ARTICLE 28	- CONTRACTING OF WORK
1	In making decisions regarding contracting of work, it is management's objective to consider carefully the interests of both customers and employees along with all other considerations essential to the management of the business.

A regular employee (not temporary, term or occasional) who is a member of a reserve component or organized militia of the state and enters upon Military Training Duty will be granted a Military Leave of Absence for the period of the necessary absence for such training. The term "Uniformed Services" as used herein shall mean Uniformed Services of the United States as specified in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994.
An employee, on a Military Leave of Absence for Active Duty for Military Service or military training duty and who has re-employment rights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 and who makes application for reinstatement within the period provided in the law will receive upon reinstatement, full service credit for the period of absence for military service or training duty.

In death cases occurring during a Military Leave of Absence, sickness death benefits, where payable, shall be based upon the term of net credited service at the time the leave was granted, plus the elapsed time of Military Leave of Absence to the date of death, and shall be computed at the time the leave began.
Sickness disability benefits, where payable, shall be granted upon the net credited service at the time the leave was granted plus the elapsed time on Military Leave of Absence to the termination of such leave, and shall be computed on the basis of Avaya pay in effect at the time of the employee’s reinstatement.
2	It is the policy of Avaya to pay a Military Differential Pay to regular employees (not temporary, term or occasional) who receive and provide the Company with a copy of military orders for military service in the U. S. Armed Forces subject to conditions imposed by federal law.

If the local emergency situation exceeds 20 scheduled workdays, pay treatment for additional time must be approved by the Avaya Pension Plan Administrator.
Note 3: Payment of Military Differential Pay, for up to the maximum durations described above, is limited to the time when an employee initially enters Active Duty for Military Service. The employee is not again eligible for the maximum payments, regardless of the number of times the employee enters Active Duty for Military Service.

SUBCONTRACTING CLARIFICATION LETTER FOR DISTRIBUTION TECHNICIAN
WORK AS PROVIDED IN THIS LETTER DATED AUGUST 20,1991
This letter confirms our understanding concerning contra: ting, reached during discussions involving the incorporation of Distribution T ichnologies into the CWA-19 Bargaining Agreement.
The parties continue to recognize the intent of the Bahr-Will ams letter dated May 27, 1989, and have agreed to set forth the following illi strative examples of business circumstances under which the letter would permit the contracting of work traditionally performed by Distribution Technician: where Distribution Technicians retain recall rights in the same GCA. It is understood that the
89
Article 32
following examples are representative of likely occurrences and that they are not intended to be all inclusive.
EXAMPLE 1
The number of employees required for the work exceeds the number of on-roll and laid off employees available to staff the work, and the Company does not have sufficient lead time to recall and hire the necessary force.
For example:
-	All current employees are assigned, and five additional employees are required for a six month project which starts in two weeks. In this instance the Company may subcontract; however,
-	If all current employees are assigned, five employees are on recall, and ten employees are required for a six month project which starts in ten weeks, the Company's intent would be to recall employees and hire additional employees.
EXAMPLE 2
Because of the length of the projected schedule of the work (either the total job or individual job segments) the Company is unable to staff the job through recall of employees.
For example:
-	The total job is of four weeks duration requiring five employees; however, because of the needs of the customer, the employees cannot work four consecutive weeks and must work intermittently. The Company may subcontract.
-	The job is of four weeks duration. Two employees will be required for the first two weeks, and three employees will be required for the remaining two weeks. The Company may subcontract; however, Paragraph 3.72 of Article 30, Installation Contract CWA-19 shall be utilized when possible.
EXAMPLE 3
A job occurs in a GCA where Distribution Technologies has no current presence.
For example:
-	A six month university job was completed last year and ten employees are on recall. A new ten week job requiring four employees occurs; in the GCA. The Company may subcontract.
-	A six month university job was completed last year and ten employees are on recall. A new three month job requiring six employees occurs in the GCA; however, no qualified Distribution Technician or manager from another GCA is available to direct the job. The Company may subcontract.
EXAMPLE 4
The projected schedule for work in accordance with customer demand cannot be met through the recall of employees.
90
Article 32
For example:
-	A job of three weeks duration requiring two emp nyees is awarded and five employees are on recall. However, the lead ’me to begin the job is only two weeks. The Company may subcontrac , however, Paragraph 3.72 of Article 30, Installation Contract CWA-19 shall be utilized when possible.
It is further understood that the following shall not be cor sidered as contracted work coincident with the incorporation of Distribution Techr ologies into the CWA-19 Agreement.
-	Traditional Distribution Technologies work pen armed by Distribution Technologies for other Business Groups such ; s, but not limited to, BCS, GBS, and Computer Systems.
-	Network Systems Installers who are detailed to perform traditional Distribution Technologies work.
In the competitive and volatile environment of this business several of the above conditions may exist simultaneously. However, it is the Company's intent to optimize the utilization of its employees to cost effectively meet customer needs, including borrowing employees normally assigned to tradii'onal installation work. In addition, the Company's intent is to provide continuoi is employment where there is a sustainable work load. Through these example s, it is the Company’s desire to convey its intention that subcontracting of this w >rk in the future would only be done when the Company has no other reasonable alternative, in accordance with the provision of the Bahr-Williams letter.

The mediator's authority shall be limited to a determination of whether or not the Company subcontracted work in violation of the DT/NS subcontracting clarification letter dated August 20,1991.
92
Article 32
If the mediator determines that the Company subcontracted work in violation of the letter, the Company will, to the extent practicable in meeting the customer's completion date on the order in question, cease any remaining subcontracting of the specific job at issue in the grievance; in additio i, the Company will compensate the grievant(s) who would have been reca lled and would have accepted recall, and who also would have been available to perform the work, for lost wages, if any, at his or her Adjusted Rate for time lost within his or her Scheduled Weekly Tour less any amount paid to or received by the employee as wages in other employment and as unemployment benefits under provisions of law during the period.
Any resolution agreed to by the parties or any resolution nade by the mediator shall not be cited by either party nor shall it constitute a precedent in any other proceeding.
The Company and the Union recognize and confirm that th s grievance procedure and the mediation procedure herein established provide the mutually agreed upon and exclusive forums for resolution of disputes under the DT/NS subcontracting clarification letter dated August 20,1991.
This agreement to mediate disputes arising under the DT/NS subcontracting clarification letter dated August 20,1991, shall expire on May 30,1998.

7 MOTOR VEHICLE USAGE PROGRAM
(a)	There will be established in the Company a '/lotor Vehicle Usage Program to provide, in those administrative work units where implemented, that employees who participate will be assigned a motor vehicle for use in their work and for traveling between their work locations and places of residence or other desi gnated places for the vehicle storage.
(b)	The Motor Vehicle Usage Program will be implemented only within administrative work units where some or all of th a employees normally use a Company-provided motor vehicle in order Io perform their work. The decision to implement and to continue the pregram within any such administrative work unit will be within management's discretion.
93
Article 32
(c)	When the Motor Vehicle Usage Program is introduced within an administrative work unit, all employees within that unit who normally use a Company-provided motor vehicle in the performance of their work assignment will be eligible to participate. Participation by any such employees will be on a voluntary basis. If an employee elects not to participate, management will determine where the motor vehicle assigned to that employee is to be stored and that location will become the employee's work reporting location.
(d)	Employees who participate in the Program will be expected to provide normally secure and legal storage for the vehicle at their places of residence. If the vehicle cannot be properly stored at an employee's place of residence, the Company may arrange for appropriate storage at its expense.
(e)	The Company will make arrangements for maintenance of the vehicle; however, it will be the responsibility of the employee to whom the vehicle is assigned to assure that the vehicle is properly maintained.
(f)	For employees who participate in the Motor Vehicle Usage Program, a work reporting area will be established on a local basis before implementation. Such work reporting area will be designed so as to serve the interests of the customer, reasonably accommodate the employee, and be satisfactory to management and the Union. The work reporting area normally will be a circular geographic area. In large congested metropolitan locations or where natural barriers render a circular work reporting area Impractical, other suitable parameters will be established.
(g)	Each participating employee will be expected to begin and end the work tour at any assigned location within the established work reporting area. Prior to implementation of the Program, the Company and Union will determine a method of compensation for employees who begin or end a work tour outside an established work reporting area.

The Company and CWA and IBEW agree to continue their efforts to improve access to quality health care for bargaining unit members and to manage the cost of Avaya's medical benefits through the maintenance of cost effective health care programs. The Joint Health Care Committee (JHCC), will be continued, and will be responsible for overseeing the implementation, expansion and on-going monitoring of the Managed Care Programs (Point of Service,, Mental and Health Chemical Dependency Networks and Prescription Drug Networks) of the Medical Plan with respect to members of the bargaining units covered by the 2006 National Memorandum.
A major focus of the JHCC will be to develop communication strategies designed to promote a greater awareness among employees of being value conscious health care consumers.
JHCC Members
The JHCC will contain four (4) appointees from the Unions (two (2) from the CWA and two (2) from the IBEW) and four (4) from the Company, including members with benefits, health, and labor expertise. The JHCC members will analyze issues which arise concerning the managed care programs of the Medical Plan and using consensus, will develop solutions to the issues.
JHCC Responsibilities
The JHCC is responsible for assuring successful implementation and continued operation of a quality health care program for current bargaining unit members.
The JHCC will be a forum for addressing and resolving issues involved in the implementation and ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the managed cared programs of the Medical Plan. To accomplish these objectives the JHCC will:
• review and comment on bid specifications for the Managed Care Programs of the Medical Plan, provide input on who should be invited to bid, meet with various vendors as they make clarifying presentations on their programs and capabilities, attend briefings on the outcome of the bid analysis, and make recommendations on the selection of the carrier to senior management. In addition, the JHCC will have access to the Master Contracts between Avaya Inc. and the carriers which administer the POS networks covering the represented employees. Such access is contingent upon each JHCC member executing a confidentiality agreement.

review and evaluate POS network performances, policies and procedures (including POS managed care network operations and related administrator performance) i i order to assess effectiveness and efficiency of the program.
•	Based on any such review and eval lation, if the JHCC determines that a represented plan nei «vork area operation is materially deficient and that such deficiencies will not likely be resolved in a reasonable period of tir le with a reasonable effort by the network administrator, tl e JHCC may then evaluate other Company-sponsored F OS managed care operations in the same geographiarea and their administrative performance, whether >r not represented employees participate in such other a rangements on the same matters as the evaluation of repre rented plan network area operations was based.
175
National Memorandum
•	Based on any such review and evaluation, the JHCC may recommend io the Company to change an existing represented POS network plan administrator in that area to an administrator that presently administers a network under any other medical plan sponsored by the Company in that area. If the Company adopts such recommendation, it shall have, if it deems necessary to effectuate such change, at least one full calendar year to implement such change.
recommend changes in administrative procedures in order to improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the Managed Care Programs.
review any evaluations and reports (e.g., NCQA/HEDIS) relating to the POS programs of the Medical Plan.

No retired ernployee shall be required to contribute towards the cost of postretirement medical and dental coverage for the duration of this 2006 National Memorandum, it is anticipated that the combined medical and dental cap will not be exceeded during the term of the 2006 National Memorandum.
Calculation of Required Retired Employee Contribution
For purposes of determining whether the average projected costs of the Plan for the six types of coverage (i.e., individual, two-person or family, pre or post age 65) will exceed the applicable Company contribution limit for the next succeeding calendar year and if so, determining the amount of the required applicable retired employee contribution, Avaya will annually:
1.	Determine the actual aggregate cost of all incurred claims (including the cost of administration) for the second preceding calendar year prior to the year for which premiums are being set for (1) retired employees with individual coverage under 65; (2) retired employees with two-person coverage under 65; (3) retired employees with family coverage under 65; (4) retired employees 65 and over with individual coverage; (5) retired employees 65 and over with two-person coverage; and (6) retired employees 65 and over with family coverage.
2.	Based upon such actual aggregate costs, determine the average cost (including dependent costs) for such year per retired employee in each group,
3.	Adjust the six average amounts determined in item 2 by an amount to be determined by the Special Research Group, as described below.
4.	Calculate the difference between the amounts determined in item 3 and the applicable Company contribution limits and subtract the average claim for each group from the applicable cap for the group,
180
I lational Memorandum
and determine whether the cap has been excee led. If no cap for any group has been exceeded, then no retiree coni ibutions are required. If one or more caps are exceeded then all caps are aggregated, on a weighted basis. If the result is a positive number, then retiree premiums are due from each group that has exo eded the caps. If the result is a negative number then retiree prernk ms are not due from any group.
Medical and Dental Inflation and Projected Costs
The determination of medical and dental inflation and projected costs used to calculate any required retiree contributions as described at ove in item 2 shall be made by a Special Research Group whose members shall include expert representatives from the Company and no more than two < Xpert representatives from each union.
Adjustment to Retired Employee Contribution
Subsequent to each year, Avaya shall compare the aggre gate costs for actual incurred claims (plus administrative expenses) for such ye: r to the aggregate of the sum of all Company and retiree contributions, for retire as under age 65 and retirees age 65 and over, respectively.
For each of such two groups of retirees, the Company sh. ill determine whether there has been a surplus or deficit and the amount of such lor each year. If there has been a surplus in the amount of prior retiree contribi tions, the amount of such surplus will be used to offset any future retiree contr :)utions. If there has been a deficit in the amount of prior retiree contributions the amount of such deficit will be applied to increase any future required retiree ontributions.
ANNUAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS
Retirees and their covered dependents shall be eligible fc r an annual physical and free screenings in accordance with age guidelines s determined by the Claims Administrator, including prostate screenings, mammograms and colorectal screenings.
VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BENEFICIARY ASSOCIATION VESA)

National Memorandum
ATTACHMENT A
THE ALLIANCE FOR EMPLOYEE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT
1 Avaya Inc. and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) mutually acknowledge their pride in the talents, abilities, creativity and commitment of Avaya's work force. The parties share a vision of the work environment in which all employees are encouraged to develop their skills, abilities and talents to the fullest extent possible and are furnished every opportunity to take the initiative to do so. Such an environment will not only offer the maximum opportunity to employees to attain their employment goals, but will also lead to increased commitment by employees to devote their maximum energies to improving Avaya’s productivity and competitiveness. It is anticipated that this level of employee commitment will contribute significantly to marketplace success for Avaya and to the increased employment security for employees associated with such success.
(a)	To help achieve this vision, a separate and distinct jointly administered entity, known as the Alliance for Employee Growth and Development (the Alliance), will continue to operate as a not-for-profit corporation. The mission of the Alliance is to make available learning experiences to employees which will enhance their represented and work group skills; provide opportunities for personal and career development; stimulate and sustain their contributions to Avaya’s success through improved communication skills, motivation, improved work habits and enhanced interpersonal skitls; familiarize them with state-of-the-art technology, based on the present or anticipated needs of the business; and increase the probability that if they face displacement or dislocation, they will find alternative employment, either in Avaya or in the outside job market.
(b)	The Alliance focuses on both Persona l/Career Development and Job Displacement Training curricula. It is envisioned that the Alliance will generally arrange and/or underwrite these curricula by contracting with accredited outside parties for delivery. In some cases, it may provide the curricula directly.
(c)	It is understood that the Alliance is not intended to replace Avaya's existing job-specific training, nor does it limit the right of the parties to provide educational and training programs on the same, similar or other subjects as they may deem appropriate.
(d)	The Grievance and Arbitration procedures of this Agreement have no application to, or jurisdiction over, any matter relating to the Alliance.
194
rational Memorandum
2	Personal/Career Development Curriculum
The types of programs which the Alliance will undei write to enhance the personal/career development of regular employees w JI include, but not be limited to:
(a)	career counseling
(b)	skills inventory and aptitude assessment
(c)	career training
(d)	personal growth training
(e)	training associated with skill development prog ams, such as QWL, which may not be directly related to the performance of an employee’s current job.
(f)	certification training
3	Job Displacement Curriculum
Avaya will seek to identify those types of represented jobs in each of Avaya’s major organizational units in which growth, a well as decline, are anticipated. From that information and other resources, the Alliance will recommend, arrange and/or underwrite training that will assist those employees who occupy jobs in which a decline is antcipated, or who may be displaced due to force surplus, to acquire new skills The training will be designed to increase the probability that these em >loyees will be in a position to compete successfully for new positions wi- iin Avaya, or to find alternative employment outside of Avaya.
(a) Where appropriate, successful completion of Personal/Career Development or Job Displacement curricula which are relevant to a job will be considered by Avaya when selecting employees for job opportunities.
4	Curricula Development, Implementation and Delivei y
In identifying areas on which Alliance activities shoul I focus, the Alliance will consult with Avaya and CWA officials, as well as with professionals in such fields as higher education, industrial psycho jgy and vocational training In addition, the Alliance will confer will , advise and offer professional and financial assistance to local training/n training committees, in such areas as:
(a)	identifying educational, training and retraining needs, as well as the resources available to meet those needs
(b)	developing programs designed to meet identified f mployee needs

Re: Academic Awards
This will confirm our agreement regarding the eligibility of a child of a former employee to continue to receive previously awarded scholarship support under the Academic Awards Program.
In those situations where the union has grieved the Company’s action in dismissing an employee for cause, and a child of that employee has been previously awarded a scholarship under the Academic Awards Program, the Company agrees to continue to provide such scholarship support for a period not to exceed six months from the date of the employee’s dismissal.
The parties agree that any grievance and/or arbitration relating to the dismissal shall be processed as expeditiously as possible under the appropriate collective bargaining agreement and shall be concluded within six (6) months from the date of the dismissal.
If the former employee is reinstated as a result of such dispute, then the dependent will continue to participate in the program. Otherwise, the dependent will be disqualified from further participation in the Academic Awards Program.

EXTENDED COMPENSATION PARTICIPANT IN ALLIANCE
May 28, 2006
Mr. R. V. Maly, Vice President, CWA
Mr. R. F. Morrison, Vice Chairman, System Council T-3, IBEW
Re: Extended Compensation Participant in Alliance
This is to confirm our mutual understanding that an eligible represented employee who has chosen to participate in the Extended Compensation Option of the Avaya Career Transition Option Program and is available for temporary assignments through the Avaya Job Match Center, and who is also a participant in an Alliance training program, may reject a Job Match Center temporary assignment if that assignment conflicts with a verified Alliance training program in which the employee is participating at the time.
It is also the Company’s intent to develop administrative practices for the Avaya Job Match Center that foster a reasonable approach to unanticipated personal situations beyond the control of the employee which result in the declination of a Job Match Center temporary assignment.

National Memorandum
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING
NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
This agreement between CWA, IBEW and Avaya Inc. addresses Union organizing and consent elections in those job titles and occupations in Avaya organizations that are not covered by the 1986 Union-Management Relations Agreement, separately attached hereto.
The Unions and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to operate in the spirit of partnership and common vision. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development.
The parties also recognize the Unions’ goal of growing membership. In order to maintain this perspective and to also avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to all wholly owned Avaya Business Operating Groups and Divisions throughout the country and shall be the exclusive means by which the Unions, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize non-management employees in the covered Avaya Business Operating Groups or Divisions.
1	Employee Choice
Both the Unions and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a Union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties’ mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage, and nurture an environment during a Union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct, and voting will be performed by local management and local Union officials, i.e., those directly impacted by these discussions. The local Union and management officials may request a meeting with the appropriate Union and Company headquarters representatives at the beginning of this process.
2	Neutrality
The Company and the Unions agree that an organizing drive should be and will be met by Company conduct that neither helps nor hinders organizing efforts. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. The environment is intended to foster employee choice and information communicated by either party should be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
232
'Jational Memorandum
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be antimanagement.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employee; should vote against Union representation.
(c)	The Union(s) will be afforded reasonable oppo tunities for access to communicate with employees.
(d)	Management may respond to individual employe a questions, and may correct inaccurate or misunderstood information b employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and wi not be characterized as a “third party" or "outsider".
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees >y either party relative to the organizing campaign will be simultaneously shared with the other. The parties' communications with employees will ie in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire or seek the assistance of consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives wll t $ personally attacked, by name or by descriptive reference, in ce npaign literature or discussions.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacke I as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct "captive" audience neetings.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be hr idled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3	Election Procedures
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show that a majority of employee . in a unit appropriate for collective bargaining have signed show of int >rest cards indicating their desire for a representation election. The a rds must be dated within three months of the date they are present »d to the Third Party Neutral (TPN). Cards signed by persons who art no longer employed by Avaya at the time of submission to the TPN will iot be valid.
(b)	If an election is conducted and the Union is no> successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months. During this time, no Union organizing campaign for that unit will be perr fitted.
(c)	A majority of those who vote, validated by the TF N, will determine the outcome.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning c lallenged ballots by following the NLRB's rules and decisions.
233
National Memorandum
4	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will “start the clock”. The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90 day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process, exceed 120 days. If the employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local union from having contact with the workers in the group outside of the workplace. If the employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and any resulting collective bargaining agreement will apply only to the agreed upon unit.
5	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a labor union. Management’s role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including any obligations and responsibilities of the parties
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies or misstatements or any employee misunderstandings of information disseminated during the campaign process.
6	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union, or any other persons or entities during any part of this process. One way to ensure this objective is to have an NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process called “Consent Election". This process will work as follows:

National Memorandum
8	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, local Avaya management and appropriate Union representatives. It is the intent and desire of Avaya and the Union(s) that such matters be dealt with and are best dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that, if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter still remains unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. The TPN must be an active or retired attorney who has experience in, and is familiar with, NLRB procedures and precedents regarding unit determination issues. Either Avaya or the Union(s) can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three business days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide a complete statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between themselves.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.), the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived access problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five (5) days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to the TPN and an expeditious hearing shall be conducted. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
236
National Memorandum
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute tl at is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full oppo tunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. Thf re shall be no exparte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of ill parties. Avaya and the Unions believe that these matters are best he ndled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN shoul: be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Avaya and the Union(s) agree that the parties m; y distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit i >ut not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth hereir shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this disp ite resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (E».g NLRB, federal court, etc ) to address issues subject to resolution pursu; nt to this process.
(g)	All expenses resulting from the use of the TPM pt jcess shall be shared equally by Avaya and the Union
9	Acquisitions And Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications equipment industry. Avaya may act Litre another entity, it has and may in the future form joint ventures or st: ategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a finan Jal investor in other entities. The employees in these entities may be unrep esented, represented in whole or in part by the CWA or IBEW, or representer in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to s tructure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Cor ipany cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement. Nevertheles ;, Avaya will, after an initial transition period of one year following the closing >n an acquisition, and subject to any contrary legal or contractual requirement . apply this Neutrality and Consent Election agreement to any wholly owned s ibsidiary.
10	Annual Review
On an annual basis, the Avaya Vice President of .abor Relations, the President of the CWA and the President of the IBEW may review whether there has been substantial compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and, if the parties find repeated instances of violations >r repeated instances of interference during the period up to the review, may implement a process for recognition based on "card check" to replace electi ms in all cases or, if not, this Agreement shall continue in effect for the r< maining term of the Agreement

Re: Standing Joint Subcommittee on Testing
This will confirm our understanding reached during 2006 Bargaining that a CWA-IBEW-Avaya standing joint subcommittee on testing will be formed. The subcommittee, to be appointed by the bargaining chairs, will consist of two (2) representatives from the Unions, one (1) from IBEW and one (1) from CWA, and two (2) representatives from the Company,
Measurement and Selection Systems (M&SS), part of Avaya’s Labor Relations organization, is the organization with sole responsibility for the development or selection, validation, and authorization of all tests and policy and procedures used in the selection of candidates for Avaya represented positions. M&SS is responsible to ensure that such tests meet Federal and professional standards for relevance and non-discrimination.
If the committee identifies a test currently in use which has not been authorized by M&SS, the test will be suspended pending the outcome of a review and report to the committee by M&SS.
At least thirty days prior to implementation, M&SS will notify the members of the committee of the intent to implement a new test or to revise a test or critical test score, M&SS will communicate to members of the committee the following pertinent information concerning the test:
the purpose
the objective
the need for the test or change
the title(s) for which it will be a requirement
the business groups which will use it
After receiving the information described above, if the committee so requests, a meeting will be held to explore appropriate ways for the Company and the Unions to make available opportunities to assist employees in development of the new skills or job knowledge. The committee will also be expected to identify and recommend ways to maximize the many advantages and resources offered through the Alliance and ERCs in meeting the goals described above.
In addition, the committee may explore other issues with M&SS, including such matters as an apparent low percentage of employees qualifying on a specific test. Where the Committee agrees, a Third Party Neutral (TPN) may be selected to review any disputed new or revised test for relevancy and validity, applying

CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP
Over the years, the Company and the Union have developed and maintained a mutually constructive, responsible relationship character! 'ed by trust, respect, and cooperation. Recognizing that the best interests if the Company, the Unions, employees, managers, and shareowners depend on vigorous and total commitment to product and service quality and customs satisfaction, it is the mutual goal of the parties to ensure that their relationship c mtinues to improve in a positive, constructive manner consistent with the pravi- ions of the collective bargaining agreement, and that such a relationship promote s superior quality and customer satisfaction.
The parties firmly believe that through a positive, consl.ru live relationship they can best fulfill their respective responsibilities. These n sponsibilities include meeting the service and financial goals of all parties; ir iproving employment security and corporate and business unit effectiveness md competitiveness; nurturing member and customer satisfaction; achievin' i continuous quality improvement; removing barriers to successful opert lions; and building involvement, commitment and motivation among both managers and employees.
To fulfill these responsibilities the Company and the Unio i are committed to a relationship where information is openly exchanged; [. roblems are solved mutually and cooperatively; critical differences are accepter and accommodated; agreements are developed in good faith, commitments are honored; and day-to-day contacts at every level are stable and reliable.
During recent years profound changes have had major impt ?,ts on the operations and resources of both the Company and the Union. Such c langes will continue, and it is understood that jointly anticipating and respondir g constructively and cooperatively to change is the key to both Union and C ompany vitality and prosperity.
The parties recognize that integrity, trust, respect, and cooperation in their relationship depend on action at all levels, particularly at loc;11 levels. Local union officers and managers are encouraged to identify and deve op new approaches to issues which are appropriate for cooperative efforts. It is expected that progress in improving constructive relationships and aking initiative on cooperative efforts will be a primary mutual objective.

The parties may agree to schedule additional meetings with individuals in business groups or organizations to discuss issues raised in the meeting.

During 2003 negotiations, the Company and the Unions expressed mutual concerns over the employment security of on-roll Avaya employees represented by the Unions and their desire to retain work traditionally performed by those employees. The parties also understood the Company’s need to maintain flexibility in making business decisions involving subcontracting of work traditionally performed by represented employees and the potential that such decisions may have a detrimental effect on the employment security of on-roll Avaya employees.
In recognition of these mutual concerns, the parties agree that a process should be developed to address the issues. Thus, it is agreed that the Unions will be provided, in advance, pertinent information such as but not limited to, the economics, skills necessary to perform the work, and the impact such subcontracting may have on the employment security of on-roll Avaya employees.

Dear Mr. Bahr:
I am writing to respond to the expressions of concern ra sed at the Operations bargaining table regarding the Company’s contracting oi; of work, which have focused on situations in which a layoff is pending or 1 as occurred (and ex-bargaining unit members retain recall rights) within the s ime force adjustment area where the work is to be contacted, and in job titles w lose occupants would traditionally have performed such work.
I do not believe that CWA and AT&T have diverse views or this subject.
As to such work normally performed by our employe es, we have always preferred not to contract such work out if it would otherwise be performed by bargaining unit employees in job titles in a geographies commuting area (1) where layoffs of such employees are pending; or (2) whet a a layoff has already occurred and such laid off bargaining unit members retail recall rights and are available to perform such work.
In the future, the Company will not contract out such worl< under the conditions outlined above, except when it has no other reasonable al ernative. Under such circumstances, the Company will discuss its decision with t e Union.
Very truly yours.

Gentlemen:
During recent negotiations we discussed the Union's demand that management in the States of California and Nevada continue the practice of releasing certain day tour clerical employees employed in the States from the last half hour of their scheduled eight-hour day tour.
It is our intent, for the duration of the current collective bargaining agreement, to allow managers in California and Nevada to so excuse such employees, when in the judgment of the Company work assignments have been completed. However, day tour clerical employees remain obligated to work eight hours and any such excused half-hour is a gratuitous act on the part of the Company and not a guaranteed right. Where management requires an employee to work any portion of the last half-hour of a scheduled eight-hour tour, no additional compensation will be paid.

(7) VACATION SCHEDULING
During the 1998 negotiations between Lucent Technologies and Communications Workers of America, the Union expressed a concern relative to service and coverage requirements in connection with vacation schedules and personal holiday schedules.
The Company recognizes the importance of vacations to our employees and believes that vacation schedules should be prepared in such a manner as to permit a maximum number of vacations during the most desirable vacation periods to the extent that service and coverage requirements permit.
It is also our belief that special consideration should be given to the traditionally observed holidays that were replaced with personal holidays in the 1989 Agreement. The new holiday language, in and of itself, should not change the coverage requirements for those days that were designated as holidays in past contracts. Every effort should be made by managers to make available as many of these days as possible for selection as personal holidays.

Mr. Frank E. Mailloux
Area Director, Washington-ldaho-Oregon-Alaska Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO
845 Industry Drive, Building 21
Tukwila. WA 98188
Dear Mr. Mailloux:
This will confirm our understanding of voluntary overtime as an alternate method of assigning overtime work This agreement applies to P icific Northwest Bell and not to other companies or entities where bargaining jnit employees may transfer.
The basis for this agreement is our mutual desire to maintair a work environment where each employee may exercise a commitment to the n >eds of our business operations without undue impact on personal desires "his premise is the foundation of our willingness to set forth an alternative t< the past practices involving overtime work.
As an alternative to existing contract provisions governing the distribution and payment of extra work opportunities, individual force gr tups may elect an alternate overtime process. Supervision and the Union nest concur in the election and composition of the force group. The force gr >up would generally consist of employees having a common organization and ty[ e of work within the same work location. Specific practices for this voluntary* pi >cess will be jointly determined by the Union and Management. It is understood that the alternative process will include the following considerations:
The purpose is to assign extra work without causing employe > hardship.
Whenever there appears to be insufficient volunteers, the L nion and Company representatives will jointly determine what action will be take i to ensure that the priorities of the business are met.
Contract Section 25.16 concerning the distribution of premiur work opportunities will not apply to the force group. However, there remains the need to maintain a reasonable distribution of the overtime payments among r nployees who are |	equally available for overtime opportunities.
311
Other Agreements
The premium rate for all overtime will be time and one-half and Contract Section 25.5 will not apply except that hours worked on a holiday will be paid as specified in Section 22.3(a).
The effective date will be as soon as the payroll process can accommodate this alternative.
This alternative overtime process may be cancelled for a force group by either the Union or Company with 24 hours notice. If cancelled, the alternative method cannot be re-established before 1 year has elapsed. However, management may interrupt these procedures for exceptional service demands such as storms and unusual service requirements and Contract Section 25.5 will apply.
If you concur with this understanding, will you please sign the original of this letter and return it to me.
Sincerely,
