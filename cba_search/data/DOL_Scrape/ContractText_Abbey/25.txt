3
IV
Section 4.	Scheduling of Overtime, Including Holidays
a.	A steward will be offered work during periods of overtime, under one of the following provisions:
(1)	Provided that not less than fifteen (15) employees work in the steward's district and that work in his classification is scheduled within his district or
(2)	Under the provisions as set forth in Article VI, Section 7.a(1).

b.	A shop committeeman will be offered work during periods of overtime provided that not less than twenty (20) employees work in his zone and that work in his classification is scheduled within his zone.
c.	The overtime worked by stewards and shop committeemen will not be posted.

If no Union representatives are working in the zone, the nearest available steward will be called.
Section 5.	List of Union Representatives and Notice of Change
The Union will furnish the Company with a list of its officers, Plant Grievance Committee members, and stewards and will notify the Company in writing of any changes therein. Such list and notice of changes will be given in writing to the Director of Labor Relations at least one (1) working day before an officer, shop committeeman, or steward performs any act under the terms of this Agreement. Exceptions to this period of notice may be made by mutual agreement. No officer, steward, or shop committeeman will be recognized by the Company until written notification of his appointment has been received by the Company from the President of the Union or his designee.

appealing a grievance to the second step in the manner provided under Article V, Section 3, or to perform the following functions:
(1)	Investigate and, if necessary, present to a supervisor in his district a grievance of violation of an employee's recall rights, or a written grievance signed by an aggrieved employee that the steward has received outside of working hours.
(2)	Meet with an aggrieved employee's supervisor who is not located in the district where the grievance originated.

c.	A steward is to handle only grievances arising in his district. However, he will be given permission to make investigation outside of his district when it is necessary to obtain pertinent facts in a case being investigated. This does not give roving privileges to a steward.
d.	In the absence of a shop committeeman, a steward from the zone may be appointed to act in his place. The Union must notify the Company twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the appointment. The twenty-four (24) hour requirement is waived when the absence of the shop committeeman is due to illness.

a.	After notifying the supervisor in charge of his unit of his purpose and destination, a shop committeeman will be given a shop grievance pass and allowed to leave his job or unit to handle grievances as called out in the grievance procedure.

ARTICLE V GRIEVANCE, ARBITRATION AND DISCHARGE PROCEDURES
Section 1.	Union Grievance
a.	A Union grievance is a difference between the Company and the Union concerning: (1) working conditions, and (2) the interpretation or application of any provision of this Agreement that cannot be settled at the first and second steps of the grievance procedure set forth below.
b.	A Union grievance may be introduced by the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee to the Director of Labor Relations and the grievance will be discussed at the next regular third-step meeting. The Company's disposition will be given as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten (10) working days (unless extended by mutual consent) following the meeting in which the grievance was discussed. Special meetings between representatives of the Company and the Plant Grievance Committee will be by mutual consent.
Section 2.	Employee Grievance
a.	An employee grievance is a difference between the Company and any employee concerning the interpretation or application of any provision of the Agreement.
b.	When any such grievance arises, an earnest effort must be made to settle it according to the following sequence and procedure.
Section 3.	First Step
a.	Any employee having such a grievance will present it orally to his supervisor either personally or through his steward, where an earnest attempt will be made to resolve the grievance. Should the grievance not be settled orally, the Union may, within two (2) workdays, reduce the grievance to writing on the forms provided by the Company and signed by the employee, setting forth, on the grievance form, all of the available facts of the alleged violation. The grievance form must indicate:
(1)	A statement of the grievance and the facts upon which it is based.
(2)	The section or sections of the Agreement claimed to have been violated and
(3)	The remedy or correction requested. The disposition at the first and second steps of this procedure, together with the dates thereof, must be noted thereon and signed by the respective representatives of the Company and the Union.
b.	The Union will have the right to investigate and present a grievance of violation of an employee's recall rights by following the procedure as outlined in Article V, Section 3.a.
c.	When the grievance is presented in writing, the answer of the supervisor will be given in writing on the form provided, as soon as possible, but not later than two (2)
8
V
regularly scheduled working days after its presentation. After a grievance has been reduced to writing and presented to the supervisor, no representative of the Company will discuss that particular grievance with the grievant without the presence of a Union representative until it is settled in the grievance procedure.
d.	If an appeal for the disposition of a grievance at the first step of the grievance procedure is not taken within five (5) working days from the date of such decision, the grievance will be considered withdrawn without prejudice to either Party.
e.	If the Union accepts a grievance disposition given at the first step of the grievance procedure, it will not be considered precedent setting for or by either Party to this Agreement.
Section 4.	Second Step
a.	If the grievance is not settled by the unit supervisor and the steward, then the shop committeeman and the steward within whose area the grievance arose will take up the grievance with the manager or his designee at a regularly scheduled weekly meeting. Upon request of the shop committeeman and/or the manager, a Labor Relations representative will attend such meeting. If the grievance is appealed to this step of the grievance procedure, and the shop committeeman assigned to the area of the plant in which the grievance arose is unable to handle it because he is absent from the plant, then upon request by the steward to the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative, the grievance may be investigated and presented by the acting shop committeeman for that zone. For the purpose of adjusting grievances at this stage of the procedure, a shop committeeman or the acting shop committeeman will represent only employees assigned to the zone in which he is employed, except as provided in Article V, Section 3.b.
b.	The meeting of the manager (or designated representative) and/or a Labor Relations representative with the shop committeeman and the steward in his zone will be held once a week. If the grievances presented at this meeting cannot be disposed of in the time set for the meeting, the meeting may be continued the following day. The manager or designee, and/or a Labor Relations representative will render a decision on a grievance so presented no later than three (3) working days after such meeting.
c.	If no appeal from the disposition of a grievance given at the second step of the grievance procedure is taken within three (3) working days from the date of the decision, then the decision will be final, conclusive and binding upon all employees, the Company and the Union. Any disposition of a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure accepted by the Union will also be final, conclusive and binding upon all employees, the Company and the Union.
9
V
Section 5.	Third Step
a.	If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled by the manager (or designated representative) and/or a Labor Relations representative, an appeal may be taken by the Plant Grievance Committee to the Grievance Review Committee. The Grievance Review Committee will render a decision on a grievance so presented as soon as possible, but no later than five (5) working days after the regular third-step meeting at which the grievance was discussed.
b.	If no appeal from the disposition of a grievance given at the third step of the grievance procedure is taken within five (5) working days from the date of the decision, then the decision will be final, conclusive and binding upon all employees, the Company and the Union. Any disposition of a grievance at the third step of the grievance procedure accepted by the Union will also be final, conclusive and binding upon all employees, the Company and the Union.
c.	If the grievances presented at the regular third-step meetings provided for in this article cannot be disposed of within the time allowed, the meeting may be continued at a time mutually agreed to by the Company and the Union, but no later than five (5) working days. If the Union does not receive a disposition to a grievance within these time limits, the grievance may be appealed to the next step.
Section 6.	General Provisions of the Grievance Procedure
a.	In cases of disciplinary suspensions or discharge of employees for infraction of shop rules or other misconduct, the Union reserves the right to seek modification or elimination of such penalties regarding seniority and compensation, in whole or in part, on the ground that the employee was unjustly disciplined. Such protests will be handled according to the grievance procedure, including the right to appeal to arbitration.
b.	If the Union withdraws a grievance at the first, second or third step of the grievance procedure, it will be considered as having been withdrawn without prejudice to either Party. A grievance withdrawn subsequent to the third step must be withdrawn by mutual agreement and will be considered as having been withdrawn without prejudice to either Party.
c.	Any employee grievance not presented for disposition through the grievance procedure described herein within five (5) working days of the occurrence of the condition giving rise to the grievance, or within five (5) working days of the date it is reasonable to assume that the employee became aware of the condition giving rise to the grievance, will not thereafter be considered a grievance under this Agreement. Any Union grievance not presented within five (5) working days from the date on which it is reasonable to assume that the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee became aware of the condition giving rise to the grievance will be deemed untimely.
d.	No disposition or award upon any grievance under this Agreement will be made retroactive for any period prior to the date the grievance was first filed in writing, except:
io
V
(1)	There may be seven (7) working days of retroactivity on overtime grievances.
(2)	There may be sixty (60) working days retroactivity on classification grievances.
(3)	There may be up to thirty (30) working days retroactivity on layoff and recall grievances. However, in no event will the Company's liability exceed thirty (30) days.
e.	If the Union does not receive a disposition to a grievance within the time limits set forth herein, the grievance may be appealed to the next step.
f.	The time during which a grievance must be dispositioned or appealed may be extended by mutual agreement.
Section 7.	Prearbitration Review Step
a.	If a grievance within the scope of Article V, Section 8.a. is not settled satisfactorily at the third step of the grievance procedure and the Plant Grievance Committee believes it has grounds for appeal, the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee or designated representative will give the Director of Labor Relations or his designee a written "notice of appeal" to arbitration. Such notice of appeal must be approved by the international representative or designated representative.
b.	Within fifteen (15) days after a grievance has been appealed to arbitration, there will be a meeting of the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative, the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, the local Union President, and a representative of the international Union to attempt to settle the grievance, it being understood that the Parties are empowered to settle such grievance. In the event the Parties are unable to resolve a grievance, it will be submitted to arbitration as provided under this article.
c.	A representative of the international Union will, upon advance request, be permitted to enter the plant accompanied by the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee and/or the local Union President to investigate a grievance prior to the prearbitration review step. Such visitation will be permitted only under the rules governing plant visitors that have been issued by the Company or any appropriate government agency.
Section 8.	Arbitration
a.	Only grievances involving alleged violations with respect to the interpretation or application of the terms of this Agreement may be appealed to an impartial arbitrator for settlement. When such a grievance is appealed to arbitration by the Union and is not settled under Article V, Section 7.b., the Company and the Union will hold a meeting to select an arbitrator. This meeting will be held within ten (10) working days of the meeting held under Article V, Section 7.b. When an arbitrator is agreed upon, both Parties may forward their statements of issues to him at least three (3) days prior to the date of the hearing.
b.	The arbitrator is prohibited from changing, adding to or subtracting from the wording or terms of this Agreement or any supplementary written, approved agreements
11
V
entered into mutually by the Parties. Any case appealed to the arbitrator on which he has no power to rule will be referred back to the Parties without decision.
c.	In cases of disciplinary action, including discharge, the arbitrator has the right to rescind or modify the penalty and to compensate the employee for lost wages in whole or in part less those earnings, including unemployment compensation, received by the disciplined employee while off the active payroll.

d.	After the arbitrator has been notified of his selection, he will establish a hearing date and start said hearing as soon as possible.
e.	The arbitrator will make such investigation as he deems proper and may examine the witnesses of each Party. Each Party has the right to cross-examine witnesses.

After receipt of said list, the Union and the Company will each have the right to strike two (2) names from it in the following manner:
The representatives of the Company and of the Union will determine by lot the order of elimination and, thereafter, each will in that order alternately eliminate one (1) name until only one (1) remains. The fifth or remaining person will thereupon be accepted by both the Union and the Company as the arbitrator.

V
p.	Medical arbitrators will be selected in the following manner:
In the event a dispute is not resolved per the provisions of Article XIX, section 5, the Company and the Union agree to ask the Dallas County Medical Society to supply a list of five (5) doctors.

The fees and expenses of the medical arbitrator will be divided equally between the Union and the Company.
Section 9.	Written Warning Notice
a. A written warning notice will remain in effect until the employee has served one (1) year of active employment from its date of issue. An employee who is issued a written warning notice will receive a copy of the notice.

Section 5.	Work on a Holiday
All work performed by employees during the period for which they have been scheduled and which begins on the calendar day being observed by the Company as a holiday will be compensated at three (3) times the regular straight-time hourly base rate including shift differential, but excluding all premiums and bonuses. This includes all hours worked by employees subsequent to the starting time of their regularly scheduled shift on a holiday where such hours are a continuation of a period for which they have been scheduled and which begins on the preceding day.
Section 6.	No Pyramiding or Duplicating

Section 7.	Distribution of Overtime
a.
(1)	The Company, consistent with its several normal and standard overtime practices relating to areas within the collective bargaining unit, will make an equal distribution of overtime among the available qualified employees in any unit who are regularly employed on such work. Such distribution will be made on the respective shifts on which the overtime work occurs. An
17
VI
employee will be offered, on a voluntary basis, overtime as necessary to maintain production schedules. If the required personnel are not available following the initial request for volunteers, any qualified employee in the program or job family at the facility where the work is performed, whichever is applicable, may be asked to work.
(a)	No employee may be asked to work in Job Family 7491 (Shipping) unless all employees in job family 7491 have been asked to work the overtime in question, and the work in question will take longer than one (1) hour in duration.
(b)	If, in the opinion of the Chairman of Plant Grievance Committee, an employee is disproportionately asked to work overtime in a unit outside of his home unit, the parties will meet in an attempt to resolve the issue.
(2)	Whenever it is necessary for employees to work weekend overtime, the Company will endeavor to offer the overtime per Article VI, section 7, a. (1) or (2) by the close of their regular shift hours on Thursday before the upcoming weekend. An employee absent on Thursday will be considered unavailable and charged for the weekend overtime.
(3)	Should it be determined through the grievance procedure that an employee is unequal in overtime as required in Article VI, Section 7.a(1), such employee will be offered the next overtime assignment to which he is entitled under this section (new job, not continuing assignment) until the employee has worked overtime hours equal to the hours that he was out of line at the time the grievance was filed. If, from the date of the grievance, there has been overtime worked to which the grievant should have been offered and he was not asked to work, starting with the sixth workday following the date of the grievance, a displacement will have occurred and the employee will be paid for the hours that he should have been offered for the purpose of equalization.
(4)	A copy of the distribution of overtime work will be posted by each supervisor convenient to where the employees work (not in the supervisor's desk) on the workday after the overtime has been worked.
b.	At the start of a new calendar year, the employee or employees who have the lowest amount of overtime will be charged with zero (0) hours on the overtime distribution sheet. Other employees will then be charged with the difference between their hours and the lowest amount of overtime.
c.	When an employee enters a new unit or changes classification within a unit, he will be charged with the average overtime of the unit employees in the same classification.
d.	An employee scheduled for vacation will not be required to work overtime on Saturday or Sunday immediately prior to the vacation. An employee low on overtime will be offered the opportunity to work overtime preceding his vacation. However, should the employee decline to work the overtime hours, the employee will not be charged with the overtime hours, nor will the overtime hours be recorded as an absence. This will also apply in the case of a holiday(s) prior to the scheduled vacation. It is further agreed that this will be applicable to a one (1), two (2), three
18
VI
(3), and four (4) day vacation, provided such vacation begins on a Monday and is scheduled two (2) weeks in advance.
e.	Overtime will be recorded as overtime worked, even though not worked, under the following conditions:
(1)	Employee is ill or in Section 900 and would have been offered overtime.
(2)	Employee is on vacation and all employees in his classification within the unit would have been offered overtime and the employee would have been offered overtime had he not been on vacation.
(3)	Employee is due to work overtime but is absent and not available to accept overtime.
(4)	Employee does not work overtime and has been required to work overtime.
(5)	Employee agrees to work overtime and fails to work as scheduled. Any employee who accepts overtime and fails to work for such overtime will be charged double the number of hours he would have been charged.
(6)	Employee is offered overtime and refuses.
(7)	Employee is on bereavement and all employees in his classification within the unit would have been offered overtime and the employee would have been offered overtime had he not been on bereavement.
(8)	Employee is on jury duty and all employees in his classification within the unit would have been offered overtime and the employee would have been offered overtime had he not been on jury duty.
(9)	Employee has been subpoenaed adversely to testify in a case other than one involving himself, the Company or the Union, and all employees in his classification within the unit would have been scheduled to work overtime and the employee would have been scheduled to work overtime had he not been subpoenaed.
(10)	Employee is compensated in first or second step of grievance procedure for a violation of Article VI, Section 7, a.(2).
(11)	Employee is on an offsite assignment and would have been offered overtime.
f.	The following rules will apply to overtime distribution:
(1)	A probationary employee will not be offered overtime unless everyone in the same classification within the unit is offered overtime first.
(2)	An employee on loan into a unit that is in the job family of the work being performed, will not work overtime in that unit unless all the employees within the unit have been asked to work overtime.
(3)	An employee, on loan into a unit, that is not in the job family of the work being performed, will not work overtime in that unit unless all the employees within the job family, within the facility, have been asked to work overtime.
(4)	Any overtime worked by an employee on loan is to be recorded on overtime records in his home unit.
(5)	When an employee on loan returns to his home unit and is ahead on overtime because of overtime worked while on loan, he will not work overtime in his home unit until overtime has been distributed in accordance with Article VI, Section 7.a(1).
19
VI
(6)	Prior to overtime being offered to employees outside the required job family on that shift, employees on the follow on shift, pre or post, will be offered the opportunity to work the overtime in question.
(7)	If employees are equal in overtime hours, the most senior employee will be offered the overtime.
g.	An employee will not be offered overtime if he cannot perform the overtime work without a break-in or familiarization period. Employees replacing other employees for overtime work must be able to perform such work immediately.
h.	No employee will be disciplined for failure to work overtime, including holidays, when other employees in his classification and unit, within the same facility, who normally perform such work have not been required to work the overtime and are willing to work the overtime in his stead.
i.	No employee will be transferred for the purpose of equalizing overtime.
j.	Overtime records will show the overtime hours worked converted to the number of
straight-time hours for the current month and year to date.
k.	An employee working in excess of three (3) hours into another shift on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays will, beginning after three (3) hours, constitute a displacement provided there is a pre or post shift and there are employees on the succeeding shift in the classification of the work performed who normally perform the work in question. If such displacement occurs, the displaced employee will be paid for the total time worked into the pre or post shift.
I.	Requests for weekend overtime, overtime worked on Saturday and Sunday, and sixth and seventh days in the case of employees assigned to seven (7) day operations, will be on a voluntary basis provided the required personnel necessary to maintain production schedules can be secured. If the required number of employees do not volunteer for the overtime in question, the necessary employees will be required to work, but in no event will employees be required to work more than three (3) weekend assignments in a month. Management must give employees five (5) working days notice of scheduled overtime.
m.	During periods of overtime, the Company is not required to accommodate employees returning to work with medical restrictions if they cannot effectively perform the overtime work in question. Employees in this category will be considered unavailable and charged the applicable hours.
Section 8.	Travel Time on Company Business
The following rules shall govern pay for travel time while on Company business.
a.	An employee traveling on company business on a regular business (non premium) day will receive a minimum of 8 hours straight time pay.
b.	In the event that travel time or a combination of travel time plus time worked exceeds 8 hours, the employee will receive premium pay at the rate of time and one-half for time greater than 8 hours.
20
VI
c.	An employee traveling on a premium day will be paid for travel time in accordance with Article VI, Sections 2 or 3 as applicable, but in no case will the employee be paid for less than 4 hours on a premium day.
d.	For the purposes of this article, travel time will begin 3 hours prior to scheduled departure and conclude 30 minutes after landing to secure luggage and transportation.
21
VII
ARTICLE VII SENIORITY
Section 1.	Layoff
a.	In case of an indefinite layoff for lack of work, an employee will be laid off and recalled by non-interchangeable job families in accordance with his seniority as provided herein.
b.	The non-interchangeable job families as listed in the Job Family Appendices have been mutually agreed upon and incorporated and made a part of this Agreement as attached. New or revised classifications and/or job families will be effected in accordance with Article IX.
c.	In case of an indefinite layoff resulting in a net reduction of headcount within a job family (out of plant layoff), the layoff will be processed in seniority order. A senior affected employee may bump a less senior employee in another job family as follows:
(1)	If qualified under Article VII, Section 1.c(1)(a), an employee may bump to a higher labor grade (classification) than he can get by exercising his bump rights in his own job family; if faced with an out-of-plant layoff, he may bump into any classification of equal or lower grade.
(a)	If an employee has been in a classification listed in the Job Family Appendices and was so classified for a period not less than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days subsequent to his seniority date, he may bump to the highest classification held. If an employee's work record reflects that he held a classification subsequent to his seniority date that is not listed in the Job Family Appendices, it will be considered as the classification listed in the Job Family Appendices to which employees performing the same work were transferred.
(b)	An employee may not bump into a classification that he left either voluntarily because of his inability to perform the work or involuntarily where such inability was otherwise established or acknowledged.
(c)	If an employee qualifies to bump under the provisions of this section but does not have enough seniority to do so, he will be given recall rights to the job family from which he was laid off as well as to the job families into which he could have bumped had he held sufficient seniority. Such recall rights will be based upon the classifications he would have received under the provisions of this section.
(d)	The Company will have up to five (5) working days following the effective date of the layoff in which to implement the bumping between job families.
(e)	Any inequities brought about as a result of such bumping will be corrected within forty-eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays, after they are brought to the Company's attention. Any
22
VII
liability on the part of the Company will commence at the end of the forty-eight (48) hour period.
(f)	An employee who is placed in an out-of-plant layoff status as a result of being bumped by an employee under Article VII, Section 1.c(1)(a), will be laid off immediately and the Company will not be required, as set forth under Article VII, Section l.d, to give notice to the Union prior to such layoff.
(g)	No more than fifteen percent (15%) of any one job family may be affected by the bumping provided in Article VII, Section 1.c(1)(a) in any one (1) month.
(2)	A senior employee bumping under the provisions here defined may be required to replace the employee he bumps on the shift on which the replaced employee was working.
(3)	A senior employee will automatically be given the bump in his own job family. Those who do not have rights under Article VII, Section 1.c(1) will be laid off. A senior employee who is absent due to a bona fide illness, in Section 900, on vacation, on an approved leave of absence, or other bona fide reasons while the layoff is being processed, and who, if present would have an option to bump an employee under Article VII, Section 1.c(1), will be furnished by certified mail with a list of the titles of those classifications for which he qualifies. Upon receipt by the Company of the classification designated by the employee (not later than ten (10) days following receipt by the employee of the aforementioned list), the Company will process the paperwork necessary to effect the change or to extend layoff rights as provided under Article VII, Section 1 ,c(1).
d.	In case of an indefinite layoff not resulting in a net reduction of headcount within a job family (in plant layoff), a senior employee in the affected classification in which there is lack of work will be permitted, in seniority order, to bump an employee within his own job family who has seniority in the same or lower labor grade, or to exercise his bump rights to another job family per Section 1.c.(1). An employee who bumps into a lower labor grade within his job family per the provisions outlined above will have his pay adjusted in accordance with Article VII, Section 3.b.
e.	When there are layoffs for an indefinite period or for more than fifteen (15) workdays, notice in writing indicating the classification and number of employees to be surplused in each classification will be given to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee five (5) work days, if possible, and in no event later than three (3) days before such layoff. As soon as possible, but in no event later than the effective date of the layoff, a list will be made available indicating the names of the employees to be laid off and their positions on the seniority list. After the completion of the layoff, a list will be given to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee indicating the status of the employees affected by the layoff. When there are layoffs caused by sudden cancellation of major contracts, major subcontracts or acts of God that cause interruptions of production or plant shutdowns, the Company may use the procedure provided by Article VII, Section 1.f. Within the ten (10) day period provided by Article VII, Section 1 .f, the Company will process the indefinite layoff, providing such layoff is
23
VII
necessary, and give the requisite indefinite-layoff notice to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. An employee who is at work and is processed through the termination procedure for indefinite layoff will be paid through the end of the normal shift unless the employee requests and is granted permission to process earlier. An employee who is on short-term military leave, on vacation, temporary layoff or on bereavement, who comes into the plant and processes through the termination procedure for indefinite layoff will receive four (4) hours' straight-time pay. When employees are recalled to work, a similar list will be available to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee simultaneously with the notice to return to work.
f.	Temporary layoffs due to breakdowns, shortages of materials, manufacturing irregularities or causes of a like nature not to exceed fifteen (15) workdays within a rolling twelve (12) month period may be made by the Company irrespective of any provisions of this Agreement. Temporary layoffs will be processed through Wage Administration by seniority and classification of those employees within the respective unit affected, provided those retained can perform the work without a break-in or familiarization period. However, a more senior employee within the respective unit affected may volunteer prior to processing less senior employees for layoff. This restriction on fifteen (15) days will not apply in case of any stoppage of work, strike or slowdown, or any other case or condition beyond the control of the Company. The Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee will be provided a copy of the layoff notice in advance of the temporary layoff. Temporary layoffs will be recorded on the employee's unit attendance card as a temporary layoff.
g.	The Company and the Union agree that the employment of certain employees as defined herein will not be governed by seniority rules. Employees retained out of line of seniority will be those needed in starting the development of tooling or manufacturing work on a new project, or whose services are required when the work force is reduced. Such employees will be retained up to one hundred twenty (120) calendar days only because no other employee possesses the required skill, license, or experience to perform the necessary work. A list of such persons will be made, and a copy will be furnished to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. Any employee who is removed from the list will be subject to the rules governing seniority. Any complaint by the Union regarding an employee on this list will be handled in accordance with the grievance procedure.
Section 2.	Recall and Return Rights
a.	Whenever there is an increase in the work force after an indefinite layoff, and before a new employee is hired in a given job family, an employee who has recall rights to that classification within the job family will first be offered employment in that classification in accordance with his seniority at the current rate of pay for the job to which he is recalled. An employee will not be hired in labor grade 5 and below in a given job family without first considering those employees who are still on layoff in labor grade 6 and below in that job family. If employees in labor grade 6 and below are qualified to perform the work in question, they will be offered employment before a new employee is hired.
24
VII
b.	If an employee refuses to accept such offer of transfer, he will forfeit any further claim to any job equal or lower in the job family from which he was transferred or laid off, except in the event of an out-of-plant layoff, at which time the employee will be eligible to exercise bump rights as provided for in Article VII, Section 1 .c.(1).
c.	An employee will be reassigned under this section no later than the date his replacement reports for work.
d.	No employee will be eligible by reason of his seniority to be recalled or transferred to a higher-rated job, except as provided under Article VII, Section 1.c(1)(a), or as provided under Article VII, Section 2.a.
Section 3.	Loan Provisions
To avoid the undesirable features of short-time layoffs and short-time recalls, and in the interest of production efficiency that affects both employees and the Company, an employee may, upon written notification, including justification to the shop committeeman(s) with a copy to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, be loaned up to ten (10) working days into another job family from which there are employees on layoff. Written notification includes electronic messages sent to a designated Local 848 e-mail address. Loans in excess of ten working days are subject to mutual agreement in writing with the appropriate shop committeeman(s). Supervision will provide notification to the union that includes employee(s) name, employee number, unit (to/from), job family (to/from), job classification (to/from) and date(s) of loan. Failure to notify the Union of such loan will be cause for compensation to the affected employee on layoff. Further, should the Company fail to secure mutual agreement beyond the said ten (10) days and continue working the loaned employee out of his job family, there will also be cause for compensation to the affected employee on layoff. The Company's liability will not exceed thirty (30) days. It is not the intent of the Parties that this provision will constitute a continuous or repetitive loan situation into the same job family or classification.
Section 4.	Information Furnished Union

(6)	An eligible employee, within the posted job family, may bid within the allotted three (3) working days for a posted vacancy by completion of the triplicate Request for Promotion form. The Request for Promotion form is to be completed in detail, with any appropriate attachment, such as personal resume, and submitted to the bidder's immediate supervisor for acknowledgment signature. The employee will then give one copy to the immediate supervisor, retain one copy, and forward the original via internal plant mail to the designated Human Resources unit.
26
VII
(7)	Upon receipt of an employee's Request for Promotion form, the designated Human Resources unit will note date and time of receipt and will return, via U.S. mail to employee's address of record, to the bidding employee a signed acknowledgment that the completed Request for Promotion form has been received in the designated Human Resources unit.
(8)	Timely submitted and received bids submitted by eligible bidders within the posted job family will be considered and evaluated by the Company in the filling of a job vacancy.
(a)	Human Resources will review the completed Request for Promotion form, individual personnel files and other data which identifies an employee's work experience, history, education, training, etc. for the purpose of verifying and listing the qualifications of the individual bidders.
(b)	Human Resources will then complete an independent review and evaluation of those bidding.
1)	If it is determined there are no bidders who possess qualifications to fill the vacancy, Human Resources will inform the requesting supervisor, the appropriate committeeman(s), and will, via U.S. mail to employee's address of record, individually notify each unsuccessful bidder of the general reason(s) the bidder will not be promoted.
2)	Simultaneously, the Company's Employment unit will be notified to fill the Request for Personnel.
3)	Upon identification of one or more bidders who appear to possess basic qualifications for filling the vacancy, Human Resources will make a recommendation and transmit the applications for selection. Once the candidate(s) is selected, the employee will be notified. The Company will make every attempt to initiate promotion(s) within forty-five (45) days of the posting.
(9)	In cases of cancellation(s) of the Request for Promotion, the bidder(s) and the respective committeeman will be notified of the reason for cancellation and the cancellation will be posted in the designated area(s) per Article VII, Section 5.b.(4).
(10)	Whenever a less senior employee(s) is promoted to fill a job vacancy instead of a more senior bidder, Human Resources will discuss the promotion with the respective committeeman and/or steward if requested by the committeeman.
(11)	Whenever it is practical and feasible to do so and will not delay production or otherwise adversely impact Company business, the Company's Employment function will not be notified of new or replacement manpower requirements until such time as the Company has considered the eligible internal candidates who request consideration for promotion.
c.	When eligible employees within the job family do not submit a request within the three (3) working days' limitation because they are on vacation, jury duty, military duty (not exceeding two (2) weeks), temporary layoff or bereavement, or are absent not more than five (5) days due to a bona fide illness, they may protest such promotions under the procedure set forth under Article V.

While it is the intent of the Company to promote from within, nothing herein will be construed to prevent the Company from filling available openings through hiring after following the procedure set forth in Article VII, Section 5.b. An employee in the affected promotional area who feels he should have been promoted to an opening filled through hiring or transfer across job families may follow the procedure as set forth under Article V.
f.	Promotions may be processed without regards to employees having recall rights.
g.	For leads created on or after October 1, 2007, the following procedure will be applied:
(1)	The creation and selection of all lead persons will be determined by Management and Human Resources.
(2)	No employee may be promoted to a lead position unless he has met a minimum qualification of ten (10) years seniority in the job family where the promotion is being made. In the event there are no employees in a job family with ten (10) years seniority, or no employee with ten (10) years seniority applies for the lead promotion, employees with five (5) years seniority or ten (10) years experience in accordance with the applicable job description may be eligible for a lead promotion.
(3)	Should Management determine that an individual is not performing satisfactorily in a lead capacity, he may be removed from his lead position and returned to his previously held labor grade and rate of pay he would have received had he not been promoted. Human Resources will review the reasons with the Union prior to taking such action.
(a)	Management may not remove a lead until he has served at least six (6) months in the lead capacity, unless the removal was Management directed due to a rate reduction or loss of a program. Such a reduction shall take place in inverse seniority order.
(b)	Once an employee has been removed from a lead position, either voluntarily or through a Management determination that he was not performing satisfactorily as a lead, he will not be eligible for another lead position for one (1) year from the date of reclassification.
Section 6.	Inter-Unit Transfers
When the Company transfers individual employees or groups of employees from one unit to another, consideration will be given to seniority. Should an employee believe proper consideration has not been given, the supervisor will meet with the committeeman and the employee to explain the reason(s) for the transfer. Nothing herein, however, will prevent the Company from transferring employees to another unit for production reasons when such transfers do not entail a change of classification job family or rate of pay.
28
VII
Section 7.	Shift Preference
a.	When an employee has been continuously and actively on a shift for three (3) months, he may request a transfer to another shift to a job within his manager's area, except as noted per Letter of Agreement #21.

Section 6.	Cost-of-Living Allowance (COLA)
In addition to the base rate of pay of each employee and subject to the conditions and provisions set forth in this section, a cost-of-living allowance (COLA) will be paid to each employee based upon changes in the cost-of-living as follows:
a.	The cost-of-living allowance, if any, will be determined in accordance with changes in the Consumers' Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), Revised Series (U.S. city average, all items, 1982 equals 100), based on the rental equivalency now published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (hereafter referred to as BLS Consumers' Price Index).
b.	The cost-of-living allowance will be computed on the basis of one cent ($.01) for each two-tenths (0.2) point increase in the BLS Consumers' Price Index and will be calculated and made effective quarterly, as shown in the following table.
36
VIII
Effective Date	COLA Computation Period Based on Average of Three-month BLS Consumer's Price Indices for:

8-Apr-2013	December 2012, January & February 2013
8-Jul-2013	March, April, May 2013
c.	For example, the amount of the cost-of-living allowance that is effective on October 11, 2010, will be calculated using the BLS Consumers' Price Index for June, July, and August 2010 and any subsequent adjustments in the BLS Consumers' Price Index will be computed as stated in Article VIII, Section 6.b.
c. Effective with the October 11, 2010 adjustment and thereafter, to receive the COLA adjustment each employee must have been an active employee, or in Section 900 for the full period in which the adjustment is made. For example in the case of a new hire, to receive the October 11, 2010, adjustment, an employee must be on the payroll on or before June 1, 2010. For the January 10, 2011 adjustment, the employee must be on the payroll on or before September 1, 2010, and so forth.

d.	COLA adjustments will be folded into each employee's base rate and each labor grade maximum will be increased by the amount of the COLA adjustment on each COLA effective date.
e.	An employee's cost-of-living allowance will be included in computing pay for overtime premium, vacation, holiday, call-in, jury duty, bereavement and military duty.
f.	In the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not issue the Consumers' Price Index on or before the effective dates referred to in Article VIII, Section 6.b, any adjustments required will be made at the beginning of the first pay period after receipt of the index.
g.	No adjustments, retroactive or otherwise, will be made due to any revision which may later be made in the published figures for the BLS Consumers' Index for any base month.
37
VIII
h.	The Parties agree that this provision for a cost-of-living allowance is dependent upon the availability of the official monthly BLS Consumers' Price Index in its same form and calculated on the same basis as the indices for June, July, and August 2000.

a.	The job classifications and labor grades, as listed in the Job Family Appendices, and any new ones that may be established in accordance with this article, become a part of and are subject to all the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

b.	The Company will have the right to establish new jobs, to revise existing jobs, to evaluate and to obsolete jobs, providing such action will not be directed toward reducing the labor grade of a job in which no substantial change in the job itself has occurred.
(1)	When a new or revised operation involves duties that are not adequately or specifically described or properly evaluated in an existing job description, specification and classification, the Company has the right to develop and establish such new or revised job descriptions, specifications and classifications, rates of pay, and job family placements, and to place them into effect.

(b)	The existing job covers major specific functions not called out in the new or revised job.
(2)	Notwithstanding other provisions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Company will advise the Union of its intent to place a new or revised job into effect thirty (30) calendar days prior to actually working the job. Following such notification, the Parties will meet and discuss the proposed new or revised job in an effort to reach agreement on the job classification and job family placement. Upon the Parties reaching an agreement, the new or revised job will be placed into effect. Should the Parties not reach agreement within the thirty (30) calendar day period, the Company may place the new or revised job into effect in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
c.	The Company will send by certified mail ten (10) copies of such job descriptions, specifications and classifications, rates of pay and job family placements addressed to the President and Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee within fifteen (15) days after placing them into effect.

(1)	Improper evaluation and labor grade
(2)	Improper job family placement; and/or
(3)	That such new or revised operations should be placed or retained in an existing job description, specification and classification.
Such grievance will state the Union's position, the facts upon which it is based and the remedy or correction requested. In the event of a job rating grievance, the specific factors with which the Union disagrees, together with the reasons why it believes the factors are not evaluated properly, must be listed by the Union on the grievance form. In the event that the Company and the Union are unable to resolve the grievance, it may be appealed to arbitration in accordance with Article V, Section 8.a. The arbitration will be limited to a determination (based on the work as described by the Company) of:
(a)	The proper evaluation
(b)	The proper labor grade
(c)	The proper job family; and
(d)	Whether the new or revised job may properly be placed or retained in an existing classification.
e.	Thirty (30) days after receipt of such notification, if the Union has not filed a Union grievance, the job classification will be added to the Job Family Appendices. The job description and specification, rate of pay, and job family placement will become a part of and be subject to all of the applicable provisions of this Agreement.
f.	The Company's right to make work assignments and to determine methods of operations is in no way restricted by this article and will not be subject to arbitration.
g.	When arbitrating the rate of pay for a job, the authority of the arbitrator will be limited to determining which of the existing labor grades the new or revised job will be placed in. The arbitrator will base his award on evidence either Party presents under the Company's Hourly Job Rating Plan, including intraplant job comparison material.
h.	The effective date of the rate of pay of any new or revised job will be the date the new or revised job was placed into effect by the Company. In the event this rate is revised through the grievance procedure, such revision will be retroactive to the date the job was placed into effect.
i.	In the event that the job is placed in a different job family or classification than the group or classification in which the Company originally placed it, either by agreement between the Parties or by decision of the arbitrator, the effective date of displacement pay, if any, will be three (3) working days from the date of settlement by the Parties, or three (3) working days from the date of receipt of the arbitrator's decision by the Company. When the Union gives notice to the Company of intent to

arbitrate such a matter, it will list in writing to the Company the reasons for disagreement and the relief sought.
j.	The Company agrees to include in the "Description of Duties":
(1)	Any duty presently appearing as part of the job specifications
(2)	Experience; and
(3)	Education
The Company agrees with the principle that lower classified employees should not perform higher classified work on a regular and consistent basis without being paid the higher rate. The Company will continue to use "C" classifications when the need for such classifications exists. While the Company agrees that all job descriptions should be written to show a clear line of demarcation between classifications, it cannot agree that all unrelated duties appearing in present job descriptions will be removed.
Section 2.	Work Outside Job Family
a.	The Company will make every effort possible to keep employees working in their respective classifications and job families. In the event an employee is required to work outside of his job family in excess of one (1) workday, the Union will be notified via electronic message sent to the designated Local 848 e-mail address. In the event an employee is required to work outside of his job family in excess of ten (10) days, such period of time in excess of ten (10) days will be mutually agreed to in writing by the Company and the respective committeeman(s). Job descriptions and specifications will be used for the purpose of distinguishing one job classification from another as clearly and definitively as possible. In multilevel or series-type jobs, job descriptions and specifications must distinguish the level of pay of each job.
b.	It is understood that employees may be required to perform work within other job families, de minimis in length, and only in conjunction with the completion of their normal job.
Section 3.	Involuntary Transfer to Lower Classification
Under the terms of prior Agreements, an employee could not be involuntarily transferred to a lower classification within his job family, resulting in a condition where an employee could be assigned to the "A" classification with the commensurate rate while performing the duties of the "B" classification. The Parties again agreed during the 1965 negotiations that where the above condition exists, an employee will not be transferred to a lower labor grade within his job family for the duration of this Agreement, except under the following conditions:
a.	When there has been a significant change in the job content of the classification to which an employee was assigned or a significant change in his work assignment.
b.	When there is a bona fide reduction in force that affects the employee in his job family.
41
IX
It was further agreed between the Parties that an employee cannot use misclassifications as cited above as grounds for requesting an upgrade.
Section 4.	Proper Classification
For the purpose of determining if an employee is properly classified, it is understood and agreed that an employee will not be required to perform all of the incidental duties included in a job description, but he must perform the major functions of the job on a regular basis. Major functions are those duties called out in a job that are not covered in a lower-rated job and require the performance of a skill or other factor that is not required in the lower-rated job. An employee will not be considered to be improperly classified by reason of occasionally performing major functions or isolated or minor duties in a higher job. In case of dispute, the normal function of the job will govern based on the normal past practice of the shop. When it is determined that an employee is improperly classified, these findings will not be used as grounds for requesting an upgrade of the employee. Promotion reassignment and/or replacement of the employee will be effected under the terms provided herein.

In instances of standby jury duty, an employee will receive pay only for hours subsequent to being called to jury duty not to exceed the remainder of the shift. Satisfactory proof of such services must be given to the Company before this section will apply.
b.	An employee who has been subpoenaed adversely to testify in a case other than one involving himself, the Company, or the Union, and does testify, will receive eight (8) hours pay at his base rate less any witness pay he received, provided he notifies the Company prior to the day which he is scheduled to testify.

Section 6.	Personal/Sick Pay
a.	Employees will accumulate personal/sick pay credit at the rate of one-twelfth (1/12) of forty (40) straight-time hours for each month of service during the calendar year, and will be credited with the amount thus accumulated on the following January 1, provided they were on the active payroll prior to November 1 of the calendar year and they are on the active payroll on such January 1.
b.	No employee will be credited with personal/sick pay until the January 1 following the calendar year in which personal/sick pay credits are accumulated. No employee will be credited for more than forty (40) hours' personal/sick pay at the end of any calendar year.
c.	Personal/sick leave credited on any January 1 for employment in the previous year and that credited under Article X, Section 6.c(2) will be paid the following January 1, with the following exceptions:
(1)	An employee who is absent at least one (1) hour or who receives a pass to leave the plant at least one (1) hour before the end of the shift will, at his request, be paid personal/sick pay in one (1) hour increments up to eight (8) hours if he is eligible. Third shift employees not working the required six and one half (6 1/2) hours may take Sick/Personal pay in one (1) hour increments to complete eight (8) hours. Example: 3rd shift employee leaving plant after five (5) hours work must take three (3) hours Sick/Personal for credit of eight (8) hours.
(2)	An employee who is eligible for payment of unused personal/sick pay on January 1 may elect to defer such payment and add these unused days to those with which he was credited on that January 1, for a combined maximum not to exceed fifteen (15) days.

46
(2)	An employee who is laid off, retires or dies and who was credited on January 1 preceding the date of layoff, retirement, or death with personal/sick pay hours accumulated prior to this January 1, will be paid all the personal/sick pay hours accumulated by him between the date of his layoff or retirement and the preceding January 1.
e.	For the purpose of this section, a full calendar year will mean from January 1 through December 31, during which an employee is paid by the Company for performing work for the Company, except as outlined in Article X, Section 6.f.

Personal/sick pay will be paid only for straight-time hours not worked by the employee and in no event for an absence of less than one (1) hour.
h.	Language under this section does not in any way alter the requirements for holiday pay.
Section 7.	Vacations
a.	Eligibility
(1)	A vacation of one (1) week, consisting of five (5) working days, will be allowed an hourly rated employee who on his seniority date in any year during the life of this Agreement will have been continuously and actively in the employ of the Company for a period of at least one (1) year prior thereto.

(5)	An hourly rated employee who does not meet the requirements of either Article X, Section 7.a(1), (2), (3) or (4), will receive no vacation, and every employee who does meet the requirements of one (1) or more of these subsections will receive only the vacation specified in that subsection that gives him the longest vacation.
b.	Rate of Pay
The vacation pay allowances mentioned in this section will be computed at the employee's regular base hourly rate of pay, including shift differential, but exclusive of all premiums or overtime allowances. Any vacation allowance paid on a pro rata basis will be deducted from the regular allowance.
c.	Eighty Percent Rule
(1)	All employees covered by Article X, Section 7.a(1), (2), (3) and (4) must, on the seniority date used for computing their vacation eligibility, have worked at least eighty percent (80%) of the regular scheduled working hours of the plant since their seniority date of the preceding year.
(2)	Absences up to sixty-five (65) workdays due to indefinite layoff for lack of work and temporary layoffs for causes specified in Article VII, Section 1.f, or absences for jury duty, or absences up to twenty (20) work days for military service, or days absent for which an employee receives personal/sick pay will not be charged against the employee in the computation of vacation eligibility under the eighty percent (80%) rule mentioned above. In addition, absences due to occupational injury and absences excused by the Company for Union business will not be charged against the employee in the computation of vacation eligibility under said rule.
d.	Schedules and Cancellations
(1)	Vacation is to be scheduled by seniority between February 1 and February 15 of each year. An employee who refuses to schedule on any round may not subsequently bump a less senior employee's selection. Furthermore, once selections are made, they may not be changed if the selection affects another employee's prior selection. An employee transferring to a unit where vacation schedules conflict with the transferring employee's prior vacation selection(s) will not be allowed to bump an employee because of seniority from a vacation schedule previously selected. However, every effort will be made to accommodate the employee if the transfer was initiated by the Company for production reasons.
(2)	No vacation may be cancelled without the employee's consent during the two (2) week period immediately preceding the effective date, nor will the Company
48
force an employee to go on vacation without two (2) weeks' prior notice, provided there is no major change in the production schedule.
(3)	Per each vacation year, up to four (4) weeks, twenty (20) days, of an employee's credited vacation may be taken one (1) or more days at a time in eight (8) hour increments.

Vacations scheduled in a block of one (1) or more consecutive weeks will have precedence over a vacation of less than a full week. An employee's request for vacation of less than a full week must be made at least one day in advance.
e.	Unused Vacation
(1)	An employee who is in Section 900 or who has been granted a Union leave of absence will, at his request, be paid for any unused vacation time for which he is eligible. This provision applies only to full vacation time or five (5) day fractions thereof.
(2)	An employee who for any reason leaves the payroll of the Company without having taken the vacation for which he is eligible will be paid in lieu of such vacation for any portion for which he has not already been paid.
(3)	Effective February 15, 1996, the Company will permit employees who have not used all of their current year's vacation to carry over the unused portion, up to a maximum of two (2) years' total accrual. Unused vacation hours exceeding two (2) times an employee's annual accrual will be paid to employees annually the Friday prior to the Thanksgiving Holiday.
f.	Pro Rata Vacation
(1)	An employee who is laid off, dies or is drafted into military service under the Selective Service Act, as amended, or who retires under the Company's Retirement Plan, will be paid prorated vacation pay under the following conditions:
(a)	The employee has accumulated one (1) or more years of seniority
(b)	The employee has worked at least eighty percent (80%) of the
regularly scheduled working hours of the plant, from his last vacation eligibility date to his date of termination.
(c)	The employee meets these conditions, he will be paid at the rate of one-twelfth (1/12) of the vacation pay for each month for which he is eligible and the major fraction of the month in which he is terminated for which he has not previously received vacation pay. An employee will be deemed to have worked a major fraction of the month in which he is terminated if he has worked a minimum of eighty-five (85) straight-time hours.
(2)	An employee in Section 900 due to a work related injury, who retires under the Retirement Plan directly from Section 900, will be paid prorated vacation pay.
(3)	An employee recalled from layoff or returning from military service under the Selective Service Act, as amended, or returning from Section 900 due to illness
49
will, if not eligible for full vacation, be eligible for pro rata vacation pay on his seniority date falling after such recall or return, computed as in Article X, Section 7.f(1), if he worked at least eighty percent (80%) of the regularly scheduled working hours of the plant for the period from such recall or return to such seniority date.
(4)	An employee with at least six (6) months seniority but less than one (1) year seniority, who is laid off will be paid pro rata vacation provided the employee has worked at least eighty percent (80%) of the regularly scheduled working hours prior to layoff.
g.	The Parties recognize the right of the Company to shut down the Jefferson Street and/or Marshall Street facility, independent of one another, for purposes of vacation. However, no employee will be forced to take his vacation during this shutdown, with the understanding that the employee will be on vacation without pay if he elects not to take vacation during this shutdown and is not otherwise scheduled. In the event the Company reguires a certain classification of work to be performed during a scheduled shutdown, employees performing work in the particular classification will be offered the opportunity to perform the work in seniority order.
(1)	In the event the Company requires a certain classification of work to be performed during a scheduled shutdown, employees will be offered work in seniority order within the unit where the work is to be performed.
(2)	An employee shall not be loaned into or perform work in a unit that is shut down. Should this occur it will be deemed a displacement and shall be cause for compensation for the displaced employee.
Section 8.	Voting Time
The Company will grant employees reasonable time off to vote in accordance with the existing Texas state laws. Reasonable time for state and federal elections, when requested, will be one (1) hour for those employees working first-shift hours on election day. The day after the election, the employee will submit his certification as evidence of having voted, and his supervisor will approve the card provided for voting time. When a state or federal election falls on a premium day, an employee who is scheduled to work a minimum of eight (8) hours beginning no earlier than his normal first shift starting time, will be paid the one (1) hour voting time at the employee's base straight time rate, plus any applicable cost of living. No employee will be scheduled for less than eight (8) hours in order to preclude his becoming eligible for voting time pay.
50
Section 9.	Incomplete Day's Work
a.
(1)	Any employee reporting for work who has been working on the previous workday and has not been notified that there will be no work will receive four (4) hours' work at his regular base hourly rate of pay. The posting of a notice on the bulletin boards within the affected unit(s) two (2) hours before the completion of the shift of the affected employee will be sufficient and proper notice. This provision will not apply in case of any stoppage of work, strike, or slowdown, or in any other case or conditions beyond the control of the Company.
(2)	An employee who is scheduled to work on a premium payment day and reports as scheduled will be allowed to work a minimum of four (4) hours or receive four (4) hours' pay at the applicable rate for such hours.

c.	Employees who are injured in the factory and who are sent home on the day of injury by the Medical Department will be paid for the balance of their scheduled work shift on that day at their regular base hourly rate including shift differential.
d.	Any employee who is required to work less than eight (8) hours on one of the observed holidays will be paid three (3) times his regular base hourly wage rate including night shift differential if it is applicable, plus straight-time pay for the difference between eight (8) hours and those hours for which the premium rate is paid.

ARTICLE XI
LEAVE OF ABSENCE
Section 1.	Personal
a.	A leave of absence not exceeding ninety (90) days may be granted by the Company to any employee for good and sufficient cause upon the written request of the employee. Also, the Company may grant a leave of absence to an employee who has been appointed or elected to a state or federal office. If a leave of absence is granted, the seniority of the employee will accumulate during the period of the leave of absence. While on a personal leave of absence an employee will not be entitled to health care benefits unless, prior to the leave, the employee makes arrangements with the benefits office to continue benefits at his own cost during the leave of absence.
b.	An employee who has been granted such leave of absence will be considered as having quit without notice and will be terminated from employment by the Company if, while on his leave of absence, he engages in or applies for other employment without the consent of the Company. If an employee on such leave fails to report for work on his first regular shift after the termination of his leave, he will be subject to discharge.
Section 2.	Section 900
An employee absent due to illness for more than five (5) working days will be placed in Section 900, an inactive unit, on his sixth normal working day. To remain in Section 900, an employee must submit to the Company satisfactory evidence of illness within the time frames applicable to the particular type of leave. If an employee fails to return to work at the leave's expiration whether due to doctor's release to return to work and/or failure to obtain an extension of leave, the Company will presume that the employee does not plan to return to work and that the employee has voluntarily terminated employment.. The maximum time limits for Section 900 eligibility are as follows:
SERVICE	CONTINUOUS TIME IN SECTION 900
90 days to 3 years 3 years to 5 years 5 years or more	1 year 1 Vz years 2 years OR
SERVICE 90 Days to 5 Years 5 Years or More	CUMULATIVE TIME in SECTION 900 18 Months 30 Months in Any Five (5) Year Period
53
XI
When an employee reaches either one of the time limits as outlined above (cumulative or continuous) his employment will be terminated.
If the employee was in section 900 due to an occupational injury at the time of termination, he will be provided up to twelve (12) months after his termination date to submit satisfactory medical evidence showing he is able to return to work providing he successfully completes a company physical exam including substance abuse testing. Upon returning to work such employee shall be reinstated with seniority.
Section 3.	Military and Peace Corps

The provisions of the federal law relating to military leave are defined under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, and under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Seniority of employees on military leave will accumulate in accordance with the provisions of USERRA.
b.	Upon written request by an employee who is accepted for service with the Peace Corps, foreign or domestic, the provisions of Article XI, Section 3.a, will apply for a period of up to two (2) years with respect to seniority, vacation and reemployment.

The employee will receive annual renewals upon written application to the Director of Labor Relations.
Section 5.	Leaves Other Than Section 900
a.	If an employee who has been given such leave of absence reports for work on his first regular workday after he terminates his leave, he will be reemployed in accordance with his seniority on the same general type of work that he did immediately prior to his leave. His wage rate will be the rate existing in the plant at the time of his return on the job for which he is reemployed. Seniority will accumulate during such leave of absence.
b.	If an employee is physically unable to return to work, he will be placed in Section 900, provided he presents proof of his disability.

f.	Represented employees will pay the negotiated weekly contributions to provide health care coverage for enrolled dependents under the applicable health plan option. These contributions may be made on a pretax basis in accordance with Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Service Code. To comply with Section 125, a new or recalled employee may only add dependents within thirty (30) days of their initial eligibility or delete dependents within sixty (60) days of their ceasing to be eligible, or within sixty (60) days of a qualified change in status as defined in the Summary Plan Description. Should an employee not take action to delete dependent coverage during this sixty (60) day period, dependent health care deductions will stop as soon as administratively possible after notification and no refunds will be paid. Dependents may be added after sixty (60) days of the event without evidence of insurability.
g.	Eligible dependents will be as defined in the Summary Plan Description (SPD). It is the responsibility of the employee to enroll only eligible dependents in employer-sponsored coverage. Dependents that are determined to be ineligible for coverage will be dropped from coverage upon such determination and the employee may be responsible for reimbursing the Company for the cost of any claims incurred while the ineligible dependent was enrolled in coverage.
h.	Spouses who are employed by an employer that provides health care coverage for its employees and pays at least 50% of the cost will not be allowed to be enrolled as a dependent under this Health Care Plan unless they have first elected to enroll in health care coverage through their employer. In such circumstances, this Plan will pay as a secondary payor.
Section 3.	Health Care Benefits for Future Retirees or Survivors Effective for Retirements on or after January 1, 1993.
a.	General Information
(1)	Retirees with less than ten (10) years of credited service will not be eligible for retiree health care for themselves, dependents or survivors.
(2)	Should the retiree or dependent/survivor elect not to pay any cost in excess of the applicable Company contributions, the retiree and dependent/survivor of such retiree will no longer qualify for Company health care or HMO coverage. In such instances, the health care may be reinstated one (1) time with satisfactory evidence of insurability.
(3)	The health care coverage for a retiree or survivor and the eligible spouse will be based on the age of the eligible individual. The benefits will be different if both are not eligible for Medicare. Those individuals that are not eligible for Medicare will have benefits as described in Article XII, Section 3.b. Those individuals that are eligible for Medicare will have benefits as described in Article XII, Section 3.c.

2.	URC: Usual, reasonable and customary
3.	The doctor will bill the claims administrator and an Explanation of Benefits detailing deductible or co-insurance that may apply will be sent. Any lab tests or other tests required by a physician will be subject to deductible and coinsurance. Co-pay charges do not apply to deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums.
4.	Emergency room visits always qualify as in-network benefits. If the visit is not for an emergency, benefits are determined by medical plan option as follows:
•	At a network hospital, in-network benefits
•	At an out-of-network hospital, out-of-network benefits

63
XII
who will provide desired assistance to eligible retirees and eligible dependents to purchase a commercially-available Medicare coordinated plan. If at any time during the life of this agreement, there is no commercially available Medicare Supplement Plans (i.e., Medigap/Medicare Advantage) offered, the Company will reinstate the current capped Medicare Supplement Plan, placing the participant at their present lifetime maximum amount.
d.	Benefit Provisions for Retirees Who Met Specific Requirements as of January 1,1993
(1)	Retirees who meet the specific criteria specified in this section will retain benefits in place of those outlined in Section 3(c) above.
(2)	Group 1: Employees who on January 1, 1993, were age sixty-two (62) with ten (10) years credited service, age sixty (60) with twenty (20) years credited service, or age fifty-five (55) with eighty-five (85) points:
After age sixty-five (65), these retirees will be eligible for same benefit provisions that were in effect and previously administered by Unicare (“formerly Unicare”) immediately prior to January 1, 1993. This group of retirees will qualify for the Medicare premium allowance outlined in Article XII, Section 3.d(4).
(3)	Group 2: Employees who on January 1, 1993, were active employees with age and credited service totaling seventy-five (75) points or more (age and credited service calculated to the nearest month, added together and rounded up to the next whole number) will have the same plan as described in Article XII, Section 3.b. However, the service-related contribution schedule described in Article XII, Section 3.b(1) will not apply. Employees in this category will pay the same contribution amounts for both plan options.
(4)	Retirees identified in Article XII, Section 3.d.(2) and (3) will receive a premium allowance toward Part B of Medicare in the amount of twenty-eight dollars and eighty cents ($28.80) per month provided that they are not receiving the $125 healthcare reimbursement stipend per Article XII section 3c. above. To receive this allowance, retirees and their dependents who are eligible for the Company’s health care coverage must satisfactorily prove to the Company that they are enrolled in Part B of Medicare.
e.	Benefit provisions for UAW retirees who retired from active employment between July 2, 1984 and December 31, 1992 continue as defined in the Summary Plan Description (SPD).

Section 4.	Disability Plan
Short-term and long-term disability benefits have been agreed to by the Parties. The provisions of these benefits will be applicable to covered employees for the duration of the Agreement in accordance with the provisions as specified in the SPD for short-term disability benefits and the Certificate of Insurance as issued by the provider for long-term disability benefits.
a.	Short Term Disability
(1)	Employees hired before October 4, 2010.
For disabilities that occur on or after October 4, 2010 and are eligible for short-term disability benefits under the provisions of the SPD, weekly short-term disability benefits will be equal to 40% of base pay or the rates listed below, whichever is greater.
Labor Grade	Effective October 1,2000
J	416
L	410

(2)	Employees hired on or after October 4, 2010.
For disabilities that occur on or after October 4, 2010 and are eligible for short-term disability benefits under the provisions of the SPD, weekly short-term disability benefits will be equal to 40% of base pay.
The weekly benefit is determined by the employee's hourly rate on the last day worked immediately preceding the disability excluding shift differential and offsite premium. The benefits described above will be reduced by any benefit payable to the employee from workers' compensation and/or any amounts payable from Social Security.
b.	For work-related injuries which occur on or after October 2, 2000, the following will apply.
(1)	If the employee chooses to participate in the company Occupational Health Care program and agrees to remain under the care of the Company approved occupational disability physician network and the claim is found compensable under workers’ compensation.
65
XII
(a)	The employee will receive, up to a maximum of sixty six (66) work days within a rolling 12 month period, payment of an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of base pay less taxes starting from the reported date of injury. When the employee's claim has been given a maximum medical improvement (MMI) rating the employee will be ineligible to receive any additional funds under the OHC program. However, an employee reaching MMI may be eligible for benefits under the Company provided disability plan.
(b)	The OHC payment will come from two (2) sources: Company supplemental pay and the workers' compensation benefit paid by the carrier.
(c)	The payment will be calculated so the employee will not experience a decrease in net take-home pay by taking into consideration that the workers' compensation payment is not taxable.
(2)	If the employee does not choose to remain under the care of the Company-approved occupational disability physician network, the employee will be ineligible for the sixty six (66) work days of supplementary payments and any of these payments advanced to the employee will result in an overpayment that is immediately due to the company.
(3)	Should the employee remain disabled and absent from work for a total of sixty six (66) work days within a rolling 12 month period, the supplemental payments shall cease and the weekly disability benefit shall be limited to the workers' compensation payment applicable under state workers' compensation law.
(4)	If an employee returns to work and has not exhausted the sixty six (66) work day limit in a rolling twelve (12) month period, a subsequent absence (even if related to the prior absence) is treated as a new absence and the employee again has the option of whether to be under the care of the Company-approved occupational disability physician network, provided the change of treating physician is approved by the Texas Workers' Compensation Commission in accordance with current TWCC rules and regulations or provisions under section 4.b.(2) as outlined above.
(5)	As long as the employee is complying with the treatment plan established by the Company-approved occupational disability physician network, the employee is eligible for supplemental pay for the relevant injury, in accordance with Section 4.b (1). If the employee does not follow the treatment plan, the employee is considered noncompliant and owes the company any supplemental pay the employee has received.
(6)	(Insert from Letter of agreement dated 7/8/93)
In those cases where a second or third shift employee qualifies for one hundred percent (100%) pay and physical therapy is recommended by the approved occupational disability physician network, an attempt will be made to schedule the physical therapy at the beginning of the shift for second shift employees and at the end of the shift for third shift employees. If such scheduling is not practical, the physical therapy will be scheduled outside the shift and a corresponding amount of time off with pay will be granted from the
66
XII
employee’s shift. In no case will payments caused by physical therapy be at a premium rate.
c.	Long-Term Disability
UAW-represented employees who had less than sixteen years of seniority as of December 31,2007 or who were newly hired on or January 1, 2008 are eligible for coverage under a long-term disability plan as described in the Certificate of Insurance issued by the disability insurance provider.
Section 5.	Life Insurance Plans
Basic life, accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D), dependent life and optional employee life benefits have been agreed to by the Parties. The provisions of these benefits will be applicable to covered employees for the duration of the Agreement and in accordance with the provisions as specified in the Certificate of Insurance as issued by the provider.
a.	The current accidental death benefit while traveling on company business is one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).
b.	Basic Life and AD&D
Employees who are actively at work or on an approved leave of absence on or after October 4, 2010 are provided a company-paid basic life benefit of $50,000 and AD&D benefit of up to an additional $50,000. Dismemberment benefits under the AD&D benefit are paid per the schedule contained in the Certificate of Insurance.
c.	Dependent Life Insurance
Employee-paid optional dependent life insurance coverage is available through weekly payroll deductions in accordance with the Certificate of Insurance for the following levels of coverage:
Spouse:
Child(ren):
$20,000
$10,000
Rates are subject to periodic review by the provider and may be adjusted during the life of this Agreement. Child dependents may be covered under this benefit until age 26. Employees may purchase coverage for their spouses, including spouses who are also employees of the Company.
d.	Optional Employee Life Insurance
The Company will offer employee-paid optional employee life insurance coverage in multiples of 1 to 8 times the employee’s annualized base hourly pay, for which premiums will be paid through payroll deduction. The coverage amount will be determined upon initial enrollment and, thereafter, annually on July 1st.
Evidence of insurability and eligibility requirements will be in accordance with the provisions contained in the Certificate of Insurance issued by the provider.
67
XII
Initial enrollment and increases in coverage levels will not be effective if an employee is on leave of absence. An employee must return from leave of absence before new coverage or coverage increases will be effective.
Rates are subject to annual review by the provider and may be adjusted during the life of this Agreement.
Section 6.	Subject Next to Negotiations
The provisions of the Health and Welfare Benefit Plan will be subject next to negotiations upon expiration of this Agreement.
Section 7.	Disability Retirement
Employees with at least 75 points before the end of the 52 week period during which the employee receives benefits from the short-term disability plan, may qualify for a disability retirement if the employee is unable to fulfill the responsibilities and duties associated with the position they held immediately prior to incurring the disability.
For employees with less than 75 points, the definition of “disability” shall be a mental or physical condition which totally and presumably permanently prevents the employee from engaging in any gainful employment.
Other eligibility requirements must also be met and are defined in the Plan document for the Hourly Retirement Plan.
Section 8.	Dental Benefit Options
a.	Effective with ratification and continuing through December 31, 2010, the Company will offer to UAW-represented employees the same Unicare dental plan benefits as currently offered under the October 1, 2007 Collective Bargaining Agreement. Effective January 1, 2011, the Unicare dental plan will no longer be offered to active employees. Beginning July 1, 2011, a Dental Maintenance Organization (DMO) plan will be offered to active employees. There will be no employee premium contributions for this plan option.

Projected Years of Credited Service at First Retirement Eligibility is defined as the credited service the employee would have as of the date the Supplemental Early Retirement Benefit could first become payable, assuming the employee works full time in covered employment from December 31, 2007 until such date.
For example, if an employee has 10 years of credited service as of December 31, 2007 and has 30 years of credited service at age 55 (when first eligible for the Supplemental Early Retirement Benefit), the extra amount
71
XIII
of the Supplemental Early Retirement Benefit would be (10/30) X $550 or $183.33.

CHECKOFF A GREEMENT
Section 1.	Authorization for Union Dues
a.	The Company agrees to deduct Union dues in the amount of two (2) hours of the employee's hourly base rate, plus two (2) hours of COLA, plus any other amount that may be established by the Union each month from the earnings of an employee who authorizes such deductions by signing the authorization form provided for this purpose. Such deductions will be made in accordance with the provisions of the authorization form.
b.	The Company's obligation to make such deductions will terminate automatically upon the termination of the employee or upon his transfer to a plant, union or job not covered by this Agreement. Employees who are transferred out of the collective bargaining unit into supervisory positions will have, in addition to their normal withdrawal period, thirty (30) days following their transfer to revoke or withdraw their checkoff authorization by so notifying the Company and the Union by letter. However, in compliance with the 1985 NLRB ruling, the Company will not resume deduction of Union dues on an employee rehired without seniority until such time a new authorization card is signed by the employee.
Deductions will be resumed, however, under the following conditions:
(1)	If an employee is recalled or rehired with seniority, provided such employee's authorization has not been revoked by him during a revocation or withdrawal period; provided also, that the resumed deductions will begin with the employee's earnings for the first payroll week of the next calendar month following such recall or rehire.
(2)	If a former collective bargaining unit employee is transferred back to a job covered by this Agreement, provided that such employee's authorization has not been revoked by him during a revocation or withdrawal period that occurred while he was not in the collective bargaining unit; provided also, that the resumed deductions will begin with the employee's earnings for the first payroll week of the next calendar month following such transfer.
(3)	In the event of a month beginning with a split week, the date of the check compensating for said work will constitute the eligibility for a Union dues deduction in current month.
c.	On dues week, represented employees who have authorized dues checkoff will have dues deducted, based on deduction priority, if their earnings during the week are sufficient to permit the deduction. It is not required that the check be for forty (40) or more hours if the earnings are sufficient to permit the deduction.
d.	The Union agrees that it will indemnify and save the Company harm from any and all liability, claim, responsibility, damage or suit that may arise out of any action taken by the Company in accordance with the terms of this section or the terms of this article in reliance upon the authorization mentioned herein.
75
XV
Section 2.	Application of Checkoff
a.	The authorization form for checkoff of dues to be used by employees for the purpose of authorizing the Company to deduct monthly Union dues from their earnings and to assign such sums to the Union is attached and made a part of this Agreement.
b.	The Union will assume full responsibility for the distribution and collection of such authorization cards and guarantees that such distribution and collection will not take place during working hours on Company premises.
c.	Each authorization card will be signed by the employee who authorized the deduction together with a witness to his signing and the date of signing.
d.	All authorization for cards will be submitted by the Union to the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative on or before the Friday before the week in which they are to become effective. Such cards will be transmitted to the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative by a letter of transmittal, signed by an authorized officer of the Union and listing thereon the name, unit, and employee number.
e.	If an employee's earnings for the first payroll week of a calendar month are insufficient to permit the full deduction, then the deduction will be taken from the employee's earnings in the first, second, third, or fourth payroll weeks in which his earnings are sufficient. The Union will be provided with weekly catch-up reports and a check representing said deductions.
f.	Monthly union dues will be deducted from vacation checks.
g.	A check in the total amount of the sum deducted on account of dues will be drawn each month to the order of Local 848, International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW, and will be hand-delivered to the financial secretary thereof.
h.	A statement of the total Union dues deducted will be included on the employee’s annual W-2.
i.	The Company will forward to the Union each month in employee number order the following information:
(1)	The names and employee numbers of employees who authorized deduction of Union dues and from whose wages such deductions have been made during the current month.
(2)	The names and employee numbers of employees who authorized the deduction of Union dues and from whose wages no such deduction was made because of insufficient earnings during the pay period for which the deduction was authorized.
(3)	A list of all employees, including base rate and COLA, if any, identifying those employees who have not submitted to the Company an authorization for checkoff of dues.
(4)	The names and employee numbers of employees who authorized such deductions but whose authorization became ineffective pursuant to
76
XV
Article XV, Section 1.b, by reason of the termination of their employment or their transfer or layoff. .
The Company will furnish the Union monthly an alphabetical list of all employees and their employee numbers identifying Union members.
k.	The monthly Union dues provided for herein will be deducted from the authorizing employee's earnings for the first payroll week of the calendar month. However, if an employee's earnings for the first payroll week of a calendar month are insufficient to permit the full deduction, then the deduction will be taken from the employee's earnings in the first of the second, third or fourth payroll weeks in which his earnings are sufficient. Monthly Union dues deductions will not exceed the dues amount as set by the Union. Further, the Company will not be required to make a double deduction from an employee's subsequent monthly earnings if his weekly earnings in each of his preceding month's first four (4) payroll weeks were insufficient to permit a deduction.
I.	The maximum monthly deduction provided for herein is the amount of the Union dues for one (1) calendar month, except in instances where an employee owes Union dues arrears. In the event an employee is in arrears on Union dues, the Company may deduct regular monthly dues plus one (1) additional deduction per week until such time as the arrears are exhausted.
m.	The interpretation and application of "date of delivery" as it appears in the authorization form referenced in Article XV, Section 1, and which is shown in Article XV, Section 3, will be:
"Date of Delivery" -- the date of delivery will be the date the Company actually receives the authorization for checkoff of Union dues, as evidenced by the date and time stamped on each card by a date and time-recording machine.
n. The Company will furnish the Union, during regular business hours Monday through Friday, access to union dues history data via on-line computer terminal located in the Local 848 business office.
o.	The Company will furnish the Union, during regular business hours Monday through Friday, access to Union members' employment history data via on-line computer terminal located in the Local 848 business office.
p.	The Company will provide the Union with a weekly computer file of any regular union dues or arrears it may have taken in that week's payroll processing.
q.	The Company will provide the Union monthly with a clock number listing of any employees that had regular union dues taken on dues night and did not subsequently work forty (40) hours during the dues period.
r.	The Company's agreement to furnish to the Union certain dues information contained above will not automatically cease on any termination of this Agreement, but will terminate ninety (90) days after notice to the Union by certified mail from the date as set forth under Article XX, Section 1 .b.

ARTICLE XVI
OFF-SITE OPERATIONS
Section 1.	Definition of Off-Site
“Off-site” will mean the performance of work by covered employees at places geographically located at such distances from the Company’s Dallas or Grand Prairie, Texas, facilities that the distance requires an employee to obtain lodging other than at his established residence. It will also contemplate the eventual return of such employees back to the Company’s Grand Prairie, Texas, operations. “Off-site” will not include a new establishment set up by the Company or the relocated operations of a major segment of the Company’s present organization (such as one of its divisions) regardless of where the new establishment or the relocated division may be geographically situated.
Section 2.	Application of the Agreement
a.	The Company and the Union recognize that these and other conditions on the Company’s off-site operations do not make it possible to apply all parts and sections of this Agreement to employees assigned to off-site locations. Therefore, it is agreed that the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW, and its Local 848, will represent collective bargaining unit employees assigned to off-site operations on:
(1)	Wages (basic rate structure)
(2)	Discipline and discharge
(3)	Working conditions
b.	However, the Company agrees to apply to covered employees assigned to its offsite operations all articles, sections, and other parts of the Agreement between the Parties except the following:
Article III	- Recognition
Article IV	- Representation, Duties and Responsibilities
Article V	- Grievance, Arbitration and Discharge Procedures

d.	Employees assigned to an offsite assignment will be paid the maximum hourly rate of their labor grade, including applicable travel time as outlined in Article VI, Section 8.
Section 3.	Rules of Cognizant Agency
Off-site locations are normally under the cognizance of a military or a government civilian agency charged with an interest in the development or modification of a Company product at its locations. Because of this, employees assigned to such off-site locations are subject to rules and regulations of the agency having cognizance over the location and frequently must work at times and places and under conditions the cognizant agency dictates or controls.
Section 4.	Lists Required
Lists of those employees going off-site and those returning from off-site locations will be given to the Chairperson of the plant grievance committee.
Section 5.	Grievance Procedure
a.	An employee at an off-site operation who feels that he has a complaint involving one (1) of the three (3) categories given in Article XVI, Section 2.a, with respect to an application or interpretation of the Agreement, excluding the articles and sections listed in Article XVI, Section 2.b, or with respect to the provisions of this article, will write a letter of complaint to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. The Chairman of the plant Grievance Committee will investigate the complaint, and if he believes the complaint has merit, he will introduce the complaint as a written grievance at the third step of the grievance procedure.
b.	Disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the provisions of the articles and sections of the Agreement made applicable to off-site locations by Article XVI, Section 2, and of the provisions of this article will be subject to impartial arbitration. Recognizing that the normal procedures cannot practically be applied to off-site facilities, investigation time on such cases will be limited to normal in-plant investigation. The Company agrees to release witnesses called by
80
XVI
the arbitrator or the Union only if they are not assigned to off-site operations, and investigations by the arbitrator will be limited so as to exclude off-site facilities.
c.	Notwithstanding any of Article XVI, Section 5, the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee may discuss any complaint received in writing from an off-site employee with the Director of Labor Relations or his designated representative.
Section 6.	Application of Checkoff
Employees in the collective bargaining unit who are on the checkoff list when transferred to an off-site operation, or who subsequently authorize deductions, will have their deductions continued while at an off-site operation of the Company, subject to the conditions of the checkoff authorization signed by the employee.
Section 7.	Policies and Practices
The Company agrees to continue, if allowed by the cognizant contractor, its past policies and practices with respect to wage rates and other expense reimbursements allowed employees assigned to an off-site operation.
Section 8.	Assignment to Off-Site Locations
Triumph Aerostructures - Vought Aircraft Division and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW and its Local Union 848 hereby agree that employees in the collective bargaining unit may be assigned to off-site operations as required and in accordance with past practice followed by the Company and UAW Local 848, subject, however, to the following:

If a covered employee is assigned to an off-site operation and a layoff is called within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the off-site assignment, and the employee would have been affected if he had not been off-site, the employee is subject to the layoff procedure. After exhausting all rights as set forth under Article VII, the employee will be laid off and placed on the recall list as of that date.
b.	If a covered employee is assigned to an off-site operation, and a layoff is called after thirty (30) days of the effective date of the off-site assignment, and the employee would have been affected if he had not been off-site, the Company will return the employee within sixty (60) days for the purpose of layoff. After exhausting all rights as set forth under Article VII, the employee will be laid off and placed on the recall list as of the date the assignment is completed.
c.	If a covered employee assigned to an off-site operation is subsequently assigned to another operation and a layoff is called within thirty (30) days of the reassignment and the employee would have been affected if he had not been offsite, the employee is subject to the terms of Article XVI, Section 8.a.
81
XVI
d.	If a covered employee assigned to an off-site operation has the seniority to hold, he may be assigned to other off-site operations or returned to the plant as necessary.

ARTICLE XVII SUBCONTRACTING AND MAJOR MAINTENANCE OR FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION WORK
Section 1.	Notice
a.	The Company agrees, whenever reasonable and practicable, to use its maintenance employees to perform major maintenance work and facilities construction work. Due consideration will be given to employees on the layoff list in performing these tasks. The company may sub contract janitorial services only if there are no Job Code 5173-09 (Custodians) or 5174-010 (Janitors) of Job Family 5140 employees on layoff status.
b.	The Director of Facilities/Maintenance or his designated representative will meet with the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, or his designee, and respective committeeman to discuss the subcontracting/potential subcontracting of major maintenance or facilities construction work on a weekly basis. The Union representatives will be advised by the Company of the time and place of such meeting. Both Parties agree that this arrangement does not give the Union or any arbitrator the power to veto or modify the Company's right to subcontract major maintenance and facilities construction work, nor will it prohibit the Union's right to file and process a grievance, in accordance with Article V of this Agreement.
c.	The Company agrees, after it has subcontracted out major maintenance and facilities construction work, to advise the Union of such action on a weekly basis.
d.	At such weekly meeting, Union representatives may ask questions or make comments concerning the reviewed work, as well as make suggestions on how the Company might otherwise consider the accomplishment of said work.
Section 2.	Use of Maintenance Employees
a. It was agreed during the 1962 contract negotiations that under the provisions of Article XVII, Section 1, it will be deemed reasonable and practicable to use maintenance employees in lieu of subcontracting maintenance and facilities construction work when the following conditions exist:

(2)	The Company has the specialized equipment required or readily available to perform the operation
(3)	No economies can be realized.

overtime will be applicable in those instances where a contract could be completed by bargaining unit employees without impacting the daily workload by utilizing a fifty six (56) hour workweek and also in those instances where contractors are working on a short run contract during hours which are defined as weekend overtime hours for a Maintenance employee. The application of Item 4 will involve only those classifications of Maintenance employees identified in sub-section (7) below which could by application cover those jobs being performed by employees of contractors.
(5)	The work being subcontracted is not in accordance with past practices of the Company
(6)	The use of maintenance employees is not contrary to the control requirements of the cognizant military or government civilian agency
(7)	If there are employees on layoff classified as utility operators, facilities construction craftsman, millwrights, laborers, sheet metal mechanics, and/or machine repair mechanics, and the Company lets a contract calling for more than forty-five (45) days of continuous work of the above crafts, the Company agrees to recall the same number of employees in each craft as used by the contractor and retain them until the job is completed. Employee(s) refusing short term recalls per this article will be bypassed for said recall, however their contractual recall period as specified in Article VII Section 11. d. will remain in tact. The more than forty-five (45) days of work is applied only to the single contract.
Section 3.	Attachment to Article XVII

(1)	Every employee has the right, responsibility and obligation to report any hazard that they believe may cause a serious injury, illness or fatality. In addition, every employee has the right and the responsibility to report any Environmental, Safety, Health and Medical rules infractions and/or conditions of non-compliance with regulatory standards.
(2)	The employee should report any ES&H issues through his/her area immediate supervision. If the employee is not satisfied that the issue is receiving appropriate attention by area management to resolve, then the employee has the right to elevate the concern to their respective union representative(s).
e.	Right of Refusal or “Stop Work”
(1)	No employee will be discharged for refusing to perform work on the job if their refusal is based on the claim that the job involves a dangerous condition that would unduly endanger his health or cause a serious injury, and/or a willful violation of an environmental, safety and health law.
(2)	In cases where the employee believes that a dangerous condition exists and/or where a willful intent to violate an environmental, safety and health law is about to occur, the employee should inform their immediate supervisor.
(3)	Work will not continue, until affected management, the union Chairperson(s) and an Environmental, Safety and Health professional makes the final determination concerning the safety of the individual and the work to be preformed. In areas where a final consensus is not reached, ES&H department under guidance from legal counsel will make the final determination.
(4)	If the employee is not satisfied with the final determination the employee may dispute the decision through the standard grievance procedures set forth in this agreement. The employee will not be discharged for refusing to work on the particular job involved during the time the grievance is being processed. Time lost by the employee while such determinations are being made, will not be paid for by the company.

f.	Employee Negligence and Unsafe Acts
(1)	The union and company agree that providing a safe and healthful work place for all employees and maintaining high standards of environmental, safety and health compliance is a top business priority. The objective of both parties shall be to aggressively promote and enforce ES&H rules.
(2)	The union and company agree that willful negligence and/or failure by an employee to obey company ES&H rules and use of safety devices or equipment provided by the company for employee protection is just cause for disciplinary action. However, if the employee believes that disciplinary action is unjust, he/she has the right of appeal as provided for in the grievance procedure
Section 3.	Union Bulletin Boards
The Company will furnish bulletin boards in conspicuous places to be used solely for the posting of Union notices, rules, regulations and such other notices as may be mutually agreed upon. Before posting, all notices must be approved by the Director of Labor Relations or his designee. The Union will notify the Company in writing of the name of the Union representative who is authorized to sign such notices. Notices will be posted by the union stewards as provided under Article IV, Section 6a(5).
Section 4.	Nondiscrimination
a.	There will be no intimidation, coercion or discrimination in any way by the Company or its agents or by the Union, its representatives or members against any employee because he is or is not a member of the Union. There will be no solicitation of employees for Union membership or dues conducted upon the premises of the Company during working hours by the Union, its representatives or by employees.
b.	There will be no discrimination, coercion or intimidation by the Company or its agents or by the Union, its representatives or members against any employee because of race, creed, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, including disabled veterans or Vietnam era veterans, or any other reason prohibited by law. Sexual harassment is an insidious form of sex discrimination and it is prohibited. Sexual harassment is defined as unsolicited and unwelcome sexual overtures or conduct, verbal or physical, that threaten the employment relationship, which includes conditions of employment and personnel decisions, or creates a hostile, intimidating or offensive work environment.

Section 5.	Physical Restrictions
a.
(1)	An employee in Section 900 or returning from layoff who reports to the plant Medical Department with the intent of returning to work and is unable to meet the physical requirements of the job assigned, will be offered an opportunity to speak with Union representation prior to being sent home. Should the employee choose not to have Union representation, he will sign a letter to that effect and the Chairman will receive a copy of said refusal of representation.
(2)	An employee returning from Section 900, who cannot perform his job because of physical restrictions, will displace a less senior employee on another job of equal or lower labor grade within his job family that he can perform with his physical restrictions. If the physically restricted employee goes to a lower labor grade as a result of a permanent physical restriction, he will not retain rights to the higher labor grade. The Company will have seven (7) workdays to place the restricted employee. Those employees who are placed in an out-of-plant layoff status as result of being displaced, as stated above, will be laid off immediately and the Company will not be required to give notice to the Union as set forth in Article VIL
b.	If an employee who is physically disabled as a result of sustaining injury either at work or outside of work cannot be placed under Article XIX, Section 5.a, he will be given such other suitable employment as may then be available.
c.	When a dispute arises between the Company and the Union as to whether suitable work is available that such employee can perform consistent with the employee’s physical restrictions, the Union shall have the right, upon the request of the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, to request a meeting with labor relations, applicable management, and a medical services representative to address the dispute. Upon such request, a meeting shall be promptly scheduled. When a dispute arises as a result of the Company’s authorized physician’s diagnosis that an employee is not capable of returning to work, the Company and the Union agree to refer the employee to a specialist in the field for which the medical dispute exists for a functional capacity evaluation. The Company and the Union will examine the particular job to be performed to determine the physical requirements. These findings will be jointly furnished to the medical specialist to determine if the employee can perform the physical requirements of the job. The medical specialist will make whatever physical examination necessary, and the decision will be final and binding upon the employee, the Union and the Company. The medical specialist will have no power to add to, or subtract from, or modify in any way any of the terms of this agreement. The medical specialist shall be chosen from a Texas Workers Compensation Commission (TWCC) list of certified doctors, exclusive of any Company authorized physicians.
d.	The Parties recognize that modifications to the Collective Bargaining Agreement or existing practices may be required to fulfill the obligations required by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If such modifications or changes in
90
XIX
practices are needed, the Parties will jointly implement such modifications or changes necessary to comply with the ADA.
Section 6.	Absence for Union Business
Union members will be given permission to be absent from or to leave the plant on bona fide Union business upon request of the President of the local Union, providing that:
a.	Twenty-four (24) hours' advance notice has been given to the Director of Labor Relations or his designee
b.	The total number for which permission is requested to be absent from the plant on any one (1) day will not exceed twenty-five (25) and not more than two (2) of these are from any one (1) steward's district, except in those instances where an employee is elected as an official delegate to an International UAW convention, or to a function sponsored by or under the auspices of the UAW.
Such time spent by employees out of the plant will not be paid for by the Company.
Section 7.	Security Provisions
Nothing contained in this Agreement will in any way limit the right of the Company to discharge any employee in order to comply with its obligations to the government under any security agreement, under any security provisions of its government contracts, or under any law, regulation or direction of the government. The Company will notify the Union prior to or immediately following such a discharge and, if permitted, will disclose to the Union the reason or basis for its action.
Section 8.	Education Reimbursement Plan
Bargaining unit employees will have the opportunity to participate in the same tuition reimbursement program offered to non-represented employees at the Company’s Dallas locations as stated in Vought Work Instruction 1.8.011 dated March 1, 2010 for the life of the instant agreement.
Section 9.	Security and Access
a.	Since the Company has mandated security obligations in its contracts with certain other companies and/or government agencies pertaining to security access, nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to place the Company in violation of said security agreements. Therefore, the Company is not required to employ, continue in its employment, assign to or give access to any employee
91
XIX
not approved for access by the aforementioned other Company or government agency.
b.	Where it is practical and reasonable, the Company will follow the principle of seniority in determining employees to be submitted for access clearances by the appropriate other Company and/or government agency. It is recognized that other non-secured, non-accessed programs must operate efficiently, and where possible avoid disruption. Therefore, it may not be practical and reasonable to submit candidates by seniority. The Company's intent will be to follow the principle of seniority. However, should this not be practical and reasonable, the Company will discuss the matter with the appropriate committeeman(s) and the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. The Company will have no liability should it be determined that a more senior employee(s) has to be laid off while retaining a less senior employee(s) because of security requirements imposed by other companies and/or government agencies.
c.	Promotional opportunities within an access area will be filled in accordance with the contract provisions of Article VII, Section 5, Promotions. Access clearance will not be a considered factor in identification of an individual for promotion. An employee's promotion and assignment to work a job requiring security access depends upon such employee chosen for the promotion submitting access paperwork and obtaining the necessary security access from the cognizant agency in a timely manner.
d.	In a job classification requiring the assignment of a small number of employees to work full time in a security access program, the Company will request bidding employees to submit themselves for the necessary clearance in seniority order, beginning with the most senior first and so on. An employee's promotion and assignment to work a job requiring security access depends upon such employee submitting access paperwork and obtaining the necessary security access from the cognizant agency in a timely manner.
Section 10.	Masculine - Feminine References
In construing and interpreting the language of this Agreement, reference to the masculine, such as “he”, “him”, and “his”, shall include reference to the feminine.
Section 11.	Tobacco Free Facilities
Effective July 1, 2008, the use of tobacco products will be prohibited on Company property. This “Tobacco-Free” environment will prohibit smoking or tobacco use on the premises, including parking lots, walkways and Company and employee vehicles.

Section 2.

Disability Benefits - Impartial Physician
In those cases in which the insurance company exercises its option to have its physician examine an employee, the insurance company has the right for the examination to be conducted in Dallas, Texas. If the insurance company exercises the right subsequent to 52 weeks following the individual's last day at work, the Parties agree that the Company will pay mileage at the rate of $.400 per mile (both ways) as determined by Rand McNally from the individual's place of domicile to Dallas, Texas. No mileage will be paid if the domicile is less than 100 miles (one way) from Dallas, Texas. If the place of domicile is 200 miles or more (one way), the individual will be paid an additional $100 lodging allowance. The Company will increase the travel allowance, if necessary, in accordance with the current applicable Company travel rate.
If, as a result of such examination, the employee is not receiving short term disability benefits or Extended Disability Benefits (EDB) and a dispute exists as to the employee's entitlement to short-term disability benefits or EDB, it is agreed as follows:
1.	That a physician will be selected in accordance with the procedure for selection of Medical Arbitrators in Article V, Section 8.p. of the Agreement between the Parties.
2.	That the affected employee who is under the regular care and attendance of a physician will be referred to the physician selected under paragraph 1. who will determine whether, if the case involves short-term disability benefits, the employee is wholly and continuously disabled and prevented from engaging in his occupation or, if the case involves EDB, whether the employee has a physical or mental condition which totally prevents him from engaging in any gainful employment.
3.	That in the case of short-term disability benefits, if the employee is to be wholly and continuously disabled and prevented from engaging in his occupation and is and has been otherwise under the regular care and attendance of a physician, short-term disability benefits will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the disability insurance plan under which the claim arose, including short-term disability benefits not paid because of the adverse determination of the insurance
102
4
company’s physician; that in the case of EDB, if the employee is found to have a physical or mental condition which totally prevents him from engaging in any gainful employment, EDB will be payable in accordance with the provisions of the disability insurance plan under which the claim arose, including EDB not paid because of the adverse determination of the insurance company's physician.
4.	That the physician selected under paragraph 1. of this Letter of Agreement may request from an affected employee's physician or the insurance company's physician such of the employee's medical records as he deems useful to his determination.
5.	That the decision of the physician selected under paragraph 1. of this Letter of Agreement will be final and binding on the Parties.
6.	That the charges of the physician selected under paragraph 1. of this Letter of Agreement will be borne equally by the Parties.
7.	Provided, however, that this procedure will not be applicable and EDB will not be denied as a result of the insurance company's physician's examination where the Social Security Administration considers the employee eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits and the Company considers the employee to have a physical or mental condition which totally prevents him from engaging in any gainful employment.

Letter of Agreement 5
Carveout Procedure for Disability Benefits
This letter amends the original letter dated 10 August 1970 and reaffirmed 23 June 1988 to incorporate the offset procedure for Impairment Income Benefits if the employee has returned to work.
The Parties have agreed to a procedure for offsetting short-term disability benefits and Extended Disability Benefits (EDB) payable under the disability income plan now in effect between the Parties.
This procedure will be referred to hereinafter as the "offset procedure".
The disability income plan provides for certain levels of benefits under the short term disability plan and EDB. This plan also provides for the inclusion of benefits payable from such sources as Social Security, Workers' Compensation, or similar government benefits, and retirement benefits to maintain the appropriate level of benefits.
OFFSET PROCEDURES
Short Term Disability
The following sources of benefits will be "offset" from short term disability benefits:
1.	Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (SS-DIB)
The weekly equivalent of the Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit payments, to which an employee may be entitled for the same period for which he is receiving shortterm disability benefits will be deducted from short-term disability benefits. For this reduction, the weekly equivalent of a monthly SS-DIB benefit will be considered equal to the monthly SS-DIB amount divided by 4.333.
The offset procedure will be applicable only to the primary SS-DIB to which the employee is or may be entitled. No reduction in short-term disability benefits will be made because of SS-DIB which may be paid or payable to entitled dependents of the employee. However, if an employee's age is too great to allow him to apply for SS-DIB, any amount payable from Old Age Social Security will be deducted. The reduction will cease when the Company has received one SS-DIB denial.

2.	Workers' Compensation
Short-term disability benefits will also be reduced by periodic Worker’s Compensation benefits paid or payable to the employee for any injury for the same period for which the employee is receiving short-term disability benefits. For lump sum settlements, the reduction will be calculated using the method agreed to by the Parties in the retirement plan. However, if the employee has returned to work and receives Impairment Income Benefits, either weekly or lump sum, there will be no offset from shortterm disability benefits.
Extended Disability Benefits (EDB)
The following sources of benefits will be "offset" from EDB:
1.	Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (SS-DIB)
The weekly equivalent of the Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit payments, to which an employee may be entitled for the same period for which he is receiving EDB will be deducted from EDB. For this reduction, the weekly equivalent of a monthly SS-DIB benefit will be considered equal to the monthly SS-DIB amount divided by 4.333.
The offset procedure will be applicable only to the primary SS-DIB to which the employee is or may be entitled. No reduction in EDB will be made because of SS-DIB which may be paid or payable to entitled dependents of the employee. However, if an employee's age is too great to allow him to apply for SS-DIB, any amount payable from Old Age Social Security will be deducted. No SS-DIB offset will be taken if two denials have been received by the Company.
2.	Workers' Compensation
EDB will also be reduced by periodic Worker's Compensation benefits paid or payable to the employee for any injury for the same period for which the employee is receiving EDB. For lump sum settlements, the reduction will be calculated using the method agreed to by the Parties in the retirement plan. However, if the employee has returned to work and receives Impairment Income Benefits, either weekly or lump sum, there will be no offset from EDB.
3.	Disability Retirement Benefits
EDB will also be offset by any benefits paid or payable under the Company's disability retirement plan, unless such benefits have been denied.
105
5
The offset procedure will be applicable to disabilities which commence on or after January 1, 1970.
There will be no integration of sick pay and short term disability benefits under the offset procedure.
The provisions, conditions and application of the disability income plan will be unaltered by this Letter of Agreement except to the extent, if any, they must be modified to implement the offset procedure.
The Company will inform affected employees of the provisions of this Letter of Agreement in a timely manner as set forth in this letter.
It is agreed that the Company may make changes in the offset procedure (including the changes in the presumed SS-DIB amount) made applicable by changes in the law governing Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits.
Step 1. Letter SS-1
Letter SS-1 is sent to the employee during the eighth week of disability. Included with the letter is an "Authorization to Secure Award or Denial Information".
Letter SS-1 advises the employee to:
1.	File a claim for SS-DIB, and
2.	Sign and submit the authorization form to the local Social Security District Office.
A copy of the award or denial should be received by the Company (per Authorization Form) by the seventh month of disability. If notice of a denial is received, no short-term disability reduction is made. If notice of an award is received, reduction of short-term disability is made.* If no notice has been received, short-term disability benefits will be reduced by the estimated SS-DIB amount.**
*	Where an SS-DIB award is received, the reduction in short-term disability payments is made in the employee's short-term disability check for the first full week of the seventh full calendar month of disability.
For example: If the employee became disabled on January 15, the first reduction would be from the short-term disability check for the first week of August.
However, since short-term disability reductions are effective with the sixth full calendar month of disability, an additional amount is deducted until the SS-DIB
106
5
amount for the sixth month, or retroactive to the effective date of the award, has been held out.
*	* If the employee's SS-DIB claim has not yet been determined, or it appears an entitled employee has not filed a claim or has not provided the required medical evidence, or if the employee has been totally or partially disqualified for SS-DIB because of delayed filing, lack of treatment, or refusal without good cause to accept vocational rehabilitation training, weekly short-term disability benefits are nonetheless reduced, as in the example above (including the additional amount for the sixth month of disability), except the base weekly reduction is on a presumed SS-DIB amount, subject to changes in the law governing Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits.
The current amount of reduction for disabilities commencing on or after January 1, 2004, is $229 per week. The additional amount deducted to recover the sixth month overpayment is $50.
Step 2. Letter SS-2
Letter SS-2 is sent to the employee during the first full week of the seventh calendar month of disability.
It is written one of two ways. It tells the employee either:
1.	The notice of an SS-DIB award was received and short-term disability will be reduced, or
2.	That no notice was received and the presumed SS-DIB amount will be deducted.
Step 3. (Where Step 2 is not applicable) Letter SS-3
If it appears to the Company that the employee is not entitled to SS-DIB benefits (but no determination has been received) letter SS-3 is sent to the employee during the first week of the seventh month of disability.
Letter SS-3 informs the employee that no reduction in short-term disability benefits will be made presently. However, the employee is advised to immediately file a claim for SS-DIB if not already done, because if no determination of claim is received, short-term disability benefits will be reduced in accordance with the following paragraph.
Where neither award nor denial (per Authorization form) nor "Certificate of Social Insurance Award or Denial" (Social Security document) is received by the time unreduced short-term	disability
107
5
payments have been made for 39 weeks, the presumed reduction begins with the shortterm disability check for the 40th week of disability. However, since only 13 weeks of short-term disability benefits are now available to recoup presumed SS-DIB for 26 weeks (six months), the total presumed SS-DIB is deducted during the last 13 weeks of shortterm disability.
Step 4. Letter EDB-1
Letter EDB-1 is sent to the employee during the 39th week of disability. The letter advises the employee to make application for EDB, and, if applicable, for disability retirement benefits and continuation of life insurance.
Step 5.
Situations may arise where adjustments must be made from an employee's disability benefits. Letters SS-4 and SS-5 are samples of letters to cover such situations.
Letter SS-4: To be sent after receipt of notification of SS-DIB award (overpayment or underpayment).
Letter SS-5: To be sent after receipt of notification of denial of SS-DIB or after the maximum benefit period.
This Letter of Agreement will remain in effect for the duration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Parties unless otherwise mutually agreed.

Insurance Dependents After Retirement
This Letter of Agreement replaces the original letter dated 15 December 1972 and reaffirmed 23 June 1988.
The Company and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, UAW, and its Local Union 848, agree as follows:
1.	At the time an employee receives the retirement exit interview, a description of the current health care rules and provisions regarding coverage for themselves, as well as their dependents, will be explained in detail. Employees will be required to provide the Company with satisfactory evidence that the dependents listed to be covered with health care after retirement meet the eligibility requirements on the date of retirement.
2.	In the event that the retiring employee's spouse is an employee of the Company on the date of the retiring employee's retirement, and is eligible for health care in his or her own right, the retiring employee may list that spouse as a future eligible dependent. However, the spouse will retain active employee health care coverage so long as a covered employee. In the event that spouse loses coverage in their own right at any time subsequent to the retiring employee's retirement date, retiree health care coverage will be extended to that spouse.
3.	Under no other circumstances will any dependents acquired subsequent to the retirement effective date be eligible for health care coverage, regardless of the relationship to the retiree.

Letter of Agreement 13 Alternative Work Schedules (AWS)
Pursuant to Article VI, Section 4, the Company may establish alternative work schedules of 4 ten-hour shifts and 3 twelve-hour shifts. Such shifts will not exceed 25% of the total UAW represented employee population. This letter of agreement outlines the provisions for the alternative work schedules referenced in Article VI, Section 4.
Schedules
Monday - Thursday Schedule -10 hour work days 1st Shift - 7:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
2nd Shift - 5:30 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.
Friday - Sunday Schedule - 12 hour work days 1st Shift - 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.
2nd Shift - 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
Alternative work schedules may be utilized in areas in which capital investment in new equipment dictates the use of such schedules for maximum efficiency. Examples of these areas include High Speed Gantries, Stringer Mills, Makino MAG 3, Makino A99, the Brotje, and such other opportunities as may be identified in the future. Prior to establishing an alternative work schedule in any such areas, the Union will be given advance notice. Upon request of the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, the Company will meet and confer with the Union in good faith to demonstrate the basis of the Company’s belief that the establishment of an alternative work schedule will support the capital investment in such new equipment.
Staffing
•	Where management designates an area for an alternative work schedule, volunteers will be solicited from the required job family through a “pre-bid” selfnomination process. If there are more volunteers than openings, final selection will be based on seniority within the designated job family.
•	In the unlikely event that such requests results in an insufficient number of volunteers, employees will be assigned on an involuntary basis, in reverse seniority order, to an alternative work schedule. Prior to assigning employees on an involuntary basis, the Company will notify the Union and, upon request, meet with the Union to confer in good faith the best means of meeting the staffing requirements.
•	Once designated, agreed-to shift preference areas will include alternative schedules. For example, a more senior employee assigned to 1st shift on
118
13
Monday - Thursday schedule may bump a less senior employee on 1st shift of the Friday - Sunday schedule provided they are in the same shift preference area.
PREMIUM HOURS
Employees assigned to the Monday - Thursday schedule (40 scheduled hours) will be paid a premium of 5 additional hours of straight time pay.
Employees assigned to the Friday - Sunday schedule (36 scheduled hours) will be paid a premium of 9 additional hours of straight time pay.
The provisions of Article VII, Section 5 (Shift Differential) will apply to the second shifts of each special schedule.
Overtime
For Monday - Thursday schedule, overtime will be paid at time and one half for hours worked in excess of the normal scheduled 10 hour shift and for hours worked on the Friday. Hours worked on Saturday and/or Sunday will be paid at double time.
For Friday - Sunday schedule, overtime will be paid at time and one half for hours worked in excess of the normal scheduled 12 hour shift and for hours worked on the Monday and Tuesday. Hours worked on Wednesday and Thursday will be paid at double time.
Holiday Pay
Article X, Section 2. a.(1) & (2) will apply.
For Holidays that fall on a regular scheduled workday of a Monday - Thursday schedule, an employee assigned to a Monday - Thursday schedule will receive 10 hours of holiday pay.
For Holidays that fall on a regular scheduled workday of a Friday - Sunday schedule, an employee assigned to a Friday - Sunday schedule will receive 12 hours holiday pay.
In the event a Company observed holiday falls on an employee’s regularly scheduled day off, the employee will receive 8 hours holiday pay.
Work performed on a holiday will be compensated at double time. Lunches I Rest Periods
Employees assigned to a Monday - Thursday schedule will have one (1) 30-minute lunch and two (2) paid ten-minute breaks
Employees assigned to a Friday - Sunday schedule will have one (1) 30-minute paid lunch and three (3) paid ten-minute breaks
Vacation/Sick Hours
Monday - Thursday scheduled employees will be paid and charged 10 hours for a vacation day.

Letter of Agreement 15 Care 90s Retiree Cost
This letter reaffirms the letter dated 28 March 1996
Retiree medical costs under Care 90s cannot be calculated based on actual experience since Care 90s is not currently offered to retirees. The Parties recognize this fact and understand as well that it is not a sound insurance practice to set the health care insurance premium rate using exclusively the experience of a group with substantially less than 1,000 covered individuals. This Letter of Agreement is written to outline the procedure to be used for future cost calculations. In the year following the year in which the average lives covered by Care 90s reaches 1,000 retirees, insurance costs will be based on actual costs for the group and reasonable trend projections based on actual experience.
The monthly cost for calendar year 1995 or later will be the lesser of:
(1)	The prior year's monthly cost increased by the percentage increase in the health care component of the CPI-W plus two percentage points or
(2)	Actual experience for the latest available 12-month period, increased by the trend factor compounded from the midpoint of the experience period to the midpoint of the following calendar year.
The percentage increase in the health care component of the CPI-W plus 2 percentage points will be used in place of the trend factor until the covered group reaches 1,000 lives.
Beginning with the plan year commencing on January 1,2010, the monthly cost for the Essentials plan will be determined per (1) and (2) above.
The pre-65 Premium Plan has a contribution rate equal to the pre-65 Essentials plan contribution rate PLUS 100% of the excess in plan cost per participant, if any, over the pre-65 Essentials plan.
The calculations will be provided to the UAW for review during the month of November each year and will utilize the latest 12 months' claim experience available when the calculation is made. The health care component of the CPI-W change will utilize the same period of time, however, should the CPI-W data not be available, the latest 12 months' available data will be used.
It is understood that claims data for all retirees and dependents covered under the Care 90s program will be used whether or not such retirees are represented by the UAW.
122
15
The numerator to be used when calculating the monthly cost will be the claims for all Care 90s retirees and dependents enrolled in the Essentials plan. The denominator to be used when calculating the monthly cost will include enrolled in the Essentials plan each retiree as one unit and all dependents of a retiree as one unit.
The experience for retirees and families will be added together for cost calculation purposes and the amount of cost charged for the retirees will be the same as the additional amount charged for the family.
The above method outlined to calculate Care 90s retiree cost will also be used to determine the cost for company contribution maximum purposes. It is further agreed that the $7,800 company contribution maximum will be subject to collective bargaining at the expiration of this 3-year Agreement for all affected retirees who retired from the bargaining unit.

Dear Russell:
The purpose of the letter is to clarify the terms of Letter of Agreement No. 17 regarding the cost of retiree medical coverage for bargaining unit employees.
The parties agree that, for the purposes of Article XII, section 3.b, the cost of retiree medical coverage shall be calculated based upon the per capita claims cost for the most recent twelve-month period projected to the mid-point of the contribution period based on the lesser of:
(i)	the percentage increase in the CPI-W plus two percentage points; or
(ii)	the best estimate of actual trend
The remaining provisions of Letter of Agreement No. 17, not inconsistent with the above, shall continue to apply.

Return to Work
An employee returning from Section 900 must report back to work through the Company's Medical Department. The Medical Department will review the release from the employee's attending physician and will determine what restrictions, if any, the employee has. If there are restrictions placed on the employee, Medical will contact the employee's immediate supervisor or designated operations management to determine if the employee can be accepted with the restrictions.
When an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his job classification due to temporary medical restrictions, the employee may be assigned to other tasks outside his job family within the restrictions of the employee’s functional capacity record for up to ninety (90) calendar days in a calendar year. In job families affected by layoff, a limit of sixty (60) calendar days per calendar year will apply and the employees placed will not exceed the number of employees on layoff in the job family. In determining other available jobs the parties shall first examine work within the employees job family, then jobs within job families for which the employee has established bump rights under Article VII, section 1.c.(1)(a) and then any other assignments the employee is capable of performing. The Company will make every effort to place the employee on his respective shift. Should it be necessary to move an employee between shifts, the move will be reviewed every ten (10) days for alternate placement or to place a less senior employee on restrictions in that position. The functions assigned will not be limited to duties covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Temporary medical assignments will not establish Article VII, section 1.c.(1)(a) rights. Employees performing such temporary medical assignments are not eligible for overtime.
The Union will be provided a weekly list (by Name, Clock Number, Unit, Shift, and duties assigned) of employees assigned to such temporary medical assignments. Any concerns of placement will be immediately addressed upon request of the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee. If, in the opinion of the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee, a single Job Family (affected by layoff) has been disproportionately affected by placements, there will be a 30 day moratorium on additional placements in that Job Family. During such moratorium, the parties will meet to attempt to resolve issue in question.
In the event a job is located that meets the employee’s medical restrictions and the returning employee refuses to accept the job, the employee will be immediately removed from Section 900 and will be deemed as having voluntarily terminated his employment.
125
16
In the event a job cannot be found to accommodate the employee's restrictions, the employee will be retained in Section 900 until he returns to work or eligible benefits are exhausted, whichever occurs first.
If while in Section 900, an employee engages in other employment, that employee will be immediately removed from Section 900, and will be deemed as having voluntarily terminated his employment.

Letter of Agreement 17
Provisions for Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) Leave
Under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended (FMLA), employees may be eligible for a period of job-protected unpaid leave if they meet the criteria set forth in the FMLA in effect at the time the leave is requested.
General Eligibility
To qualify for FMLA Leave, an employee must be an employee of the Company, must have worked at the Company for at least twelve (12) months, must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the past twelve (12) months, and must at a location where the Company employees at least fifty (50) employees within seventy-five (75) miles.
Types and Duration of FMLA Leave
• Basic FMLA Leave and Qualifying Exigency Leave
An employee may be eligible for up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid FMLA leave in a rolling backward twelve (12) month period for any or a combination of the following reasons:
1.	the birth of a child and to care for such child or placement for adoption or foster care of a child within twelve (12) months following birth or placement of the child;
2.	to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child under 18 years old or 18 and over that is incapable of self-care, or parent) with a serious health condition;
3.	because of a serious health condition which renders the employee unable to work; or
4.	because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son (of any age), daughter (of any age) or parent, defined as a covered military member, (a) is on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty); or (b) is in the National Guard or reserves or is a retired member of the Armed Forces or reserves and has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty in support of a covered contingency operation; or
•	Military Caregiver Leave
An employee also may take Military Caregiver Leave to care for a spouse, son (of any age), daughter (of any age), parent or next of kin (nearest blood relative) who is (a) a current member of the Armed Forces, including the National Guard or reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary disability retired
127
17
list, for a serious injury or illness or (b) a person who, during the five (5) years prior to the treatment necessitating the leave, served in the active military, Naval or Air Service, and who was discharged or released from duty under conditions other than dishonorable (a “veteran” as defined by the Department of Veteran Affairs) and who has a serious injury or illness incurred or aggravated in the line of duty while on active duty that manifested itself before or after the member became a veteran.
A covered service member incurs a serious illness or injury for purposes of this paragraph when he or she is medically unfit to perform the duties of his or her office, grade, rank or rating.
Eligible employees are entitled to a total of twenty-six (26) week of unpaid Military caregiver Leave during a single 12-month period. The single 12-month period begins on the first day of an eligible employee takes Military Caregiver Leave and ends 12 months after that date. The leaves entitlement described in this paragraph applies on a per-covered service member, per-injury basis. However, no more than 26 weeks of leave, may be taken within a single 12-month period. Even in circumstances where an employee takes other leave covered by the FMLA under numbers 1-4 in the Basic FMLA Leave and Qualifying Exigency Leave section above, the combined leave shall not exceed 26 weeks during that 12-month period.
Definitions
•	A “serious health condition” referenced in numbers (2) and (3) of the Basic FMLA Leave and Qualifying Exigency Leave section above means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:
(a)	in-patient care (i.e., an overnight stay) in a hospital or other medical care facility (including any period of incapacity or any subseguent treatment in connection with such in-patient care);
(b)	a period of incapacity of more than three (3) consecutive full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition that also involves (i) treatment two 92) or more times by a health care provider or under the supervision of a health care provider within 30 days of the start of the incapacity, or (ii) treatment by a health care provider on at least one (1) occasion within seven (7) days of the start of the incapacity which results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of a health care provider;
(c)	any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care;
(d)	any period of incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition requiring periodic visits of at least twice a year for treatment by a health care provider;
(e)	a period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective, during which the employee (or family member) must be under the continuing supervision of, but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care provider; or
128
17
(f)	any period of absence to receive multiple treatments by a health care provider or under the supervision of a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that will likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three (3) consecutive calendar days in the absence of medical intervention or treatment.
• A “qualifying exigency” referenced in number (4) of the Basic FMLA Leave and Qualifying Exigency Leave section above refers to the following circumstances: (a) Short-notice deployment: to address issues arising when the notification of a call or order to active duty is seven (7) days or less;
(b)	Military events and related activities: to attend official military events or family assistance programs or briefings;
(c)	Childcare ands school activities: for qualifying childcare and school related reasons for a child, legal ward or stepchild of a covered military member;
(d)	Financial and legal arrangements: to make or update financial or legal affairs to address the absence of a covered military member;
(e)	Counseling: to attend counseling provided by someone other than a health care provider for oneself, for the covered military member, or child, legal ward, or stepchild of the covered military member;
(f)	Rest and recuperation: to spend up to five (5) days for each period in which a covered military member is on a short-term rest leave during a period of deployment;
(g)	Post-deployment activities: to attend official ceremonies or programs sponsored by the military for up to 90 days after a covered military member’s active duty terminates or to address issues arising from the death of a covered military member while on active duty;
(h)	Additional activities: for other events where the Company and the employee agree on the time and duration of the leave.
When Spouses Work Together
Spouses, when both are eligible for FMLA and both work at the Company, are eligible for either a combined 12 weeks of unpaid leave as discussed in the Basic FMLA Leave and Qualifying Exigency Leave section above or a combined 26 weeks of unpaid leaves as discussed in the Military Caregiver Leave section above.
Notice of Need for FMLA Leave
If the need for leave is foreseeable (birth or placement of child, planned medical care, leaves due to active duty of immediate family member), the employee must provide at least thirty (30) days’ advance notice. If circumstances prevent providing the thirty days advance notice, then the employee should provide as much advance notice as possible, following standard absence call-in procedures whenever possible.
129
17
Intermittent FMLA Leave
Intermittent leave (taking leave in blocks of time, or by reducing the normal weekly or daily work schedule) also may be available depending upon an employee’s serious health condition or an employee’s immediate family member’s serious health condition.
When an employee who has been previously approved for intermittent FMLA leave seeks to take time off for that purpose, and the need for the leave is unforeseeable, the employee must specifically refer to either the qualifying reason for the leave or must otherwise state the absence is for FMLA leave at the time the employee calls in to report the absence.
Military Caregiver Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary.
Employees taking intermittent leave, whether the leave is for a reason previously designated as FMLA-qualifying or not, must follow the Company’s standard absence call-in procedures absent unusual circumstances that prevent the employee from following those procedures.
Documentation Supporting FMLA Leave
The reason for the leave must be covered under FMLA and the employee must provide a completed FMLA Certification of Health Care Provider Form supporting the need for the leave. A request for reasonable documentation of the family relationship verifying the legitimacy of a FMLA Leave may also be required. Certifications must be obtained at the expense of the employee.
The employee will have fifteen (15) calendar days in which to return a completed Certification form following the employee’s receipt of the form from the Company. If the employee fails to provide timely certification after being required to do so, the employee may be denied the taking of the leave under FMLA. If the Certification form provided is incomplete or insufficient, an employee will be given written notification by the Company of the information needed and will have seven (7) days after receiving such written notice to provide the necessary information. Failure to submit a timely and complete Certification may result in the delay or denial of FMLA leave, which could result in the employee’s absences being unprotected by FMLA, counted as unexcused absences, and subject to discipline, up to an including termination.
If there is reason to doubt the validity of the medical certification, a second opinion, at the expense of the Company, related to the health condition may be required. If the original certification and the second opinion differ, a third opinion, at the expense of the Company, may be required. The opinion of the third health care provider, which the Company and the employee jointly select, will be the final and binding decision.
A request for Qualifying Exigency Leave must be supported by the Certification of Qualifying Exigency for Military family Leave form as well as appropriate documentation, including the covered military member’s active duty orders. A request
130
17
for Military Caregiver Leave must be supported by the Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of Covered Service Member form as well as any necessary supporting documentation.
Absent unusual circumstances, failure to comply with notice and certification requirements noted above will result in a delay or denial of the FMLA leave. If an employees fails to return to work at the leave’s expiration either due to doctor’s release to return to work and/or failure to obtain an extension of the leave and has not obtained an extension of the leave, the Company will presume that the employee does not plan to return to work and that the employee has voluntarily terminated employment.
Recertification
Under certain circumstances as provided by law, including (but not limited to) situations in which the need or nature of the approved leave changes, the Company, in its sole discretion, may require recertification of the serious health condition. The Company may also request recertification every year in which FMLA Leave is taken for any serious health condition that lasts longer than one (1) year. In these situations, the employee has fifteen (15) days in which to provide, at the employee’s expense, a completed Recertification form.
Substitution of Paid Leave
Any other type of leave (e.g., worker’s compensation leave, Section 900, etc.) that would also qualify for leave under the FMLA shall be treated as leave under FMLA and shall reduce the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement accordingly.
Reinstatement
Upon return from FMLA leave, employees must be restored to their original or equivalent positions with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms. Employees have no greater right to reinstatement after FMLA leaves than if the employee had been continuously employed rather than on leaves. For example, if the employee would have been laid off had the employee not taken leaves, or if the employee’s position has been eliminated during the leaves, the employee is not entitled to reinstatement. Employees returning from FMLA are subject to fitness-for-duty notices and evaluation before returning to work, as determined by requirements for similar non-FMLA leaves.
Benefits During FMLA Leave
During the approved FMLA Leave, the employee’s coverage under Company benefits will continue and will be paid through payroll deductions to the extent possible. If any portion of the employee’s leave is without pay, the employee must make arrangements with the Company to pay his or her share of health and welfare plan contributions for this coverage to continue. Failure to pay after notification will result in cancellation of coverage for the duration of the leave.

Letter of Agreement 20 New Technology
The application of technological advancements is recognized by the Union and the Company as being essential to both the Company's growth and ability to compete and to the continued improvements of the standard of living of employees covered by the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The term "new technology" will be defined as the installation of automated manufacturing machines, robots and computer-aided manufacturing systems which cause the direct elimination of work which has been performed manually by an hourly-represented employee. As a result, recognizing that future technological changes will occur and that such future changes cannot be definitized at this time, the Company agrees:
1.	That with the introduction of "new technologies" it is important that advanced planning be made to anticipate substantial changes that would eliminate or consolidate jobs, require new skills or substantial retraining. Therefore, at the time such substantial technological changes which affect bargaining unit employees are defined, discussions with the Union will be held. The discussions will be with the President, Chairman, and Zone Committeeman for affected areas. Upon determination that the impact of the change is "new technology" as defined in this Agreement, the Parties may establish a joint sub-committee(s), hereinafter referred to as joint new technology committee(s). The joint new technology committee(s) will be established by mutual agreement to study specific issues, make recommendations, and complete actions as mutually directed by the Parties.
When it is mutually agreed by the Parties to establish a joint new technology committee(s), the Union will appoint up to three (3) members and the Company will appoint up to three (3) members. The Committee(s), may request a maximum of two (2) additional temporary members if deemed necessary. It is further agreed that appointees to the joint new technology committee(s) will be individuals from the affected area(s) which are knowledgeable of the operation(s) where the new technology will be implemented. The joint new technology committee(s) will be under the oversight of the Plant Grievance Committee and the Director - Labor Relations.
2.	When new hourly-rated jobs are instituted by the Company in accordance with Article IX, Section 1.b. of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, as a result of such technological changes the Company will counsel affected bargaining unit employees in their efforts to obtain additional or update existing skills commensurate with the technological change so they can be considered for placement in such new jobs.
135
20
C. While the Company does not anticipate vast reductions in the workforce due to new technology, if a reduction will result from the introduction of such new technology, the Company will make every reasonable effort to achieve such reduction through normal attrition due to quits, deaths and retirements.
The Company considers this letter as its commitment to a significant effort by both Parties to ensure job security for employees as technology advances.

Letter of Agreement 25 Reemployed Retirees
This letter replaces the letter dated March 28, 1996.
With respect to the reemployment of bargaining unit retirees, the Parties recognize that under certain business conditions the Company may have the necessity to rehire retirees. It is also understood that in no event will more than fifty (50) reemployed retirees be in the bargaining unit at the same time.
The Parties agree that while an active employee, the reemployed retiree will be covered by active employee benefits.

Retiree medical coverage contingent on combined age and years of service at future retirement, (age 62 and 10 years of service)
The reemployed retiree may elect to continue receiving their monthly retirement payments. At such time the reemployed retiree decides to retire, their service acquired during their current employment period will be calculated at the current rate in affect at that time.

Letter of Agreement 27 Substance Abuse Testing Program Effective 4 October 2010
The Parties to this Agreement, UAW Local 848 and Triumph Aerostructures- Vought Aircraft Division wish to cooperate in making our workplace a safe environment and our workforce a productive one for the benefit of all the Parties, our customers and our community.
To that end the Company affirms that it will zealously administer and conduct its drug testing programs to ensure that:
The dignity and privacy of those tested will be safeguarded to the maximum extent possible.
•	The program may not be used for any purpose except the achievement of a drug-free workplace and workforce.
•	It will continue to employ the rigorous controls, safety checks and quality control measures that are employed in testing other segments of the workforce.
For its part, the Union (UAW Local 848) agrees to support the Substance Abuse Testing Program described herein. All parties agree that their mutual interests will be best served in adopting this program to achieve the goal of a drug-free workplace and workforce.
Section 1.	Purpose
To define substance abuse testing practices to provide a drug-free workplace/workforce for all employees.
Section 2.	Policy
It is the policy of the Company to hire/employ only individuals who do not use illegal drugs or other controlled substances in any amount or frequency, unless properly prescribed for them by their physician. The term "illegal drugs" means controlled substances included in Schedules I through V as defined by Section 202 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812), the possession of which are unlawful, and include amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine and propoxyphene. The Company will not arbitrarily change the current list of drugs being tested. In the event the Company deems it appropriate to change the list of drugs being tested (Substance Abuse Panel-10), the Company will consult with the Union at least thirty (30) days prior to any change. In the event the parties do not agree on the proposed change, such change will not take effect until the issue can be resolved by a mutually satisfactory third party. The term "illegal drugs" does not include controlled substances obtained and
143
27
used pursuant to a valid prescription or as otherwise authorized by law. Human Resources will administer the following "Substance Abuse Testing Program." The Substance Abuse Testing Program will apply to the following individuals:
a)	All UAW represented new hires, recalls, rehires, and reinstatements will be tested as part of the Company's pre-employment review requirements. If the employee has not been absent from the payroll for thirty (30) days or more, this provision will not apply.
b)	All UAW represented employees will be subject to systematic random testing without notice and after a positive test, accelerated testing under Section 4.c.
c)	All UAW represented employees will be tested for cause based upon a reasonable suspicion to believe that such persons are under the influence of illegal drugs, after involvement in accidents or potentially dangerous near-miss accidents which could be attributed to substance abuse or whose performance is impaired and who exhibit behavior consistent with substance abuse.
Section 3.	General Procedures
a)	Urinalysis drug screen tests consist of an initial Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT) screen, confirmed by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Such testing will be conducted by a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (formerly NIDA) certified laboratory. The screening parameters and cut-off levels for both test categories are published by SAMHSA
b)	Individuals to be tested will complete and sign an Authorization and Release Form listing prescribed and over-the-counter medications taken within the last thirty (30) days. Failure to sign an Authorization and Release Form or to provide a sample in accordance with the procedures set forth herein will be considered failure to successfully complete the substance abuse test and will be reason for disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
c)	The collection of individual urine samples and the testing of same will be supervised by Company-designated medical personnel and collection/testing facilities in a manner consistent with the following standards:
(1)	Urine samples will be collected from individuals in such a manner as to ensure the integrity of the testing process.
(2)	Special containers will be provided for specimen collection.
(3)	Suitable, sanitary and private facilities will be provided for the collection of urine specimens.
(4)	Sample collection will be supervised, but not witnessed. An enclosed stall will be provided to ensure privacy of the individual.
144
27
(5)	The Vought Medical Department clinic manager or approved designee will immediately review all situations where there is reasonable suspicion that an individual has submitted a suspicious or potentially adulterated sample. When the Medical Department or its approved designee determines an original sample to be suspicious, that sample shall immediately be set aside as unsuitable for testing and the individual must submit another sample before leaving the collection site. Samples may be considered suspicious or potentially substituted or adulterated if the urine temperature registers below 90° or above 100° within four minutes, and/or the sample imparts a suspicious odor or abnormal appearance.
(6)	Container will be sealed with tamper-evident tape in the presence of the individual tested.
(7)	Specimens will be labeled and checked to ensure that the name on the label matches the name on the Authorization & Release Form and the Chain of Custody Requisition Form.
(8)	The label will be signed by the individual.
(9)	The Chain of Custody Requisition Form and the Authorization and Release Form will be kept on file for one (1) year from the date of testing for a positive specimen and one (1) month from the date of testing for a negative specimen.
(10)	The lab will relay test results to the Medical Review Officer who will personally discuss lab tests reported positive with the individual. If the Medical Review Officer determines the positive test is the result of legal usage, the test will be reported as negative. Only results certified as positive by the Medical Review Officer will apply in Section 4, below.
d)	Test results will be handled as "Company Private" information and are not to be communicated outside the Company, except as required by contract or law. Currently, these requirements are clearance reporting requirements and court orders.
e)	Individuals who test positive may request, within thirty (30) days of being notified of their results, a re-confirmation test on the same biological specimen, to be conducted by a SAMHSA certified testing facility at the individual's expense. Such re-confirmation testing only uses the GC/MS method, and only tests for the presence of the drug(s) and/or drug metabolites in question. The presence of those drug(s) and/or drug metabolites at any detectable level by GC/MS, without regard to the previous screening and confirmation test cutoff levels, is considered a positive result. In the unlikely event the test results are negative, the Company will reimburse the employee for laboratory testing charges.
f)	If there is a reasonable suspicion of a faulty specimen or if the laboratory report shows evidence of an "abnormality" in the specimen, Vought Medical may request a retest. The Vought Medical Review Officer will provide the employee with an explanation for the retest.
g)	The following actions are considered major disciplinary offenses, and are equivalent to a positive test result for purposes of determining subsequent disciplinary actions and processing in accordance with Section 4 below: (1)
145
27
repeated refusal to cooperate with the testing procedures, (2) laboratory documentation of substitution or adulteration of a test sample: (3) failure to report for testing within a reasonable amount of time after being notified of a random drug test.
Section 4.	Positive Test Results
a)	Positive test results are communicated to the employee in person by the Medical Review Officer and negative results are communicated via personal and confidential memo.
b)	If the Medical Review Officer is convinced the positive test results are the result of a one (1) time usage of a valid prescription issued to a member of the employee's immediate family, the test results will be pended and the employee will be subject to accelerated unannounced testing for the next ninety (90) day period.
c)	Employees who test positive will be placed on unpaid suspension for five (5) working days and in addition, during the five (5) day period, will be required to seek help from a company-directed counseling and assistance program or a company-approved drug treatment program prior to being allowed to return to work. The employee will be required to read and sign a Return-To-Work Conditions Form.
d)	The employee will be subjected to regular random drug tests as well as an accelerated schedule of unscheduled and unannounced tests, for two (2) years following his or her return to work. For the purpose of calculating two (2) calendar years, any period of time spent on layoff or on vacation will count towards the satisfaction of the two (2) year testing period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee will not be considered to be “subject to testing” during any period of time on layoff or in Section 900 in excess of thirty (30) consecutive days. Accordingly, the employee shall be subject to an additional period of accelerated unannounced testing equal to any such period(s) spent in Section 9OO.The two (2) year period does not constitute an employment contract or other guarantee of employment during such period.
e)	The employee who tests positive under the accelerated period referenced in d above will be discharged.
Section 5.	Recalled Employees
a)	All laid off employees with recall rights who have been absent from the payroll for at least thirty (30) days and who are offered employment in accordance with Section 2 of Article VII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, shall report to the plant Medical Department for a drug test.
b)	A laid off employee who tests positive within a two (2) year period from the date of a previous positive test will be denied recall and lose all seniority.
c)	A laid off employee who tests positive beyond the two (2) year period of a previous positive test or an employee who tests positive who was not on accelerated drug screening at the time of layoff will be denied recall and
146
27
bypassed for a thirty (30) day period beginning on the date the positive test results are communicated, during which time the individual should seek help from a drug counseling or treatment program. Upon the expiration of the thirty (30) day period, the individual shall again report to the plant Medical Department for a drug test. If the individual again tests positive, he/she will be denied recall and lose all seniority. If the individual tests negative, he/she will be returned to work but subjected to regular random drug tests as well as an accelerated schedule of unscheduled and unannounced tests for two (2) years following his/her return to work.
Section 6.	Testing For Cause
a)	Employees will be subject to the above testing procedures described above if there is reasonable suspicion to believe his/her behavior has been impaired by substance abuse. Reasonable suspicion shall be left to the sole determination of the Company Medical Doctor, or a Human Resources professional certified in the standardized field sobriety test battery.
b)	Nothing in this policy will preclude the Company from taking action against the employee warranted by other policies, procedures, rules of conduct, etc.
Section 7.	Testing Responsibility
a)	Medical informs supervision in a timely manner of employees selected for substance abuse testing.
b)	The supervisor has the employee read the instruction letter and fill out an Authorization and Release Form. The employee is sent to Medical.
c)	Medical has the employee sign the Authorization and Release Form and collects a sample as specified in the General Procedures section.

Human Resources and the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will exchange known information and will discuss the direction of the planned investigation including who will be interviewed.
The UAW Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will be involved in all interviews involving bargaining unit employees and interviews of non-bargaining unit employees where allegations have been made against bargaining unit employees.
It is not necessary for the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator to be present in interviews with salaried employees where no allegations have been made against bargaining unit employees; however, if there are bargaining unit witnesses to be interviewed, the Dignity in the Work Place Coordinator will be present during the witness interviews.

Letter of Agreement 29
Workforce Diversity
The Parties agree that to remain competitive in today’s market place, it is critical to continue to maintain a work place that values, understands, respects and best utilizes the diversity of Vought employees. As our workforce continues to change, it is the desire of both parties to recruit, employ, train, transfer, and advance people regardless of their race, color, religion, gender, mental or physical disabilities, national origin, age, military status, or any other characteristics that makes us different from one another.
Due to the priority both parties place on workforce diversity, a joint effort will be made to establish and coordinate a Workforce Diversity Team. This team will meet six (6) times a year and will accomplish the following:
Review policies and practices, as well as recommend changes as appropriate, within the bargaining unit environment, that may hinder the advancement or development of women, minorities, the disabled or people who differ culturally; and
Develop ways that enable employees at all levels to appreciate and respect individual differences.
Provide recommendations to the company on methods of delivering education regarding “What is Diversity” and how to best value and utilize it.
The team will be co-chaired by the UAW local President and a member of Human Resources. The team will consist of 10 members; two co-chairs, one member of human resources, and seven UAW appointed representatives. The seven UAW appointed representatives would serve as members of the team for a term of approximately 18 months.

Letter of Agreement 31 Dependent Life Insurance
This letter replaces the original letter dated 15 February 1982 and reaffirmed 23 June 1988.
It was agreed by the Parties during the 1981 negotiations that provisions would be made for offering dependent life insurance to employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement. (Reference Article XX, Section 2.d).
Following is a description of the Dependent Group Life Insurance Program to be offered to eligible employees beginning March 1, 1982.
1.	Eligibility Date
An employee will become eligible for Dependent Group Life Insurance on March 1, 1982, provided that the employee has at least one eligible dependent as defined in Section 3. below. If the employee does not then have such a dependent, the employee will become eligible for Dependent Group Life Insurance on the first day of the calendar month following the date a dependent is acquired.
The date that the employee becomes eligible for Dependent Group Life Insurance will be hereinafter referred to as the employee's eligibility date.
2.	Enrollment and Effective Dates
The employee's Dependent Group Life Insurance will become effective as set forth below:
a.	If the employee enrolls on or before the eligibility date, insurance becomes effective on the eligibility date.
b.	If the employee enrolls during the 30-day period following the eligibility date, insurance becomes effective immediately.
c.	If the employee enrolls subsequent to the 30th day following eligibility, the employee must furnish evidence satisfactory to the insurance company of each dependent's good health. In such case, insurance will become effective on the first day of the calendar month following the date the insurance company approves the evidence, with respect to those persons whose evidence has been approved and who are still eligible dependents, as defined in Section 3., below.
In any event, for insurance to become effective, the employee must be actively at work on the date insurance would otherwise become effective. If the employee is not actively at work on such date, insurance becomes effective on the date the employee returns to active work, provided the employee is then still eligible as set forth in Section 1 above.
3.	Definitions of dependents are the same as the health care definitions, provided that employees' spouses who are also employees of the Company may be covered by this Dependent Life Insurance until such time as the insurance company elects not to provide the dependent coverage due to a conflict of state insurance laws. Coverage will remain in effect until the conflict is explained to the employee in writing by the insurance company and premiums are discontinued.
4.	Amount of Insurance
The amount of Dependent Group Life Insurance applicable to each dependent is as follows:
Amount of Insurance
Spouse	$20,000
Child	$10,000
5.	Contributions
The employee will contribute the full cost of Dependent Group Life Insurance and contributions will be payable monthly in advance. Coverage for this insurance is fully pooled and not eligible for dividends of any manner. The required monthly contribution, regardless of the number of dependents on whose account the employee is insured, is as set forth in the following schedule, which is subject to change. An employee who elects to participate will complete a payroll deduction card authorizing weekly payroll deductions. When a participant is not receiving weekly payments, it is the employee's responsibility to
153
31
transmit the appropriate payment to Payroll. In the event the participant fails to make the required payment as outlined in Section 7, the coverage will terminate and the employee may reapply for coverage only by furnishing satisfactory evidence of good health as required in Section 2.
Schedule - Cost Per Dependent Unit Per Week (subject to change annually based on experience)
Over 50%	Below 50%
Enrollment	Enrollment
$.61	No Plan
6.	Payment of Benefits
If a dependent dies from any cause while the employee is insured for Dependent Group Life Insurance, the amount of such insurance in force on account of the dependent will be paid in a lump sum to the employee (the employee is the beneficiary for Dependent Group Life Insurance). The employee's insurance certificate will set forth the procedure for payment of insurance in case a dependent dies subsequent to the death of the employee.
This insurance is term insurance without cash, loan or paid-up values.
7.	Cessation of Insurance
Dependent Group Life Insurance will automatically cease on the earliest of the following:
a.	The date the employee ceases to have a dependent as defined in Section 3., above.
b.	The date the employee ceases to be insured for Company life insurance.
c.	If the employee fails to make a required contribution for Dependent Group Life Insurance when due.
d.	The last day of the calendar month in which the employee attains age 70.
e.	The date of discontinuance of the Dependent Group Life Insurance.
f.	The date the dependent begins active duty in the armed forces of any state.
g.	The date the dependent becomes insured as an employee on a regular full-time basis.
The Dependent Group Life Insurance on account of any dependent will automatically cease on the day immediately preceding the date such person ceases to be a dependent as defined in Section 3. above.
8.	Conversion privileges are the same as the employee group life provisions.

Letter of Agreement
Nashville 1AM Represented Employees Transferring to Dallas
Per recent Company announcements, plans are in place to facilitate the addition of capital equipment, facility upgrades and the rearrangement of buildings that will be located within the Dallas Jefferson St. and Marshall Drive Facilities. These capital additions will help accommodate the relocation of work from the Nashville, Tennessee site. This work will transition in phases over, but not limited to, a thirty six month period as the Nashville site is closed.
In a mutually beneficial effort to attract and relocate as many experienced aerospace workers currently employed at the Nashville Site to the Dallas Site, the parties have reached the following agreement:
Employees electing to transfer to Dallas to perform work will be covered by the UAW certification as designated in the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Certification No. 16R1744, dated July 19, 1946, the NLRB Certification of Representatives in Case No. 16RC2696 (Bargaining Unit Voting Group 1), dated April 12, 1960, those employees designated in NLRB Certification No. 16RC3476, dated August 29, 1963, and those employees designated in the mutual Agreement between the Parties, dated December 8, 1961.
Job Placement
•	The Company will offer an hourly job in Dallas to all hourly employees represented by the International Association of Machinists (IAM) in Nashville who elect to transfer. The positions offered will be jobs outlined in the UAW agreed-to job family appendices.
•	Nashville employees transferring will be offered, to the extent possible, a similar job and classification corresponding to the closest equivalent job within the UAW job family and classification structure.
•	Nashville employees electing to relocate to Dallas will transfer at their current Nashville hourly wage rate effective on their actual start to work date in Dallas and subsequently progress per the provisions of the UAW collective bargaining agreement.
•	Nashville employees will not be transferred until the current UAW recall lists of the applicable job family is exhausted. Once all laid off UAW employees with rights to the target job family have a documented, active recall letter placed in the U.S. Mail Service the recall list will be considered exhausted.
•	A list, including name and job family placement, of the Nashville employees electing to relocate will be provided to the Chairman of the Plant Grievance Committee within a reasonable time period. Additions to the list subsequent to the date the list is provided must be by mutual agreement.
Seniority
•	The date the first hourly Nashville employee begins work within the Dallas facility will be the in-date seniority date for all subsequent transferring employees
Nashville Letter of Agreement 1 of 3
163
•	Nashville employees will remain in relative Nashville seniority order within the indate established, within their respective job families, regardless of report to work date.
•	Nashville transfers will have their total Company service time count toward vacation accrual rates per Article X, section 7.
•	The Service Date, which will be the Original Company Seniority Date for Nashville employees, will be the calculation and award date for vacation hours earned.
•	Nashville employees relocating to Dallas with available vacation hours on the books will be allowed to transfer them one for one and be able to utilize them per Article X, section 7.
Pension and Retiree Medical
•	After a five (5) year qualifying period from the date a Nashville employee actually begins work at the Dallas facility, they will be eligible for the negotiated retiree medical provisions per Article XII, section 3., b.. Should a Nashville employee voluntarily quit prior to the 5 year period, they will be covered under the plan in place for Nashville heritage hourly employees. Should a Nashville transfer be affected by layoff during the first year in Dallas, the five year limit will be waived.
•	Transfers, provided they are currently vested, will begin accruing pension benefits per the provisions of Article XIII of the UAW collective bargaining agreement beginning the first day of work in Dallas. Employees transferring who are not vested will have Nashville and Dallas service time count toward being vested. Once vested, all Dallas service time will count toward the UAW pension benefit.
•	Transferred employees who are, or become, eligible for the early retirement supplement outlined in Article XIII, Section 2, c. and qualify for a similar benefit under a Nashville heritage plan will only be eligible for one supplement..
Miscellaneous
•	Nashville 1AM employees on layoff^ if interested, will be considered for open positions along with outside new hires. In the event a laid off Nashville employee is hired they will be offered a wage rate no lower than their Nashville recall rate.
•	Existing Nashville Employees classified as Leads will not be transferred into UAW Lead classifications.
•	In the event an open job is posted per Article VII, section 5 subsequent to the establishment of the Nashville In-date but prior to a Nashville employee starting to work in the posted job family, and an existing UAW employee is selected for the position, the In-date seniority date for the UAW employee selected will be the same as the established Nashville in-date. Once a Nashville Employee transfers into a UAW job family or a new hire from the street is hired into the applicable job family all postings in that job family will be per Article VII, section 5.
•	In the event there are unclear job classification matches, (Plant Maintenance for example) both parties will review the employee’s skills and experience for placement into a UAW job classification.
