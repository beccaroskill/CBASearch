Section 1.	It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that as a condition of continued employment, all persons who are hereafter employed by the Employer in the unit which is the subject of this Agreement shall become members of the Union not later than the eighth (8th) day following the beginning of their employment or the execution date of this Agreement, whichever is the later; that the continued employment by the Employer in said unit of persons who are members of the Union shall be conditioned upon those persons continuing their payment of the periodic dues of the Union; and that the continued employment of persons who were in the employ of the Employer prior to the date of this Agreement and who are not now members of the Union, shall be conditioned upon those persons becoming members of the Union not later than the eighth (8th) day following the execution date of this Agreement.

The Apprenticeship Program shall be administered by the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee. The Employer and the Union agree to be bound by the decisions of the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee.
The Apprenticeship Program shall be a "letter of intent" type of program, which shall allow for persons to enter the Apprenticeship Program provided they have an Employer willing to employ them for the term of apprenticeship under the terms of the Standards. Apprentices enrolled pursuant to these Standards shall be indentured to the Committee.
The Term of Apprenticeship shall be for two years (4,000 hours) of diversified work and on-the-job training, excluding time spent in off-the-job related instruction and training.

APPRENTICES NOT ATTENDING CLASSES TO WHICH THEY ARE ASSIGNED AND SCHEDULED SHALL BE CANCELLED FROM THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. Any persons so cancelled shall not be eligible for employment in the apprenticeship classification by any Employer signatory to a collective bargaining agreement providing for such classification and negotiated by the Eastern Missouri Laborers' District Council or any of its affiliated Local Unions.

In the event a specific project warrants additional manpower requirements above the ability of the Local Union to provide workmen, the above apprentice to journey level worker ratios may be waived by the Eastern Missouri Laborers’ District Council.
7
In the event of temporary reduction of workforce, the Employer shall reduce the number of apprentices in accordance with the above and promptly notify the Committee of the name of the apprentice. Apprentices so temporarily laid off will have their names placed in a pool and will be available for employment by Employers desiring to employ apprentices during times that the Committee is not accepting new applications for apprentices.
Apprentices shall work at all times under the supervision of a competent and qualified journey level laborer employed by the same Employer.

No person who has previously been employed as a Journey Level laborer shall be eligible for employment as an apprentice.
Should any provision of this Article be contrary to or in violation of any applicable existing law or statute hereafter promulgated, then in that event such provision shall be void and of no force and effect, but all other provisions of this Article shall continue in full force and effect.

It is hereby agreed and understood that any person entering but failing to maintain and complete his or her Apprenticeship shall not be employed by the Employer as a Journey Level Laborer under this Agreement. Further, the failure of any Apprentice to maintain his or her Apprenticeship status shall, upon written notice to the Employer by the Union to such effect, obligate the Employer to discharge such person.

The amount paid to the Vacation Fund is part of wages, included in the laborers’ wage rates, and shall be so considered in computation of withholding, taxes and insurance, etc. In the event an Employer party hereto performs residential work in areas covered both by this Agreement and by the Union’s collective bargaining agreement with the Residential Construction Employers, the Employer, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII hereof, shall continue to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Article regarding the Laborers’ Vacation Fund, and shall deduct the amount of the Vacation Fund contribution from the wages payable to the employees performing such work and forward it to the Vacation Fund in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 10.	Bonding of Employers: The Union shall not furnish laborers to any Employer, until such Employer has previously delivered to Laborers’ Welfare Fund security for the timely and full payment of wages, fringe benefits and contributions provided herein. Said security shall be kept in full force and effect for the entire term of this Agreement unless the Employer ceases to perform any work under this Collective Bargaining Agreement. This security, in the discretion of the Employer, shall be in one of the following three (3) forms:
Section 10.1 Surety Bond: In order to assist the Trustees in the collection of all wages, fringes and contributions provided herein, certain employers shall be required to post with the Trustees, or there authorized agent, a surety bond on the terms set forth hereinafter.
Section 10.2 Effective Date: Except in the case of an Employer who has made all required payments due to all the Fund(s) from March 1, 2001 to February 28, 2005, a surety bond shall be required of each employer as of March 1, 2005. In the case of an Employer who, after March 1, 2005 becomes a signatory to, or becomes bound by this, or any future Collective Bargaining Agreement, or who after March 1, 2005 fails to make required payments when due to any Fund, such bond shall be posted immediately upon such Employer becoming signatory to, or becoming bound by, such Collective Bargaining Agreement or becoming delinquent, as the case may be.
Section 10.3	Length of Bond: Any bond required to be posted shall be maintained for a period of sixty (60) months following the date the employer becomes signatory to, or becomes
10
bound this, or any previous or future Collective Bargaining Agreement (Provided all required payments to all Funds are made when due) or the date on which the Employer’s most recent delinquency is cured pursuant to Section 11 herein below as the case may be.
Section 10.4	Amount of Bond: The Employer shall secure and maintain a surety bond in the minimum amount of $10,000.00 to guarantee the payment of all wages, fringes and contributions provided herein and shall furnish to the Union evidence of the procurement and maintenance of said bond in such an amount.
Section 10.5	Irrevocable Letter of Credit: An Employer may, at its option, submit to the Trustees an Irrevocable Letter of Credit, in the same amount and for the same term as the aforementioned bond, from a commercial lending institution in a form satisfactory to the Trustees, in lieu of a Surety Bond.
Section 10.6	Certificate of Deposit: A one month automatically renewable certificate of deposit issued to the Laborers’ Welfare Fund by a commercial lending institution in the same amount as the aforementioned bond, in lieu of a Surety Bond.
Section 10.7	Unsecured Employer(s): Any Employer who fails to post a security as outlined in Sections 10.1 through 10.6, shall pay fringe rates at a rate of 10% more than the “secured” Employer who has posted one of the three securities as listed in Sections 10.1 through 10.6.
Section 11.	Reporting and Delinquent Contributions: Contributions to Greater St. Louis Construction Laborers’ Welfare Fund (hereafter called "Welfare"), Construction Laborers’ Pension Trust of Greater St. Louis (hereafter called "Pension"), AGC-Eastern Missouri Laborers’ Joint Training Fund (hereafter called "Training"), Laborers’ International Union of North America AFL-CIO Locals Nos. 42-53-110 Supplemental Dues Fund (hereafter called “supplemental dues”), Eastern Missouri Laborers’ District Council Laborers-Employers Cooperation and Education Trust (hereafter called “LECET”), and to the St. Louis Laborers’ Vacation Fund (hereafter called “Vacation”), shall be paid monthly, with each month's contribution covering work ending with the last payroll period in that month. Reporting shall be on forms furnished by Welfare, Pension, Training, Supplemental Dues, Vacation and LECET, and all forms shall be signed by a person authorized to sign for the reporting Employer. Employers who have been making contributions shall, during periods of inactivity, make monthly reports showing "no laborers" if no laborer worked during that month.
11
Contributions are due by the 15th day of the month following the month reported or which should be reported, and any contributions not received by the last day of the month during which contributions are due shall be considered delinquent. The Employer recognizes that the Employer's failure or refusal to make contributions when due causes additional bookkeeping, correspondence, telephone calls, loss of use of funds, delay in making entries in record keeping and other expenses to those whom contributions are due. Therefore, the Employer agrees that upon contributions becoming delinquent said Employer will pay, in addition thereto and as liquidated damages, a sum equal to twenty percent (20%) of such delinquent contributions. Further, when there are delinquent contributions due, the Union, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, following seventy-two (72) hours written notice by Welfare, Pension, Training, Supplemental Dues, Vacation, or LECET trustees or by the Union to such delinquent Employer may order cessation of all work covered by the Employer on all jobs of Employer until such reports are made and the contributions together with liquidated damages are paid.
In addition, any Employer whose contributions to the St. Louis Laborers’ Vacation Fund are delinquent for more than one month during the term of this Agreement may be required by the Trustees of said Fund to remit Vacation contributions weekly, apart from other Fringe Benefit contributions, for a period of up to one year.
Section 12.	Audits and Suits to Collect Contributions: The Employer agrees that Welfare, Pension, Training, Supplemental Dues, Vacation and LECET shall each have the right to verify the accuracy of reports and contributions made by the Employer, by having their respective employees, agents, representatives or accountants audit and examine during the Employer’s regular business hours that Employer's weekly payroll journal, individual earning records of employees, copy of Federal payroll tax returns, and other payroll records as may be necessary to allow such examiners to determine whether the Employer is making full and complete reports and contributions as required by the Employer's collective bargaining agreement with the Union. If such examination discloses that the Employer has not made full reporting and payment, the cost of examination and audit shall be paid by the Employer, provided that such allocation of cost to the Employer shall not apply in the case of inadvertent or immaterial error or clerical mistake. In addition to all other remedies on account thereof available to Welfare, Pension, Training, Supplemental Dues, Vacation, LECET, and/or the Union, suit to recover unpaid contributions and liquidated damages due and owing, if so, and/or to enforce this Section concerning audit and examination, may be brought by the respective Trustees of
12
Welfare, Pension, Training, Supplemental Dues, Vacation, LECET, and/or the Union, and in the event of any such suit the Employer agrees to pay in addition to the amount found due and owing, interest at the maximum rate allowed by law per annum computed from the due date of each month's contribution, plus a reasonable attorney’s fee payable to the attorney or attorneys filing such suit in the amount fixed by the Court, but in no event less than thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) of the total amount for which judgment is rendered.
Section 13.	Vacation Period: An employee may upon three (3) weeks prior notice to the Employer, take a leave of absence for a vacation not to exceed two (2) weeks from the job on which he is employed, without jeopardizing future employment on the job, provided however, that plumber laborers' work on that job is in progress on his return and that no more than one (1) employee on such job shall be on vacation leave at any one time.
Section 14.	Supplemental Dues: The Employer shall deduct and withhold from wages of all employees covered by this Agreement supplemental dues in an amount equal to three percent (3%) of gross wages (taxable income).
It is specifically understood that no supplemental dues shall be deducted from any employee's wages unless and until such time as the Employer has physically in his possession an authorization card signed by the employee providing for such deduction and payment to the respective Local Unions.
Reporting and payment of such sums so deducted will be made on forms furnished by the Union.

However, should a holiday occur, Monday through Thursday, the Employer shall have the option to work Friday at the straight time rate of pay to complete his forty (40) hours.
However, if Friday or any portion of the day is used to complete the workweek, each employee will be guaranteed at least eight (8) hours’ work and not over ten (10) hours at the straight time rate of pay, unless work is halted due to inclement weather (rain, snow, sleet falling).
When an Employer works a project of a four (4) ten-hour (10) day work schedule, the Employer will not bring in any other crew for a fifth workday on the project while not calling in the normal crew that had been scheduled for that project.
Section 4.	Projects That Cannot Be Performed During Regular Workday: On heavy-highway work or if required by owner, the contractor may perform work outside the normal work hours and employees shall be paid applicable straight time hourly wage rate plus a premium of $2.50 per hour for the first eight (8) hours worked. Any hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours shall be paid at the applicable overtime rate plus the $2.50 per hour premium.

Payment for shift work shall be determined when an Employer first begins his shift operation, i.e., the shifts which being on Friday morning and end on Saturday morning will be paid at straight time; the shifts which start on Saturday morning and end on Sunday morning will be paid at tine and one-half (1 %); the shifts that start on Sunday morning and end on Monday morning will be paid at two (2) times the regular rate of pay. Employees working during the normal workday shall receive first shift pay; employees working predominantly in the evening hours shall receive second shift pay; employees working predominantly during the early morning hours will receive third shift pay.
Section 5.5	Nothing above prohibits the working of two (2) shifts at greater than eight hours with excess hours to be paid at overtime rate.
Section 6 Voting Time: RSMo 129.160-1 states any person entitled to vote at any election held within this state, or any primary election held in preparation for such election, shall, on the day of such election be entitled to absent himself or herself from any services or employment in which he or she is then engaged or employed, for a period of three (3) hours between the time of opening and the time of closing of the polls for the purpose of voting; and any absence for such purpose shall not be sufficient reason for the discharge of or the threat to
