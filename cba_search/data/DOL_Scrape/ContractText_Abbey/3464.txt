The shift differential shall be at such rate(s) or in such amount(s) as from time to time during the term of this Agreement shall have been approved by the City of New York for “City-reimbursed” employees in the bargaining unit, not exceeding, however, the rate(s) or amount(s) which, with respect to City reimbursed employees, are capable of being paid solely from funds actually received by the Society from the City for the designated purpose of covering the shift differential. Unless and until funds for said purpose are so received by the Society from the City, no shift differential shall be payable hereunder; it being agreed, however, that the Society shall submit monthly to the City vouchers for payments of shift differential for City-reimbursed employees.
Vehicle Differential: Subject to the conditions hereinafter provided, a vehicle differential for the operation of a vehicle having a maximum gross weight of 18,000 pounds or more when loaded, or for the operation of a boom truck, back-hoe, packer-loader (garbage truck), or bulldozer, shall be paid to employees in the bargaining unit who operate any of same, except to
5
any employee (a) who operates same during less than four (4) hours in any single day; or (b) who operates same on day when another employee in the bargaining unit already has operated same for at least four (4) hours and has been paid or is entitled to be paid a vehicle differential therefore; or (c) who operates same while on overtime (as defined in Article 5); or (d) who operates same while undergoing training to do so.

Effective upon execution of the contract, Union Members who perform pesticide applications for the Society at the Society's direction will be paid a differential of $1,000 per year. This sum will be paid to the Union Member regardless of how many actual applications the employee performs during the said year and will be added to their base salary for the duration of the time that employee performs pest control work. Once an employee ceases to perform pest control work, the differential will no longer be paid and will be removed from the employee's base salary. This differential will be paid on a bi-weekly basis. Should the Union Member cease performing the pesticide applications for any reason during the year, the differential will be pro-rated for the period of time that he/she was licensed and/or certified and expected to perform such work for the Society. The Society will bear the entire cost of obtaining and maintaining the license(s) and/or certification(s) required for the Union Member to perform pesticide applications.
G.	The Society shall deduct from the wages of an employee who submits to the Society a written, personally signed authorization for the monthly Union dues (if the employee is a member of the Union), or the monthly sendee charge (if the employee is not a member of the Union), as provided in such authorization, and the Society shall remit the same to the union not later than the 15lh day of each month following such a deduction. The authorization for this deduction will be accepted by the Society only if submitted on the official Authorization for Payroll Deductions card and in the words and form set forth on Exhibit A annexed. All checkoff authorization cards shall be dated as of the day of submission to the Society. During the effective term of this Agreement (including any renewals thereof), such authorization of deductions of dues or service charge shall be deemed automatically renewed upon the anniversary date of this Agreement, unless the employee submits to the Society a written notice of revocation of such authorization not less than twenty (20) work days before such anniversary date.

H.	Upon becoming an employee as defined by this Agreement, the employee shall decide to:
a.	Join the Union and pay the appropriate periodic dues required as a condition of membership in the Union
OR
b.	Decline to join the Union but pay to the Union a contract consideration fee equivalent to the appropriate periodic dues required of Union members.
I.	Enforcement: The parties recognize that the failure of any member of the bargaining unit to comply with the provisions of this section shall be deemed just and reasonable cause for the termination of such individual's employment. The procedure that is to be followed in the event of a violation by the employee of the requirements of this section shall be as follows:
The Union shall notify the affected individual of non-compliance with the terms of this section by certified mail, return receipt requested. A copy will be sent to the Society. Said notice shall state the fact of non-compliance, shall quote the relevant provisions of this Section, and shall advise such individual that failure to effect compliance within thirty (30) calendar days shall result in the termination of such individual's employment.
In the event that such a member of the bargaining unit fails to comply with the provisions of this Section within such thirty (30) day period, the Society shall, upon written notification by the Union to the Society of such noncompliance, forthwith terminate the individual's employment. The Society forthwith shall notify the individual by certified mail, return receipt requested, directed to the individual's last known address according to the Society's official records.
It is agreed that the Society shall have no obligation or liability, financial or otherwise, other than set forth herein, arising out of the understanding set forth in this Section. It is further agreed that the Union agrees to and does hereby indemnify, defend and save the Society harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, lawsuits or any other form of action arising out of its deduction and remittance of membership dues and fees or arising from or related to any action taken by the Society in reliance upon information furnished to the Society by the Union for the purpose of complying with any of the provisions of this Section.
J.	All checks issued to bargaining unit employees shall continue to itemize each element of premium pay and each wage deduction.

ARTICLE 5
WORK WEEK
The normal work week of employees in the bargaining unit shall consist of five (5) consecutive days during a seven (7) day week, except that the normal work week of employees
7
in particular jobs currently (at the time of the execution of this Agreement) being performed pursuant to a schedule differing from five (5) consecutive days during a seven (7) day week, shall conform with the current practice. For overtime computation purposes, in such work week the employee's first scheduled regular day off shall be considered the sixth day of his/her work week and his/her second regular day off, whether or not successive, shall be considered the seventh day of his/her work week. The schedule of regular days off for any employee may be changed twice a year by the Society, without incurring overtime compensation, provided that advance notice of two (2) weeks or more shall be given to the affected employee before each such change.
Wash-up time policy shall be standard for all Keepers and Senior Keepers.
Each July 1st will be appointed as a day to review the permitted twice a year changes in days off that occurred during the period subsequent to eighteen months and prior to six (6) months before said day of reckoning. An employee will be awarded an additional day's pay if during that time he/she worked more than five (5) days between regular days off without a prior or subsequent change where he/she worked less than five (5) days between regular days off. In the event that an employee during this period worked less than five (5) days between regular days off without a prior or subsequent change where he/she worked more than five (5) days between regular days off, he/she may in the future have his/her days off changed without incurring additional compensation under this Section or if the employee should retire or terminate, the Society shall deduct a day's pay from his/her annual or equivalent leave time.
The Society shall give two (2) weeks advance notice to employees prior to a change in shift greater than one (1) hour.
The Society further agrees that no employee shall be scheduled to work with less than eight (8) hours off between regular scheduled shifts.
Overtime compensation at the rate of one and one-half times the hourly rate of pay, including night shift differentials and as of July 1, 2015, shall be paid by the Society for all work required by it to be performed in excess of eight (8) hours in a calendar day or in excess of forty (40) straight time hours in a work week. Overtime hours paid for on a daily basis shall not be included in the compensation of hours for overtime on a weekly basis. Voluntary overtime shall be defined as overtime which the employee is free to accept or decline. Involuntary overtime shall be defined as overtime which the employee is directed to work.
Opportunities to work voluntary overtime shall be based on seniority but will cycle, such that if an employee is offered the opportunity to work overtime and elects to do so, that employee will move to the bottom of the overtime seniority list once they have completed that particular overtime shift. However, if an employee is offered a voluntary opportunity to work overtime and turns the offer down, that employee shall also move to the bottom of the overtime seniority list. Overtime shall be offered in order of seniority, but if all senior employees decline, the least senior qualified employee shall be ordered to work overtime.
Overtime for a vacant shift shall be offered first as a full shift before it is offered in split shifts.
8
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article 5, employees regularly assigned to relieve other employees for vacation purposes may be required to take the same regular days off as the employees relieved, without payment of overtime.
The collecting of animals for the Queens Wildlife Center shall be regarded as regular activity. All time spent collecting animals for the Queens Wildlife Center beyond the regular work day shall not be compensable but all time spent driving or repairing or maintaining equipment shall be compensable at regular and overtime rates. The parties agree that in connection with such collecting activities at the Queens Wildlife Center, it shall be voluntary with the employee whether or not he/she will go on a collecting trip.
Employees in the bargaining unit who are called in from home to work overtime and who perform such overtime work as is required of them shall receive overtime compensation for not less than four (4) hours.
Employees who are detained at work for overtime purposes and who perform such overtime work as is required of them shall receive overtime compensation for not less than one (l)hour.
Any overtime work necessary in connection with preparations for the Annual Meeting or Garden Party of the Society, or for the opening of exhibits, but not otherwise, shall be offered, in the order of departmental seniority in the titles which have traditionally performed such work, but only to employees in said titles who are qualified to perform the particular work. If such offers are refused by all qualified employees in said title(s), the Society may require the work to be performed by the qualified employee(s) having the least departmental seniority in said title(s).
Subject to all the foregoing provisions, employees shall work overtime at such times and for such periods as may be reasonably required by their supervisors.
ARTICLE 6 HOLIDAYS
A.	For employees in the bargaining unit (exclusive of laborers who shall receive holidays in accordance with the determination made under Section 220 of the Labor Law), the following shall be paid holidays, irrespective of the day of the week on which they occur:

Employees and their Supervisors shall also be notified when leave balances are approaching the cap. If use of time is denied, there shall be a three (3) month grace period in which employees may use excess leave balances. The Society reserves the right to make corrections concerning leave balances reported to the employee.. For annual leave computation purposes, years of service and seniority shall include prior Society service.
B.	Employees may accrue, and carry over from year to year, a maximum of sixty (60) earned days and sixty (60) annual leave days.

B.	No provision herein shall be construed either to increase or decrease the sick leave accumulated for any employee as of the effective date of this Agreement.

12
certificate from the employee’s attending physician or an examination or consultation by a physician selected by it. In the case of protracted illness, additional certificates or examinations may be required. Certificates from attending physicians will not normally be required for absence due to illness for three (3) days or less. For illnesses longer than three (3) days, the employee shall be required to produce a note from the treating physician stating the anticipated date of return.
G.	Upon the resignation, retirement or severance of an employee (and whether he/she is then on sick leave or not), he/she shall not be entitled to any further sick leave benefits nor to any payment on account of unused sick leave, except as hereinafter provided in respect to computing terminal leave.
H.	If an employee who has been laid off is reinstated to a permanent position, any unused sick leave balance at the time of his/her layoff shall be restored to his/her credit.
I.	At the written request of an employee and upon verification, his/her annual leave shall be changed to sick leave when during annual leave the employee is hospitalized. Such sick leave usage may also include a reasonable convalescent period. The decision on a reasonable convalescent period is at the General Director's sole discretion and the decision of the General Director in the exercise of such a matter of such discretion shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
J.	The Society may grant to an employee, at its discretion, up to three (3) days per year of accumulated sick leave for care of ill members of the immediate family upon submission of proof, by the employee, of said family member's disability, to the Society's satisfaction, within five (5) work days after his or her return to work. The term “immediate family” means spouse or domestic partner, child, brother, sister, mother, father, mother-in-law, father-in-law, grandparent, grandchild, or any relative residing in the employee's household.
K.	When an employee who has fewer than ten (10) sick leave days and is absent from work on a scheduled workday immediately before or after: (a) a holiday or holidays, including the holiday (b) the employee’s scheduled annual leave day, or (c) the employee’s scheduled earned leave day, approval of sick leave is discretionary.

Dear Ms. Roberts and Mr. Herkommer:
In an effort to simplify the application for those who will administer Article X, Section C of the 2008-2010 collective bargaining agreement, the following language is introduced to address the matter:
If the employee advises his/her supervisor that he/she intends to return to work, but because of documented exigent circumstances is unable to do so, the leave-period is reinstated for the time remaining. Should the employee not return to active employment upon expiration of the period of leave, the employee will be considered to have abandoned his/her job.
All parties agree to use this language to address the Personal Leave of Absence provision, Section C as stated above.
Sincerely,
Zulma M. Rivera
Accepted and Agreed:
