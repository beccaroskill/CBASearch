If the Appointing Authority has reason to reprimand a supervisor, it shall be done in such a manner that will not embarrass the supervisor before other employees, supervisors, or the public.
When any disciplinary action more severe than an oral reprimand is intended, the Appointing Authority shall, before or at the time such action is taken, notify the supervisor in writing of the specific reason(s) for such action, with a copy to the Association Executive Director.
The Appointing Authority may discipline a supervisor before such notification is given if extenuating circumstances exist. The Appointing Authority will provide the supervisor with such notification within one working day, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, after such action.
Section 3.	Investigatory Leave. The Appointing Authority may place a supervisor who is the subject of an investigation on an investigatory leave with pay. The Appointing Authority shall as soon as practicable upon placing an employee on investigatory leave, notify the employee in writing of the reason(s) for such action.
Section 4.	Investigatory Interview. The Appointing Authority shall not meet with a supervisor for the purpose of questioning a supervisor during an investigation that may lead to discipline of that supervisor without first offering the supervisor an opportunity for MMA representation. Any supervisor waiving the right to such representation must do so in writing prior to the questioning. However, a supervisor may initially waive the right to representation orally in the case of a phone interview. A copy of such waiver shall be furnished to the Association. The supervisor shall be advised of the principal allegations being investigated and, if known, the alleged time and place of occurrence prior to questioning. However, if any supervisor, who is not the subject of the investigation, is being questioned during an investigation of resident/patient abuse, the supervisor, upon request, shall have the right to Association representation.
Notification of status of the investigation will normally be provided to the Association within thirty (30) days of the interview.
3
Section 5.	Discharge of Permanent Supervisors. The Appointing Authority shall not discharge any permanent supervisor without just cause.
If the Appointing Authority believes there is just cause for discharge, the supervisor and the Association will be notified, in writing, that a supervisor is to be discharged and shall be furnished with the reason(s) therefore and the effective date of the discharge. The supervisor may request an opportunity to hear an explanation of the evidence against him/her, and to present his/her side of the story and is entitled to Association representation at such meeting, upon request. The right to such meeting shall expire at the end of the next scheduled work day of the supervisor after the notice of discharge is delivered to the supervisor unless the supervisor and the Appointing Authority agree otherwise. The discharge shall not become effective during the period when the meeting may occur. The supervisor shall remain in pay status during the time between the notice of discharge and the expiration of the meeting. However, if the supervisor was not in pay status at the time of the notice of discharge, for reasons other than an investigatory leave, the requirement to be in pay status shall not apply.
A supervisor found to be unjustly discharged shall be reinstated in accordance with the conditions agreed to between the parties if appropriate or the decision of the arbitrator.
Section 6.	Unclassified Supervisors. The termination of unclassified supervisors is not subject to the arbitration provisions of this Agreement.
The provisions of Section 1 of this Article shall not apply to this Section.
Section 7.	Personnel Records. Initial minor infractions, irregularities, or deficiencies shall first be privately brought to the attention of the supervisor and, if corrected, shall not be entered into the supervisor’s personnel record.
Oral reprimands and letters of expectation shall not become a part of a supervisor's personnel record. Investigations which do not result in disciplinary actions shall not be entered into the supervisor's personnel records.
Upon the request of the supervisor, a written reprimand shall be removed from the supervisor's personnel record provided that no further disciplinary action has been taken against the supervisor for a period of one (1) year following the date of the written reprimand.
Upon the request of the supervisor, a suspension of ten (10) days or less shall be removed from the supervisor's personnel record provided that no further disciplinary action has been taken against the supervisor for a period of three (3) years from the initial date of the suspension.
The contents of a supervisor’s personnel office record shall be disclosed to him/her upon request and to the supervisor’s Association Representative upon the written request of the supervisor. In the event a grievance is initiated under Article 7, the Appointing Authority shall provide a copy of any items from the supervisor's personnel office record upon the request of the supervisor.
Only the personnel office record may be used as evidence in any disciplinary action or hearing. This does not limit, restrict, or prohibit the Appointing Authority from submitting supportive documentation or testimony, either oral or written, in any disciplinary hearing, nor does it so limit the Association.
Each supervisor shall be furnished with a copy of all evaluative and disciplinary entries into their personnel office record at or before the time such entry is placed in the record and shall be entitled to place his/her written response to such action in the personnel office record.

ARTICLE 7	- GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1.	Definition of a Grievance. For the purpose of this Agreement, a grievance shall be defined as a dispute or a disagreement as to the interpretation or application of any term or terms of this Agreement.

If the matter cannot be resolved to the supervisor's satisfaction by informal discussion, it shall then be settled in accordance with the following procedure.
The Association shall have the right to take up suspensions, demotions, and discharges at the second step of the Grievance Procedure and the matter shall be handled in accordance with this procedure, if so requested by the Association.
STEP 1. The grievance shall be reduced to writing, setting forth the nature of the grievance, the facts upon which it was based, section or sections of the Agreement alleged to have been violated, and the relief requested and shall be presented to the grievant's immediate superior by an Association Representative or designee. Any alleged violation not processed to this step within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the first occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance or within twenty-one (21) calendar days after the grievant, through the use of reasonable diligence should have knowledge of the first occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance, shall be considered waived. Within ten (10) calendar days after receiving the written grievance, the grievant’s immediate superior or the Appointing Authority's designee and the Association Representative shall arrange a meeting with or without the grievant, in an attempt to resolve the grievance. Failure to arrange a meeting within the above stated ten (10) calendar days shall require the Association to commence the next step filing within the succeeding ten (10) calendar days unless'the parties mutually agree in writing to an extension. If the grievance remains unresolved after this meeting, the immediate superior’s written answer to the grievance shall be given to the Association Representative within ten (10) calendar days of this meeting. The Association may appeal the grievance to Step 2 within ten (10) calendar days of the receipt of the immediate superior's answer.
STEP 2. Within ten (10) calendar days following the receipt of a grievance referred from Step 1, the Appointing Authority or designee shall arrange a meeting with the Association's designee in an attempt to resolve the grievance. Failure to arrange a meeting within the above stated ten (10) calendar days shall require the Association to commence the next step filing within the succeeding ten (10) calendar days unless the parties mutually agree in writing to an extension. Within ten (10) calendar days following this meeting, the Appointing Authority or designee shall respond in writing to the Association Representative stating the Appointing Authority or designee's answer concerning the grievance. If, as a result of the written response, the grievance remains unresolved, the Association may refer the grievance within twenty (20) calendar days to Step 3. Any grievance not referred in writing by the Association to Step 3 within twenty (20) calendar days following receipt of the answer of the Appointing Authority or designee shall be considered waived.
STEP 3. If the grievance remains unresolved, the Association may, within twenty (20) calendar days after the response of the Appointing Authority or designee is due, by written notice to the Assistant Commissioner of Minnesota Management & Budget (State Labor Negotiator) request arbitration of the grievance. The arbitrator shall be selected pursuant to Section 2 of this Article and the hearing shall be scheduled on a date mutually agreeable to the arbitrator and the parties. A supervisor who is eligible and elects to use the procedure under M.S. 197.46 cannot use the arbitration provisions of this agreement.
Section 2.	Arbitration Panel. The parties shall employ a list of three (3) permanent arbitrators to decide disputes arising under this collective bargaining agreement.
5
Section 3.	Arbitration Hearing Site. The arbitration hearing site shall be determined by mutual agreement of the State Negotiator and Association. If mutual agreement cannot be reached, the hearing site shall be determined, in a pre-hearing conference, by the arbitrator chosen to hear the case.
Section 4.	Arbitrator's Authority. The arbitrator shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the specific issue submitted in writing by the Employer and the Association and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other issue not so submitted to him/her. The arbitrator shall be without power to make decisions contrary to or inconsistent with or modifying or varying in any way the application of laws, rules, or regulations having the force and effect of law. The arbitrator shall submit his/her decision in writing within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties whichever is later, unless the parties agree to an extension. The decision shall be based solely on the arbitrator's interpretation or application of the express terms of this Agreement and the facts of the grievance presented. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Association, and the supervisor.
Section 5.	Fees and Expenses. The fees and expenses for the arbitrator's services and proceedings shall be borne equally by the Appointing Authority and the Association, provided that each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and witnesses.
If either party desires a verbatim record of the proceedings, it may cause such a record to be made, provided it pays for the record. If either party desires a transcription of the verbatim record, it shall pay for such transcription and provide a free copy to the arbitrator. Should the other party desire a copy of such transcription, it shall pay the service who took the verbatim record for such copy.
Section 6.	Time Limits. If a grievance was not presented within the time limits set forth above, it shall be considered waived. If a grievance is not appealed to the next step within the specified time limit or any agreed extension thereof, it shall be settled on the basis of the Appointing Authority or designee's last answer. If the Appointing Authority or designee does not answer a grievance or an appeal thereof within the specified time limits, the Association may elect to treat the grievance as denied at that step and immediately appeal the grievance to the next step. The time limit in each step may be extended by mutual written agreement of the Appointing Authority or designee and the Association at each step. By mutual agreement of the Appointing Authority and Association, the parties may waive Step 1.
Section 7.	Processing Grievances. The Association Representative involved and the grieving supervisor shall not leave work or disrupt departmental routine to discuss grievances without first requesting permission from his/her immediate superior, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
The Association Representative and the grieving supervisor shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time during working hours while on the Appointing Authority's premises when a grievance is investigated or presented in Steps 1 and 2.
Section 8.	Expedited Arbitration. The parties may choose to use the following expedited arbitration procedure which has been mutually agreed.

In the event that the arbitrator becomes unable to discharge arbitral duties, or becomes unavailable subsequent to appointment, the parties shall select a replacement by mutual agreement.
6
2.	Total case presentation time will not exceed three (3) hours. If the three (3) hour time limit is exceeded, the arbitrator may assess additional pro rata fees for the hearing time beyond three (3) hours.

ARTICLE 8	- VACATION AND SICK LEAVE
Section 1,	Vacation Eligibility and General Conditions.
A.	Eligibility. Supervisors, except for emergency, temporary, and intermittent appointments shall accrue vacation leave.
B.	Vacation on Initial Entry to State Service. Upon initial entry to State service in a MMA position, an eligible supervisor may be advanced up to eighty (80) hours of vacation leave. Any vacation hours advanced shall be reduced proportionately as actual earned vacation leave is accrued.
7
C.	Accruals. All eligible supervisors shall accrue vacation leave according to the following rates:
Length of Service	Rate Per Full
Requirement	Payroll Period
0 through 5 years	4 working hours
After 5 through 8 years	5 working hours
After 8 through 12 years	7 working hours
After 12 through 19 years	71/z working hours
After 19 through 24 years	8 working hours
After 24 through 30 years	81/z working hours
After 30 years	9 working hours
Length of service is defined as the length of employment with the State of Minnesota since the last date of hire in accordance with Section 1(A). Length of service shall be interrupted only by separation because of resignation, termination, discharge for just cause, failure to return upon expiration of a leave of absence, failure to respond to a recall from layoff, or retirement.
A supervisor shall not suffer a reduction in his/her vacation accrual rate due to being covered by a contract or plan with a vacation accrual scale with a different length of service requirement component than that indicated above.
For purposes of determining changes in a supervisor's accrual rate, periods of suspension or unpaid non-medical leaves of absence shall not be deducted from the Length of Service Requirement unless they are one (1) full payroll period or more in duration. However, for supervisors on an unpaid military leave of any duration, or an FMLA qualifying leave of any duration, no adjustment to accrual rates shall be required. This method will be effective only after this date and shall not be used to change any Length of Service Requirements determined prior to that date.
Changes in accrual rate shall be made effective at the beginning of the next payroll period following completion of the specified Length of Service Requirement.
Supervisors being paid for less than a full eighty (80) hour pay period will have their vacation accruals pro-rated in accordance with the schedule set forth in Appendix C.
D.	Crediting Accruals. A supervisor who is reinstated or reappointed to State service, and within four (4) years from the date of resignation in good standing or retirement shall accrue vacation leave with the same credit for length of service that existed at the time of such separation.
An Appointing Authority may adjust length of service to reflect credit for the supervisor’s previous public sector service including service with the Minnesota Historical Society and the Metropolitan Council. Length of service credit shall be subject to the following conditions:
1.	The supervisor must have been appointed to State service within one (1) year of separation from the other public sector employer.
2.	The only time credited will be for the time the supervisor spent in a vacation eligible position with the other public sector employer.
3.	The supervisor must provide the necessary documentation demonstrating his/her previous vacation eligibility status. 4
4. The amount of the length of service credit granted is at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.
8
An Appointing Authority may, at its discretion, adjust length of service to reflect credit for all, none or a portion of the supervisor’s service in the United States Armed Forces provided the service was full-time and continuous for at least one (1) year. The supervisor must have been appointed to State service within one (1) year of separation from the Armed Forces.
A supervisor may, at any time, request that prior public sector or United States Armed Forces service be credited for purposes of vacation accrual. Changes in the accrual rate will commence effective at the beginning of the next payroll period following the Appointing Authority’s approval of the adjusted rate, and is not retroactive.
Upon request, supervisors of the Legislative Branch who are appointed to the Executive Branch within four (4) years of the date of resignation in good standing or retirement, shall receive credit for their length of service in the Legislative Branch that existed at the time of such transfer or separation for vacation accrual purposes provided that the supervisor was in an eligible status as defined in Section 1(A) of this Article when employed by the Legislative Branch. Such supervisors shall begin accruing vacation leave based on this method effective at the beginning of the first payroll period following the effective date of this Agreement. Supervisors who are appointed without a break in service may be allowed to bring any accumulated but unused vacation leave with them provided that it does not exceed two hundred and seventy-five (275) hours.
Supervisors in the unclassified service of the State who are subsequently appointed to a position in the classified service, or vice versa, without an interruption in service shall have their accumulated but unused vacation leave balance posted to their credit in the records of the employing department provided such vacation leave was accrued in accordance with the personnel rules or the provisions of this or any preceding Agreement.
E.	Accumulation of Vacation. Vacation leave may be accumulated to any amount provided that once during each fiscal year, each supervisor’s accumulation must be reduced to two hundred and seventy-five (275) hours or less. If this is not accomplished on or before the last day of the fiscal year, the amount of vacation shall automatically be reduced to two hundred seventy-five (275) hours at the end of the fiscal year.
Supervisors on a Military Leave under Appendix L shall earn vacation leave as though actually employed, without regard to the maximum accumulation set forth above. Vacation earned in excess of the maximum accumulation shall be taken within two (2) years of the date the supervisor returns from the Military Leave.
F.	Use of Vacation. A vacation leave eligible supervisor may use vacation leave as soon as the supervisor has accumulated or has been advanced such leave hours and the supervisor is not required to wait until being employed six (6) months in State service.
Should a supervisor become ill or disabled while on vacation, vacation leave shall be changed to sick leave, effective the date of illness or disability, upon notice to the supervisor's superior. Upon such notice, supervisors may be requested by the Appointing Authority to furnish a medical statement from a medical practitioner. If requested by the Appointing Authority, such statement shall be provided as soon as possible after the illness or disability occurs.
Supervisor vacation accruals earned while on a paid leave may be used by the supervisor with the approval of the immediate superior without returning to work prior to the use of the accrued vacation leave.
9
Section 2.	Vacation Schedules. Every reasonable effort shall be made to grant vacation at the times requested by the supervisor. The Appointing Authority agrees to respond in a reasonable time to supervisors’ requests for vacation. However, if an early response date is needed by the supervisor, it shall be so stated on the request form and responded to by the Appointing Authority in writing. If the nature of the work makes it necessary to limit the number of supervisors on vacation at the same time, vacation schedules shall be established on the basis of Classification Seniority within a work location in the event of any conflict over vacation periods.
Except in emergencies, as determined by the Appointing Authority, no supervisor will be required to work during the supervisor's vacation once the vacation request has been approved.
Section 3.	Vacation Cashout on Separation. Any supervisor separated from State service shall be compensated in cash, at the supervisor's then current rate of pay, for all earned, but unused vacation leave to the supervisor's credit at the time of separation, but in no case shall payment exceed two hundred and sixty (260) hours except in case of death. Vacation hours advanced pursuant to Section 1(B) but not yet offset by earned vacation shall not be liquidated. Certain supervisors shall have their vacation cashout converted to a Health Care Savings Plan account. See Article 16, Section 10.
Supervisors shall be allowed to leave their accumulated vacation to their credit during the period of seasonal or temporary layoff.
Seasonal supervisors shall have the option to cash out all, some or none of their vacation leave upon seasonal layoff.
Section 4.	Sick Leave Accrual. Supervisors, except for emergency, temporary, and intermittent appointments, shall accrue sick leave at the rate of four (4) hours per pay period of continuous employment beginning with their date of hire.
Supervisors being paid for less than a full eighty (80) hour pay period shall have sick leave accruals pro-rated in accordance with the schedule set forth in Appendix D.
Supervisors on a military leave under Appendix L shall earn and accrue sick leave as though actually employed.
Section 5.	Sick Leave Restoration. A supervisor who is reinstated or reappointed to State service, and within four years from the date of resignation in good standing or retirement shall have accumulated but unused sick leave balance restored and posted to the supervisor’s credit in the records of the employing department provided such sick leave was accrued in accordance with the personnel rules or the provisions of this Agreement and provided that any supervisor being appointed after receiving severance pay shall have his/her leave restored proportionately by deducting the hours paid as severance. This method shall not be used to change sick leave balance restorations determined prior to July 1,1983.
A supervisor who receives severance pay prior to January 9, 2008 and returns to State service on or after January 9, 2008, shall have his/her sick leave balance restored at sixty percent (60%) of the supervisor’s accumulated but unused sick leave balance (which balance shall not exceed nine hundred (900) hours) plus eighty seven and one-half percent (87%%) of the supervisor's accumulated but unused sick leave bank.
A supervisor who receives severance pay on or after January 9, 2008, and returns to State service shall have his/her sick leave balance restored at 65% of the supervisor’s accumulated but unused sick leave.
10
Supervisors in the unclassified service of the State who are subsequently appointed to a position in the classified service, or vice versa, without an interruption in service shall have their accumulated but unused sick leave balance posted to their credit in the records of the employing department provided such sick leave was accrued in accordance with the personnel rules or the provisions of this Agreement.
Upon request, employees of the Legislative Branch who are appointed to the Executive Branch within four (4) years of the date of resignation in good standing or retirement shall have accumulated but unused sick leave posted to the employee's credit provided such sick leave was accrued in accord with the personnel rules or the provisions of this Agreement.
Section 6.	Sick Leave Use. A supervisor shall be granted sick leave with pay to the extent of the supervisor's accumulation for absences necessitated by the following conditions:

11
C.	Sick Leave Procedures. The supervisor shall notify the Appointing Authority at or before his/her normally scheduled starting time of any illness. Supervisors utilizing leave under this Section shall furnish a statement from a medical practitioner upon the request of the Appointing Authority if it has reason to believe that a supervisor has abused or is abusing sick leave. Those supervisors who misuse sick leave may be subject to disciplinary action. The Appointing Authority may also request a statement from a medical practitioner if the Appointing Authority has reason to believe the supervisor is not fit to work or has been exposed to a contagious disease which endangers the health of other supervisors, employees, clients or the public. Supervisors returning from extended sick leave shall notify the Appointing Authority within a reasonable amount of time prior to returning to work.
Section 7.	Sick Leave Charges. A supervisor utilizing sick leave shall be charged for only the number of hours he/she was scheduled to work during the period of his/her sick leave.

Sick leave must be exhausted before the vacation leave or compensatory time can be used. The Appointing Authority shall obtain from the Workers' Compensation Division the amount of the benefit check and automatically authorize a payroll check in the amount of the difference between the benefit check and the supervisor's regular gross pay for the supervisor's normal pay period. The supervisor's sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time balance shall be reduced by the amount of the payroll check divided by the supervisor's hourly rate of pay at the time the payroll check is issued.
A supervisor who uses sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time while awaiting the determination of the Worker’s Compensation claim shall retain the Worker’s Compensation payment.

ARTICLE 11	- HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 1.	Supervisors assigned to Progression Code 2 and supervisors assigned to Progression Code 1 at Salary Range 18 and below.
A.	Consecutive Hours. The regular hours of work each day shall be consecutive except that they may be interrupted by unpaid lunch periods if free from work and each work shift shall include two rest periods of at least 15 minutes each which shall be included in work time.

Supervisors desiring to get off evening and/or night shift duty in continuous operations shall request such reassignments in writing to the Appointing Authority.
17
B.	Normal Work Week. Work week is defined as a fixed, regularly recurring period of seven (7) calendar days designated by the Appointing Authority. It is recognized that because of the nature of their work, some of the supervisors covered by this Agreement may be required to work varied hours, work on holidays and weekends, making the maintaining of consistent starting and stopping times or the assignment of the number of hours worked in one day sometimes impossible. Insofar as practicable and without reducing the efficiency of work performance, supervisors are expected to complete normal routine work within a normal work day.
Supervisor's hours may be adjusted in accordance with circumstances and with the approval of the immediate superior.
C.	Overtime Rates.
1.	Supervisors assigned to Progression Code 2 shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half for all hours worked as assigned by the Appointing Authority in excess of forty (40) within the seven (7) day work week. Paid vacation, sick leave, holidays, compensatory time taken and/or other paid leaves of absence shall be considered hours worked for purposes of this section. •
2.	Supervisors assigned to Progression Code 1 and designated as non-exempt under FLSA shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half for all hours worked as assigned by the Appointing Authority in excess of forty (40) within the seven (7) day work week. Paid sick leave shall be considered as hours worked for purposes of this section. Paid vacation, holidays, compensatory time taken and/or other paid leaves of absence shall not be considered hours worked for purposes of this section.

Holidays, sick leave and compensatory time taken shall be considered hours worked for purposes of this section. Paid vacation, and/or other paid leaves of absence shall not be considered hours worked for purposes of this section.
D.	Liquidation of Overtime.
1.	General. At the supervisor's option, overtime hours shall be paid in cash or assigned to a compensatory bank. Supervisors shall elect each pay period whether all overtime hours ■earned in that pay period shall be paid in cash or assigned to a compensatory bank. This decision shall be recorded on the timesheet each pay period. Should a supervisor fail to indicate on the time report, liquidation shall be in cash.
2.	Compensatory Bank,
a)	Size of Bank. The maximum amount of hours that may be in the compensatory bank at any given time is one hundred twenty (120) hours.
b)	Hours Worked in Excess of Bank. All overtime hours worked over the maximum amount of hours in b-1 shall be compensated in cash.
3.	Cash Liquidation. Overtime hours which are liquidated in cash shall be liquidated on the same or immediately following payroll abstract for the payroll period in which it is earned. Supervisors who choose cash liquidation may still use compensatory time within the same work week/applicable work period. Overtime earned for work on a holiday shall be paid in cash.
18
4.	Compensatory Time Liquidation in Cash. At the option of the Appointing Authority, all or a portion of the compensatory bank may be liquidated in cash at the beginning of the pay periods closest to January 1st, April 1st, July 1st and October 1st, with thirty (30) calendar days advance written notice to the Association. Such liquidation shall be done in a uniform manner for all supervisors of the seniority unit. Such liquidation shall be at the supervisor’s then current rate of pay.
Immediately upon promotion to a supervisory position assigned to Salary Range 19 or above, the Appointing Authority may liquidate some, all or none of the supervisor’s compensatory bank.
A supervisor transferring to the service of another Appointing Authority, accepting a position not represented by the Association, or placed on permanent layoff, shall have unused compensatory time paid in cash at the supervisor’s then current rate of pay. A supervisor placed on seasonal layoff may have unused compensatory time paid in cash, at the option of the supervisor.
Payment of unused compensatory time for supervisors separating from State service shall be at the average regular rate of pay received by the supervisor during the last three (3) years of the supervisor's employment or his/her regular rate of pay as of the date of payment, whichever is greater.
5.	Use of Compensatory Time. Supervisors requesting compensatory time off with fourteen (14) or more calendar days notice to the Appointing Authority shall be permitted to use such time if it does not unduly disrupt the operations of the Appointing Authority, or require payment of additional salary costs. Requests for use of compensatory time off with less than fourteen (14) calendar days notice to the Appointing Authority or for weekend shifts may be granted at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.
The Appointing Authority may schedule compensatory time off for a supervisor with more than forty (40) hours in the compensatory bank by providing him/her no less than fourteen (14) calendar days notice prior to the specified scheduled time off.

Supervisors shall not be permitted to use compensatory time or scheduled to use compensatory time if use will result in the denial of a request to have a holiday off, a denial of a vacation request, or a denial of a discretionary leave request in Article 10.
If it is necessary to limit the number of supervisors in a work unit using compensatory time at the same time, conflicts shall be resolved on the basis of State Seniority within or among class(es) as determined by the Appointing Authority.
DNR supervisors who work overtime hours on out-of-state firefighting shall be paid in cash only.
19
Section 2.	Supervisors designated as exempt under FLSA and assigned to Progression Code 1 at Salary Range 19 and above.
A.	Time Management. Because of the nature of the duties performed by these supervisors, it is impracticable to apply provisions which prescribe normal work hours. However, it is normally expected that eighty (80) hours of work shall constitute a normal payroll period.
It is recognized that these supervisors are responsible for managing and accounting for their own hours of work and that they may work hours in excess of the normal work day and/or payroll period and may make adjustments in hours of work in subsequent work days and/or payroll periods, provided such time management system does not result in overtime payment or guarantee hour-for-hour time off for extra hours worked.
B.	Overtime. Supervisors assigned to a special project that is in addition to their normal duties or workloads and upon having received advance approval shall be compensated as follows:
1.	Such overtime shall be liquidated in cash or compensatory time off at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.
2.	Such overtime shall be compensated at the rate of straight time for hours worked in excess of eighty (80) within the payroll period. Holidays and compensatory time taken shall be considered hours worked for purposes of this section. Paid vacation, sick leave and/or other paid leaves of absence shall not be considered hours worked for purposes of this section.
3.	A compensatory bank when established shall normally not exceed forty (40) hours; however, the Appointing Authority may increase this amount in extraordinary circumstances.
4.	The Appointing Authority shall not be obligated to liquidate in cash overtime hours worked over the established maximum hour limit of the compensatory bank.
5.	The compensatory bank shall be liquidated in leave or converted to deferred compensation (as described in Section 3 below) only and shall terminate if the supervisor leaves his/her seniority unit.
Section 3.	Compensatory Bank. A supervisor may choose to convert some or all of his/her compensatory time bank to deferred compensation one time during each fiscal year, at a time of their choosing using the employee self-service system, as long as the total hours converted in a fiscal year do not exceed forty (40).
Section 4.	Cail Back. Any continuous operations supervisor, or any supervisor in an emergency situation, called back to work after his/her regularly scheduled shift shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours at the appropriate overtime rate.
Call back is unscheduled overtime which is not assigned by the end of the supervisor's last worked shift prior to the overtime assignment. Overtime assigned any time period in advance of the end of the supervisor's last worked shift is not call back.
Supervisors who are called back to work shall use a State vehicle or use their own vehicle and shall be reimbursed mileage for driving to and from their work station and their home.
20
Section 5.	On Call. A supervisor shall be in an on-call status if the supervisor's superior has instructed the supervisor, in writing, to remain available to work during an off duty period. A supervisor who is instructed to be in an on-call status is not required to remain at a fixed location but is required to leave word where he/she may be reached.
A supervisor who is instructed to remain in an on-call status shall be compensated for such time on the basis of fifty dollars ($50) for twenty-four (24) hour period or part thereof, not to exceed a maximum of three hundred fifty dollars ($350) per week.
Section 6.	Flex-Time. Upon agreement of the supervisor's immediate supervisor, an individual flex-time schedule may be established.
ARTICLE 12	- SENIORITY
Section 1.	Seniority. For purposes of this Article, seniority is defined as follows:
A.	State Seniority. "State Seniority" is defined as the length of employment with the State of Minnesota since the last date of hire.
B.	Classification Seniority. "Classification Seniority" is defined as the length of service in a specific job classification within the bargaining unit, beginning with the date an employee starts to serve a probationary appointment.
Classification Seniority shall be interrupted only by separation because of resignation, discharge for just cause, failure to return upon expiration of a leave of absence, failure to respond to a recall from layoff, or retirement.
C.	Bumping, Demotions, Transfers. When a supervisor exercises bumping rights, or is demoting, or is transferring within the bargaining unit, Classification Seniority in the class to which the supervisor is bumping or is demoting, or is transferring shall include Classification Seniority in all related higher or equally paid classes in which the supervisor has served.
Time in a related higher or equally paid class outside of the bargaining unit shall not be used for purposes of bumping back into the bargaining unit. Upon return to the bargaining unit, all time in higher or equally paid classes in the managerial or confidential units shall be credited to a supervisor's Classification Seniority.
D.	Provisional Appointments. In the case of a supervisor working under a provisional appointment, Classification Seniority shall be credited back to the date of hire at the time a supervisor begins to serve a probationary period in a related classification.
E.	Related Classes. "Related Classes" are those classes which are similar in the nature and character of the work performed and which require similar qualifications.
F.	Seniority Units. "Seniority Unit" is defined as set forth in Appendix A.
21
Section 2.	Seniority Rosters. No later than November 30 of each year, the Appointing Authority shall prepare the roster, shall post it on all official bulletin boards, and shall provide one (1) copy to the Association Executive Director and one (1) copy to the designated Association Representative in the seniority unit Such rosters shall be based on transactions occurring up to and through the pay period closest to October 31 of each year. The rosters shall list each supervisor and manager with supervisory seniority in the order of Classification Seniority and reflect each supervisor’s date of Classification Seniority, date of State Seniority, and the date of Classification Seniority and class title for all classes in which the supervisor previously served.
The rosters shall also identify the type of appointment if other than full-time unlimited.
When two (2) or more supervisors have the same Classification Seniority dates, seniority positions shall be determined by total State Seniority. Should a tie still exist, seniority positions shall be determined by lot
Section 3.	Appeals. Supervisors may raise disputes about the seniority roster at any time. Such disagreements shall be limited to changes since the previous listing.
ARTICLE 13	- LAYOFF AND RECALL
Section 1.	Layoff. An Appointing Authority may lay off a supervisor by reason of abolition of the position, shortage of work or funds, or other reasons outside the supervisor's control which do not reflect discredit on the service of the supervisor. A layoff occurs when such conditions continue longer than ten (10) consecutive working days.
Section 2.	Layoff Mitigation Measures. When an Appointing Authority initiates a reorganization planning process or management study which may result in layoff, the Appointing Authority will meet and confer with the Association during the planning phase and again during the implementation phase. The Appointing Authority and the Association shall enter into negotiations regarding a Memorandum of Understanding upon the request of either party to modify this Agreement regarding the implementation plans which shall include, but are not limited to the following:
•	length of the layoff notice;
•	jobs and re-training opportunities;
•	alternative placement methods;
•	early retirement options pursuant to M.S. 43A.24, Subd. 2(i);
•	paid release time to seek other employment;
•	claiming rights;
•	other methods of mitigating layoffs or their effect on supervisors.
Section 3.	Layoff Procedures. In the event a layoff in the classified service of bargaining unit supervisors becomes necessary, the Appointing Authority shall notify the Association and the Association Executive Director of the classifications and number of positions to be eliminated at least thirty (30) calendar days if practicable, but at least twenty-one (21) calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff. At least twenty-one (21) calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff, the Appointing Authority shall give written notice of the layoff, including the reason(s) such action is necessary and the estimated length of the layoff period, to all supervisors about to be laid off and to the Association Executive Director.
Seasonal supervisors shall be laid off in inverse order of Classification Seniority within the supervisor's principal place of employment
22
Notice to supervisors shall include information about how to apply for state vacancies after the date of layoff.
At the Appointing Authority's discretion, a supervisor under notice of permanent layoff may continue in payroll status for up to one hundred sixty (160) hours of paid leave, ending at the date of layoff.
The Appointing Authority may designate a specific date for group selection of layoff options, provided that the Appointing Authority has given at least three (3) weeks notice of layoff prior to the group selection date and that the selection date is not more than ten (10) working days prior to the effective date of layoff.
When an option has been selected, a supervisor may not make a new choice unless an option which did not exist at the time of the original selection becomes available to the supervisor.
Section 4.	Out-of-Seniority Order Layoff. A more senior supervisor in the same classification may be laid off out of seniority order upon his/her request and the approval of the Appointing Authority. By so requesting layoff, the supervisor waives his/her rights in Sections 3, 7 and 8 (in current or different agencies), but maintains the option to have his/her name placed on the layoff list for the class from which the supervisor is laid off.
Section 5.	Limited Interruptions of Employment. Any interruption in employment not in excess of ten (10) consecutive working days, because of adverse weather conditions, shortage of material or equipment, or for other unexpected or unusual reasons, shall not be considered a layoff.
In the event limited interruptions of employment occur, full-time supervisors shall, upon request, be entitled to advance of hours in order to provide the supervisor with up to eighty (80) hours of earnings for a pay period. Advance of hours shall be allowed up to the maximum number of hours of a supervisor's accumulated and unused vacation leave. If a supervisor elects to draw such advances, the supervisor shall not be permitted to reduce his/her vacation accumulation below the total hours advanced. However, except as provided below, no supervisor after the first six (6) months of continuous service shall be denied the right to use vacation time during a limited interruption of employment as long as vacation hours accrued exceed the hours that the supervisor has been advanced under this Section.
The Appointing Authority may require that supervisors use compensatory time before use of vacation or supervisors may elect no. pay. Other than full-time unlimited supervisors may use compensatory time during a limited interruption. With the approval of the supervisor's superior, the supervisor shall have the right to make the hours up.
On the payroll period ending closest to November 1st of each year, all supervisors who have received such advances and have not worked sufficient overtime hours to reduce the advances to zero (0) will have their advances reduced to zero (0) by reduction of the supervisor’s accumulated and unused vacation leave.
However, such advances shall not apply when the limited interruption is the result of a shortage of funds.
Section 6.	Subcontracting. In the event the Appointing Authority finds it necessary to subcontract out work now being performed by supervisors that may result in a displacement of supervisors, the Association shall be notified no less than ninety (90) calendar days in advance. During this ninety (90) day period, the Appointing Authority shall meet with the Association and discuss ways and means of minimizing any impact the subcontracting may have on the supervisors.
23
Section 7.	Layoff. The Appointing Authority shall designate the position(s) in the class/class option which is to be eliminated.
If there is a vacancy within thirty-five (35) miles in the same class (or class option or another option within that class for which the supervisor is determined by the employer to be qualified), seniority unit, and employment condition as the position to be eliminated, the Appointing Authority shall reassign the supervisor holding the position to be eliminated to that vacancy provided the supervisor is qualified for the position.
If there is no such vacancy, the supervisor may exercise the following options in the order set forth below. In lieu of the following options, a supervisor may elect to accept a vacancy in the same seniority unit, in the same class/class option or in an equal or lower class/class option (in which the supervisor has previously served or for which the supervisor is determined by the Employer to be qualified) or in an equal or lesser employment condition.
When a vacancy exists in a class/class option into which the supervisor has a right to bump, the supervisor must accept the vacancy prior to exercising the option to bump except that if the option to bump is within thirty-five (35) miles and the vacancy is more than thirty-five (35) miles, then the supervisor is not required to accept the vacancy.
1.	Bump the least senior supervisor occupying a position in the same class (or class option or another option within that class for which the supervisor is determined by the employer to be qualified), seniority unit, and employment condition within thirty-five (35) miles of the supervisor’s work location provided the supervisor is qualified for the position.
2.	Bump the least senior supervisor occupying a position in the same class (or class option or another option within that class for which the supervisor is determined by the employer to be qualified), seniority unit, and employment condition more than thirty-five (35) miles from the supervisor’s work location provided the supervisor is qualified for the position.
3.	Bump the least senior supervisor occupying a position in the same seniority unit and employment condition in an equal or lower class (or class option) in which the supervisor most recently served (or another option within that class for which the supervisor is determined by the employer to be qualified) within thirty-five (35) miles of the supervisor's work location provided the supervisor is qualified for the position.
4.	Bump the least senior supervisor occupying a position in the same seniority unit and employment condition in an equal or lower class (or class option) in which the supervisor most recently served (or another option within that class for which the supervisor is determined by the employer to be qualified) more than thirty-five (35) miles from the supervisor's work location provided the supervisor is qualified for the position.
If none of the preceding exist or if the supervisor chooses not to accept the preceding, the supervisor shall be laid off.
A supervisor who does not have sufficient Classification Seniority to bump into a previous class shall not forfeit the right to exercise Classification Seniority in bumping into the next previously held class/class option.
Qualified means that the supervisor meets the registration requirements and reasonably meets the experience and/or educational requirements for the position or that the supervisor meets the registration requirements and previously served in any permanent appointment in the class (or class option) in the Agency, except as otherwise required by State or federal rule or law. The Employer's determinations of classification/class option qualification are not grievable nor arbitrable, but the Appointing Authority's determinations of position qualification are grievable and arbitrable.
24
In all cases, the supervisor exercising bumping rights must have greater Classification Seniority in the classification/class option in which the supervisor is bumping than the supervisor who is to be displaced. Supervisors who have accepted an equally or higher paid position excluded from the bargaining unit shall retain full bumping rights into a previously held class/class option within the seniority unit of the same Appointing Authority based upon Classification Seniority, provided the supervisor has exhausted all of the layoff options available under the existing layoff procedure which covers him/her for purposes of layoff.
When two (2) or more supervisors in the same class/class option, seniority unit, and employment condition are being simultaneously laid off, the Association and the Appointing Authority may mutually agree to selection of layoff options among the affected supervisors.
Section 8.	Claiming. In order to avoid a layoff or bump, a supervisor may take a transfer or demotion to a vacancy in another seniority unit in a class/class option for which the supervisor is qualified. Supervisors may not request a transfer or demotion to another Appointing Authority if a comparable vacancy within thirty-five (35) miles of the supervisor's work location is available which the Appointing Authority determines to fill or if the supervisor has previously requested and been offered a vacancy under this provision in the same or a transferable class within thirty-five (35) miles of the current position.
Eligibility for claiming begins on the date of the written notice of layoff and continues until the date of layoff. For a supervisor who has no vacancy or bumping options and must accept layoff, eligibility for claiming shall continue for forty five (45) days if that is later than the actual date of layoff. If the claiming period extends beyond the date of layoff, no severance or vacation liquidation shall be paid to the supervisor until the end of the claiming period. In addition, the supervisor's name shall not be placed on any layoff lists until the end of the claiming period. If the claiming period extends beyond the layoff date, supervisors may waive their post-layoff date claiming rights and the Appointing Authority shall authorize payment of any severance or vacation liquidation and the supervisor will be eligible for placement on appropriate layoff lists.
If the supervisor successfully claims a vacancy but cannot be appointed until after the scheduled layoff date, the current Appointing Authority shall place the supervisor on unpaid leave or, upon mutual agreement, vacation leave until the new appointment begins. Vacation leave usage is not subject to Section 2 of Article 8.
Supervisors who transfer or demote to another seniority unit under this provision and who do not successfully complete the probationary period shall be placed on layoff from their original seniority unit, class, employment condition, and location. Such supervisors are not subject to Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this Article but shall become eligible to be placed on layoff lists in accordance with Section 9 on the effective date of their non-certification.
Also see letter on page 164 regarding an experimental method for supervisors noticed of permanent layoff to demonstrate qualifications for positions to which they may be able to transfer or demote.
25
Section 9.	Layoff Lists.

Section 11.	Removal From Layoff Lists. Supervisors shall be removed from all layoff lists for any of the following reasons:
A.	Recall to a permanent position from the Seniority Unit Layoff List or Bargaining Unit Layoff List/Same Classification. In the event that a supervisor is recalled to a seniority unit other than the one from which he/she was laid off, and the supervisor does not successfully complete the probationary period, such supervisor's name shall be restored to the original Seniority Unit Layoff List for the remainder of the time period originally provided in Section 8A.
When a supervisor is recalled from the Bargaining Unit Layoff List/Other Classification, his/her name shall remain on other layoff lists.
B.	Failure to accept recall to a permanent position within thirty-five (35) miles of the supervisor's previous work location.

E.	Resignation, retirement or termination from State service.
Section 12.	Exclusions. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to unclassified supervisors.
ARTICLE 14	- FILLING OF POSITIONS
Section 1.	Vacancies. A vacancy is defined as a permanent position in the classified service which the Appointing Authority determines to fill. A vacancy is not created by reallocation, unless the incumbent fails to qualify for appointment to the new class.
Prior to filling a vacancy by other means, the Appointing Authority shall reassign a supervisor who has received notice of layoff, to the vacant position if the vacant position is within thirty-five (35) miles in the same class (or class option or another option within that class for which supervisor is determined by the Employer to be qualified), seniority unit, and employment condition as the position to be eliminated.
27
Section 2.	Job Posting. Whenever a vacancy occurs, it shall be posted within the seniority unit for ten (10) calendar days so that qualified supervisors in the same classification may indicate their desire to be considered for the position. The posting shall include the classification/class option, a brief description of the position and the required qualifications. A copy of each posting shall be sent to the MMA Office at the time of the posting. If the ten (10) calendar day posting ends on a weekend or holiday, the expiration date shall be the day following the weekend or holiday. For informational purposes only, each Appointing Authority within a multi-seniority unit agency shall maintain a list of vacancies or copies of job postings for other seniority units within the agency.
With notification to the Association, the Appointing Authority may institute electronic posting.
Section 3.	Filling of Vacancies. All permanent or probationary classified supervisors in the same class and seniority unit who meet the posted qualifications and who express their interest in writing, shall be given consideration for the opening prior to filling the vacancy through other available means. If requested by the supervisor, an interview shall be provided before filling the vacancy.
If a Seniority Unit Layoff List exists for the classification, seniority unit, geographic location, and employment condition, selection shall then be made from qualified supervisors on that list.
If the vacancy is not filled by the Seniority Unit Layoff List, it may be filled by a qualified supervisor exercising claiming rights. Such supervisor may not request a transfer or demotion to another Appointing Authority if a comparable vacancy within thirty-five (35) miles of the supervisor’s work location is available which the current Appointing Authority determines to fill.
If the vacancy remains unfilled and other layoff lists exist for that classification and that geographic location and employment condition, the Appointing Authority shall either:
1)	transfer or promote a current non-probationary permanent supervisory bargaining unit employee, or
2)	recall a qualified supervisor from the following layoff lists in the order set forth below:
A.	Bargaining Unit Layoff List/Same Classification
When recalling from a Bargaining Unit Layoff List/Same Classification, those agencies with multiple seniority units (Education, Corrections, Human Services, MnSCU, Veterans Homes Board) shall recall a qualified supervisor from another seniority unit within that agency before recalling a supervisor from a different agency.
B.	Bargaining Unit Layoff List/Other Classification
If the vacancy is not filled by the use of a layoff list for that classification, geographic location, and employment condition, or by transfer or promotion as noted above, the Appointing Authority may fill the vacancy by the use of any of the following methods:
1.	multi-source recruitment selection system
2.	voluntary demotion
3.	voluntary transfer
4.	reinstatement
5.	other: any other appointment procedure pursuant to statute.
28
Section 4.	Promotional Ratings. Promotional ratings required by the Employer in conjunction with an selection process shall be prepared for each supervisor who is a candidate for that selection process in an objective manner. No supervisor will be rated by a superior who is an applicant for the same selection process. Prior to being processed by the Appointing Authority, the supervisor's final rating shall be discussed with the supervisor by the superior who signs the rating form and a signed copy of the rating shall be furnished to the supervisor.
Section 5.	Transfers Between Agencies. Supervisors may request a transfer to a position under another Appointing Authority by submitting such request in writing to the Personnel Office of the Appointing Authority to which they wish to transfer with a copy to the Personnel Office of the Appointing Authority by which they are currently employed.
When the Appointing Authority to which the supervisor wishes to transfer agrees to the transfer and does not require that the supervisor serve a new probationary period, the supervisor's current Appointing Authority shall agree to the transfer.
ARTICLE 15	- PROBATIONARY PERIOD
Section 1.	Probationary Period. All unlimited appointments to positions in the classified service, except appointments from layoff lists, shall be for a probationary period as follows:
Half to Full-Time positions	Six calendar months
Less than Half-Time positions	Twelve calendar months
Supervisors on their initial appointment to the bargaining unit and appointed to a half to full-time position shall serve a probationary period of nine (9) calendar months.
Notwithstanding the above, an incumbent appointed to a reallocated position shall serve a three (3) month probationary period. The Appointing Authority and the Association may extend the probationary period, not to exceed an additional three (3) months.
A calendar month is defined as the time between the date of employment and the corresponding date in the next following month. Any unpaid leaves of absence in excess of an aggregate total of ten (10) working days shall be added to the duration of the probationary period. The probationary period shall exclude any time served in emergency, provisional, temporary, or unclassified employment Supervisors promoted prior to the completion of their probationary period to a higher classification in the same occupational field and Appointing Authority, shall complete the probationary period in the lower classification by service in the higher classification.
An Appointing Authority may require a probationary period as specified above for transfers and reinstatements. An Appointing Authority may also require a probationary period when a supervisor voluntarily demotes to a position in an agency different from the one presently employed in, or to a classification in which the supervisor has not previously served. All supervisors shall be provided with a mid-probationary review if requested by the supervisor.
Supervisors placed on a layoff prior to the completion of their probationary period shall be required to complete the probationary period upon return from the layoff.
Supervisors laid off more than two (2) years may be required to serve a probationary period.
A supervisor shall be required to serve a probationary period, unless waived in writing by the superior, for the length of time specified above when recalled to a position in a seniority unit other than the one from which he/she was laid off.
29
Section 2.	Noncertification. If the Appointing Authority decides a supervisor cannot successfully complete the probationary period as provided above, such supervisor shall not be certified. However, if the Appointing Authority feels that an extension of the probationary period could result in successful completion of the probationary period, the Appointing Authority may extend the probationary period up to three (3) months. The supervisor will be notified in writing of any extension, with a copy to the Association, prior to the end of the initial probationary period.
Probationary supervisors serving a probationary period may upon request meet with the Appointing Authority, with or without the Association representative, to discuss the non-certification decision.
Supervisors who have permanent status in another classification who fail to be certified in a subsequent probationary period may upon request have a meeting with the Appointing Authority, with or without the Association representative, to discuss the non-certification decision.
Upon request, such supervisors shall be given the reason for the non-certification.
The provisions of Article 6 and Article 7 shall not apply to supervisors serving in an initial probationary period. Additionally, permanent supervisors serving a subsequent probationary period cannot use Article 7 to appeal a non-certification decision.
Section 3.	Trial Period. Supervisors serving a probationary period pursuant to this Article shall have a trial period of two (2) calendar weeks for the purpose of evaluation. During this trial period, the supervisor may elect to return to his/her former position. In the event a supervisor does not successfully complete the remaining probationary period after the two (2) calendar week trial period, the supervisor shall be restored to his/her former position, if vacant. If such vacancy does not exist, the supervisor shall be restored to a vacant position in his/her former classification/class option within the agency and geographic area from which the supervisor came. If no such vacancy exists, the supervisor shall be restored to a position in his/her former classification and agency.
ARTICLE 16-WAGES
Section 1.	Salary Ranges. The salary ranges for classes covered by this Agreement shall be those contained in Appendix F. In the event that supervisors are to be assigned to newly created or newly added bargaining unit classes during the life of this Agreement, the salary range for such class shall be established by Minnesota Management & Budget which will advise the Association and upon request, discuss the new salary range in advance of final establishment. The salary range established by the Department shall be based on comparability and internal consistency between classes in the salary plan. The Employer may assign a class to a higher salary range during the life of this Agreement after consultation with the Association.
Section 2.	Progression. No salary increases shall be granted to supervisors with anniversary dates from July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010. All increases authorized by this Section shall be effective at the start of the pay period nearest to the supervisor’s anniversary date.
Appointing Authorities may withhold step increases because of unsatisfactory service, with written notice to the supervisor. Increases so withheld may subsequently be granted upon certification by the Appointing Authority that the supervisor has achieved a satisfactory level. If an Appointing Authority fails to give the supervisor written notice prior to the supervisor’s anniversary date that a step increase is to be withheld because of less than satisfactory performance, the increase shall be granted. The substantive judgment of the supervisor’s superior regarding his/her performance is not grievable/arbitrable; however, the withholding of a step increase is grievable/arbitrable.
30
A.	Progression for Supervisors Assigned to Progression Code 1, as Identified in Appendix F. Supervisors may receive a one-step salary increase annually on their anniversary date until reaching the maximum rate in their salary range, provided satisfactory performance is indicated by their Appointing Authority.
Authorized increases shall be recommended in the context of performance measured against specific performance standards or objectives. Increases will not be recommended for supervisors who have not met, or only marginally attained, performance standards or objectives.
The anniversary date for all persons employed on or before May 30, 1973, shall be May 30. For those reinstated from a leave of absence during the period May 30, 1973, through June 30, 1975, the anniversary date shall be the month and date of such reinstatement. After June 30, 1975, reinstatement from a leave of absence shall not change a supervisor's anniversary date. For all supervisors employed, promoted, reinstated after resignation or retirement, or reemployed after May 30,1973, the anniversary date shall be the month and date of such action.
B.	Progression for Supervisors Assigned to Progression Code 2, as Identified in Appendix F. Advancement from step one to step two and from step two to step three shall occur semiannually. Supervisors at or beyond the third step shall advance to the next higher step in their salary range annually until the maximum rate of pay is attained.
Section 3.	Achievement Awards.
Individual Achievement Awards. Any supervisor who has demonstrated outstanding performance may receive an achievement award in the form of 1) a lump sum payment of $1,600, or 2) a one step salary increase. The form of the achievement award, either 1) or 2) above, shall be at the discretion of the Appointing Authority. If the supervisor’s salary is at or above the maximum salary rate for his/her salary classification, the achievement award shall be paid as a lump sum. The receipt of an achievement award as a step increase shall not change the supervisor’s anniversary date nor affect the timing of future progression increases. In no instance during a fiscal year shall achievement awards be granted to more than forty (40) percent of the number of supervisors authorized at the beginning of the fiscal year, except that in seniority units of three (3) or fewer supervisors, the Appointing Authority may grant one (1) achievement award in each seniority unit.
Section 4.	Salary Upon Class Change.
A.	Promotion. Supervisors who are promoted during the life of this Agreement shall be granted a salary increase of at least one (1) step or shall be paid at the minimum of the higher range, whichever is greater.
B.	Voluntary Transfer. A supervisor who transfers within the same class shall receive no salary adjustment. A supervisor who transfers between classes shall receive the minimum adjustment necessary to bring his/her salary up to the minimum salary for the new class or up to a published salary rate for the class. However, a supervisor receiving a rate of pay in excess of the range maximum shall continue to receive that rate of pay.
C.	Voluntary Demotion for Other than Cause. A supervisor who takes a voluntary demotion or a demotion in lieu of layoff shall retain his/her present salary unless that salary exceeds the maximum rate of pay for the new position in which case the supervisor's salary shall be adjusted to the new maximum. However, a supervisor may continue to receive a rate of pay in excess of that maximum upon the recommendation of the Appointing Authority and approval of the Commissioner of Minnesota Management & Budget.
31
D.	Demotion for Cause. A supervisor who is demoted for cause shall receive a salary rate within the range for the class to which he/she is demoted.
E.	Reallocation. If a position is reallocated to a class in a lower salary range, and the salary of the supervisor exceeds the maximum of the new range the supervisor shall be placed in the new class and shall retain his/her current salary. In addition, the supervisor shall receive any across the board or conversion increases as provided by this Agreement.
if the incumbent of a position which is reallocated to a higher classification receives a probationary appointment to the reallocated position, pay for the reallocated position shall commence fifteen (15) calendar days after Minnesota Management & Budget receives a reallocation request determined by Minnesota Management & Budget to be properly documented, and the payment shall continue from that date until the effective date of the probationary appointment
Such payment does not apply to reallocations resulting from department or division or group studies initiated by Minnesota Management & Budget or the Appointing Authority. The Commissioner of Minnesota Management & Budget shall determine when such payment is appropriate.
F.	Non-certification during Probationary Period. A supervisor who is not certified to permanent status and returns to his/her former class shall have his/her salary restored to the same rate of pay the supervisor would have received had he/she remained in the former class.
Section 5.	Shift Differential.

Section 6.	Work Out of Class. When a supervisor is expressly assigned to perform substantially all of the duties of a position allocated to a different class that is temporarily unoccupied and the work out of class assignment exceeds ten (10) consecutive work days in duration, the supervisor shall be paid for all such hours at the supervisor's current salary when assigned to work in a lower or equal class or at a rate within a higher range which is equal to the minimum rate for the higher class or at least one (1) step higher than the supervisor's current salary, whichever is greater. When a supervisor is assigned to serve in a class for which he/she is on a layoff list, the supervisor shall be paid as provided above or the maximum step previously achieved by the supervisor, whichever is greater.
Section 7. Severance Pay. All supervisors who have accrued twenty (20) years or more continuous State service shall receive severance pay upon any separation except for discharge for just cause from State service. Supervisors with less than twenty (20) years continuous State service shall receive severance pay upon retirement at or after age 65; death; or layoff, except for seasonal layoffs. Supervisors who retire from State service after ten (10) years of continuous service and who are immediately entitled at the time of retirement to receive an annuity under a State retirement program shall, notwithstanding an election to defer payment of the annuity, also receive severance pay. Certain supervisors shall have their severance pay converted to a Health Care Savings Plan. See Article 16, Section 10.
Severance pay shall be equal to thirty-five (35) percent of the supervisor’s accumulated but unused sick leave times the supervisor's regular rate of pay at the time of separation.
Supervisors who have been laid off and received severance pay and are reappointed to State service are eligible for additional severance only if they meet the continuous State service requirement.
32
Supervisors who have received severance as a result of continuous State service and are reappointed to State service are eligible for additional severance upon separation.
Severance for eligible supervisors returning to State service shall be computed upon the difference between the amount of accumulated but unused sick leave restored to the supervisor's credit at the time the supervisor was reappointed and the amount of accumulated but unused sick leave at the time of the supervisor's subsequent eligibility for severance pay.
Such severance pay shall be excluded from retirement deductions and from any calculations in retirement benefits and shall be paid over a period not to exceed two (2) years from termination of employment. In the event that a terminated supervisor dies before all or a portion of the severance pay has been disbursed, that balance due shall be paid to a named beneficiary or, lacking same, to the deceased's estate.
Section 8.	Health Care Savings Plan. The following supervisors shall have one hundred percent (100%) of severance pay and one hundred percent (100%) of vacation payout converted to a Health Care Savings Plan (HCSP):

2)	Supervisors retiring with less than twenty (20) years of continuous State service and eligible to receive severance pay;
3)	Supervisors with twenty (20) or more years of continuous State service who are laid off.
Supervisors who do not meet the criteria for the Health Care Savings Plan or whose severance and vacation payouts total less than five hundred dollars ($500) will continue to receive such payments in cash.

2.	Supervisors on Layoff. A classified supervisor who receives an Employer Contribution, who has three (3) or more years of continuous service, and who has been laid off, remains eligible for an Employer Contribution and all other benefits provided under this Article for an extended benefit eligibility period of six (6) months from the date of layoff.
36

In the event the supervisor, while on permanent layoff, is rehired to any state job classification, the supervisor shall continue to receive the employer contribution toward the six (6) months of employer-paid insurance.
However, notwithstanding the paragraph above, in the event the supervisor successfully claims another state job in any agency and classification which is insurance eligible without a break in service, and is subsequently non-certified or involuntarily separated, the six (6) month duration for the employer contribution toward insurance benefits will begin at the time the supervisor is non-certified or otherwise involuntarily separated and is no longer actively employed by the Employer.
3.	Work-related Injury/Disability.

A.	When Coverage May Be Chosen.
1.	Newly Hired Supervisors. All supervisors hired to an insurance eligible position must make their benefit elections by their initial effective date of coverage as defined in this Article, Section 5C. Insurance eligible supervisors will automatically be enrolled in basic life coverage. If supervisors eligible for a full Employer Contribution do not choose a health plan administrator and a primary care clinic by their initial effective date, they will be enrolled in a Benefit Level Two clinic (or Level One, if available) that meets established access standards in the health plan with the largest number of Benefit Level One and Two clinics in the county of the supervisor’s residence at the beginning of the insurance year.
2.	Eligibility Changes. Supervisors who become eligible for a full employer contribution must make their benefit elections within thirty (30) calendar days of becoming eligible. If supervisors do not choose a health plan administrator and a primary care clinic within this thirty (30) day timeframe, they will be enrolled in a Benefit Level Two clinic (or Level One, if available) that meets established access standards in the health plan with the largest number of Benefit Level One and Two clinics in the county of the supervisor’s residence at the beginning of the insurance year.
If supervisors who become eligible for a partial Employer Contribution choose to enroll in insurance, they must do so within thirty (30) days of becoming eligible or during open enrollment.

The election change must be due to and correspond with the change in status. A supervisor who receives notification of a work location change between the end of an open enrollment period and the beginning of the next insurance year, may change his/her health or dental plan within thirty (30) days of the date of the relocation under the same provisions accorded during the last open enrollment period. A supervisor or retired supervisor may also change health or dental plans in any other situation in which the Employer is required by applicable federal or state law to allow a plan change.

1.	Changes Due to a Life Event. After the initial enrollment period and outside of any open enrollment period, a supervisor may elect to change health or dental coverage (including adding or canceling coverage) and any applicable supervisor contributions in the following situations (as long as allowed under the applicable provisions, regulations, and rules of the federal and state law in effect at the beginning of the plan year).
The request to change coverage must be consistent with a change in status that qualifies as a life event, and does not include changing health or dental plans, which may only be done under the terms of Section 5A above. Any election to add coverage must be made within thirty (30) days following the event, and any election to cancel coverage must be made within sixty (60) days following the event.

d.	A dependent ceasing to satisfy eligibility requirements for coverage due to attainment of age, student status, marital status, or other similar circumstances.
e.	A change in the place of residence of the supervisor, retiree or their spouse, or dependent.

3.	Canceling Supervisor Coverage. A part-time supervisor may also cancel supervisor coverage within sixty (60) days of when one of the life events set forth above occurs.
4.	Effective Date of Benefit Termination. Medical, dental and life coverage termination will take effect on the first of the month following the loss of eligible supervisor or dependent status. Disability benefit coverage terminations will take effect on the day following loss of eligible supervisor status.
C.	Effective Date of Coverage.

A supervisor must be actively at work on the initial effective date of coverage, except that a supervisor who is on paid leave on the date State-paid life insurance benefits increase is also entitled to the increased life insurance coverage. In no event shall a supervisor’s dependent’s coverage become effective before the supervisor’s coverage.
If a supervisor is not actively at work due to supervisor or dependent health status or medical disability, medical and dental coverage will still take effect. (Life and disability coverage will be delayed until the supervisor returns to work.)
2.	Delay in Coverage Effective Date.
a.	Basic Life. If a supervisor is not actively at work on the initial effective date of coverage, coverage will be effective on the first day of the supervisor’s return to work.

41
b.	Medical and Dental. If a supervisor is not actively at work on the initial effective date of coverage due to a reason other than hospitalization or medical disability of the supervisor or dependent, medical and dental coverage will be effective on the first day of the supervisor’s return to work.

In addition, a person in the following categories may, as allowed in section 5D1 above, make certain changes: (1) a former supervisor or dependent on continuation coverage, as described in Section 2D, may change plans or add coverage for health and/or dental plans on the same basis as active supervisors; and (2) an early retiree, prior to becoming eligible for Medicare, may change health and/or dental plans as agreed to for active supervisors, but may not add dependent coverage.

Once the supervisor elects to sign the waiver of recall, such supervisor shall not be able to exercise his/her seniority rights for recall for the duration of the summer school. The Appointing Authority agrees to provide a signed copy of any waiver of recall to both the Association and the supervisor.
Any waiver of recall by a supervisor is not to be considered a refusal to return to work and shall not be considered to be a break in continuous service. This section does not, in any way, constitute a forfeiture of the Appointing Authority's right to recall laid off supervisors, whenever necessary, to carry out the functions and needs of the summer school programs. Notification of intent to return to work may be made in writing and hand delivered, provided that a written receipt of such notification is given.

For supervisors engaged in summer school, prior to July 1 of each year, supervisors shall designate the amount of vacation leave hours to be used. Use of vacation leave hours shall be consecutive.

73

3.	The Appointing Authority agrees that for the purpose of determining an employee's length of service credits for vacation accruals, the Appointing Authority shall use the date the employee was appointed to a trainee classification provided there was not a break in service between the trainee appointment and a probationary appointment. This provision shall be prospective only, and it shall only apply to changes and rates of accrual that may occur in the future.
74
Notice of Shift Change

•	In the final year prior to their retirement or in the first year of employment in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund, if a supervisor has more than six (6) months of active payroll status during a twelve- (12) month period, he/she shall be credited with the full ten percent (10%) for that twelve (12) months.

The supervisor shall pay the remaining monthly portion.
•	if the supervisor has one hundred percent (100%) credit, the Employer shall pay the full Employer contribution for health and dental insurance as specified in Article 17, until the supervisor reaches age sixty-five (65).

•	Subject to the provisions in paragraph C, supervisors will accrue ten percent (10%) credit for each twelve (12) months that the supervisor is in active payroll status in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund and in which the supervisor and the Employer made the statutorily required retirement contributions.
•	in the final year prior to their retirement or in the first year of employment in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund, if a supervisor has more than six (6) months of active payroll status during a twelve- (12) month period, he/she shall be credited with the full ten percent (10%) for that twelve (12) months. If a supervisor has less than six (6) months of active payroll status during a twelve- (12) month period, the supervisor shall receive no credit for that twelve (12) months.
•	Total credit for all years of service will not exceed one hundred percent (100%). The result of the above calculation divided by the number of months until the supervisor reaches age sixty-five (65) is the amount of the monthly Employer contribution until the supervisor reaches age sixty-five (65). The supervisor shall pay the remaining monthly portion.
C.	Conditions for the Early Retirement Incentive and the Pre-Fifty-Five Early Retirement Incentive. The supervisor must be in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund for a minimum of five (5) consecutive years prior to the time of retiring and, during the five (5) years, the supervisor and the Employer were paying the statutorily required contributions to the State Patrol Retirement Fund.

A. Early Retirement Incentive. This incentive is available to supervisors who are at least fifty-five (55) years of age and are covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund (M.S. 352B) and are eligible for an annuity. Supervisors who meet these criteria and retire at or after age fifty-five (55) and on or after the effective date of this MOU, shall be entitled to receive an Employer contribution toward health and dental insurance coverage in accordance with the following:
95
•	Subject to the provisions set forth in paragraph C, supervisors will accrue ten percent (10%) credit for each twelve (12) months that the supervisor is in active payroll status in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund and in which the supervisor and the Employer made the statutorily required retirement contributions.
•	In the final year prior to their retirement or in the first year of employment in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund, if a supervisor has more than six (6) months of active payroll status during a twelve- (12) month period, he/she shall be credited with the full ten percent (10%) for that twelve (12) months. If the supervisor has less than six (6) months of active payroll status during a twelve- (12) month period, the supervisor shall receive no credit for that twelve (12) months.
•	Total credit for all years of service will not exceed one hundred percent (100%).
•	If a supervisor has less than one hundred percent (100%) credit, the appropriate percentage times the monthly Employer contribution for health and dental insurance applicable to the supervisor at the time of retirement is the monthly amount paid by the Employer until the supervisor reaches age sixty-five (65). The supervisor shall pay the remaining monthly portion.
•	If the supervisor has one hundred percent (100%) credit, the Employer shall pay the full Employer contribution for health and dental insurance as specified in Article 17, until the supervisor reaches age sixty-five (65). The supervisor shall be responsible for payment of the employee contribution.
B.	Pre-Fifty-Five Early Retirement Incentive. This incentive is available to supervisors who are covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund and retire on or after the effective date of this MOU, at or after age fifty (50) and before age fifty-five (55). The Employer contribution for the pre-fifty-five retirement incentive shall be equal to one hundred and twenty (120) times the amount of the monthly Employer contribution for health and dental insurance applicable to the supervisor at the time of retirement times the percentage calculated as follows:
•	Subject to the provisions in paragraph C, supervisors will accrue ten percent (10%) credit for each twelve (12) months that the supervisor is in active payroll status in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund and in which the supervisor and the Employer made the statutorily required retirement contributions.
•	In the final year prior to their retirement or in the first year of employment in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund, if a supervisor has more than six (6) months of active payroll status during a twelve- (12) month period, he/she shall be credited with the full ten percent (10%) for that twelve (12) months. If a supervisor has less than six (6) months of active payroll status during a twelve- (12) month period, the supervisor shall receive no credit for that twelve (12) months.
•	Total credit for all years of service will not exceed one hundred percent (100%).
The result of the above calculation divided by the number of months until the supervisor reaches age sixty-five (65) is the amount of the monthly Employer contribution until the supervisor reaches age sixty-five (65). The supervisor shall pay the remaining monthly portion.
96
C.	Conditions for the Early Retirement Incentive and the Pre-Fifty-Five Early Retirement Incentive. The supervisor must be in a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund for a minimum of five (5) consecutive years prior to the time of retiring and, during the five (5) years, the supervisor and the Employer were paying the statutorily required contributions to the State Patrol Retirement Fund.
However, supervisors remain eligible for the Early Retirement Incentive and the Pre-Fifty-Five Early Retirement Incentive if, as a result of a workers’ compensation injury, they must move from a position covered by the State Patrol Retirement Fund to a State position covered by any other State retirement plan. Such supervisors must retire from a position in State service and are subject to all other requirements and conditions of the Early Retirement Incentive or Pre-Fifty-Five Retirement Incentive. The agency in which the workers' compensation injury occurred shall be responsible for paying any Employer contribution under this provision.
Under all conditions, the supervisor must be receiving an Employer contribution for health and dental coverage at the time of retirement.
A supervisor who retires with no Employer contribution for dependent coverage or who terminates dependent coverage following the retirement shall not subsequently be eligible for an Employer contribution for dependent coverage.
Receipt of retirement insurance benefits is dependent on the supervisor completing all required forms and continuing to pay any required premium.
Supervisors eligible to receive an Employer contribution for health and dental insurance coverage shall continue to receive the coverage to which the supervisor was entitled at the time of retirement until he/she reaches age sixty-five (65), subject to any changes in coverage in accordance with this or any subsequent Collective Bargaining Agreement.

APPENDIX G - DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES/DEPARTMENTWIDE
No Layoff Agreement
This Agreement is made between the State of Minnesota and the various bargaining unit representatives with respect to the restructuring of the State's health facility system and opportunities which will be provided employees as change occurs.
This agreement will become effective only if the Legislature substantially authorizes the policy and funding necessary to implement the department's restructuring plan.
The parties agree to the following terms in order to ensure that fair and equitable arrangements are carried out to protect the interest of affected State employees under the restructuring. These terms shall be part of the collective bargaining agreements between the parties and shall be implemented through the Master and Supplemental Agreements.
1)	As a result of changes in the department's service delivery system, no employee of a State operated treatment center or nursing home except a temporary employee or emergency employee shall suffer a reduction in pay or be involuntarily laid off. Hours of work of full-time unlimited employees will not be involuntarily reduced. The hours of work of part-time employees shall not be involuntarily reduced below their current level of employer paid insurance contributions. Within sixty days of the execution of this Agreement, the parties will meet and negotiate regarding the status of intermittent employees. Following these negotiations, the employment condition of intermittent employees shall be changed, if appropriate. Intermittent employees who are laid off shall retain rights under their normal separation procedures.
2)	Reduction in employee numbers will be made through normal attrition and through the provisions detailed in the employee mitigation to layoff section of this agreement.
3)	Nothing in the agreement shall be interpreted as entitling an employee to lifetime employment or as protecting an employee against discharge for just cause.
4)	Employees of the department who move to State operated community based facilities in accord with the restructuring proposal will be guaranteed collective bargaining rights as applicable under M.S. 179A and other rights under M.S. 43A, M.S. 352, and M.S. 354.
5)	Training and retraining of staff who, as a result of restructuring, fill a position in a State operated community based facility, or staff who fill a position within a facility, or between facilities will be the responsibility of the department. The department will make every reasonable effort to coordinate training and retraining with public institutions of postsecondary education.
6)	Procedures for notifying employees affected by the restructuring plans will be negotiated into the collective bargaining agreements or Supplemental Agreements.
7)	Any dispute concerning the interpretation, application or meaning and relationship to the terms of the respective Master or Supplemental Agreements must be resolved by the grievance/arbitration procedures of the appropriate agreements. The terms of this Memorandum are non-precedential.
8)	Every effort will be made to communicate openly and to have common understanding between the State and labor organizations affected by the restructuring plan, including the establishment of joint labor and management committees.
114
9)	The term of this Agreement for each facility extends until the completion of restructuring at that facility.
EMPLOYEE MITIGATION TO LAYOFF SECTION
For employees whose positions will be eliminated by implementation of the department's restructuring plan, a number of options will be offered. If an employee's position is to be eliminated, the following will be simultaneously presented to the employee:
1)	job and training opportunities;
2)	enhanced separation option;
3)	normal separation including recall rights.
In order to reduce involuntary separations otherwise necessary, the most senior employee within a class shall be offered the choice of one of the available options before less senior employees. At the time an offer is made, the employee may select from the options available. Selection of the enhanced separation or normal separation packages preclude exercising any other option. The employee who selects from job and training opportunities [items 1.1-1.7] shall choose from all available job and training opportunities. Once such a selection has been made, the employee is precluded from exercising another option from items 1.1-1.7 at a later time, unless the employee's position is subsequently eliminated as a result of restructuring. An employee who selected the job and training opportunities shall be guaranteed at least one job and training opportunity.
JOB AND RETRAINING OPPORTUNITIES
1.1	A position of comparable duties and same pay within the same employment condition and within the same Regional Treatment Center.
1.2	A position in State operated community based residential or day habilitation services or a position in the technical support group for those services. Such positions would be of comparable duties and same pay and within the same employment condition. Relocation expenses will be paid by the Employer.
1.3	A position which the parties agree can best be filled by upgrading existing staff and for which the employer agrees to pay the cost of necessary training or certification.
1.4	Up to 160 hours training necessary to qualify for a comparable job (i.e., no reduction in pay) and the subsequent offer of that job within the same or another Regional Treatment Center or State nursing home. Relocation expenses will be paid by the Employer.
1.5	A position of comparable duties and same pay, within the same employment condition, at another State agency within a reasonable commuting distance.
1.6	A position of comparable duties and same pay, within the same employment condition at another State agency or Regional Treatment Center. Relocation expenses will be paid by the Employer.
1.7	A position at any State agency pursuant to the activation of M.S. 246.60 by the Commissioner of Minnesota Management & Budget and Administration. Relocation expenses will be paid by the employer.
115
An employee who refuses a job and training opportunity not requiring relocation waives his/her right to enhanced separation. An employee who does not accept a job and training opportunity requiring relocation shall be entitled to select the enhanced separation option or normal separation.
ENHANCED SEPARATION PACKAGE
2.1	Retirement, with employer paid insurance benefits as negotiated under Chapter 605 (1988 Session Laws); or,
2.2	In addition to benefits provided under collective bargaining agreements, a one time enhanced payment not to exceed $7500, based on 5% of the employee's base salary or wage, not to exceed $1250.00, multiplied by the number of yeas of State service. For employees selecting this option, the department agrees not to contest any unemployment insurance determination; or,
2.3	In lieu of the one time enhanced payment, tuition, fees, books, travel expenses, career guidance, and related expenses at a public institution of post-secondary education, up to the amount of the enhanced payment to which the employee would be entitled.

116
2.	The Appointing Authority shall notify the exclusive representatives of the classification(s) and number of positions to be eliminated within the time frame and manner specified in the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	Provisional and emergency employees shall be terminated before the elimination of positions of probationary or permanent employees in the same class and employment condition within the facility.
4.	The Appointing Authority shall post the position(s) by class (or class option), employment condition, seniority unit, and work location that are to be eliminated for a minimum of seven (7) calendar days on all employee bulletin boards where employees in the facility in the class are stationed. When the seven (7) calendar day posting requirement would be met on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the expiration date of the posting shall be the day following the weekend or holiday.
5.	Simultaneously with the above posting, the Appointing Authority shall post the list of available jobs. During the seven (7) day posting period, employees may express a willingness to be at risk. At the end of the seven (7) day period employees for whom a desired option still exists shall be placed at risk and the employees shall indicate their desire to select either mitigation to layoff options 1, 2, or 3. If the employee picks mitigation to layoff option 1, the employee shall also notify the Personnel Office/Job Center in writing of his/her specific job and training opportunity option/position. If the employee picks mitigation to layoff option 2, the employee shall also notify the Personnel Office/Job Center in writing of his/her choice of retirement with Employer contribution to insurance, one-time enhanced payment, or educational payment. Designation of at-risk employees and the awarding of available job and retraining opportunities shall be made in seniority order within the affected classifications.
For employees represented by MAPE and MMA, "seniority" shall be defined as Classification Seniority; for employees represented by MNA, "seniority" shall be defined as Bargaining Unit Seniority; for employees represented by AFSCME, Council No. 5, AFL-CIO, "seniority" shall be defined as State Seniority; and for employees represented by SRSEA "seniority" shall be defined pursuant to Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties.
It is further understood that classifications which are recognized as part of a junior/senior plan shall be treated as one classification for purposes of this Agreement.
6.	At the end of the seven (7) day posting period, if no employee(s) has indicated his/her desire to be declared "at-risk", the least senior employee(s) (as defined in #5 above) shall be notified in writing by the Appointing Authority that he/she is declared to be "at-risk." The employee shall provide written receipt of this notice to the Appointing Authority.
The written notice shall state that the employee may select one of the following employee mitigation to layoff options:
1)	job and retraining opportunities
2)	enhanced separation package
a.	retirement, with Employer contribution to insurance
b.	one-time enhanced severance

Within fourteen (14) calendar days of the receipt of such notice, the employee must notify the Personnel Office/Job Center in writing of his/her intent to select mitigation to layoff option 1, 2, or 3 and the specific option/position within the particular option. At the end of the fourteen (14) day period, the employee may not change the specific option/position that he/she previously selected.

If an employee is on an approved leave of absence at the time his/her position is determined to be "at-risk," the employee shall be notified by certified mail. A copy of such notice shall also be sent to the Union/Local Union/Association office.
An employee on leave at the time his/her position is declared "at-risk" shall be given the opportunity to select option 1, 2, or 3. If he/she selects option 1, the employee shall be able to choose from available job and retraining options at the time his/her leave expires. It is understood this does not prevent an employee from terminating his/her leave and selecting a job and retraining option at the time he/she is declared "at-risk."
8.	The Appointing Authority may, with the agreement of the Union/Local Union/Association office, designate individual employees at risk out of order seniority.
9.	If an employee selects the enhanced separation package or the normal separation package, he/she shall be precluded from selecting a job and training opportunity.
10.	An employee selecting the job and retraining opportunities may choose any of the available options.

Employees may be asked to rank their order of preference of available jobs and retraining options. The employee with the most seniority (as defined in #5 above) shall receive his/her first preference. Subsequent job and retraining options shall be made on the basis of seniority (as defined in #5 above).
11.	Once an employee selects a particular job and retraining opportunity option, the employee is precluded from exercising another job and retraining opportunity option at a later time, unless the employee's position is subsequently eliminated as a result of the Department's restructuring plan (e.g. an employee from Oak Terrace Nursing Home accepts a position at another Regional Treatment Center and the employee's position at the RTC is subsequently eliminated because of the Department's restructuring plan).

Employees in new positions represented by other bargaining units which were obtained through exercising a job and retraining option pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding and which require additional certification/iicensure shall not subsequently be placed at risk during the period of restructuring at the facility.

Department shall meet with the exclusive representative to discuss the determinations.
Such training shall be on State time and be paid for by the Department
8.

In this situation, the employee shall be considered to have been offered a job in the same employment condition.
9.	If the Commissioners of Minnesota Management & Budget and Administration determine to activate the provisions of M.S. 246.60, the Department of Human Services shall discuss its implementation with the exclusive representatives.

TO: All State Agencies
The Department of Employee Relations and the Middle Management Association met and conferred on the design of an experimental project under M.S. 43A.04, Subd. 9. The experiment waives the provisions of M.S. 43A.15, Subd. 6 which requires employees to qualify prior to transferring or demoting. Instead, agencies may agree to allow supervisors noticed of permanent layoff to demonstrate their qualifications for transfer or demotion through on the job experience and training.
Under the experiment, a supervisor noticed of permanent layoff identifies a vacancy in the same or another agency and provides information on his/her qualifications. If the supervisor qualifies for the vacancy through the normal DOER selection process, the agency considers the supervisor for appointment under existing contract provisions regarding layoff options (within the same agency) or claiming (different agency). This experiment does not modify or diminish the layoff and claiming rights of a supervisor who qualifies to transfer or demote to the new class through the testing process. If the supervisor does not qualify through the normal selection process but the agency believes he/she could through time on the job, the agency should contact their DOER Staffing Representative regarding participation in this experiment.
For appointments covered by this experiment, the supervisor will be placed in trainee status for up to eighteen (18) months in the position to demonstrate his/her qualifications. If, at the end of the eighteen (18) month period, the agency and DOER agree the supervisor has achieved the necessary knowledges, skills and abilities, the supervisor will receive a probationary appointment to the new class. If, at any time during that period, the agency determines the supervisor is not qualified, the supervisor will be placed on layoff from his/her original seniority unit as described in Section 7 of the agreement for supervisors who do not successfully complete the probationary period after a claim.
Sincerely,
Julie M. Vikmanis /s/ Staffing Manager

RE: Article 6, Discipline
Dear Rebecca:
The parties have agreed in the course of bargaining to the following:
1.	Any implementation of a discipline or corrective action program other than what is explicitly described in Article 6 of the Master Agreement, will require the consent of the Association.
2.	When the time has expired for discipline to remain in a supervisor's personnel file, the parties agree that the record of discipline cannot be used in any subsequent disciplinary arbitration. However, the parties do agree that the Employer is allowed to use subsequently the fact from the old discipline case that the employee was given notice of what was expected and the possibility of discipline for failure to comply.
