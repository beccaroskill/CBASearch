INSIDE WIREMAN AGREEMENT
Agreement by and between the Washington, D.C. Chapter, National Electrical Contractors Association and Local Union No. 26, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
It shall apply to all firms who sign a Letter of Assent to be bound by this Agreement.
As used hereinafter in this Agreement, the term '’Chapter” shall mean the Washington, D.C. Chapter, National Electrical Contractors Association and the term "Union” shall mean Local Union No. 26, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
The term "Employer” shall mean an individual firm who has been recognized by an assent to this Agreement.
The term "Employee” or "Employees" as used hereinafter shall mean the worker or workers covered by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES
This Agreement is based upon the following set of Fundamental Principles, affirmed by the parties hereto:
1.	Close contact and a mutually sympathetic interest between Employee and Employer will develop a better working system which will tend constantly to stimulate production while improving the relationship between the Employee, Employer and the community.
2.	The right of Employees and Employer in local groups to establish wage scales and local working rules is recognized.
3.	Strikes and lockouts are detrimental to the interests alike of Employee, Employer and the general public, and should be avoided.
4.	Public welfare, as well as the interests of the trade, demands that electrical work be done by the electrical industry.
5.	The public interest is served, hazard to life and property is reduced, and standards of work are improved by fixing an adequate minimum of qualifications in knowledge and experience as a requirement precedent to the right of an individual to engage in the electrical construction industry, and by the rigid inspection of electrical work, old and new.
2
6.	Agreements and understandings which are designed to obstruct directly or indirectly the free development of trade, or to secure to special groups special privileges and advantages, are subversive of the public interest and cancel the doctrine of equality of rights and opportunity, and should be condemned.
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
EFFECTIVE DATE - TERMINATION - AMENDMENTS
Section 1.01. TERM. This Agreement shall take effect June 1, 2003, and shall remain in effect until May 31, 2006, unless otherwise specifically provided for herein. It shall continue in effect from year to year thereafter, from June 1 through May 31 of each year, unless changed or terminated in the way later provided herein.
Section 1.02. CHANGES, TERMINATION. & UNRESOLVED ISSUES, (a) Either party or an Employer withdrawing representation from the Chapter or not represented by the Chapter, desiring to change or terminate this Agreement must provide written notification at least 90 days prior to the expiration date of the Agreement or any anniversary date occurring thereafter.
(b)	Whenever notice is given for changes, the nature of the changes desired must be specified in the notice, or no later than the first negotiating meeting, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
(c)	The existing provisions of the Agreement, including this Article, shall remain in full force and effect until a conclusion is reached in the matter of the proposed changes.
(d)	Unresolved issues or disputes arising out of the failure to negotiate a renewal or modification of this Agreement that remain on the 20Ih of the month preceding the next regular meeting of the Council on Industrial Relations for the Electrical Contracting Industry (CIR) may be submitted jointly or unilaterally to the Council for adjudication. Such unresolved issues or disputes shall be submitted no later than the regular meeting of the Council following the expiration date of this Agreement or any subsequent anniversary date. The Council’s decisions shall be final and binding.
(e)	When a case has been submitted to the Council, it shall be the responsibility of the negotiating committee to continue to meet weekly in an effort to reach a settlement on the local level prior to the meeting of the Council.
3
(f)	Notice of a desire to terminate this Agreement shall be handled in the same manner as a proposed change.
Section 1.03. AMENDMENTS BY MUTUAL CONS ENT. This Agreement shall be subject to change or supplement at any time by mutual consent of the parties hereto. Any such change or supplement agreed upon shall be reduced to writing, signed by the parties hereto, and submitted to the International Office of the IBEW for approval, the same as this Agreement.
Section 1.04. NO STRIKE OR LOCKOUT. There shall be no stoppage of work either by strike or lockout because of any proposed changes in this Agreement or dispute over matters relating to this Agreement. All such matters must be handled as stated herein.
Section 1.05. LABOR-MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE. There shall be a Labor-Management Committee of three (3) representing the Union and three (3) representing the Employers. It shall meet regularly at such stated times as it may decide. However, it shall also meet within 48 hours when notice is given by either party. It shall select its own Chairman and Secretary. The Local Union shall select the Union representatives and the Chapter shall select the Management representatives.
Section 1.06. GRIEVANCES. All grievances or questions in dispute shall be adjusted by the duly authorized representative of each of the parties to this Agreement. In the event that these two are unable to adjust any matter within 48 hours, they shall refer the same to the Labor-Management Committee.

Four members, two from each of the parties hereto, shall be a quorum for the transaction of business, but each party shall have the right to cast the full vote of its membership and it shall be counted as though all were present and voting. The Committee's decision shall be final and binding on both parties hereto.
Section 1.08. CIR. Should the Labor-Management Committee fail to agree or to adjust any matter, such shall then be referred to the Council on Industrial Relations for the Electrical Contracting Industry for adjudication. The Council's decisions shall be final and binding.
Section 1.09. PENDING ADJUSTMENT. When any matter in dispute has been referred to conciliation or arbitration for adjustment, the provisions and conditions prevailing prior to the time such matters arose shall not be changed or abrogated until agreement has been reached or a ruling has been made.

4

ARTICLE II
EMPLOYER RIGHTS - UNION RIGHTS
Section 2.01. LABOR ORGANIZATION ASSISTANCE.
(a)	REMOVAL - UNION RIGHT. This Agreement does not deny the right of the Union or its representatives to render assistance to other labor organizations by removal of workers from jobs when necessary and when the Union or its proper representative decide to do so; but, no removal shall take place until notice is first given to the Employer involved.
(b)	UNION RESPONSIBILITY. When such removal takes place, the Union or its representative shall direct the workers on such job(s) to put away tools, material, equipment or any other property of the Employer carefully and safely. The Union will be responsible financially for any loss to the Employer caused by neglect in carrying out this provision, but only when a safe place for such storage is provided by the Employer.
Section 2.02. ANNULMENT SUB-CONTRACTING.
(a)	VIOLATIONS OF IBEW AGREEMENTS. The Local Union is a part of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, and any violation or annulment by an individual Employer of the approved Agreement of this or any other Local Union of the IBEW, other than violations of Subsection 2.02(b) will be sufficient cause for the cancellation of his Agreement by the Local Union after a finding has been made by the International President of the Union that such a violation or annulment has occurred.
(b)	ASSIGNMENT OF WORK. The subletting, assigning or transfer by an individual Employer of any work in connection with electrical work to any person, firm or corporation not recognizing the IBEW or one of its Local Unions as the collective bargaining representative of his Employees on any electrical work in the jurisdiction of this or any other Local Union to be performed at the site of the construction, alteration, painting or repair of a building, structure or other work will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
All charges of violations of this Subsection shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement covering the procedure for the handling of grievances and the final and binding resolution of disputes.
Section 2.03. JURISDICTION. The Employer recognizes the IBEW as having jurisdiction over the installation, operation, maintenance and repair of all electrical wiring and electrical equipment used in the construction, alteration and repair of buildings, structures, bridges, street and highway work, tunnels, subways, shafts, dams, river and harbor work, airports, mines, all present and future electrical raceways for electrical conductors, wires and cables and such other work as by
5
custom has been performed by members of the IBEW when determined to be within the Inside branch in accordance with the third paragraph of the Section.
All electrical work as defined in the preceding paragraph and all equipment, tools, supports, materials and temporary light and power work used to accomplish such electrical work shall be performed by workers covered by this Agreement.
The Employer understands that the Local Union's jurisdiction—both trade and territorial—is not a subject for negotiations but rather is determined solely within the IBEW by the International President and, therefore, agrees to recognize and be bound by such determination.
Section 2.04. BETTER TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The Union agrees that if during the life of this Agreement it grants to any other Employer in the Electrical Contracting Industry on work covered by this Agreement any better terms or conditions than those set forth in this Agreement, such better terms or conditions shall be made available to the Employer under this Agreement and the Union shall immediately notify the Employer of any such concessions.
Section 2.05.	EMPLOYER QUALIFICATIONS. Certain qualifications, knowledge, experience and proof of financial responsibility are required of everyone desiring to be an Employer in the Electrical Industry. Therefore, an Employer who contracts for electrical work is a person, firm or corporation having these qualifications and maintaining a permanent place of business, a suitable financial status to meet payroll requirements and to meet compensation requirements for injured workers and other insurance or protective requirements, and employing not fewer than one journeyman wireman continuously.
Section 2.06.	EMPLOYEE CONTRACTING. Employees covered by this Agreement shall not contract for any electrical work, except on behalf of their Employer.
Section 2.07.	WORKMEN'S COMPENSATION. Each Employer shall carry workmen’s compensation liability insurance as may be required by the laws of the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and any other state in which such Employer performs work. Such insurance shall be obtained from a company authorized to do business in the state in which work is performed, and each Employer shall furnish certification of its coverage to the Union. Failure to comply with any portion of this Section shall be considered a breach of the whole Agreement between the Employer and the Union.
Section 2.08.	MEDICAL ATTENTION. An employee injured while on the job shall be allowed sufficient time to obtain medical attention and shall be paid for time spent obtaining such attention, such pay not to exceed two (2) hours.
Section 2.09.	JOB ACCIDENT REPORTS. Employees covered by this Agreement shall report all job accidents the same day they occur to the job foreman or, when there is no foreman on the job, to the Employer. The job foreman or, when there is no foreman on the job, the Employer
6
shall send without delay a written report or copy of the accident report to the Employer's office and to the Local Union office when formally requested by the Business Manager or President of the Union.
Section 2.10.	JOINT SAFETY RULES COMMITTEE. The Employer and the Union shall each designate five (5) representatives to the Joint Safety Rules Committee who shall serve until their successors are appointed. The Committee shall meet not less often than once each year to review the OSHA Safety Standards and consider the application of these safety standards within the geographical area of this Agreement.
Section 2.11.	EMPLOYER TELEPHONE. An Employer shall maintain a place of business with a business telephone.
Section 2.12.	WORK FORMS. The Employer shall submit to the Union office a work form for all jobs covered by this Agreement that will take more than one week to complete. This form, furnished by the Union, shall be a postcard form and shall contain the following information: (1) location of the job, (2) class of work-such as new, remodel, etc.—and, (3) approximate starting date.
Section 2.13.	TERMINATION SLIPS. The Local Union shall furnish to the Employer Termination Slips which shall state the reason for termination. One copy shall be given to the Employee, one copy mailed to the Business Manager’s office, one copy retained by the Employer, and one copy sent to the NECA Chapter office. The Termination Slip shall be signed by the job foreman or, when there is no foreman on the job, by the superintendent or other management representative of the Employer. If the Employee is not considered eligible for rehire, the completed termination slip will indicate that such ineligibility is for six months, for one year, or forever. A $20.00 payment shall be due an employee who does not receive a termination slip and his final pay at time of termination (lay-offs only).
Section 2.14.	NOTICE OF VACANCIES. The Employer shall notify the Business Manager of the Union of all vacancies.
Section 2.15.	MANAGEMENT’S RIGHTS. The Union understands the Employer is responsible to perform the work required by the owner. The Employer shall, therefore, have no restrictions except those specifically provided for in the collective bargaining Agreement in planning, directing, and controlling the operation of all his work, in deciding the number and kind of Employees to properly perform the work, in hiring and laying off Employees, in transferring Employees from job to job within the Local Union's geographical jurisdiction, in determining the need and number as well as the person who will act as foreman, in requiring all Employees to observe the Employer's and/or owner's rules and regulations not inconsistent with this Agreement, in requiring all Employees to observe all safety regulations, and in discharging Employees for proper cause.
7
Section 2.16.	LENDING OUT. Employers shall not loan their employees to another Employer.
Section 2.17.	DUES CHECK-OFF. The Employer agrees to deduct and forward to the Financial Secretary of the Local Union—upon receipt of a voluntary written authorization-the additional working dues from the pay of each IBEW member. The amount to be deducted shall be the amount specified in the approved Local Union By-Laws. Such amount shall be certified to the Employer by the Local Union upon request by the Employer.
Section 2.18.	TRAVELING EMPLOYER. An Employer signatory to a collective bargaining agreement or to a letter of assent to an agreement with another IBEW Local Union, who signs an assent to this Agreement, may bring up to four bargaining unit employees employed in that Local Union’s jurisdiction into this Local’s jurisdiction and up to two bargaining unit employees per job from that Local’s jurisdiction to this Local’s jurisdiction for specialty or service and maintenance work. All charges of violations of this section shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this agreement for the handling of grievances with the exception that any decision of a local labor-management committee that may be contrary to the intent of the parties to the National Agreement on Employee Portability, upon recommendation of either or both the appropriate IBEW International Vice President or NEC A Regional Executive Director, is subject to review, modification, or rescission by the Council on Industrial Relations.
Section 2.19.	UNION AS EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE. The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative of all its Employees performing work within the jurisdiction of the Union for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and other conditions of employment.
Section 2.20.	UNION SECURITY CLAUSE. All Employees covered by the terms of this Agreement shall be required to become and remain members in good standing of this Union as a condition of employment from and after the thirty-first day following the date of their employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later. This provision is not applicable where prohibited by law.
Section 2.21.	CREDIT UNION DEDUCTION. Each Employer shall participate in a Local 26 Credit Union deduction plan for any Employee who provides the Employer with proper authorization. The Employer is not obligated to initiate more than one such arrangement for any Employee within any 12-month period.
Section 2.22.	STEWARDS CLAUSE. The Union has the right to appoint Stewards at any shop and/or job where workers are employed under the terms of this Agreement. The Employer shall be notified and furnished the name of the Steward. The primary function and job of any worker appointed Steward shall be that of a Journeyman Wireman. The Stewards shall be allowed reasonable time during the regular working hours without loss of pay to see that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are observed at any such shop or job. No Steward shall be
8
discriminated against by any Employer because of his faithful performance of duties as a Steward, nor shall any Steward be removed from the job until notice has been given to the Business Manager of the Union.
Section 2.23.	VOLUNTARY COPE CONTRIBUTION. The Employer agrees to deduct the amount of $.05 per hour for each hour worked from the wages of those employees who voluntarily authorize such deductions. These contributions will be used to fund the Local 26 Political Action Committee. These transmittals shall occur monthly, and shall be accompanied by a list of names of those for whom such deductions have been made and the amount deducted for each employee included in the benefit reporting form.
Section 2.24.	FOREMAN CALL-BY-NAME. The Employer shall have the right to call Foremen by name provided:

weeks.
(2)	The Employer shall notify the Business Manager in writing of the name of the individual who is requested for employment as a Foreman. Upon such request, the Business Manager shall refer said Foreman provided the name appears on the highest priority group.

All other physical locations where workers report for work are each considered to be a single, separate job site.
Section 7.13.	APPRENTICE SUPERVISION. An apprentice is to be under the supervision of a Journeyman Wireman at all times. This does not imply that the apprentice must always be in-sight-of a Journeyman Wireman. Journeymen are not required to constantly watch the apprentice. Supervision will not be of a nature that prevents the development of responsibility and initiative. Work may be laid out by the employer’s designated supervisor or journeyman based on their evaluation of the apprentice’s skills and ability to perform the job tasks. Apprentices shall be permitted to perform job tasks in order to develop skills and trade competencies. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice.
26
Apprentices who have satisfactorily completed the first four years of related classroom training using the NJATC curriculum and accumulated a minimum of 6,500 hours of OJT with satisfactory performance, shall be permitted to work alone on any job site and receive work assignments in the same manner as a Journeyman Wireman.
