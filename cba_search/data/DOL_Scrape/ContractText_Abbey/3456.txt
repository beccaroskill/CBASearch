ARTICLE 10 Insurances/Welfare Fund
10.	A.	Health Insurance
1.	The Authority agrees to elect to participate, pursuant to the provisions of Section 163(4) of the New York State Civil Service Law, in the Health Insurance Program for New York State Employees and Employees of Local Subdivisions in New York State, as it may from time to time be amended, and to pay 100% of the cost of the individual and dependent coverage for those enrolled in the Empire Plan.

3.	For those employees appointed to a position in this Negotiating Unit on January 1, 1983 and thereafter, the Authority will pay, during the first year of employment, 80% of the individual or individual and dependent coverage, whichever is appropriate for active employees enrolled in the various Health Insurance Plans available to employees in this Negotiating Unit through the New York State Health Insurance Program.

19

10. A. 4. Both parties are concerned with the rising cost of the State Health Insurance Plans. During the term of this Agreement, the Authority will investigate the feasibility of providing the present medical benefits through an alternate provider or self-insuring such benefits.
5.	If during the term of this Agreement an alternate provider acceptable to both parties is found or it is agreed by both parties that self-insurance will provide cost effective savings with comparable benefits, then the health insurance benefits will be transferred to such provider or provided through self-insurance.
6.	If the investigation does not identify an alternate	provider which	can	provide
comparable	benefits	or	if it	is determined
that self-insurance	will	not	provide
comparable	benefits	at	equal	cost	or less
cost, the parties will discuss in the next negotiations various means through which future health costs can be met.

For non-shift personnel, excluding seven-day rotating workday personnel, holidays falling on Saturday will be observed on Friday, and holidays falling on Sunday will be observed on Monday. For personnel working seven-day rotating work days, holidays will be observed on the calendar day on which they fall. Schedules in which a holiday falls will be adjusted so that no employee's pass day and holiday coincide. Those seven day rotating work day personnel scheduled to work the holiday will be compensated at the rate of time and one-half for hours worked (see Appendix B for example) .
For shift personnel, equivalent time off for each holiday will be provided in shift schedules, and holidays will be observed on the calendar day on which they fall.
2.	The Authority may, at its option, designate up to FOUR floating holidays in a contract year (July 1 - June 30) for ALL EMPLOYEES EXCEPT TOLL, DISPATCHERS, CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT OPERATORS LIGHT, CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT OPERATORS HEAVY AND THRUWAY MAINTENANCE WORKERS in lieu of FOUR of the holidays set forth below. Employees shall have the opportunity to select on an individual basis the dates upon which such floating holidays shall be observed by them, consistent with the reasonable operating needs of the Authority. The Authority's designation of the holidays to be floated shall be announced in July.
The holidays that may be designated as floating holidays are as follows:
Lincoln's Birthday Washington's Birthday Columbus Day Election Day
The floating holiday (s) may be used prior to the actual date(s) of the holiday(s).
3.	The parties agree that the employees in this Negotiating Unit will be granted any special holiday declared by the Governor for State employees.
12.B. Vacation (Annual) Leave
The parties agree that the crediting, accrual, and use of vacation leave for employees in this Negotiating Unit
28
will be administered as follows and, where appropriate, in accordance with the "Procedure for Granting Vacation to Uniformed Employees of the Bureau of Toll Collection":
1.	Employees of the Authority on December 31, 1956, or who were in State service or Authority service before such date and who, after such date, are reinstated or reemployed within one year after separation from State or Authority service, will earn and accumulate vacation at the rate of 20 working days per year as provided in the Attendance Rules in force and effect on December 31, 1956.
2.	Employees with no previous State or Authority service who enter Authority service on or after January 1, 1957, will, upon completion of 13 biweekly pay periods of service, be credited with 6.5 days of vacation. Thereafter, each such employee will earn and accumulate vacation credits at the rate of one-half day per biweekly pay period until such employee has completed seven years of continuous service. An employee will not earn vacation credit for any biweekly pay period during which the employee is in less than full pay status for more than five workdays.
3.	Employees who enter Authority service on or after January 1,	1957, will also earn on
January 1 of each year, additional vacation in accordance with the following schedule: Completed Years of Additional Vacation Continuous Service	Credits Earned
1	1	Day
2	2	Days
3	3	Days
4	4	Days
5	5	Days
6	6	Days
7	7	Days
29
12.	B.	4. During the second through the seventh year of
continuous service, one-half of the additional vacation credits earned during the current year of service will be credited on the first day of the pay period that includes July 1 and the remainder in the pay period that includes the next succeeding January 1. Compensation will be granted for these credits in the event of layoff, military leave or death of an employee. Furthermore, credits not to exceed the number of additional vacation credits earned for the previously completed year of service, and in proportion to the number of pay periods served during the current year, may be advanced to an employee to cover necessary absences where no other credits are available. Following the January 1 on which an employee has earned seven days of additional vacation credits, the employee will then earn vacation for completed biweekly pay periods at a rate which will equal 20 days for 26 such pay periods.
5.	Employees having 20 or more years of continuous Authority and/or State service, and who are entitled to earn and accumulate vacation credits will earn additional vacation credits as follows:
Completed Years of	Additional Vacation
Continuous Service	Credits Earned
20	to	24	1	day
25	to	29	3	days
30	to	34	4	days
35	or	more	5	days
Employees who complete 20 years of continuous Authority and/or State service will be credited with one additional vacation day on the first day of the payroll period that includes January 1 or July 1 which immediately follows their anniversary date. Therefore, if there is no break in continuous service, they will receive one-half of their entitlement every six months. The crediting day is the first day of the payroll period that includes January 1 and July 1.
NOTE: A seasonal employee does not earn accruals while serving in a seasonal position. However, such seasonal service counts as service credit when the employee becomes either a temporary or permanent employee provided there has been no break in service.)
30
12.B. 6.
7.
8.
9.
Continuous service for vacation purposes is continuous employment with the Authority from the date of first appointment to an Authority or State of New York position, excluding all periods of unsatisfactory service or part-time employment. A leave of absence without pay will not constitute a break in continuous service, however, a leave without pay for more than six months, except for military duty, will not be counted as Authority service. Except for employees who are reinstated or reappointed within one year or are reinstated by the Civil Service Commission, an employee’s continuous service shall be broken so that no prior period or periods shall be counted when the employee
•	voluntarily terminates employment;
•	is discharged for just cause;
•	abandons their job (see Article 15.D.
for definition); or
•	is terminated from temporary or
seasonal employment. (The one-year reinstatement exception stated above does not apply to employees terminated from a temporary or seasonal position.)
During the first year of employment, an employee will be considered eligible for the additional day of vacation if the employee has completed 13 or more biweekly pay periods of service by the January 1 next following appointment.
No accumulation of vacation credits in excess of 40 days will be permitted, except as noted below:
On the first working day of each calendar year, an employee may not exceed 40 days of accrued vacation, although their total may exceed this limit at other times during the year.
An employee who accumulates more than 40 days of vacation credits in a calendar year must use the amount over 40 days or lose it on the last day of the calendar year.
Each employee will be notified in writing of the total amount of unliquidated vacation credits when such credits total the equivalent of 25 workdays. Should an employee exceed the maximum allowable vacation while out on Workers’ Compensation Leave, such employee will have one year from the date of restoration of the vacation accruals or the date of return to work, whichever is appropriate, to reduce such credits below the allowable maximum.
The time at which vacation may be drawn by an employee is subject to the prior approval of the appropriate department head or their
31
designated representative. Vacation requests must be made 24 hours in advance except in an emergency.
Employees, except those who are required to punch time clocks, shall have the right to use accumulated vacation credits in not less than one-quarter hour units. Employees who are required to punch time clocks, shall have the right to use accumulated vacation credits in either 0.3, 0.5 or 0.8 hour units.
12.B.10.	For Uniformed Toll Personnel, vacation
requests shall be approved in accordance with seniority, except that a vacation request of less than five days shall not supersede a prior vacation request for more than five days, notwithstanding the seniority of the employees concerned. See Article 17.S. for definitions of long-term and short-term leave and notice required for such leave.
11.	So far as practicable, vacation credits are to
be used prior to transfer. However, an employee who is transferred to the Authority from State service will be credited with all of such employee's accumulated vacation credits not used prior to transfer to the extent permitted by the labor contracts concerned.
12.	t Upon separation from service by layoff, retirement or death, an employee or the employee's estate or beneficiary, as the case may be, will be compensated in cash for the employee's vacation credits not in excess of 30 days.
13.	In the event of a dismissal for cause, an
employee will be compensated for their vacation credits provided the employee was not dismissed for the following offenses:
a.	physical assault on supervisor or any other employee or Authority patrons;
b.	theft, embezzlement or conviction of a felony;
c.	loss of driver’s license because of driving on duty under the influence of liquor or illegal narcotics, and/or willful concealment of loss of driving privileges.
14.	Other provisions of this Agreement
notwithstanding, an employee, when first subject to the Attendance Rules regarding the accumulation of leave credits, shall not receive vacation credit until the completion of 13 complete biweekly pay periods of service which may be a combination of temporary and probationary service.
32
F
12. C.	Sick Leave
The parties agree that the crediting, accrual and use of sick leave for employees in this Negotiating Unit will be administered as follows:
Sick leave is absence with pay necessitated by the illness or other physical disability of the employee.
1.	Employees will earn sick leave credits at the rate of one-half day per biweekly pay period and may accumulate such credits up to a total of 165 days; provided, however, that an employee will not earn sick leave credit for any biweekly pay period during which the employee is in less than full pay status for more than five work days.
2.	An employee absent on sick leave is to notify the supervisor of such absence and the reason therefore on the first day of such absence and within two hours after the beginning of the work day; provided, however, that where the work is such that a substitute may be required, the Authority may require earlier notification. Sick leave credits may be used in such units, as the Authority may approve, but not in units of less than one-quarter hours.
3.	IF THE AUTHORITY BELIEVES AN EMPLOYEE IS ABUSING SICK LEAVE, IT MAY REQUIRE THE ' EMPLOYEE TO PROVIDE MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION FOR THE ABSENCE WHICH PROVIDES EVIDENCE SATISFACTORY TO THE AUTHORITY OF ILLNESS SUFFICIENT TO JUSTIFY THE EMPLOYEE’S ABSENCE FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR JOB DUTIES. FURTHER, THE EMPLOYEE MAY ALSO BE PLACED ON RESTRICTED SICK LEAVE STATUS FOR 90 DAYS AND WILL BE NOTIFIED IN WRITING. DURING THE 90-DAY RESTRICTED SICK LEAVE PERIOD, THE EMPLOYEE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT PROOF OF ILLNESS FOR EACH ILLNESS CLAIMED. THE AUTHORITY MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, CONTINUE THE RESTRICTED SICK LEAVE STATUS FOR ANOTHER 90-DAY PERIOD WHEN IT DETERMINES	THAT AN
EMPLOYEE’S	ATTENDANCE RECORD	IS NOT
SATISFACTORY.
When a doctor's statement is required by the Authority and the employee wishes to maintain a high degree of confidentiality with regard to the doctor’s diagnosis, the employee may submit a doctor’s statement containing the diagnosis to the supervisor in a sealed envelope and request that the doctor’s statement be forwarded to the Personnel Director. The Personnel Director will review the doctor’s statement and if the Director finds that the statement is acceptable proof of illness, the Director will place that statement in the employee's Personal History Folder in a sealed envelope marked "Confidential - Do Not Open Without Employee's or Personnel Director's Approval." An employee requesting confidential treatment of
33
T
the doctor's statement containing a diagnosis must, upon return to work, also provide the supervisor with a statement from the employee’s doctor indicating that the employee is able to resume work and perform all of the duties of the position and the date upon which the employee may return to work.
12. C.	4 . The Authority may require an employee who has
been absent because of personal illness, prior to and as a condition of return to duty, to be examined, at the expense of the Authority, by a physician designated by the Authority, to establish that the employee is not disabled from the performance of the normal duties and that return to duty will not jeopardize the employee’s health or that of other employees. However, upon request of an employee returning from sick leave who is certified as being able to work but, because of the nature of the illness or injury will, for a short period of time, be restricted from performing some of the duties appropriate to the position, the Authority may, in its discretion, permit return to service on a limited duty basis, subject to whatever conditions the Authority may require.
When the Authority requires an employee to be examined by a doctor selected by it, such examination shall be scheduled within five work days of the employee's notification to the Authority of the intended return date or the employee's accruals will be restored if the employee is subsequently certified to return to work. If the employee's doctor and the doctor selected by the Authority disagree, the employee will be sent to a third doctor for examination. The third doctor will be chosen through the appropriate County Medical Society. The Authority and the Union will be bound by the decision of the third doctor and will share expenses equally.
5.	In addition to personal illness of the employee, the following types of absence, when approved by the Authority, may be charged against accumulated sick leave credits: illness or death in the employee's family provided, however, that charge for such absence may not exceed a maximum of 15 days in any one year; personal visits to doctor or dentist. Proof of the need for such absences satisfactory to the Authority may be required. In those cases where the employee wishes to retain confidentiality, the Authority will accept as proof of absence a statement from the family member's doctor that the family member's illness was such that it required the employee's presence.
6.	When an employee is transferred to an agency with which the Authority has a reciprocal agreement, the employee's accumulated sick leave credits, to the extent permitted by the
34
labor contracts concerned, will be transferred with the employee. When an employee is separated from service for other than transfer or disciplinary reasons and is subsequently reinstated or reemployed within one year after such separation, the employee's sick leave credits accumulated and unused at the time of separation will be restored.
12.C. 7. Where reinstatement occurs more than one year following separation, sick leave credits accumulated and unused at the time of separation may be restored at the discretion of the Authority. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, an employee reinstated from a preferred list or by action of the Civil Service Commission will be entitled to restoration of all sick leave credits accumulated and unused to the extent permitted by this Agreement.
8.	Unused sick leave will not be liquidated in cash at the time of separation, retirement or death.	However, its cash value will be
applied	as provided in	Section 167,
subdivision 5 of the State Civil Service Law relative to the payment of health insurance premiums of retired employees.
If the Civil Service Law, Section 167.5 is amended to permit dependent survivors to use the value of a deceased retiree' s sick leave accruals to offset the cost of State Health Insurance Plan Premiums, the Authority agrees to negotiate this with the Union.
9.	EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2000, THE FOLLOWING SICK LEAVE INCENTIVE PROGRAM WILL BE INTITIATED:
EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE NOT ACCUMULATED 165 DAYS SICK LEAVE, SHALL AT THE END OF A SIX-MONTH PERIOD OF JULY 1 - DECEMBER 31 AND/OR JANUARY 1 - JUNE 30, RECEIVE THE GREATER OF EITHER ONE OR TWO DAYS STRAIGHT TIME PAY FOR EACH SIXMONTH PERIOD FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE:
SICK LEAVE USED DURING	ADDITIONAL
SIX-MONTH PERIOD	DAYS PAY
NO SICK LEAVE USED	2 DAYS
ONE OR LESS DAYS SICK LEAVE USED	1 DAY
MORE THAN ONE DAY SICK LEAVE USED	0
10.	Should an employee who is out sick be in danger of exceeding the 40 day maximum allowable limit for annual leave, such employee may charge all of the absence because of illness or a portion thereof to vacation accruals.
35
■
12.C. 11. EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2000, EMPLOYEES AT THE END OF A SIX-MONTH PERIOD OF JULY 1 - DECEMBER 31 AND/OR JANUARY 1 - JUNE 30, WHO DURING SUCH PERIOD (S) HAVE AND MAINTAIN CONTINUOUSLY A BALANCE OF 165 DAYS OF ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE SHALL RECEIVE FOUR DAYS STRAIGHT TIME PAY FOR EACH SUCH SIX MONTH PERIOD THEY DO NOT USE SICK LEAVE.
EMPLOYEES WHO USE SICK LEAVE DURING A SIX MONTH PERIOD AND THUS FAIL TO MAINTAIN A CONTINUOUS BALANCE OF 165 DAYS DURING THE ABOVE SIX-MONTH PERIOD(S) SHALL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE SICK LEAVE INCENTIVE PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES WITH LESS THAN 165 DAYS ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE PROVIDED IN ARTICLE 12.C.9.
12.D. Extended Sick Leave
The Authority may advance sick leave credits to an employee absent due to personal illness who has exhausted accumulated sick leave and vacation credits. Such advanced sick leave credits are to be repaid, as soon as practicable after the employee's return to duty, from subsequent accumulations of time credits. The outstanding unrepaid sick leave credits advanced to any employee under the provisions of this Article may not at any time exceed a total of five days.
Upon termination of the employee ’ s services, any such advance of sick leave not offset by subsequent accumulations of sick leave and vacation credits, is to be deducted from salary or wages due the employee.
12.E. Mandatory Sick Leave at Half Pay
1. The Authority shall grant sick leave at half pay for personal illness to a permanent employee having not less than one year of Authority service after all of the employee’s sick leave and vacation credits have been used, subject to the following guidelines:
a.	the employee must, by reason of personal illness or injury, be unable to perform the normal duties of the position. The Authority may require the employee to undergo a physical examination by its own physician to verify this fact.
b.	the Authority must be reasonably assured that the employee will be able to return to normal duties following this absence.
c.	the record of the employee in the areas of attendance and work performance for the past year must be satisfactory.
d.	the cumulative total of all sick leave at half pay granted to an employee during their Authority and/or State
36

service may not exceed one pay period for each complete six months of Authority and/or State service.
12.E. 2. The Authority shall, subject to subparagraphs a. , b. and d. above, grant sick leave at half pay in all Workers' Compensation cases after the use of all Workers ’ Compensation Leave, sick leave and vacation credits unless (1) there is good and sufficient reason to believe that the disability resulting from such injury or disease is not job related or is primarily due to some pre-existing medical condition; (2) there is good and sufficient reason to believe that the employee could report for work on a full-time or part-time basis; (3) the employee's services would have been terminated or would have ceased under Law; or (4) the employee's claim for benefits is controverted by the State Insurance Fund.
3. Consideration will continue to be given to requests by employees to return to limited duty for a short period of time including leave with half pay and working half-time.
12.	F.	Personal Leave
The parties agree that the crediting and use of personal leave for employees in this Negotiating Unit will be administered as follows:
Personal Leave is leave with pay for annual leave or for personal business, including religious observance, without charge against accumulated vacation. Employees will be entitled and credited with personal leave as follows:
1.	Each employee in Negotiating Unit I prior to July 2, 1981 except as herein otherwise provided, will be credited with five days personal leave each year as of the first full pay period in January. Employees hired July 2,	1981 and thereafter,
except as herein otherwise provided, will be credited with three days personal leave each year as of the first full pay period in January until they either reach the Job Rate of their position or they have completed a total of five years of State/Authority service, following which they will receive five days personal leave each year as of the first full pay period in January.

If such extraordinary weather conditions develop after the commencement of the workday, employees who are sent home shall not have to charge the time to their accruals.
38
12. G. 2.

If the employee’s accruals are not sufficient to cover the time period denied by the Board, payroll deductions of $50 per payroll period will be made until the balance owed the Authority has been repaid.
5.

16.E. Staffing of Snow Plows and Patrol Trucks
The parties agree that two employees will be assigned to operate a truck equipped with a right-hand wing plow or a spreader when, during loading or snow plowing operations, in consideration of weather and other visibility conditions, the safety of personnel and equipment, and the most appropriate utilization of the available personnel and equipment, such snow plowing operation requires it.
The parties also agree that the number of employees to be assigned to operate a patrol truck will be determined by the supervisor and that when, in the supervisor’s opinion, the conduct of the patrol operation requires the assignment of two employees to the patrol truck, in consideration of weather conditions, the safety of personnel and equipment, and the most appropriate utilization of the available personnel and equipment, such assignment will be made.

The Authority agrees to encourage the use of the ’’buddy" system in the conduct of mowing operations whereby mowers operate in teams.

16.H. Assignment of Overtime Opportunities
The parties agree that overtime opportunities will be distributed equitably among qualified employees.
The parties further agree that the practices for the distribution of overtime in effect in each work unit on the date of this contract will be continued.
The procedure for the distribution of such overtime is as follows:
56
The Authority will establish a list of qualified employees in order of seniority by work unit or by shift depending on the present overtime practice of the work unit. Working an overtime opportunity of less than four hours shall not affect an employee’s standing on the overtime list. Working an overtime opportunity of four to less than eight hours, or a call-out of less than eight hours, being unavailable or refusing an overtime opportunity shall be deemed a chargeable overtime opportunity. Working an overtime opportunity of eight to less than twelve hours shall be deemed two chargeable overtime opportunities. Working an overtime opportunity of twelve to less than sixteen hours shall be deemed three chargeable overtime opportunities. Working an overtime opportunity of sixteen hours or more shall be deemed four chargeable overtime opportunities.
Refusing and being unavailable for an overtime call is equal to the number of charges for working such overtime.
For purposes of scheduled overtime, Bridge employees and employees of the Bureau of Equipment Maintenance assigned to a maintenance section are not considered Section employees and will not be considered as being on the Section list nor will Section employees be considered as being on the Bridge list unless otherwise mutually agreed between the Authority and the Union.
If an error in the assignment of overtime occurs, the Authority shall have 21 calendar days from notice thereof to rectify the error by offering the employee another overtime opportunity. If it is unable to do so within such time, the Authority shall pay such employee for the lost time. If a temporary employee is improperly assigned overtime that should have been assigned to a permanent employee and the Authority is unable to reschedule the permanent employee for overtime in place of a temporary employee, the Authority will pay the permanent employee for the lost time.
If in either party’s view the Authority alters the shift or overtime staffing so that the equitable distribution of overtime in effect in the work unit is no longer feasible, then the parties will agree on a new method of overtime di s tributi on.
The parties agree that the "crew concept" shall be utilized for the distribution of bridge overtime, whereby overtime required on a particular bridge project will first be offered to the members of the crew assigned to that project.
However, it is understood that the desire of the parties is that there be an equitable distribution of overtime opportunities among Bridge employees in the geographical unit to which the employees are assigned. Therefore, this must be considered in making crew assignments to bridge projects where it is known in advance that such project would require overtime on a continuing basis.
57
16.1. Winter Maintenance Patrol (Weekend and Holiday)
When the Winter Maintenance Patrol (Weekend and Holiday) is fully staffed, such staffing, which may include at least one Construction Equipment Operator (Heavy) per shift, shall be at least three employees in all Divisions.

Example:	Employee Sands, appointed seasonal/hourly as a
Construction Equipment Operator (Light) on September 30, 1975, works full time until November 1, 1975, at which time employee Sands is appointed permanently as a Construction Equipment Operator (Light). Employee Cannon is appointed permanently as a Construction Equipment Operator (Light) on October 15, 1975.

16. Q.	1. a. When an employee takes a voluntary
demotion, their seniority shall begin as of the employee's time in the new work unit. SUCH EMPLOYEES SHALL HAVE FULL SENIORITY, HOWEVER, ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSFERRING BETWEEN WORK UNITS. FOR ALL OTHER PURPOSES SENIORITY WILL BE THE DATE THE EMPLOYEE TAKES THE VOLUNTARY DEMOTION.
b. When an employee changes from a competitive to a non-competitive job, the employee’s seniority in the new work unit shall begin as of the time of the move. SUCH EMPLOYEES SHALL HAVE FULL SENIORITY, HOWEVER, ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSFERRING BETWEEN WORK UNITS. FOR ALL OTHER PURPOSES SENIORITY SHALL BE AS OF THE DATE OF THEIR DEMOTION OR CHANGE FROM COMPETITIVE CLASS TO NON-COMPETITIVE CLASS.
An employee who is terminated or who resigns shall have seniority from the date of reinstatement for promotion and transfer but shall retain all other earned benefits. Military leave, leave of absence, Workers’ Compensation, inability to work because of sickness or injury shall be considered continuous service with the Authority.

Except that in the case of overtime opportunities, upon reverting to the permanent position, the employee will be credited with the highest number of overtime opportunities of any member of the work unit.
NOTE: Seniority for field maintenance employees shall provide that ties in seniority may be broken first by counting non-competitive seasonal service and second, if need be, by the flip of a coin.

the competence (including ability and/or other qualifications) and/or the satisfactoriness of prior service of employees concerned will not be permitted.

ARTICLE 17
Toll Collection Employees
17.A.	Applicability of Article
This Article applies to all full-time uniformed Toll personnel except as otherwise expressly provided herein.
17.B. Scheduling Time Off
The need for 24 hour coverage, seven days a week, makes it necessary to schedule days off, holiday time and other non-working periods of Toll Collectors at times and on days other than weekends, holiday dates and other conventional non-working dates and hours.
Since traffic is usually the heaviest on weekends and holidays, particularly during the summer months, days off will usually be on weekdays. Compensatory time for other purposes will be scheduled as set forth hereafter.
17.C.	Work Schedules for Toll Collectors
The parties agree to implement a "Fixed Work Scheduling System" for the Authority’s toll stations at New Rochelle, Yonkers, Tappan Zee Bridge, Spring Valley, Woodbury and Harriman. This shall be accomplished by a joint study committee composed of two Authority representatives and two Union representatives which shall study the individual toll stations to determine whether such fixed scheduling should be on a seniority basis or a rotational basis or a combination thereof. As each toll facility is studied and agreement is reached upon the type of scheduling to be implemented for that toll facility, it will be implemented as soon as possible thereafter. This study shall be completed by January 1, 1988. Such fixed schedules will incorporate the following:
1.	All Toll Collectors will be assigned to duty in accordance with a work schedule covering a 2 8-day period. There will be 13 such schedules each year. Each such schedule will provide for not more than 19 scheduled workdays or shifts.
2.	Compensatory time off for the 12 holidays specified in Article 12.A. 1. Will be given to Toll Collectors by granting one additional day off in 12 of the 13 annual schedule periods.
3.	Toll Collectors will receive seven checkout days in lieu of time required for performing
76
17.C. 4.
5.
6.
7.
clerical duties in "checking-out" at the end of a shift. For a Toll Collector six of these seven checkout days may be taken in units of four hours or multiples thereof at the Toll Collector’s discretion throughout the year. (See Article 17.S. for definitions of longterm and short-term leave and notice required for such leave.) Such checkout leave must be with the approval of the supervisor. These days are not cumulative and any days remaining unused by an employee on January 1 of each year will be canceled. However, if a Toll Collector takes all but two of the five personal leave and six check-out days during the period from mid-June to mid-August and thereafter is denied, or is unable because of Workers’ Compensation Leave or sick leave which extends from December 1 to the first full payroll period in January to request, permission to take either one or both of the remaining days before the first full payroll period in January, such day or days shall be accumulated and added to the checkout days and/or personal leave, as the case may be, credited to the employee for the following year. Toll Collectors will also receive an additional 3.5 days pay per calendar year at straight time to compensate for the overtime aspects of the seven checkout days as outlined in the "Procedure for Making Payment of Check-Out and Change-Over Time."
In addition to the above payment for checkout time, Toll Collectors are eligible for 15 minutes pay at the employee ’ s overtime rate for checkout purposes on each day when not scheduled to work and are subsequently called in for overtime.
Toll Collectors in all sections will be scheduled to be off duty two weekends per schedule period. For Shift I employees, weekends will be Sunday and Monday.
The limit on the number of employees who may be on vacation each day contained in the Manual for Personnel of the Bureau of Toll Collection-Section I is hereby eliminated. The parties have eliminated the previous restriction on the number of vacation days an employee may take during the summer.
There shall be no variations beyond the two hour limit of the present I, II, IIB or III Shifts for the purposes of this Article.
When a Toll Collector is absent from duty for a long-term absence, the employee may not sign a schedule rebid until they have provided documentation that indicates their ability to return to full duty before the end of that signed for period. If the employee signs and subsequently fails to return to work two weeks before the next rebid posting, they will not be permitted to sign for another schedule until the rebidding period following the day
77
of actual return to work.
A copy of each toll schedule will be supplied to the Union Shop Steward the day prior to the time it is posted. Schedules may be modified only by joint agreement between the Toll Division Manager and the Chief Shop Steward. No joint approval is required if the error is an obvious contract violation or a typographical error.
17.D. Shift Assignments
1.	The Authority agrees to post each work schedule three weeks in advance, except that such schedule may be amended by the Authority at any time during the first week of such posting if unforeseen circumstances (including by way of illustration but by no means limited to, political or other conventions, sporting events, fairs, festivals, centennial celebrations, dramatic events, beauty contests, concerts, closing of interchanges or construction) require such amendment. Otherwise, no shift changes shall be made following the posting of the schedule except upon the consent of the Monitors or Toll Collectors concerned. However, within the posted schedule only, Toll Collectors may, with the approval of their supervisor, make one shift change per calendar day. When such shift changes have occurred subsequent leave requests, other than for sick leave, which is supported by a doctor's certificate, will not be permitted for the shift in question. When such approval is withheld the supervisor will, at the employee's request, set forth the reasons therefore in writing. Cancellation of a shift change will not be considered a second change provided overtime has not been committed. All changes must be posted on the schedule at the station within 48 hours after the change has occurred. A shift change is any change made by a Toll Collector altering the posted schedule. This definition is not meant to include those changes made where a Toll Collector agrees to the request of the Authority or when a Toll Collector requests additional time off when time off has previously been approved for part of the scheduled shift.
2.	The parties have marked copies of the work schedules for all Toll Stations with a red line; one copy is held by the Union, one by the Authority's Bureau of Labor Relations and one by the Authority's Bureau of Toll Collection.
3.	Following the application of paragraph 2.
above, permanent full-time Toll Collectors below the red line will be scheduled in reverse seniority order, first for I Shifts, then for III Shifts, then for IIB Shifts, then for II Shifts, except that they may be scheduled for II Shifts, where conditions permit training, for a period not to exceed 21 days. New permanent full-time Toll Collectors
78
who have been previously trained as seasonal or Part-Time Toll Collectors shall be scheduled for II Shifts for a period not to exceed 21 days. The Authority will schedule experienced seasonal Toll Collectors first for I Shifts, then for III Shifts, then for I IB Shifts, then for II Shifts. Inexperienced seasonal Toll Collectors shall be scheduled mostly for I and III Shifts except that they may be scheduled for	II Shifts where
conditions permit training for a period not to exceed 21 days.
Once a toll station	adopts seniority
scheduling, it cannot return to rotational scheduling.
17.D. 4. Following the application of paragraphs 2. and 3. above, the Authority will schedule all permanent full-time Toll Collectors above the red line to an equal share of the remaining II, IIB, III and I Shifts. This will be done in seniority order providing it does not violate the mandatory scheduling requirements contained in section C. above.
5.	A transferring Toll Collector will be slotted in order of seniority above the red line when their is senior to any other Collector then above the red line at that station. A transferring Toll Collector will be slotted in order of seniority below the red line when they are not senior to any other Collector then above the red line at that station.
6.	It is understood by the parties that Article 17.D. may have to be modified to accommodate the "Fixed Work Scheduling System" which is being implemented at all toll facilities as soon as possible.
17.E. Work Day
The normal workday or shift includes eight hours of duty, plus whatever time is required for "check-out” duties. Toll Collectors will be granted the equivalent of two fifteen-minute rest periods during each workday or shift and adequate time for lunch, subject to the following:
1.	In those instances in which one Toll Collector is assigned to a shift, no formal relief period for rest and meal is required since adequate time for these purposes is available during the shift. Toll Collectors working a I shift alone will receive a premium of $.40 per hour if scheduled to work alone for five hours or more. When necessary for the reasons described therein, the lane may be closed down as provided in Toll Collection Directive 75-3.
2.	In those instances in which more than one Toll Collector is assigned to a shift, they may take rest and meal periods at such times as mutually agreed to by themselves or as assigned by their supervisor, with due consideration of the necessity for performing
79
the work of the station without undue delay at any time, provided that, to the extent practicable, each Toll Collector will receive relief time during each shift.
17. E. 3. Toll Collectors are required to interrupt lunch or other relief periods to assist in the work of the station whenever necessary. Time permitted for lunch and rest periods is considered working time. Employees are not to leave the immediate area of their duty station during the tour of duty except when unforeseen circumstances, such as a major storm make it necessary for a Collector to leave their duty station at the request or with the approval of the supervisor to get necessary supplies.
17.F. Staffing of Toll Stations
The Authority agrees to post annually or when changes occur, at each toll station, the minimum staffing pattern for each schedule period for that station which will be in effect under normal circumstances and to send copies, for the toll stations in each Division, to the Teamster Chief Shop Steward for such Division. The parties also agree that such staffing patterns can be modified by the supervisor when, in the supervisor's judgment, conditions warrant it.
Upon advice from the Union, the Authority will review any particular problems raised with respect to staffing complements at any particular station(s).
The Authority agrees to review permanent vacancies as they occur and, when justified by traffic conditions, to fill these vacancies with full-time employees within a reasonable period of time.
The Director of Toll Collection and representative will meet with the Union representatives appointed for such purposes to review present minimum staffing to more realistically reflect what staffing is actually being assigned.
17.G.	Assignments To Other Than Regularly Assigned Station
The parties agree that the assignment of Toll Collectors to work at toll stations other than the one to which they are regularly assigned will be made on a volunteer basis. The parties also agree that, in the event there are insufficient volunteers, Toll Collectors will be assigned, in order of least seniority, to the extent required to provide sufficient personnel for the work to be performed.
The Authority agrees to provide a mileage allowance at $.23 per mile, or transportation by an Authority vehicle, except where the employee's residence is closer to such temporarily assigned station than their regularly assigned station.
17.H. Motor Vehicle Operators (Courier)
1. Work Day - Work Week
Motor Vehicle Operators (Courier) work 7.5 hours per day, Monday through Friday. The work hours vary by individual.
80

17 . H.	2. Uniforms and Allowances
Male employees in this title are uniformed the same as Toll Collectors and are issued the following items of clothing:
•	A total of six pair of trousers and shorts (maximum two pair of shorts)
•	A total of ten shirts (maximum two polo shirts, two turtlenecks)
•	Two	sweaters

•	One	belt
•	One	knit hat
•	Two	ties
The Authority further agrees to replace such garments as needed, by reason of normal wear and tear, damage on the job or unanticipated shrinkage, and to pay a uniform cleaning allowance of $160 annually on January 31. All of the above garments are machine washable and cleaning them is the responsibility of the employee.
At the time of issue, normal uniform alterations will be made at Authority expense and subsequent alterations are to be at the expense of the employee. The Authority agrees that it will attempt to accommodate any Major size changes by substituting with more appropriate uniform sizes as available.
3.	Safety Shoes
The Authority agrees to provide Motor Vehicle Operators (Courier) who have not previously received such safety equipment reimbursement for two pair of safety shoes which shall be black in color at the rate of $85 per pair AND $100 EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2002.
4.	Training New Couriers
The Authority agrees to pay couriers $1.00 per
81
hour training pay when assigned to train new Couriers.
17.1. Carbon Monoxide Testing
The Authority will perform carbon monoxide testing on a quarterly basis at New Rochelle, Yonkers, Spring Valley, Harriman, Williamsville, Lackawanna, Black Rock and City Line. The test results will be given to the Shop Steward. All other stations would be tested upon request within two weeks of the request.
17. J.	Overtime
1. Time Allowance for Availability
At the time each schedule is posted, a Schedule of Availability for Toll Overtime shall be posted at each toll station, and shall remain up for at least 15 days. Toll Collectors shall continue to indicate their availability for overtime on such schedule as at present, except that they shall be permitted to indicate such availability on all pass days, including all shifts on the compensatory pass day they receive in lieu of an Employee Organizational Leave day.
The following instruction will be permanently posted on the Schedule of Availability for Overtime:
"Explanation: If you want to volunteer for overtime with this work group - sign your name at left and draw a horizontal line through dates for which you do not want to be considered for overtime. Indicate under each date for which you volunteer for overtime the shift or shifts during all and any part of which you wish to be considered willing to work. On your scheduled days off, you may use an ’A’ to indicate your wish to be considered available for all and any part of all shifts on that date. On days that you are scheduled to work, you must designate the shift or shifts all and any part of which you are willing to work on an overtime basis.
Example: Toll Collector Sessamy signs his name at the left of the Schedule of Availability for Overtime and indicates his availability to work the I Shift from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on September 22, 1976. An overtime opportunity arises for the three hours between 4:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. at the end of that shift. Toll Collector Sessamy will be considered for that overtime opportunity."
Full-time toll employees have the option of signing for particular hours or shifts on the overtime availability list. Employees must sign up in four-hour block minimums and split shifts will not be permitted.
82
17.J. 2. Withdrawal of Availability-
After the original of the Schedule of Availability has been removed from the toll station, Toll Collectors or Monitors may withdraw their availability for overtime work on one or more shifts by notifying their supervisor that they will not be available on the shift or shifts indicated. The Toll Collectors or Monitors must notify their supervisor at least 24 hours in advance of the shift entered on the Schedule of Availability by making an entry on the Unusual Occurrence Report (TA- 6310) .
The supervisor may also be notified orally. The supervisor will note the withdrawal by placing an ”X” or "shift withdrawn" over the shift or shifts indicated; if an "A" is indicated, an "X" will be placed over the "A" and any shift or shifts which the Collector or Monitor is still interested in working will be set forth.
3.	Distribution of Overtime Opportunities
The Authority retains the right to select Toll Collectors to serve as Trainers and Authority Safety Committee representatives. In these types of situations, the employees will be treated as being on Employee Organizational Leave for overtime replacement and distribution of overtime purposes. In order to achieve a more equitable distribution of overtime opportunities, such overtime opportunities will be offered first in seniority order to Toll Collectors and Monitors as hereafter set forth. Any refusals of overtime opportunities of less than eight hours and working such opportunities up to an aggregate of less than eight hours shall not affect such seniority order. After working or being assigned to work one or more overtime opportunities aggregating eight or more hours, an employee shall be deemed junior to an employee who has not reached eight hours.
Among employees who have worked or been assigned overtime opportunities of eight or more hours, overtime opportunities shall be offered in order to those who have worked or been assigned the least amount of overtime within each 56 day period referred to in paragraph J. 7. Refusal of a single overtime opportunity of eight or more hours shall, for these purposes, be deemed overtime worked.
4.	Distribution of Toll Collector Overtime Opportuni ties
Toll Collector overtime opportunities, before being offered to any full-time temporary, part-time or seasonal Toll Collectors, will be offered in the following order to eligible personnel who have signed the Schedule of Availability:
83
'.J.	4. a. regular full-time Toll Collectors from
the station on pass days;
b.	other regular full-time Toll Collectors at the station;
c.	regular full-time Monitors from the station on pass days;
d.	other regular full-time Monitors at the station;
e.	regular full-time Toll Collectors from other stations on pass days;
f.	regular full-time Monitors from other stations on pass days.
5.	Distribution of Monitor Overtime Opportunities
Monitor overtime opportunities, before being offered to any full-time temporary, part-time or seasonal Toll Collectors, will be offered in the following order to eligible personnel who have signed the Schedule of Availability:
a.	regular full-time Monitors from the station on pass days;
b.	other regular full-time Monitors at
the station;
c.	regular full-time Toll Collectors
trained as Monitors from the station on pass days;
d.	other regular full-time Toll Collectors trained as Monitors at the station;
e.	regular full-time Monitors from other
stations on pass days;
f.	regular full-time Toll Collectors
trained as Monitors from other stations on pass days.
6.	Implementation of paragraphs 3. through 5. above shall be subject to the standard that except for emergency situations, Toll Collectors and Monitors may not work double shifts (any two work periods, each consisting of 16 or more continuous hours, separated by an off duty break of 16 or less hours) , nor any triple shifts.
7.	Equitable Distribution of Overtime Opportunities by Seniority
The supervisor will note the refusal of each overtime opportunity of eight hours or more, and the working of all overtime, on the Work Schedule by circling the amount of overtime worked or refused in ink. Following the expiration of the first posted Work Schedule
84
under this Agreement, all the overtime worked or deemed worked will be accumulated and carried forward to the next posted work schedule. Following completion of the next such schedule, the following posted schedule shall again be utilized in order of seniority so that each seniority list shall extend for a period of 56 days.
17. J.
8.	Removal from Schedule of Availability
A supervisor will discuss with the employee a pattern of repeated instances of inability to contact the employee for overtime assignments.
If, after discussion, the pattern continues, the supervisor, with the approval of the Toll Division Supervisor, may remove the employee’s name from the Schedule of Availability for two schedule periods or until the current 56-day period expires.
9.	Compensatory Overtime Opportunities
If an error in the assignment of overtime occurs, the Authority shall have 21 calendar days from notice thereof to rectify the error by offering the employee another overtime opportunity. If it is unable to do so within such time, the Authority shall pay such employee for the lost time.
10	. Late Replacement Calls
Should a Toll Collector be called within one-half hour of the commencement of a scheduled shift to replace a permanent Toll Collector on an overtime basis, the Toll Collector will receive credit toward the overtime meal allowance if they report to work within 30 minutes after the shift begins.
11.	Assigned Overtime
Should a Toll Collector be required by the supervisor to work a specific overtime period and subsequently be told by another supervisor to leave prior to working the entire specified period, the Toll Collector would be paid for that overtime to which they were first assigned.
12.	Overtime - Restrictive Leave Status
A Toll Collector or Monitor who is on restrictive leave will not be called for overtime on any day on which the employee is off on sick leave other than family sick leave, funeral leave or visits to the doctor or dentist with acceptable proof of illness. Any violation of this paragraph by the Authority will result in the automatic payment of the lost overtime earnings to the employee.

17.K. Transfers
Transfers in the Bureau of Toll Collection will be administered in accordance with the ’’Policy and Procedure for Transfer (Geographical Reassignment) of Personnel in the Bureau of Toll Collection” contained in the Manual for Personnel of the Bureau of Toll Collection as amended in accordance with Article 17.N. The employee’s prefiled request for transfer will be acknowledged in writing by the appropriate supervisor.
The parties agree to eliminate the present requirement that a permanent Toll Collector must serve six months at the location of original appointment before being eligible to transfer. It is understood that the employee's score on the Civil Service List for their title must be reachable in the location to which the employee wishes to transfer during this six-month period.
The parties agree that if an employee refused on one occasion in a six-month period a transfer to a location of choice, the employee's name will be removed from the transfer list for that location for a period of six months. If the employee is still interested in transfer to the location in question five months from the date of the prior refusal, the employee may resubmit their name at that time to the Division Toll Office and may transfer 28 days after that. An employee will be allowed 48 hours and no longer when responding to a transfer request.
17.L. Utilization of Regular Full-Time Toll Collectors
The parties agree that Toll Collectors who are absent due to short-term sick leave, personal leave, administrative leave or employee organizational leave will be replaced, when necessary, by regular full-time Toll Collectors. For the purposes of this Article, short-term sick leave shall mean five or fewer consecutive workdays.
17.M. Posting of Monitor Vacancies
Monitor vacancies will hereafter be posted at the station where the vacancy occurs. Such vacancies will be filled in accordance with seniority from among those interested employees at the station where the vacancy occurs, unless the failure to appoint such senior employee is supported by a "skip memo", subject to satisfactory completion of a 26 week probationary period.
The Authority will also post quarterly at toll stations where Monitors are assigned a sheet whereon Toll Collectors may indicate their desire to be trained as Monitors. Toll Collectors who have successfully completed their training as Monitors shall be eligible for overtime opportunities accorded to Toll Collectors trained as Monitors.
A Monitor is a Toll Collector who has been assigned the responsibility for the operation of one or more automatic toll lanes.
17.N. Seniority for Toll Collection Employees
Seniority for Toll Collectors shall be defined as length of continuous permanent service with the Authority except that for new Toll Collectors appointed permanently on
86
October 28, 1982 and thereafter, seniority for scheduling and vacation selection shall be determined by length of continuous permanent service as a Toll Collector.
The above seniority definition shall apply to Toll Collectors serving as Monitors prior to February 22, 1985. For Toll Collectors appointed, reappointed or reassigned to Monitor positions February 22, 1985 and thereafter continuous service as a Monitor will be used in determining seniority for scheduling purposes. Toll Collectors and Toll Collectors serving as Monitors shall bid on their work schedules according to seniority. Seniority for Monitors voluntarily returning to a Toll Collector position after March 6, 1991 will include all permanent service as a Toll Collector excluding time served as a Monitor. Monitors forced to return to a Toll Collector position after March 6, 1991 will have all continuous permanent service counted as good service time.
An employee who has been reinstated following a termination or resignation shall have seniority from the date of such reinstatement for the purpose of shift selection, vacation request consideration, transfer (geographical reassignment) , and for distribution of overtime opportunities.
All relevant documents, including the following procedures, will be deemed amended to conform with these definitions, which shall apply as hereafter set forth:

For purposes of shift assignment as provided in Article 17.D. 3., 4. and 5.
17.0. Stools
The Authority will provide stools for each tollbooth. Toll Collectors will be permitted to sit while collecting tolls provided service to patrons is not adversely affected.

Toll Collectors will receive a shoe allowance of $80 effective January of 1996 and $85 effective January of 1997.
17. Q. Out-of-Title
A Toll Collector assigned to perform the duties of a higher level position shall receive out-of-title pay for each assignment of one consecutive hour or more from the first hour.
Non-consecutive fractions of an hour can never accumulate to make an hour’s unit of out-of-title pay. Article 8. E. 1. and 2. apply in determining employee • s salary in out-of-title situations.
17.	R. Toll Complaint Committee
The parties agree to the formation of a Toll Complaint Committee to review the written complaints of a Toll Collector who has appropriate accruals and who believes they have been wrongfully removed from the payroll by the supervisor.
If a Toll Collector desires to have the removal reviewed, such Toll Collector must submit a written request with supporting documentation to the Toll Division Manager with a copy to the Chief Shop Steward, within five work days of the receipt of notification of removal.
The Toll Division Manager shall within three work days review such complaint and make a determination. If the Toll Division Manager decides that the employee should not be
88
removed from the payroll, the Manager will make the necessary arrangements to cancel the removal and notify the employee. If the Toll Division Manager concurs with the removal, the Manager will forward the complaint to the Director of Labor Relations, who will attempt to settle it. If not settled within five workdays, it is considered by the full Committee.
The Committee will within five workdays after receipt thereof, render a decision on the complaint. If the Committee agrees, such decision will be final and binding and not subject to further review. If there is a disagreement of the Committee, either party may request that it be pursued through the grievance procedure.

ARTICLE 18 Clerical Employees
This Article applies to full-time 37.5-hour clerical employees except where otherwise indicated.
18 .A. Seniority
1.	Seniority for full-time clerical employees shall be defined as length of continuous permanent service with the Authority.

The Authority will, during January of each year, ask all employees interested in transfer to submit a written request indicating such interest. Any employee may also submit such a request at any other time subject to subparagraph 5. below. All such requests shall be submitted to, and receipt acknowledged in writing by, the Personnel Director, who will establish and maintain a transfer roster for each title and location in which such interest has been indicated. If an employee refuses a transfer to a particular office where the employee had previously indicated an interest, that employee's name will be removed from the transfer list for that office for one year. The employee's name will remain on the transfer list for other office for which the employee had indicated an interest. If a permanent clerical employee transfers to a temporary position, the employee can apply for subsequent permanent positions in the same title and office to which the employee transferred without regard to the one-year transfer restriction.
Where a vacancy is to be filled in a position which is newly created or reactivated, such vacancy shall be posted for a period of 14 days at the work locations of all other employees in the same title.
When a vacancy is to be filled in a position for which there is a transfer roster, it will be in seniority order, Thruway-wide, from such roster unless failure to do so is supported by a "skip memo". Skip memos which purport to deny such transfers only on the grounds that the employee requesting the transfer is too valuable to lose from such employee' s present position, or that recruiting a replacement for such employee in that area will be difficult, will not be permitted.
Where a vacancy is to be filled in a position for which there is a transfer roster and an eligible list, the names of candidates from the transfer roster and eligible list will be interfiled into one listing. If the top eligible list candidate is from the Department in which the vacancy exists, then that candidate will be considered prior to the
90
consideration of the most senior transfer candidate. If this is not the case, then the most senior transfer candidate will be given first consideration, then the top eligible list candidate and alternate transfer and eligible list candidates to the extent permitted by law.
18. B.	5. The name of each employee who transfers shall
be removed from all transfer rosters for a period of one year; thereafter, it may be placed upon any transfer roster as provided in paragraph 1. above.
6.	Permanent vacancies will be filled as soon as practicable after selection is made.
7.	The Authority is not obligated to consider or appoint transfer candidates to positions which will be vacant for six months or less (one year or less for temporary vacancies due to maternity leave).
8.	A clerical employee who declines three transfer opportunities after interview will have their name removed from the transfer list for all clerical positions (except new positions) for one year from the date of the third declination.
18 . C.	Out-of-Title
WHERE A CLERICAL EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO WORK IN A HIGHER-LEVEL POSITION FOR LESS THAN ONE DAY, THAT EMPLOYEE WILL BE PAID OUT-OF-TITLE WORK. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN ASSIGNMENT OF A CLERICAL EMPLOYEE CONSITUTES OUT-OF-TITLE WORK FOR LESS THAN A DAY SHALL BE MADE BY THE AUTHORITY AND WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 14.
18.D. Toll Collectors Assigned Clerical Positions
No part-time, temporary, seasonal or permanent Toll Collector or employees in non-competitive positions shall routinely be assigned to work in a clerical position. This does not preclude such assignments which provide for vacation relief.
18.E. Mail Room Clothing and Allowance
1.	All Mailroom employees shall receive either SIX long sleeve shirts or short sleeve shirts/blouses and SIX slacks annually. IN ADDITION, THEY WILL ALSO RECEIVE A WINTER JACKET SIMILAR TO THE JACKETS PROVIDED TO MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES AND WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR SAFETY SHOE REIMBURSEMENT AS PROVIDED IN ARTICLE 16.L.4.
2.	The Authority agrees to pay a clothing cleaning allowance of $95 annually pursuant to the Work Clothing Allowance Policy Statement (25-3-01) of the Authority. A quarter of this allowance will be paid on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 to those Mailroom employees issued such clothing.
91
3.	THE AUTHORITY WILL PROVIDE TO EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED SUCH SAFETY EQUIPMENT AND WHOSE POSITIONS REQUIRE THAT THEY WEAR SUCH EQUIPMENT, REIMBURSEMENT FOR TWO PAIRS OF SAFETY SHOES.	PURCHASES OF
SAFETY SHOES WILL BE REIMBURSED UP TO $85.00.
EFFECTIVE JULY 1,	2002, THE REIMBURSEMENT
RATE WILL BE INCREASED TO $100.00.
THE AUTHORITY FURTHER AGREES UPON REQUEST OF THE EMPLOYEE TO REIMBURSE THE EMPLOYEE FOR THE REPLACEMENT FOR SUCH SAFETY SHOES FOR THESE EMPLOYEES AND THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED SUCH SAFETY SHOES AT THE RATE SET FORTH ABOVE, WHEN REPLACEMENT IS MADE NECESSARY BY WEAR OR DAMAGE ON THE JOB.
THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE PROVIDED OR REIMBURSED FOR SUCH EQUIPMENT SHALL MAKE FULL APPROPRIATE USE THEREOF.

3.	Selection of vacation periods shall be in order of seniority as defined in this Article. Vacation requests of one week or multiples thereof shall take precedence over vacation requests of less than five days.
92

Radio Dispatcher overtime shall first be offered to Radio Dispatchers except on those occasions when more than one Senior Radio Dispatcher is on the shift in which such overtime opportunity occurs. Overtime will continue to be offered in accordance with seniority, and only by working, being assigned to work, or personally refusing an overtime opportunity shall a Radio Dispatcher move to the bottom of the availability sheet.
2.	If an error in the assignment of overtime occurs, the Authority shall have 21 calendar days from notice thereof to rectify the error by offering the employee another overtime opportunity. If it is unable to do so within such time, the Authority shall pay such employee for the lost time.

Required overtime will be so rotated yearly July 1 to June 30.
4.	Where practicable, Radio Dispatchers shall receive the equivalent of two fifteen minute rest periods and adequate time for a meal during each shift with due consideration of the necessity of performing the work of the Bureau of Communications; such time off is considered working time during which the employee may be required to interrupt to assist in the work of the Bureau whenever necessary.

APPENDIX B
HOLIDAY SCHEDULING FOR TOLL EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE AND SERVICE AREA MAINTENANCE FOR THOSE HOLIDAYS SET FORTH IN ARTICLE 12.A.1.
The following scheduling method should be used for Unit I Toll Equipment Maintenance and Service Area Maintenance employees when a holiday falls within the scheduling period:
1.	Schedule employees four pass days so that no employee's pass day falls on the holiday;
2.	On a rotating basis (with seniority as the guideline) schedule off those employees not needed on the holiday.	The number of employees so scheduled would
depend on work load and/or traffic volume.
Following are examples of this scheduling method:
EMPLOYEE A - Not scheduled to work holiday
THU FRI SAT SUN MON TUES WED THU FRI SAT SUN MON TUES WED 10/4 10/5 10/6 10/7 10/8 10/9 10/10 lO/ll 10/12 10/13 10/1410/15 10/16 10/17 XXRRHRRRRRXXRR
In the above example, the employee did not work the holiday or any pass days, and, therefore, submitted the following cards:
9 R cards - 72 hours
1 Holiday card -	8 hours
TOTAL	80 hours
EMPLOYEE B - Scheduled to work holiday
THU FRI	SAT SUN	MON	TUES	WED THU FRI SAT SUN MON TUES	WED
10/4 10/5	10/6 10/7	10/8	10/9	10/10 10/11 10/12 10/13 10/14 10/15 10/16	10717
X X	R R	R/H	R	RRRRXXR	~R
Employee B worked the holiday. Therefore, the following cards would be submitted:
9 R cards	-	72	hours
1 Holiday card	-	8	hours
1 Overtime card -	12	hours
8 hours (at time and one-half)
TOTAL	92 hours
NOTE:	In a schedule period during which there is a holiday,
if an employee works the holiday or one pass day, the employee is compensated at the rate of time and one-half for the hours worked on these days, provided the employee has been in full pay status for the other days in the schedule. Full pay status means either working, use of accruals, or on other leave with full pay.
110
APPENDIX C EXAMPLES OF THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 8.G.I. (NIGHT SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL)
A Radio Dispatcher, working a shift from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., works two hours overtime from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. , is entitled to night shift differential pay for the two hours worked beyond their regular shift.
A Radio Dispatcher working a shift from 12:00 Midnight to 8:00 a.m. also works two hours overtime, to 10:00 a.m. The Dispatcher is entitled to night shift differential pay for the eight hours between 12:00 Midnight and 8:00 a.m., and not for the two hours between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.
A Radio Dispatcher on a pass day is called in to work overtime for the last two hours of a "II Shift" ahd the first two hours of a "III Shift," from 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. The Dispatcher is entitled to night shift differential pay for the two hours worked between 4:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
A Unit I employee has a regular work schedule, Monday through Friday, from 4:30 p.m. until 12:30 a.m. This is not a "shift," because no other Unit I employees work the preceding or following eight hour periods, but this work day includes more than four hours outside regular day shift hours, so the employee is entitled to night shift differential pay for the entire shift.
A Computer Operator regularly works from 4:00 p.m. until 12:00 Midnight. The Operator receives night shift differential pay for the entire shift. If Operators work overtime, until 1:00 a.m., they also receive night shift differential pay for that hour. If they work overtime, from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., they do not receive night shift differential pay for that overtime hour.

ARTICLE 16	- Part-Time Toll Collection Employees
16. A. Equitable Distribution of Work Hours
1.	PTTCS must designate which of the following areas for which they will be available for work. A PTTC in addition to a designated area may also indicate THEIR availability for work in one or more stations of another area.
New York Division
Area 1 - New Rochelle Area 2 - Yonkers Area 3 - Tappan Zee Bridge Area 4 - Spring Valley Area 5 - Woodbury/Harriman/ Newburgh/New Paltz
Albany	Division
Area 1	- Stations 19-21
Area 2	- Berkshire Section, Stations 21B - 22
Area 3	- Stations 23 - 25A
Area 4	- Stations 26 - 29
5
Syracuse Division
Area 1 - Stations 29A - 31 Area 2 - Stations 32 - 34 Area 3 - Stations 34A - 39 Area 4 - Stations 40-42 Area 5 - Stations 43 and 44
Buffalo Division
Area 1 - Stations 45 and 46 Area 2 - Stations 47 - 48A Area 3 - Stations 48A - 50 Area 4 - Stations 55 - 58 Area 5 - Stations 58-61 Area 6 - Niagara Section
16.A. 2. PTTCS must indicate the same availability for all stations within their designated area.
3.	PTTCS will be required to indicate their availability for work within their designated area and any other stations outside of their designated area for which they wish to make themselves available. Such availability will be submitted to the Toll Division Manager's office six weeks in advance of the first schedule to be worked under this system. PTTCS will be given two weeks in advance of the six-week deadline to indicate their availability. Such availability will be in effect for the following TWO schedules. After this TWO-schedule period, this process will again be followed.
NOTE:	PTTCS will indicate their availability in
the same fashion as full-time Toll Collectors do for overtime for all dates.
4.	After receipt of such availability by the Toll Division Manager's office, PTTC work assignments then known INCLUDING TRAFFIC SHIFTS, REQUESTS FOR VACATION, CHECK-OUT AND LONG-TERM SICK LEAVE RECEIVED WITHIN SEVEN DAYS OF THE FULL-TIME WORK SCHEDULE POSTING will initially be assigned within the PTTC' s designated area and other indicated stations in accordance with the PTTC's availability. Such assignments will be in seniority order.
6

FOR PRE-ASSIGNED SHIFTS, PART-TIME TOLL COLLECTORS WILL RECEIVE A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF AVAILABLE SHIFTS BASED UPON THEIR AVAILABILITY. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY DETERMINING THEIR AVAILABLE HOURS PER 28-DAY SCHEDULE AND DIVIDING THAT BY 672 HOURS, WHICH IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF AVAILABLE HOURS PER 28-DAYS SCHEDULE PERIOD. FOR EXAMPLE, A PART-TIME TOLL COLLECTOR AVAILABLE FROM 0700 TO 1500 ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS (64 HOURS) PROPORTIONATE SHARE WOULD BE CALCULATED BY DIVIDING 64 HOURS BY 672 HOURS.
Thereafter, PTTC work which becomes available will be OFFERED TO PART-TIME TOLL COLLECTORS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR AVAILABILITY. SHOULD A PREASSIGNED SHIFT BE SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELED BY THE AUTHORITY, THE PTTC ASSIGNED TO THAT SHIFT WILL BE GIVEN FIRST OPPORTUNITY FOR SUBSEQUENT CALL-OUT WORK DURING THE REMAINING SCHEDULING PERIOD CONSISTENT WITH THEIR AVAILABLITY.
REFUSALS OF PART-TIME TOLL COLLECTOR WORK IS A BASIS FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE PART-TIME TOLL COLLECTOR’S EMPLOYMENT, PROVIDED SUCH PART-TIME TOLL COLLECTOR HAD INDICATED AVAILABILITY FOR SUCH WORK ASSIGNMENTS, HOWEVER, A PART-TIME TOLL COLLECTOR MAY CANCEL UP TO TWO SHIFTS PER 28 DAY SCHEDULE.
16.A. 5.
6.
Major changes in PTTC availability - for example:	a move of a part-timer’s
residence, change in the work hours or location of another position which the part-timer holds, or an unusual change in the personal circumstances of a part-timer will be permitted. No other changes in availability will be permitted.
Seniority for the purposes of equitable distribution of PTTC work hours is defined as:
date of first appointment as a PTTC. Breaks of less than one year in PTTC service will not be counted as a break in service and such time will be counted as good service. Breaks of one year or more will be considered a break in
7
service and no prior PTTC service will be counted.
7. A joint Labor/Management Committee will be established to study and make recommendations regarding equitable distribution of:
Preassigned and unscheduled work hours.
Present supplemental payment work hour threshold.
Scheduling for work hours in predetermined blocks.
Ways to enable PTTCS to become eligible for participation in State Health Plans on a direct pay basis.
A report will be issued within six months of May 1, 1992.
16.B. Holidays
In addition to a PTTC’s indication of availability for other holidays, PTTCS must be available for work on the six major holidays:
Memorial Day (Legal holiday) Independence Day Labor Day Thanksgiving Day Christmas Day New Year’s Day
All work performed on the above six holidays by a PTTC will be paid at time and one-half of their regular rate of pay. Holiday pay will be applied to the particular holiday and overtime pay will be applied to the previous day worked when working the holiday means the employee has exceeded 40 hours in the work week.
Each PTTC will be assigned to work a maximum of four of the six holidays (two summer and two winter). PTTCS will indicate their holiday preference, the assignment of such holiday work will be in an equitable manner over the life of the Contract to ensure that no PTTC is scheduled to work the same holiday each year.
8
It is understood that should traffic conditions warrant additional staffing on a specific holiday beyond that which has been scheduled, additional PTTCS may be assigned to work the specific holiday. Such assignments will be on a reverse seniority basis.
16.C. Posting of Schedules
The parties agree that the shifts assigned PTTCS are to be posted at each station for that station within a reasonable period of time.
16.D. Reassignment of PTTCS
The parties agree that PTTCS who report to an assigned work location to work and are then reassigned to another work location will be paid for all time spent traveling to the new work location plus a travel allowance of 23 cents per mile.
16.E. Uniforms
The parties agree that PTTCS averaging 80 hours of work in each 28-day schedule will be provided with four shirts, two pants, one sweater and one winter coat. The parties understand that women may request skirts and that short and long sleeve shirts are involved. All other PTTCS will be provided four shirts and one sweater.
16.F. Preference When Filling Full-Time Positions
The parties agree that the Authority will give preference in seniority order to those PTTCS who are reachable for appointment from the Civil Service List when filling full-time Toll Collector positions.
16.G. Cancellation of a Shift
The parties agree that if a PTTC shift or assignment is canceled, the Authority will attempt to notify the employee at least 24 hours in advance of the cancellation.

16.H. Replacing a Full-Time Employee

9
lane assignment as the full-time Collector would have received.
1	6.1. Lockers
