WAGES
Section 5.	For the purposes of this agreement the following definitions regarding rates of pay will be used:
A.	Wage Rate - means the employee's rate of pay as defined in Article X, Section 4.
89
B.	Hourly Rate - means the employee’s wage rate plus COLA, red circle, Improshare/Gainshare and shift premium when applicable.
C.	Average Hourly Rate - means the rate used in calculating premium pay. This rate is determined by taking the average of eamings, including wage rate, COLA, red circle, Improshare and shift premium, for all hours worked in die payroll week. The determination of this rate does not include earnings for hours paid due to Bereavement, Jury Service, Holiday and Volunteer Emergency Worker Duty.
D.	Personal Rate - means a rate above the maximum rate of the rate range of an employee’s job classification. For an employee with a personal rate the personal rate supersedes the term wage as used in this Agreement.
1.	Employees downgraded and personalized because of a compensable injury prior to November 1, 1971 will maintain their personal rate in the event that a reduction in workforce requires them to be further downgraded. In addition, they will receive wage increases in accordance with the labor grade to which they were assigned when they were injured. This means their present wage rate will be increased by the cents-per-hour negotiated for the labor grade they were in at the time of injury rather than their present labor grade.
2.	Employees downgraded and personalized because of a compensable injury after November 1, 1971 will be
31
X
WAGES
paid the personal rate for the grade they were assigned at the time of the injury for as tong as their seniority would allow them to hold that grade. If they would have been bumped had they not been injured, their personal rate will be adjusted to the grade they would have held by virtue of exercising their seniority rights. Furthermore, such employees will receive wage increases in accordance with the labor grade to which they are assigned at the time of the general increase.
3.	A personal rate may also result under the provisions of Article XII, Section 7.
4.	A former leadperson with a personal rate will receive one half to the next higher even cent, of the wage adjustments provided in this Agreement for the top rate of the job classification to which such employee is assigned. If such adjustment results in an employee receiving a wage rate lower than the top rate of the job classification to which the employee is assigned, the employee will receive the top rate. The provisions of this Section will not apply to those personal rates that were established prior to May 21, 1962.
5.	In no case will an employee retain a personal rate when permanently transferred from a formerly nonincentive job to a formerly incentive job.
Section 6- A monthly tool allowance of one hundred and 90 fifty ($150) dollars will be paid to all Tool Room and
Maintenance skilled trades employees with a formal apprenticeship training background with payment being made at the end of each quarter.

When such transfer is to a job more than one (1) labor grade higher than the employee's present job, the employee's wage rate will be determined as follows:
1.	The employee will receive the first step in the rate range provided the employee has not held the second step of the next lower labor grade or previously held an equal or higher rated job than the employee is transferring to.
2.	The employee will receive the second step in the rate range provided the employee has held the second step of the next lower grade or previously held an equal or higher rale to which the employee is transferring to.
B.	W the employee who moves receives the first step rate, the employee will progress to the second step rate six- 93 teen (16) weeks after the award date and/or permanent assignment to the job.
| C. The period of time required to progress further within the
I	rate range of the job of higher labor grade will begin with	94

2.	Transfer to SAME OR LOWER Grade - Start with the volunteers, with preference given to the most senior qualified person. If no employee volunteers, transfer the junior person.
3.	Transfer involves 10 HOUR Schedule (regardless of labor grade) - and the group you are transferring from is on an eight-hour schedule, then ask starting with the senior qualified person. If there are no volunteers, transfer the junior qualified person.
4.	Transfer STRICTLY for OVERTIME - If the transfer is strictly to cover overtime hours, then regardless of labor grade, the qualified employee with the lowest overtime hours in the job code should be asked.
5.	Transfer from a formerly non-incentive job to a formerly incentive job - and the transfer is to a lower or same grade, then ask employees in seniority sequence starting with the senior qualified person.
Any temporary transfers involving a shift change will be made on a voluntary basis, except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 of this Article,
The Company will maintain a temporary transfer record for each employee which will be made available for review by the Union. In addition, a copy of the temporary transfer payment document will be provided to the Union representative at interest.

2.	Employees with non-compensable medical limitations will receive the labor grade of the job to which they are temporarily transferred.
(Payment ot any building bonus will be in accordance with the Improshare/Gainshare plan.)

XI-XII
TRANSFER OF EMPLOYEES JOB EVALUATION PLAN
Section 8.	The Company may assign work locations on a temporary basis within the Maintenance Department in accordance with Section 5. Where such assignments require a change in shift and cannot be made on a voluntary basis, they will be made on the basis of reverse order of seniority from among the employees in the same job classification in all maintenance areas who have the ability to do the work. Such assignments will be subject to the pay guarantees set forth in Sections 5(A) and the Improshare/Gainshare plan.
Section 9.	Transfers as referred to in this Article will apply to 109 bumping, recall, temporary transfers and permanent transfers except where specific provisions to the contrary have been provided in this Agreement to cover specific situations.
ARTICLE XII - JOB EVALUATION PLAN
Section 1.	The pay level of new or substantially changed jobs 110 will be established using a job-slotting approach. The new or substantially changed job will be compared to the benchmark jobs in the same occupational grouping. The work will be slotted and paid at the occupational group level that most closely reflects the job and skill requirements of the work.
Section 2.	The Company will develop generic job descrip-111 tions and minimum standards for each occupational group which are representative of the job and skill requirements for that level of work within the occupational grouping as of November 3, 1985. These generic descriptions will be reviewed with the Union Job Evaluation Specialist prior to implementation and a copy provided. If the Union disagrees that the generic description is representative of the job and skill requirements of the work within the occupational group, it may file a grievance within thirty (30) calendar days of the Company action. The grievance may only challenge the issue of whether or not the description is representative of the work tn the occupational group. As such, should the
38
XII
JOB EVALUATION PLAN
grievance be submitted to arbitration, only that issue is to be decided by the arbitrator.
The minimum standards will be written for the jobs as they exist as of November 3, 1985.
Section 3.	The new generic description for each occupational group will be slotted at the same pay level that the existing jobs were on September 20, 1985, based on the NMTA Job Evaluation System. These new generic descriptions will become benchmark jobs for that skill level and 113 those job requirements within the occupational grouping.
Section 4.	The Company’s description and slotting of new or substantially changed jobs will be reviewed with the 114 Union and ail incumbents of each job code. A substantially changed job is defined as the addition of a higher skill requirement which clearly differentiates the skill requirements from other jobs at the same or lower levels within the same occupational grouping.
The Union may challenge either the appropriateness of the generic description and/or the pay level of a new or a sub- 115 stantially changed job (other than those specified in Sections 2 and 3 above), by filing a grievance within thirty (30) normal work days following the review of the job. If the pay level of the job is increased, retroactivity back to the date of the change wilt be paid to those employees assigned to the job in the work groups involved.
When the Union claims an existing job has been substantially changed so as to warrant a review of the slotting of the 116 job, the appropriate Union representative will make a request in writing to the building’s Industrial Relations Representative, stating the building, job code and the reason for requesting a review of the slotting.	.
39
XII
JOB EVALUATION PLAN
The Company will answer the request within thirty (30) nor-117 mal work days.

Section 5.	Any changes to job descriptions after the generic descriptions are installed will be communicated in writing to the employees involved. All changes to the job description will be noted and dated on the job description. A copy will be sent to the Union office along with the date the changes were made. The Union may request that any change to the generic job description be reviewed with the affected employees, the immediate supervisor and the job evaluation specialists. The Union will not be unreasonable in making this request.
Section 6.	The Company will reduce the number of occu-19 pational groupings to the extent practicable while providing a system for promotion and demotion of employees under the provisions of Article XXII. In the event new occupational groupings are created, or existing occupational groupings combined and/or moved, the Company and the Union will meet to insure the change being made does not interfere with the seniority provisions of Article XXII.
Section 7.	If a job is downgraded after the effective date of 120 this Agreement as a result of change in job content, the employee(s) assigned to such job will not receive a reduction in wage rate. Where a personal rate results, the employ-ee(s) with the personal rate is to be returned in accordance with their seniority to a job in the same labor grade, and shift as the employee’s former job and in occupational groups the employee currently or formerly occupied or in the case of a classification for which rates have been negotiated returned 40

COLA CALCULATION EXAMPLE
(Repeated from the 1991 Bargaining Agreement)
An example of the calculation for the second quarterly COLA adjustment, i,e., change in Index from July 1991 to January 1992 would be as follows:
July 1991 Actual Index is 400.0
January 1992 Actual Index is 406.9 (Example)

Step 1:
Calculate the difference between the July 1991 Actual Index and the January 1992 Actual Index
1/92 is 406.9
7/91 is 400.0
6.9 is the difference
Step 2:
Calculate the difference between the July 1991 Actual
Index and the Triggered January 1992 Index. (Note: First quarterly trigger is .0075, second quarterly trigger is .015, third quarterly trigger is ,0225, fourth quarterly trigger is .03, fifth quarterly trigger is .0375 and so on until the twelfth quarterly trigger is .09.)
1/92 Triggered Index is 406.0
7/91 Actual Index is 400.0
6.0 is the difference
Step 3:
Calculate the cent allowance of the formula 1e for each .3 rise in the Index between July 1991 and January 1992 (from Step 1).
6.9 is the difference between 7/91 Actual Index and 1/92 Actual Index
6.9 (the difference) divided by .3 equals 23c
Step 4:
Calculate the cent allowance of the formula 1d for each .3 rise in the Triggered Index between July 1991 Actual Index and January 1992 Triggered Index (from Step 2).
6.0 is the difference between 7/91 Actual Index and j 1/92 Triggered Index

20c Triggered Rise (Step 4)
3<f is the difference
Step 6:
Subtract from the difference between the Actual and Triggered Rise in the CPI-W (Step 5) and the actual payment made in the previous quarter to get the payment to be made as the second quarterly payment.

Letter of Understanding - #6 Asbestos Medical Monitoring Program
November 6, 2000
Mr. Bruce Evans, Business Manager
Sheet Metal Workers' International Association
Local #527
4110 New Court Rd.
Syracuse, NY 13206	•
Dear Mr. Evans;
This will confirm our discussions during the recently completed negotiations concerning an Asbestos Medical Monitoring Program. Through cooperative exchange of information and experience between members of Sheet Metal Workers' Local 527 and representatives of Carrier Corporation, an Asbestos Medical Monitoring Program will be developed and delivered for the purpose of providing health assurance information to individual employees who may be at increased risk of exposure to asbestos. >
1.	Union and Company Participants
The following representatives from the Union and the Company are contemplated;
1.	Company Director of Environmental and Health Services.
2.	Company Medical Director.
3.	Union Environmental Health and Safety Specialist.
4.	Other designated Union representative.
Other Carrier employees may be utilised by the Company or the Union to assist in gathering required information.
144
N. Exposure Selection Criteria
It is understood that the Asbestos Medical Monitoring Program is to be focused on those employees who, due to their duties, may be at significantly increased risk of exposure to asbestos. An example of such a group of employees are those employed in the Powerhouse where, due to the presence of asbestos insulating material and the employees' daily proximity to the asbestos, significantly increased risk of exposure to asbestos is possible,
III.	Medical Selection and Monitoring Criteria
Recognizing that the health effects of exposure to asbestos commonly take twenty (20) to thirty (30) years to appear, it is appropriate that the Union and the Company select a minimum length of employment criteria for inclusion of an individual in the Asbestos Medical Monitoring Program.
The following Asbestos Medical Monitoring Program components are suggested as being appropriate for consideration:
1.	Training regarding asbestos hazards and protective measures, and the components of the Asbestos Medical Monitoring Program.
2.	Collection of a relevant Medical History.
3.	Performance of appropriate Lung Function Tests on a frequency to be determined.
4.	Collection and qualified reading of appropriate chest X-ray information on a frequency to be determined.
5.	Appropriate explanation and counseling regarding med-| ical findings with the individual employees included in the program.
It is understood that the Asbestos Medical Monitoring Program is a voluntary and cooperative effort which, follow
145
ing the initial set of medical services, will require the included employees to arrange with the Medical Department for follow-up exams on the frequency which has been designated by the Union and the Company.
IV.	Continuation of Cooperative Understanding Between the Union and the Company
Should either the Union or the Company feel that the cooperative intent of this agreement has been broken, either party may unilaterally terminate this understanding upon written notice.
Very truly yours,
Charles V. Gagliardi

Dear Mr. Evans:
The following represents the understanding reached during the 1997 negotiations regarding the Modified Gainsharing Plan proposed by the joint committee appointed to investigate alternatives to the Improshare Plan adopted during the term of the 1985 agreement.

The base for the labor productivity measure will bt updated from 1986 to 1997.
Goats for the new business measures will provide fc year over year continuous improvement.
Site-wide guidelines and plan rules will be developed b the jointly appointed Site Gainsharing Committee whict will also be responsible for an annual plan review as wel as approval of each building’s proposed measures.
148
A procedure for handling disputes will be included in the plan rules, replacing Schedule G of the Imprcshare Plan and incorporating the appeals and arbitration procedure dated February 3, 1988,
Final guidelines and rules will be approved by the Joint Site Steering Committee.
It is the expectation of both parties that first year guidelines will be issued by January 15, 1998 and that each building will implement a modified plan during the 2nd quarter of 1998.
Should the Modified Gainsharing Plan prove unworkable, it is agreed to refer to this issue back to the site Joint Labor Management Committee for the mutual development of a back-up group bonus system for the Improshare Plan, on a building by building basis.

Syracuse, NY 13206
Dear Mr. Evans:
This letter will serve to confirm our understanding reached during the 1994 negotiations.
In the event of an overtime bypass when assigning overtime within job code, work group and shift the Company will compensate the bypassed employee(s) for the hours as if the employee had worked the overtime opportunity and this time will be credited as time worked on the overtime records under the following conditions:
1
,1. The overtime distribution is correctly challenged by an ■ affected employee(s) or Union representative prior to the overtime opportunity and the distribution of overtime is < not corrected. Employees who are within the fourteen t (14) hour limitation and where the revised work sched- • ule has been noted do not constitute a correct challenge.
i 2. The overtime distribution is correctly challenged by an
I affected employee(s) or Union representative after the overtime is worked and it is verified the supervisor failed to comply with the provisions of Article IX, Section 4 on the posting of work schedules and/or Article IX, Section 10(D), paragraph 67 on the posting of overtime records.
3. The overtime within a job code in a work group and shift is offered outside the fourteen (14) hour limitation because the bypassed employee is not proficient to perform the work and no proficiency notice has been issued.

Only when the conditions cited in 1,2 or 3 occur will anovertime bypass result in payment to the affected employee(s). A "bypass” which results from borrowing for overtime, as provided in Article IX, Section 10 (G) will not serve as the basis for any payment, providing the borrowed employee is within the fourteen (14) hour limitation in the employee’s own work group, job code and shift.

3,	The “lump sum" form of payment will not be applicable to pension credited service accrued on or after July 1, 1995. Employees hired on or after January 1, 1994 can not accrue any pension credited service toward a “lump sum" form of payment under our pension plan.

Letter of Understanding - #24 Lump Sum Pension Benefit
' November 6, 2000
Mr. Bruce Evans, Business Manager
Sheet Metal Workers’ international Association
Local #527
4110 New Court Rd.
Syracuse, NY 13206
Dear Mr. Evans:
This will confirm the agreement reached concerning the lump sum pension benefit, during the negotiations for the 1994 - 1997 collective bargaining agreement.
All employees hired on or before December 31, 1993 who are entitled to a pension, are also entitled to the lump sum pension benefit option. Effective July 1,1995, the lump sum eligible pension credited service will be frozen for those employees. Employees who select that option shall have it computed based on credited service earned up through June 30,1995. For purposes of computing the lump sum amount, an employee will be considered to have earned | credited service up through June 30, 1995 for each year of 1 service with the company in accordance with Article XXVH, Section 3.
Example:
Initial service date: July 1, 1978
Last day worked:	June 30, 2018
Total years of service: 40 years
in this example, the employee has over 35 years of service, but under the plan as heretofore in place, only the last 35 years would be years of credited service. With this agreement, however, for purpose of the calculation of the number of years of credited service for computing the lump sum benefit payment option, the years of service from July 1, 1978 through June 30, t995 will be considered as years of credited service under Article XXVII, Section 3. Therefore,
168
this employee’s lump sum amount will be figured based on 17 years of credited service from 1978 through June 30, 1995; and the remaining benefit will be based on the last 18 years of service through June 30,2018.
It is also agreed that the last sentence of Article XXVN, Section 1 shall read “...specifically revised in accordance with this Article and Letter of Understanding #24,"'	• ’
' This agreement shall not prejudice either party's position '• before the NLRB or the courts in NLRB Case 3-CA-17827,

Syracuse, NY 13206
Dear Mr. Evans:
This letter will serve to confirm our understanding reached during the recently concluded 2000 negotiations regarding the establishment of a new gainsharing plan for those employees assigned to RCD and RCG warehouse operations.
A special joint labor-management gainsharing committee will be established within one month following the completion of the 2000 labor negotiations. This committee will be comprised of six (6) members with three (3) being appointed by , the Business Manager, Local No. 527 and three (3) mem- ; bers appointed by the Manager, Syracuse Industrial Relations.
The committee will be responsible for developing a proposed gainsharing plan for each of the RCD and RCG warehouse operations. The proposed gainsharing plan is subject to review and approval of the Business Manager, Local No. > 527, the Manager, Syracuse Industrial Relations, and the General Managers for each of the RCD and RCG I Warehouse Operations. It is agreed the proposed plan will I include the following features:
1.	The minimum payout under this plan will be 0% and the maximum payout under this plan will be 6% of the employee’s wage rate earnings, including overtime.
176
2.	The payout will be matte quarterly to eligible participants in a separate check from their regular wage earnings.
3.	Only those employees assigned to the 2908 job classification in either the RCD or RCG warehouse operation are eligible participants and must have worked a minimum of three hundred (300) hours in the applicable quarter in order to be eligible for the gainsharing payment.
4.	The plan will have a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of five (5) metrics being used to determine the payment calculations. The metrics under each plan will be established annually. The quarterly goals for each metric, which may vary from quarter to quarter, will also be reviewed and established annually. The potential metrics for the plan could be cost per line shipped, lines picked per hour, credit requests per lines shipped on a rolling 12 month average, cycle count location accuracy, fill rate or inventory turns.
5.	Each party agrees the metrics of the plan will be business related, directly tied to the ongoing success of the business and will be reviewed and established annually to ensure the baseline and/or goals are aligned with continuous improvements of the business operation.
It is the expectation of both parties that the new RCD and RCG gainsharing plans will be implemented no later than March 31, 2001. In the event a new gainsharing plan is not approved by the parties for implementation by March 31, 2001, the matter will be referred back to the Business Manager, Local 527, SMWIA and the Manager, Syracuse Industrial Relations for resolution.	■

Letter of Understanding - #31 New Provision-Drug and Afconoi Screening
November 6, 2000
Mr. Bruce Evans, Business Manager
Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association
Local #527
4110 New Court Rd.
Syracuse, NY 13206
Dear Mr. Evans:
Carrier and Local 527 are committed to ensuring a sate working environment for all employees and recognize their responsibility to assist employees in dealing with drug and/or alcohol problems. Carrier and Local 527 agree to form a joint labor management committee, including appropriate medical and EAR personnel. The purpose of this committee will be to select a lab(s) for initial and confirmation screening, and to participate in employee and supervisor training programs. After implementation the committee will continue to monitor the policy and address any complaints of protocol or abuses of the policy with the Manager, Syracuse Industrial Relations, the Business Manager, President, and Vice President of the Union. This policy will be implemented once appropriate education and training are provided to the workforce, supervision and Union officials but no sooner than July 1,2001. After implementation of this policy the Company will assume sole responsibility for administration of this policy for day to day operation of this policy.
The Union EAP Liaison will review test results and applications of this policy.
As part of this commitment employees may be required to submit to drug/aicohoi screening under scenarios 1 and 2 described below and subject to the process detailed in the Anti Drug/Alcohol Protocol:
180
L An employee observed exhibiting a combination of characteristics leading to reasonable suspicion that the employee may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol by their supervision will:
A.	The employee will be assessed by medical as to their fitness for duty.
B.	If the employee is determined to exhibit specific contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drugs/alcohof the employee will be subject to alcohol/drug testing.
Reasonable suspicion that the employee may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol include: lack of balance: staggered walk, red, watery, glassy eyes; dilated or contracted pupils; disorientation; uncoordinated movement: impaired judgement; flushed face; slurred speech; detection of alcohol on their breath or possession of alcohol or drugs on the premises or determined to have been involved in an unsafe act or injured due an accident involving moving machinery.
When there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs while on duty the appropriate information will be gathered and provided to the union official. If the test above proves to be negative all information regarding the incident will be destroyed.
2. After an initial positive drug/atcohol test the employee will be subject to “Return-to-Duty" testing as described in the Anti Drug/Alcohol Protocol.
The procedures for fitness for duty and drug/atcohol testing are as follows:
* The employee has the right to have a Union representative present during the testing and when results are communicated and the employee will receive a copy of the test procedures and protocols including chain of custody requirements at the time testing occurs.
181
■	Employee must sign a consent form before being required to produce specimens.
•	A refusal to sign the consent form or submit a specimen will be considered a positive result.
•	Employees are afforded the opportunity to disclose all prescription drugs and controlled substances they have used.
•	A positive test will be subject to a confirmation test.
•	The employee has the right to have a certified lab of his/her choice test the specimen sample tested by the Company’s certified laboratory. If the test proves positive the employee wilt cover the cost of the test, if the test proves to be negative the Company will bear the cost of the rest.
•	If a confirmation test proves to be negative the positive test result will be removed from the employees record and medical file.
The toilowing is an overview ot the testing protocols. The full protocol will be provided to the employee at the time of testing.
•	Screenings are done for eight drug groups and alcohol.
•	Urinalysis screen is used for drugs and controlled substances.
■	A breathalyzer or blood sample is used for alcohol screening.
*	A negative finding indicates that the sample either contains no drugs/alcohol, or contains an amount below the cut-off level for a specific drug or alcohol.
•	A positive finding indicates the sample contains an indicated drug or alcohol in an amount at or above the cut-off tevel for that drug or alcohol.
•	Any employee tested is immediately deemed unfit for work and sent home with pay for that day (paid for the amount of scheduled day). The employee will remain out of work until the results of the testing are received. If the test results are negative the employee will be returned to work and be paid for time lost.
■	If the test result is positive, the employee will be disciplined in accordance with the collective bargaining
182
agreement and required to sign an agreement that requires evaluation by Carrier's Employee Assistance Program provider.
•	Results of an employee's test results and consent and release forms become a part of the employee’s medical file unless the test is negative which will result in the information being removed from the employee’s files.
•	Actions taken under this policy are to be dealt with in as strict of confidence as is reasonably possible. Information relevant to possible employee violation of the policy, results of testing and ariy follow-up actions required are shared on a need to know basis only.
