ARTICLE I APPLICATION AND PURPOSE OF CONTRACT
Section 1.	Application. This contract applies to the employees in the recognized bargaining unit located at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex, Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee, for those operations contracted to the Company by the United States Air Force. This contract applies to those wage employees of URS who are permanently assigned to Arnold Air Force Base, TN whether they are temporarily assigned to work inside or outside the confines of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex, Arnold Air Force Base, Tennessee. This agreement contains all the conditions agreed upon and is effective between the Company and the Union, and supersedes all previous agreements, collectively or individually, between the Company and the Union. No agent or representative of either party has the authority individually to alter or to modify the Agreement. Any modification of the Agreement shall be made only by the mutual consent of both parties in writing.
Section 2.	Purpose. The purpose of this contract is to set forth the agreement reached December 1, 2016, between the Company and the Union, who are signatory hereto, as to the rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment to be observed by the parties, except as it may be amended hereafter by written agreement of the parties.
ARTICLE II RECOGNITION
Section 1.	Recognition. The Company recognizes the Union as the exclusive Bargaining Agent with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours, and other conditions of employment for the employees of the Company in the recognized Bargaining Unit as set forth below.
The recognized Bargaining Unit consists of all of the Company’s base supply, freight, vehicle operations and maintenance, fire protection services, and grounds maintenance employees within the classifications as set forth in Exhibit A attached hereto, and any new or revised job classifications as may be established in Article IX, Section 2 of this contract.
Excluded from the Bargaining Unit are all other employees and any other existing job classifications not covered by the above paragraph.
A Bargaining Unit employee, at the time he is hired, will be notified by the Company that the Union is recognized by the Company as the exclusive Bargaining Agent for the employees in the Bargaining Unit.
1
The Company will notify the appropriate Chief Steward of any new hire(s) into the Bargaining Unit within his seniority group.
No outside business activities will be conducted at AEDC, and no employee may perform work for another contractor/subcontractor currently engaged in work at AEDC. When job openings are declared by the Company, the appropriate Chief Steward and the Air Engineering Metal Trades Council (AEMTC) shall be notified electronically and in writing of approved position(s). Openings will be filled in accordance with Article V of this contract. Recommendations received from the Chief Stewards in a timely manner will receive consideration.
Additionally, as part of a new employee’s first day processing, the respective Chief Steward shall be allowed a brief introduction meeting.
Section 2.	Anti-discrimination. There shall be no discrimination, interference or coercion against any employee because of membership or non-membership in the Union by the Company or any of its agents, and the Union likewise agrees that there shall be no discrimination, interference or coercion against any employee of the Company due to membership or non-membership in the Union.
Section 3.	Equal Employment Opportunity. The Company and the Union agree to provide equal employment opportunity and affirmative action. The Company and the Union will comply with Executive Order 11246 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1974, and will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, veteran status, or presence of a disability or handicap or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state or local law in connection with employment, demotion, upgrading, promotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; rate of pay or other forms of compensation; selection for training including apprenticeship; and layoff or termination.
Section 3a. Gender Neutral. Whenever the masculine gender is used in this agreement, it shall also refer to the female gender.
Section 4.	Check off of Union Membership Dues. The Company agrees to deduct uniform Union membership dues by class of membership from the wages of each employee who furnishes the Company with a written assignment and authorization to deduct such dues from his wages each month and to remit such membership dues to the Union. Such check-off of membership dues shall continue so long as the employee is continuously a member of the Bargaining Unit, on the payroll, and unless withdrawn in writing by the employee effective as of the first day of March of any year within the life of this contract, or successive contracts, upon the Company’s receipt of a written notice from the employee within a fifteen (15) day period immediately preceding the first day of March. The written notice from the employee shall be counter-signed by the Chief Steward and addressed to the Company with a copy to the AEMTC by registered mail. An employee, at any time, may change his authorization for membership dues deductions from one class of dues to another class of dues within the Union.
2
The dues assignment and authorization form shall read as follows:
TO: URS

affiliated with the Air Engineering Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO of Tullahoma, Tennessee, and an employee in the Bargaining Unit hereby cancel any and all authorizations heretofore given to you to deduct any Union Membership dues from my earnings. I hereby assign to the Air Engineering Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO, during the time that I am continuously an employee in the Bargaining Unit on the payroll of URS, such an amount as the Air Engineering Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO, certifies in writing to the Company to be the periodic membership dues of my local Union. I authorize you to deduct such amount in the amount of $from my wages monthly, and to remit the same on my account to the proper officials of, and designated by the Air Engineering Metal Trades Council, AFL-CIO. In addition to the foregoing, deduct $_for the
next pay periods for my initiation fee. This assignment and authorization may be cancelled
or revoked pursuant to the provisions of Article II of the contract between the Company and the Union.
Date:	Signed:
Section 5.	Company Recognition. The Union recognizes that the Company shall exercise the exclusive responsibility for the operation, maintenance and management of the work and areas which URS, its successors and assigns, under contract with the United States Air Force, is currently operating or may acquire during the duration of this contract, at the Arnold Engineering Development Complex. Such responsibility shall include the right to select, assign, and direct the working forces, determine job content, qualifications of employees to perform work, and the right to adopt and enforce reasonable rules and regulations for efficient operation, provided that the Union rights set forth in this contract, including the use of the grievance procedure and arbitration, shall not be abridged, curtailed, or modified by this clause.
Section 6.	Outsourcing Work. The Company may at times subcontract work, which in its opinion can be performed efficiently and economically by outside contractors who bid in a freely competitive environment. The Council will provide the Company with a list of craft union contacts that the Company may use when additional workers are required.
ARTICLE III
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 1.	Stewards and Grievance Committee. The Company agrees to recognize one Chief Steward for each affiliated Union of the AEMTC. An alternate will be appointed by each affiliated Union to cover the absence or unavailability of a Chief Steward. The Chief Stewards (or alternates) and the Chairperson of the Insurance/Pension Committee (or alternate) will be given time at regular rate of pay to handle Union business associated with grievances, issues related to this CBA, Company policies, on-site jurisdictional issues, and employee benefits. Chief Stewards will notify their supervisors as soon as possible prior to requiring release for Union business in order to help
3
minimize schedule and work interruptions. Chief Stewards, the President and Secretary of the Council, Grievance Committee, and Insurance/Pension Committee shall work the day shift Monday through Friday (except for the optional four (4) day work week schedule). During the period that an employee is holding the office as a Chief Steward for the Union or is holding the office of President or Secretary of the Council, he shall be placed at the top of the seniority list of employees within his seniority group. At the end of his term of office, he shall be returned in seniority to his proper place on the seniority list as determined by Article V of this contract. The Company will not be required to lay off ex-Union officers and recall more senior employees who were laid off while the ex-Union officer was at the top of the seniority list.
Council President and Recording Secretary shall not be transferred from their work area unless there is no work in their classification, which they can perform.
The Company also agrees to recognize a Union Grievance Committee who shall be selected by the Union. The Union Grievance Committee will function in the adjustment of grievances.
The Union shall notify the Company in writing of any changes in personnel of the Chief Stewards, President or Secretary of the Council, Insurance/Pension Committee, and Grievance Committee.
Section 2.	Discussion. Any employee having a complaint shall, with or without his Chief Steward, discuss the matter with the immediate Supervisor in the section where the alleged violation occurred. In the absence of the affected employee, the employee’s Chief Steward shall represent him concerning said complaint. If the complaint is not satisfactorily adjusted by the Supervisor, it may be considered a grievance and be referred to the grievance procedure. If there are multiple grievants in response to an action or event in which only one grievant could be given redress, the grievance will be consolidated for purposes of the grievance meeting at each step, unless one of the grievants works a shift other than the day shift. This Section will not be considered part of the grievance procedure.
Section 3.	Grievance Procedure. Any grievance arising under the terms of this contract or an alleged violation thereof shall be handled in the following manner:
Step 1. An employee or group of employees, having a grievance shall first take the matter up with the Chief Steward, who shall attempt to adjust the matter with the First Line Supervisor or his designated representative in the section where the alleged violation occurred. Unless settlement is reached within three (3) working days, the grievance may be carried to Step 2.
Step 2. If processed to this step, the issue will be reduced to writing on a form mutually agreeable to the Company and the Union and submitted by the Union to the Manager or his designated representative who will hold a hearing within five (5) working days after receipt of the form, with a Union committee consisting of the Chief Steward, one (1) employee, and one (1) member of the permanent grievance committee. If a Labor Relations representative is to be present at the hearing, the Union will be represented by a principal officer of the Council. An answer will be given in writing to the Union with a copy to the Chief Steward within five (5) working days after the hearing. Failing satisfactory adjustment, the matter will be referred to Step 3.
Step 3. If processed to this step, the written grievance will be referred to the Project Manager or designee for final hearing and possible settlement by the designated Company representative and 4
the Union grievance committee. Third step grievance will be held on a mutually agreeable date(s) each month, which is established in advance. An answer will be given in writing addressed to the Secretary of the Council with a copy to the Chief Steward within seven (7) working days after the hearing. If no agreement is reached, the matter may be referred to mediation in accordance with Article IV.
In order to expedite the procedure, grievances settled in the first step or second step of the grievance procedure will not be held as establishing precedent for future grievances.
It is understood that the provisions of the Labor-Management Relations Act shall be applicable to the above-described grievance procedure.
NOTE: After receiving payment from the trustees of the Retirement Plan, the retired person will have seven (7) days to grieve concerning error in payment with the Plan Administrator.
Section 4.	Time Limits. Any grievance not taken up with the immediate Supervisor in the area in which the alleged violation has occurred within seven (7) working days after the occurrence of the incident complained of cannot be processed through the grievance procedure. A grievance will be considered settled if the decision of the Company is not appealed to the next higher step in the above procedure within seven (7) working days after a decision has been rendered by the Company. All time limits noted in this Article are exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. Extensions may be made by mutual agreement.
On grievances involving monetary items, time limits do not begin until checks covering said alleged violations are received by the employees.
The Union’s failure to carry a grievance from one step to another or to arbitration shall be without prejudice to its right to process the same subject matter, although not the very same case, in another grievance.
In the event the Company does not answer a grievance within the time limits, the grievance may be processed to the next step in the procedure, to Mediation and/or arbitration, as the case may be.
In the event an employee is to be discharged for cause, the Company shall notify his Chief Steward immediately. If the Chief Steward does not agree, the Union may within five (5) working days file a grievance in the third-step of the grievance procedure.
The issue of timeliness of any grievance must be raised at the earliest possible time in the grievance procedure, but in no event later than the third-step hearing.
Section 5.	Pay for Grievance Time. Chief Stewards and other employees who are members of the Union Grievance Committee may assist in the settling of grievances under this Article without loss of pay, provided they arrange with their Supervisor to leave work for the purpose of handling a grievance.
5
Grievance hearings shall be scheduled during the grievants work shift. Members of the Union Grievance Committee will not receive pay for attending grievance hearings held at times other than during their work shift.
With proper approval of the Labor Relation Administrator, members of the grievance committee will be able to meet on the clock without loss of pay in order to assist in the settling of grievances.
ARTICLE IV
MEDIATION / ARBITRATION
Section 1. Mediation. If the grievance is not settled in Step 3 within seven (7) working days, the grievance shall at the insistence of either party, be submitted for mediation and conciliation. The parties shall mutually contact the FMCS requesting assistance in settling the grievance. The FMCS shall assign a Mediator to the case. The Mediator assigned shall not have the authority to alter, vary, or add to the terms of this Agreement. If settlement is not reached the grievance may be referred to arbitration according to this Article. Time limits set forth in this Article shall be considered mutually extended while utilizing mediation.
When either party receives the list of arbitrators, they shall contact the other party and inform them of such receipt. If an arbitrator is not selected within thirty (30) calendar days of such contact or a new list of arbitrators is not requested, the grievance will be considered withdrawn.
Section 2. Arbitration Procedure. Any controversy which has not been satisfactorily adjusted under the grievance procedure and which involves the discharge of an employee, or the interpretation or application of the provisions of this contract, or an alleged violation of the contract may be submitted for settlement to the arbitrator within fifteen (15) working days after the final action taken under the third step of the grievance procedure.
The arbitrator for each case will be chosen in the following manner: The parties agree to place all of the names of current active members of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) roster of arbitrators into a selection pool. The parties will alternately draw one (1) name from the pool until five (5) names have been drawn. The parties will then alternately strike names until one (1) name remains and the remaining name will act as arbitrator.
Each party shall bear its respective expenses, and the expenses incident to the services of the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union.
The arbitrator shall be requested by the Company and the Union to render a decision within thirty (30) calendar days after the arbitration hearing. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties. The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, to disregard, or to modify any of the terms of this contract.
ARTICLE V SENIORITY
Section 1.	Seniority. The seniority of an employee shall be determined by his employment date or transfer date into the Bargaining Unit, whichever is later. By the term “seniority group” is meant 6
one of the groups consisting of one or more Skill Sets listed in Exhibit A of this contract.
On and after December 22, 2003, the lowest last four digits of the SSN (Social Security Number) will determine the greater seniority for same date hires, rehires, or transfers. In the event there is a tie with the last four digits of the SSN, go to the lowest preceding number until the tie is broken.
When employees are transferred permanently from one seniority group to another, it shall be done by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union. Employees so transferred and who fail to qualify for the job to which they are assigned within a three (3)-months’ period may be returned to their previous seniority group without prejudice to their rights to later be transferred to the same or another job for which they may qualify.
The Company will provide the Council upon request, or at least semi-annually, summaries of the wage employees’ moves to fill openings through permanent promotions, permanent transfers, and employees hired into the Bargaining Unit.
Section 2.	Loss of Seniority. Seniority shall be lost by an employee under the following circumstances:
a.	When he is discharged by the Company.
b.	When he quits the service of the Company upon his own volition.
c.	When he does not properly report when recalled from layoff, as set forth in Section 8 of this Article.
d.	When he is not recalled during a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive months after being laid off.
e.	When a bargaining unit employee is promoted or transferred to a non-bargaining unit position as provided for in Section 5 of this Article.
f.	When a Bargaining Unit employee who is on a leave of absence as an officer or representative of a Union fails to return to work at the completion of his authorized leave of absence as provided for in Article VI.
Section 3.	Probationary Employees. A new, regular, full-time employee shall be considered a probationary employee for the first 120 days of employment in a single seniority group; and at the end of this period, if he is retained, his name shall be placed on the seniority list and his seniority shall start from the original date of hire.
A probationary employee shall be allowed to participate in all fringe benefits and use accrued vacation and sick leave after the first 60 days of employment.
The Union shall be notified in the event of discharge of a probationary employee.
The termination of employment of an employee during the probationary period shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Section 4.	Seniority List. The Company agrees to compile and furnish every four (4) months to
7
the Council copies of a seniority list showing the seniority of each employee in the Bargaining Unit. Employees shall have fifteen (15) days following the posting of the seniority list or following return from leave or vacation to raise objections as to the correctness of the list. The Union will provide the Company with a skill set document for URS employees within thirty (30) days of the ratification of the agreement. From that point forward, the Company will keep the skill set document updated and provide the Union a copy quarterly, if there are any changes.
Section 5.	Seniority Status Outside the Bargaining Unit. A Bargaining Unit employee who is promoted or transferred to a position outside the Bargaining Unit will continue to accumulate seniority for a period of thirty (30) days following the date of his promotion or transfer. Should the employee remain in a Non-Bargaining Unit position beyond the thirty (30) day period, he will lose all seniority accumulated under the contract.
Section 6.	Promotions. Promotions of employees within the Bargaining Unit shall be made on the basis of the necessary qualifications to perform the work and seniority. If qualifications to perform the work of the skill set are considered equal, the senior employee shall be given preference.
Should the Union disagree with the Company’s selection of the employee who is promoted under this section of the contract to the extent the matter is processed to arbitration, the burden of proof will rest with the Company. Any Bargaining Unit employee who is temporarily promoted out of the Bargaining Unit in the future shall have all rights under this contract.
Section 7.	Filling of Vacancies. In case there is no one in a seniority group qualified for promotion under Section 6 of this Article, the Company may fill vacancies in the following manner:
a.	Promote from within the Bargaining Unit.
b.	Hire from outside the Bargaining Unit.
A temporary promotion which does not involve all of the substantial aspects of the higher paying skill set, will not necessarily by itself satisfy the minimum qualification requirements of a regular full time assignment in the higher paying skill set. For purposes of full time promotion, candidates must still meet the minimum requirement of the regular full time job.
Section 8.	Layoffs. When decreasing the work force, probationary employees, apprentices, and interns shall be the first to be laid off from the affected skill set within the seniority group/skill sets within a job classification. When it becomes necessary to layoff employees in any seniority group/skill set, the employees with the least seniority shall be laid off first.
Leaderman and journeyman skill sets will be combined for layoff purposes only and the employees with the least seniority in the combined list shall be laid off first.
An employee scheduled to be laid off shall be given an opportunity to accept an assignment into one of the seniority group/skill sets to which he has previously been assigned and held seniority provided his seniority exceeds that of any employee in his previously assigned seniority group/skill set.
If a job opening later occurs in the employee’s seniority group from which he was laid off, he shall be recalled to said seniority group if his seniority exceeds that of other employees having recall rights to that seniority group/skill set. The Company will maintain a special list of individuals that
8
have held seniority in any previous job.
Section 9.	Recalling. The only individuals entitled to recall pursuant to this Article are individuals who have been hired by, employed with and then laid off from URS. Recalling shall be in reverse order of layoffs within a seniority group/skill set. The recalled employee shall return to the former classification and seniority group/skill set held at the time of layoff.
Employees being recalled shall be notified by telephone and e-mail if provided. If telephone or e-mail contact cannot be made, the employee shall be notified by certified mail, mailed to the last address on record in the Company’s files. The AEMTC President and/or Recording Secretary will be regularly advised of the notification status. If the Company does not receive a reply from the employee to said letter within six (6) days from the date of its delivery, as verified via electronic Postal Service records in which the employee agrees to report for work within two (2) calendar weeks after he has received said notification, or if the Post Office returns said letter to the Company because the addressee has moved, or the employee does not report for work on the date he agreed to report as provided in this section, the employee will be considered to have forfeited all recall rights, unless these time limits are extended by the Company. In case of an emergency the Company may temporarily fill any vacancy. Laid off employees who are offered jobs of less than forty-five (45) calendar days’ duration by the Company will not lose their seniority if they do not accept the offer. Qualified employees may be hired while laid off employees are being recalled.
Section 10.	Seniority During Absences. Employees will continue to accumulate seniority when absent due to occupational illness or occupational accident. Employees will continue to accumulate seniority when absent due to personal illness for a continuous period of twenty-four (24) months. Seniority will also be accumulated during leaves of absence granted in accordance with Articles VI and XV of this contract, and for approved leaves of absence for other personal reasons not in excess of thirty (30) days.
Section 11.	Job Posting. In the event of a new job, or a vacancy to be filled, the Company shall internally advertise via email and memo to the Council, a description of the job or vacancy, and rate of pay.
Interested URS wage employees shall submit an electronic resume and complete the electronic job bid forms on the Company portal for employees to include their name and employee number. Consideration will be given any permanent employee who bids on the new job or vacancy within a period of seven (7) working days from the date of the initial posting. Employees will not be allowed to bid laterally, except as provided in Article II, Section 3. Other Council wage employees (non-URS) interested in a position will submit an application on the URS career website.
A new job is defined as an additional permanent position within the Bargaining Unit. A vacancy is defined as a vacated position.
Requirements stated on the job posting will accurately reflect duties of the job to be filled and will be within the scope of the job description.
Employees temporarily absent or in layoff status may arrange with their Chief Steward to file a job bid form in their behalf.
9
Filling of vacancies caused by vacations, disabilities, and leaves of absence shall not be subject to the posting procedure.
Section 12.	Schedule and Shift Preference. The Company shall have the authority to establish a work schedule and maintain operational capability. Any other application of the work schedule in this agreement shall mean shift for the purpose of shift preference and vacation bidding.
a.	On November 1st through November 30th of every year the Company will post shift bid sheets indicating the shifts and rest days available for assignment. A seniority list will be posted with the bid sheets. Assignments to shifts will be in order of seniority preference within each skill set. Skill sets will be grouped as follows:
1)	Fire Communications Operator
2)	Firefighter and EMT/Firefighter
3)	Paramedic/Firefighter
4)	Driver/Operator
5)	Crew Chief and Paramedic/Crew Chief
6)	Fire Prevention Officer and Fire Prevention Lead
b.	Bids shall take effect on the 1st day of the 1st full week of the following January.
c.	Bid Vacation. On December 1st through December 31st of every year, the Company will post bid sheets in which every employee will bid days for vacation. These days will be bid by seniority on each shift, providing Bid Vacation does not violate minimum manning requirements as set forth at the time of the bid. A seniority list will be posted with the bid sheets. Vacations will be awarded in order of seniority preference.
The Company will give preference as to the dates in accordance with employee seniority and the operational requirements of the Company. Any requested vacation must be approved by the Company before it is to start.
ARTICLE VI UNION REPRESENTATION LEAVE

13
Section 9. Lost Time. The Company will use one-tenth (1/10) of an hour (6 minutes) as a unit in computing tardiness. If an employee clocks “in” from one (1) to six (6) minutes late, the employee will lose one-tenth (1/10) of an hour (6 minutes). For tardiness beyond six (6) minutes, the regular procedure of computing time in multiples of six (6) minute intervals will apply. Employees leaving the job early will be considered tardy on the same basis as if they reported to work late. Employees shall not be required or permitted to work during the period used in computing tardiness. The foregoing shall not be considered as a limitation on the right of the Company to take disciplinary action for repeated or unexcused tardiness.
Section 10.	Exchange of Jobs. When an employee is assigned to a higher paid job he will receive the higher rate for the time he is on the job.
Section 11.	Overtime.

b.	Offsetting Overtime. An employee shall not be required to take time off from his regularly scheduled normal workweek in order to offset overtime.
c.	Assigning and Posting Overtime. Opportunities for overtime work assignment shall be divided as equally as reasonably practical among qualified employees who regularly perform the work during non-overtime hours.
The Company and the Union will review all overtime distribution lists the first week of April and July of the contract year for the purpose of reducing problems of the overtime list. A new employee, at the end of his probationary period, will be charged with the same amount of overtime hours as the highest man within his skill set, on his overtime list.
If an employee is offered overtime and refuses, for any reason, he will be charged on the overtime list for the hours refused.
If it is necessary, after first offering the overtime to all the employees on the overtime record, to direct the low employee on the overtime record to work; he will be charged for the hours refused in addition to the hours that he is directed to work.
An employee who is absent because of illness or a disability will not be offered overtime and will be removed from the applicable overtime list. Upon returning to work from such illness or disability he will be replaced on the overtime list in the relative position to the high man (the same differential of hours) as he held prior to becoming ill or disabled. An employee who incurs a limitation because of an illness or disability which prohibits overtime assignments will not be offered overtime and will be removed from the overtime list during such restriction. When able to work overtime, he will be replaced on the overtime list in the relative position to the high man (the same differential of hours) as he held prior to becoming ill or disabled. An employee whose restriction does not prohibit
14
overtime assignments will be offered overtime. The determination as to whether an employee with a restriction can or cannot accomplish a particular overtime assignment shall be made by the Supervisor.
An employee who is instructed by his Supervisor to work unscheduled overtime after the end of his shift will be offered a minimum of one (1) hour. If the work is completed in less than one (1) hour, the employee may elect to clock out and be paid for time worked.
Overtime hours, before they are posted on the overtime record, will be translated into the equivalent straight-time hours to the nearest one-tenth (1/10) hour, i. e., one (1) hour paid at double time will be posted as two (2) hours. Hours worked on holidays are not overtime and will not be posted as such on the overtime list. All hours worked on holidays shall be offered on the basis of seniority within an overtime list.
Employees who have scheduled four (4) or more hours of vacation will not be asked to perform overtime work during this period. Employees who have scheduled at least four (4) hours vacation at the end of a shift will not be offered overtime until he properly reports for the next scheduled work shift. An employee who has scheduled at least four (4) hours of vacation at the beginning of a shift will not be offered overtime from the end of his last scheduled work-shift prior to the scheduled vacation until he properly reports for his next scheduled work-shift.
However, if the employee has scheduled vacation, he may elect to be available for overtime and notify his Supervisor of such at the time of his scheduling of vacation. If the employee subsequently refuses such offered overtime, he will be charged according to this section.
d.	Time and One-Half. Overtime at the rate of one and one-half (P/z) times the regular rate of pay shall be paid as follows:
1)	For hours worked in excess of forty (40) in the established workweek,
2)	For the 9th, 1 Oth, 11th, and 12th hours worked in the workday, or
3)	For the first eight (8) hours worked on Saturday or for the first eight (8) hours worked on the employee’s first rest day in the established workweek.
Fire Department employees on a 24-hour work schedule will be paid their regular straight time rate for the eight (8) hours of active duty and one and one-half (1A) times the regular rate for the eight (8) hour period when the employees are on stand-by duty. If an employee on a 24-hour work schedule does not receive at least five (5) uninterrupted hours of rest during the eight (8) rest period as a result of an assigned response, the entire rest period will be paid at one and one-half (1 A) times the regular rate for those assigned to work. Anyone not receiving five (5) hours of uninterrupted rest that is unassigned to work will receive one (1) hour of pay at time and one-half (1 A). The employee will continue to be available during the period for which he is compensated under this paragraph.
For work performed during a scheduled 24-hour period off, Fire Department employees will be paid one and one-half (1 A) times their rate of pay for the eight (8) hours of active duty
15
and one and one-half (1V2) times their regular rate for the eight (8) hours of stand-by duty. The eight (8) hour rest period will be unpaid. The 24-hour work schedule discussed in this section will not apply Fire Communications Operators or Fire Inspectors.

3.	This agreement is subject to the provisions of any implementing Regulations of the Drug-Free Work Place Act of 1988 which may affect the terms or provisions therein.
ARTICLE XIII PROTECTIVE SECURITY
Section 1.	Protective Security. The Union and the Company agree that they will do their utmost to protect the security of classified information and will not reveal such information to any person not specifically cleared for such information by the United States Government. No person will be cleared for such information except where the information is necessary for performance of work desired by the United States Government. It is recognized that the Company has agreed not to employ any person designated by the United States Government whose employment is considered prejudicial to the government and to remove from the work and exclude from the Arnold Engineering Development Complex any person whose continued employment is deemed by the United States Government to be prejudicial to the United States Government.

Section 2.	Proprietary Information. The Union and the Company agree that they will do their utmost to protect proprietary information.
ARTICLE XIV JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES
Section 1.	Job Assignments. The Company will assign employees to duties in accordance with Article XIV, Section 3.
24
Section 2.	Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes. Determination of jurisdictional boundaries is the responsibility of the Local Unions of the Council which have been duly designated to represent employees. Therefore, when work boundaries between crafts have been clearly established by:
a.	Custom, practice, and tradition,
b.	Agreements between national or international unions, or agreements between crafts within an international union, or
c.	Decisions or awards rendered by appropriate bodies,
d.	The employees represented by each such union shall perform the work as determined by these boundaries. Appropriate bodies as referred to in this Article are defined as those which the disputing unions by agreement or through participation in such bodies recognize as having the authority to make such awards and decision.
In the absence of established work boundaries, the Company shall assign the work in accordance with custom and practice in the vicinity. In the absence of custom and practice in the vicinity, the Company shall assign the work to those employees who in its judgment are best qualified to perform the work, with due regard to practices of employers outside the vicinity which the disputing Unions present.
If, after work has been assigned on this basis, the Unions reach agreement or if an appropriate body renders a decision on the award which conflicts with the Company’s assignment of work, the Company agrees to alter its assignment to conform to such an agreement or award as soon as possible and in any case within fifteen (15) working days, except when the period is extended by agreement between the Company and officers of the Council.
A grievance relating to jurisdictional disputes and/or mis-assignment(s) of work shall not be placed into the grievance procedure, Article III of the Agreement, including the discussion stage. Should the Chief Stewards not reach agreement resolving a disputed assignment of work, the moving Union shall refer the dispute to the AEMTC’s internal mechanism and/or Metal Trades Department Jurisdictional policy. Should the individual Chief Steward(s) agree on a resolution to the dispute the council shall notify the Company of the jurisdictional agreement(s).
The Council shall notify the Company of jurisdictional agreements or disagreements, which affect the assignment of work by the Company.
Section 3.	Union-Employer Cooperation in Craft Jurisdiction and Work Practices
Section 3a. Work Assignment Guidelines. In order to improve operational efficiencies, the AEMTC and its affiliated unions agree to perform limited cross-craft work assignments, as defined in this Article, to accomplish all the work covered by this agreement. The Company and the Union agree that a fully motivated, efficient work force is essential to achieving the mutual objectives of continuing to be the best aerospace test center in the world.
25
The Company recognizes the benefits of traditional craft jurisdictions in a highly sophisticated and technologically advanced environment. The Company has invested substantial time and money in equipment and training of its employees in developing and fostering valuable craft skills. However, the realities of reduced workloads and low times of testing necessitate a change to this historical approach. The Company is not looking for total interchangeability. Further, cross-craft assignments shall not be used for the purpose of depopulating affiliates of the AEMTC. The Company has the responsibility to improve its methods, processes, scheduling, planning, and training within the occupational titles. All facilities, tools, and equipment should be adequately maintained for craft manpower to be more productive and efficient. The Company may assign work cross-craft to employee(s) who have the skill, ability, and experience to perform the work safely. The Company shall not place the employee(s) or others at risk of personal injury because of these cross-craft assignments.
Cross crafting will not exceed sixty (60) hours per month, and the employees will be promoted to the cross-crafted skill set at the same tier percentage as their current position.
Each employee has the responsibility and authority to stop work if they have reason to believe an assignment puts the employee(s) at excessive or unnecessary risk. All work assignment guidelines apply uniformly during regular and overtime hours.
Section 3b. Work Assignment Pay. The AEDC Fire Department group will receive ninety ($.90) cents per hour Work Assignment Pay in addition to their regular rate of pay. This pay is provided in order to gain operational efficiencies through cross-craft work assignments. The Work Assignment Pay will not be paid for Jury Duty, Funeral Pay, Sick Leave, or Holiday Pay. This additional pay shall not be considered part of the employees’ straight time rate. Employees will no longer receive temporary promotion pay. Promotions, which are considered permanent, will be paid at the higher rate. The skill sets within Exhibit A will apply.
The Company agrees to provide the above monetary consideration for members of the bargaining unit in order to gain operational efficiencies through cross-craft work assignments. Each employee’s initial qualifications will be reviewed and agreed upon by the Company and the Union.
NOTE: Fire and Rescue staffing levels will be according to AEDC/AF requirements.
Section 3c. New Work. It is hereby agreed between URS and the AEMTC and its affiliated unions that all work now being performed will continue to be assigned to the craft or classification of employee now performing the work.
New equipment or new work will be assigned to the craft or classification of employee performing similar work. It is further agreed that the Company will not change any work assignments except when two or more unions reach an agreement and the AEMTC notifies the Company that an agreement has been reached and that the work should be reassigned in accordance with said agreement.
26
ARTICLE XV SICK LEAVE AND DISABILITY
Section 1.	Sick Leave.
a.	All employees will utilize Sick Leave which consists of an initial balance of 40 hours credited to a new hire's account and accumulates a balance of 3.3 hours per month up to a 96-hour maximum (accruals will stop for employees on disability leave after twelve (12) months or when leave balances are exhausted, whichever occurs first). All hours accumulated above the 96-hour maximum will be forfeited. Employees absent more than three (3) consecutive workdays must consult a licensed physician and obtain a release from the physician to return to work.
b.	The Company and the Union agree to work together to curtail any and all potential and/or proven abuse of Sick Leave as stated within the confines of this agreement. The employee may request to use the alternative work schedule to reduce the use of Sick Leave for the purpose of a medical visit. This request must be initiated by the employee and must have the approval of the Chief Steward and management. The Company and the Union agree that this will not be used to abuse the alternate work schedule. The employee must report the absence and cause of the absence to his immediate supervisor or an alternate representative designated by the Company as soon as possible but no later than two (2) hours after the beginning of his work shift, except for causes beyond his control.
c.	Employees on the twenty-four (24)-hour work schedule will be paid for twenty (20) hours and charged for sixteen (16) hours per tour of duty.
d.	When an employee retires or is terminated, all unused hours of Sick Leave shall be used to increase the years of participation in accordance with the legacy Pension Plan.
Section 2.	Disability Leave. Employees on disability are placed in leave status. The employee satisfies the elimination period using accrued vacation/sick leave or may use unpaid leave. Once the disability benefit begins, employees may decide to either remain in a full pay status or not (at their option) to supplement their pay (receive a “whole” paycheck). For example, if the benefit pays 66-2/3 pay per week, employees can supplement 1/3 pay per week (approximately 13.30 hours per week) with vacation/sick leave to have a 100% paycheck.
Employees will be terminated after two (2) years on disability leave from the date of disability (first day employee is off work). If employee receives a negotiated settlement from the disability carrier, termination will be effective as of the date of settlement.
NOTE: Employees that return to work for more than ninety (90) consecutive days, are re-injured and placed back on disability, on day ninety-one (91) restarts the two (2)-year termination provision stated above.
Employees continue to accrue vacation and sick leave up to twelve (12) consecutive months or until either leave is exhausted, whichever comes first. All benefits (holidays, funeral leave, and any other form of remuneration), including vacation/sick accruals, will stop after twelve (12) consecutive months.
27
Employees will continue to accrue seniority in accordance with Article V, Seniority.
The Company will continue to pay the same percentage of the premium cost as the current health plan employer contribution for employees on disability leave. The employee will pay the same percentage of the premium cost as the current health plan employee contribution.
Aon Hewitt will direct bill employees for most Company benefit plans, such as optional life insurances, long term disability, accidental death & dismemberment, etc.
Section 3.	Occupational Injuries.
a.	The amount paid to an employee on disability of an approved work-related illness/injury will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount received under Workers’ Compensation. An employee absent due to occupational illness or injury may supplement pay with accrued leave, as necessary, to receive full pay.
b.	The employee reports work injuries to supervision no later than the day the incident occurs. The injury is compensable under the State Worker’s Compensation law, the employee utilizes a Company-approved physician, and the employee cooperates fully in obtaining medical treatment.
ARTICLE XVI
GROUP INSURANCE
Section 1.	Wage Employee Premium Reduction. The Company will reduce the employees’ portion of the medical insurance premium cost as indicated in the following table for the term of this agreement.

If the insurance premiums increase more than the 4.5% in CY2017, the employee will be responsible for payment of one-hundred percent (100%) of the premiums above the 4.5% cap.
The Tri-Care supplement premiums will be paid by the employee unless there is a change in the law governing the allowance of the Company to pay such premium. In that case, the language would revert back to the 2005-2010 language allowing the Company to pay the Tri-Care Supplement.
Section 2.	Life Insurance. The terms and conditions of life insurance coverage’s are governed by the contract between the Company’s and their life insurance carrier. URS will provide Company paid life insurance benefit to all employees equivalent to 1.5 times their annual base wages in basic life insurance coverage. The Company may offer at no cost to employees other benefits (i.e AD&D, STD). The Company reserves the right to amend this optional offering at its discretion. Other ancillary benefits will be offered during open enrollment, for election by employees.
The Company has an optional employee paid voluntary life insurance plan that allows employees to purchase supplemental life insurance for themselves, supplemental life insurance for their spouse and/or child(ren) at the employees cost subject to the terms and conditions of the plan, evidence of insurability and applicable regulations and/or laws.
