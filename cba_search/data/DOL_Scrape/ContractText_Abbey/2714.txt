3.1	Policy. The job performance of each employee, whose term of appointment is one (1) semester or longer, shall be evaluated in writing once during each such appointment. The employment evaluation shall include evaluation of assigned duties and such other responsibilities as are appropriate to the assignment. Personnel decisions shall take such employment evaluations into account, provided that personnel decision need not be based solely on written employment performance evaluations.

A reasonable schedule shall be given to accomplish the necessary improvements. Such evaluation shall be placed in the employee’s evaluation file. The employment evaluation shall be signed by the person who performed the evaluation and shall be shown to the employee, who shall be given the opportunity to sign it. A copy of the employment evaluation shall be given to the employee. The employee may attach a concise comment to the evaluation. Written student comments or evaluations need not be signed to be used for evaluation purposes.
3.3	Observations and Visitations. Observations or visitations for the purpose of evaluating employee performance may be either announced or unannounced.
(a)	Within two (2) weeks after an observation or visitation, the employee shall have an opportunity to meet and discuss the observation or visitation with the observer.

A copy of such comment shall be given to the employee no later than two (2) weeks following the observation, if practicable. Such comment shall not be grievable; however, the employee shall have the right to respond in writing and shall have such response attached. The employee shall have the right, to be exercised within three (3) working days after the meeting with the observer, to request in writing an additional observation or visitation by a different observer. Such additional observation or visitation shall be accomplished prior to the end of the semester, and shall be placed in the evaluation file. The employee shall have the right to respond to this observation also and have the response attached.

Article 4
EMPLOYEE EVALUATION FILE
4.1	Policy. There shall be only one (1) employee evaluation file in which all written materials used to evaluate employee performance are maintained so that when evaluations and personnel decisions are made, the only documents which may be used are those contained in that file. A copy of the employee’s performance evaluation shall be given to the employee in accordance with Section 3.2. Employees shall be notified, upon request, of the location of the employee evaluation file and the identity of the custodian. A notice specifying the location of the official evaluation file shall be posted in each department or comparable unit.
4.2	Access. An employee may examine the employee evaluation file upon reasonable advance notice, during the regular business hours of the office in which the file is kept, normally within the same business day as the employee requests to see it and under such conditions as are necessary to insure its integrity and safekeeping. Upon request, an employee may paginate with successive whole numbers the materials in the file, and may attach a concise statement in response to any item therein. Upon request and the payment of a reasonable fee for photocopying, an employee may obtain copies of any materials in the evaluation file. A person designated by the employee may examine that employee’s evaluation file with the written authorization of the employee concerned and subject to the same limitations on access that are applicable to the employee.
4.3	Indemnification. UFF agrees to indemnify and hold UBOT and the University, and their officials, agents, and representatives harmless from and against any and all liability for any improper, illegal, or unauthorized use by UFF of information contained in such employee evaluation file.

4.5	Anonymous Material. No anonymous material shall be placed in an employee evaluation file, except for student evaluations which are part of a regular evaluation procedure of classroom instruction.
4.6	Materials in Evaluation File. Evaluative materials or summaries thereof, prepared as part of a regular employee evaluation system, may be placed in an employee evaluation file when signed.
4.7	Removal of Contents. Materials shown to be contrary to fact shall be removed from the file. This section shall not authorize the removal of materials from the employee evaluation file when there is a dispute concerning a matter of judgment or opinion rather than fact. Materials may also be removed pursuant to the resolution of a grievance.
Article 5
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
It is the policy of the UBOT and UFF to encourage graduate assistants, in fulfillment of their assigned teaching responsibilities, to give their own interpretation of instructional materials used by them— whether self-chosen or prescribed by the teaching unit—within the bounds of knowledge and methodologies appropriate to the disciplinary field, under the guidance of the employing department or

Article 9
COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS
9.1	Disclosure. An employee shall disclose all patentable inventions and technological developments which the employee may develop or discover while an employee of the University. With respect to discoveries or inventions made during the course of approved outside employment, the employee may delay such disclosure for no more than one hundred and eighty (180) days, when necessary to protect the outside employer's interests, until the decision has been made whether to seek a patent.
9.2	Waiver of Rights. While an employee may, in accordance with Article 7, Outside Activity/Conflict of interest, engage in outside employment pursuant to a consulting agreement, the Office of Academic Affairs and the Office of Research and Graduate Programs, must approve any requirement by the outside employer that the employee waive the employee's/university's rights to any patentable invention or discoveries which arise during the course of such outside employment. An employee who proposes to engage in outside employment shall furnish a copy of the University's patents policy to the outside employer prior to or at the time the consulting agreement is executed.
9.3	Federal Sponsorship. If the employee's activities involve inventions or discoveries conceived under Federal sponsorship or supported by University funds or resources, then the Office of Academic Affairs and the Office of Research and Graduate Programs shall not grant permission to waive patent rights.
9.4	Reporting Procedures. The employee shall report to the President or designee the nature of the discovery or new invention, together with an outline of the project and the conditions under which it was done. If the University wishes to assert its interest in the patent, the President or designee shall inform the employee within a maximum of one hundred and thirty-five (135) days. It is understood that every effort shall be made at appropriate administrative levels to expedite the decision-making process to minimize the time involved. The division of proceeds between the University and the employee generated by the licensing of patent rights or trade secrets shall be negotiated and reflected in a written contract between the University and the employee. All such agreements shall comport with and satisfy any preexisting commitments to outside sponsoring agencies, but the employee shall not commit any act which would tend to defeat the University's interest in the matter, and the University shall take any necessary steps to protect such interest.

Article 10
LEAVES OF ABSENCE
10.1	An employee shall not be required to perform assigned duties when:
(a)	disabled or otherwise unable to perform them because of injury, illness, jury duty, required U.S. military service, or when unable to so perform because the employee's presence is required elsewhere because of injury, illness, or death in the immediate family. Immediate family shall consist of mother, father, spouse, sister, brother, child, a person in a legal dependent relationship with the employee, or other relative living in the employee's household. The employee shall notify the supervisor of the inability to serve as soon as possible.
(b)	The university is closed for a state holiday or a declared emergency, unless the special conditions of the appointment require the employee to perform duties at these times. These days shall not be held against the employee with regard to permitted days of leave pursuant to Section 10.2.
(c)	Taking examinations for professional licensing related to the degree or qualifying examinations are required by the university. These days shall not be held against the employee with regard to permitted days of leave pursuant to Section 10.2.

10.2	Personal time under this Article shall be with pay for up to five (5) days per semester appointment. Each employee shall be credited with such five (5) days at the beginning of each semester and shall use leave in increments of not less than one (1) day.

Article 11
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND ARBITRATION
11.1	Purpose. The UBOT and the UFF-GAU agree that all problems should be resolved, whenever possible, before the filing of a grievance and they encourage open communication between administrators and employees so that resort to the formal grievance procedure will not be necessary. The UBOT and the UFF-GAU further encourage the informal resolution of grievances. At each step in the grievance process, participants are encouraged to pursue appropriate modes of conflict resolution. The purpose of this Article is to promote a prompt and efficient procedure for the investigation and resolution of grievances. The procedures hereinafter set forth shall be the sole and exclusive method of resolving the grievances of employees.
11.2	Resort to Other Procedures. If prior to seeking resolution of a dispute by filing a grievance hereunder, or while the grievance proceeding is in progress, an employee or UFF seeks resolution of the matter in any other forum, whether administrative or judicial, the employer shall have no obligation to entertain or proceed further with the matter pursuant to this grievance procedure and the grievance shall be decreed withdrawn. Further, since the parties do not intend that this grievance procedure be a device for appellate review, the President's response to a recommendation of a hearing officer or other individual or group having appropriate jurisdiction in any other procedure shall not be an act or omission giving rise to a grievance under this procedure.
11.3	Definitions. As used herein:
(a)	The term "grievance" shall mean a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of a specific term or provision of this Agreement, filed pursuant to this Article, and subject to those exclusions appearing in other Articles of this Agreement.
(b)	The term "grievant" shall mean an employee or group of employees who has filed a grievance in a dispute over a provision of this Agreement which confers rights upon them, or UFF which has filed a grievance in a dispute over a provision of this Agreement that confers rights upon UFF. A grievance filed by UFF which alleges a violation of its rights by two (2) or more colleges, or a grievance filed by employees in two (2) or more colleges, shall be initiated at Step 1.
11.4	Representation. UFF shall have the exclusive right to represent any employee in grievances filed hereunder, provided employees may represent themselves or be represented by legal counsel. If an employee elects not to be represented by UFF, the UBOT shall promptly inform UFF in writing of the grievance. No resolution of any individually processed grievance shall be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement and for this purpose UFF shall have the right to have an observer present at all meetings called between grievants and the University for the purpose of discussing grievances and shall be sent copies of all decisions at the same time they are sent to the other participants.
11.5	Grievance Representatives. UFF shall furnish annually to the UBOT and the University a list of all persons authorized to act as grievance representatives and shall update the list as needed. The UFF grievance representative shall have the responsibility to meet all instructional, research, and other duties and responsibilities incidental to the assigned workload. Some of these activities are scheduled to be performed at particular times. Such representative shall have the right, during times outside of the hours scheduled for these activities, to investigate, consult, and prepare grievance presentations and attend grievance meetings. Should any hearings or meetings with the President, the UBOT, or their representatives necessitate rescheduling of assigned duties, the representative may, with the approval of
http://www.ufgau.org/NewPageBeta2/Document%20Dump/2005contract.htm
05/08/2006
Agreement
Page 17 of 48
the appropriate administrator, arrange for the rescheduling of such duties or their coverage by colleagues. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.
11.6	Appearances.
(a)	When an employee participates during working hours in arbitration proceedings or in a grievance meeting between the grievant or representative and the President or UBOT or either of their representatives, that employee's compensation shall neither be reduced nor increased for time spent in those activities.
(b)	Prior to participation in any such proceedings, conferences, or meetings, the employee shall make arrangements acceptable to the appropriate supervisor for the performance of the employee's duties. Approval of such arrangements shall not be unreasonably withheld. Time spent in such activities outside regular working hours shall not be counted as time worked.
11.7	Grievance Forms. All written grievances, requests for review, and arbitration notices must be submitted in writing on forms attached to this Agreement as Appendices C, D, E, and F respectively, and shall be signed by the grievant. Except for the initial filing of the grievance, if there is difficulty in meeting any time limit, the UFF representative may sign such documents for the grievant. The UBOT, or its representatives, including those University representatives responsible for reviewing grievances at Step 1 or Step 2, may refuse consideration of a grievance not filed in accordance with this Article.
FORMAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
11.8	Filing. The filing of a written grievance shall constitute a waiver of any rights the grievant may have under Chapter 120, Florida Statutes, or under any other University procedures with regard to the matters contained in the grievance. A grievance may be withdrawn at any time by the grievant or by the UFF representative.
11.9	Oral Step.
(a)	An employee having a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of a specific term or provision of this Agreement may, within ten (10) days following the act or omission giving rise thereto, or the date on which the employee knew or reasonably should have known of such act or omission, whichever is later, file a grievance by presenting the grievance orally to the employee's faculty supervisor. At the time the grievance is filed, the grievant shall identify it as such.
(b)	The faculty supervisor, and the college dean, if appropriate, shall discuss the grievance with the grievant and/or the grievant's representative, if any, and shall issue a decision within ten (10) days following the date the grievance is filed at the Oral Step.
11.10	Stepl.
(a)	If a grievance is not satisfactorily resolved at the Oral Step, the grievant may file a
written grievance, on the form contained in Appendix C, with the graduate dean or designee within ten (10) days after the receipt of the decision at the Oral Step.
(b)	In advance of the Step 1 meeting, the grievant shall have the right, upon request, to a copy of any identifiable and currently existing documents relevant to the grievance.
(c)	At the Step 1 meeting, the grievant shall have the right to present any evidence in support of the grievance. The graduate dean shall meet with the grievant and/or the grievant's representative no later than ten (10) days following the filing of the grievance at Step 1 and shall issue a written decision to the grievant and the grievant's representative, if any, within ten (10) days following the meeting.
11.11	Step 2.

(b)	The President, or his/her representative, shall meet with the UFF grievance representative within ten (10) days after receipt of the request at Step 2 and shall issue a written decision to the grievant and the grievant's representative, if any, within ten (10) days following the meeting.
11.12	Step 3.
(a)	If the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved at Step 2, the grievant may, on the form contained in Appendix E, file a request for review with the Chancellor or representative within ten (10) days following the receipt of the Step 2 decision.

(b)	The Chancellor or representative shall schedule a meeting with the UFF grievance representative within fifteen (15) days after the filing of the grievance at Step 3 and shall issue a written decision to the grievant and the grievant's representative, if any, within twenty-five (25) days following the meeting.
11.13	Step 4.
If the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved at Step 3, UFF may, upon the request of the grievant, proceed to arbitration by filing a written notice of intent to do so on a form contained in Appendix F. Notice of intent to proceed to arbitration must be filed with the Chancellor or representative within twenty-five (25) days after receipt of the Step 3 decision and shall be signed by the grievant and the UFF President or representative.
11.14	Selection of Arbitrator. Representatives of the UBOT and UFF shall meet within ninety (90) days after the execution of this Agreement for the purpose of selecting a fifteen-member Arbitration Panel. Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of a Notice of Arbitration, representatives of the UBOT and UFF shall meet for the purpose of selecting an arbitrator from the Panel. Selection shall be by mutual agreement or by alternately striking names from the Arbitration Panel list until one (1) name remains. The winner of a coin toss shall be the first to strike a name from the list. If the parties are unable to agree on a panel of arbitrators, they shall follow the normal American Arbitration Association procedure for the selection of an arbitrator.

(c)	If the arbitrator determines that the Agreement has been violated, the arbitrator shall direct the University to take appropriate action. An arbitrator may award back pay if the arbitrator determines that the employee is not receiving the appropriate compensation from the University, but the arbitrator may not award other monetary damages or penalties.
(d)	If notice that further employment will not be offered is not given on time, the arbitrator
may direct the University to renew the appointment only upon a finding that no other remedy is adequate, and that the notice was given so late that (1) the employee was deprived of reasonable opportunity to seek other employment, or (2) the employee actually rejected an offer of comparable employment that the employee otherwise would have accepted.
11.16	Burden of Proof. In all grievances except disciplinary grievances, the burden of proof shall be on the employee. In disciplinary grievances, the burden of proof shall be on the UBOT.
11.17	Arbitrability. In any proceeding, the first matter to be decided is the arbitrator's jurisdiction to act, which decision the arbitrator shall announce. Upon concluding that the arbitrator has no such power, the arbitrator shall make no decision or recommendation as to the merits of the grievance. Upon concluding that the issue is arbitrable, the arbitrator shall normally proceed with the hearing at that time, provided that either party may seek judicial review of the arbitrator's decision as to jurisdiction and have the hearing on the merits of the grievance delayed until such review is completed, pursuant to Section 682.03, Florida Statutes.
11.18	Conduct of Hearing.
(a)	The arbitrator shall hold the hearing in the city where the grievant is employed, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The hearing shall commence within twenty-five (25) days of the arbitrator's acceptance of selection or as soon thereafter as is practicable, and the arbitrator shall issue the decision within sixty (60) days of the close of the hearing or the submission of briefs, whichever is later, unless additional time is agreed to by the parties.
(b)	The decision shall be in writing and shall set forth findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted. Except as expressly specified in this Article, the provisions of the Florida Arbitration Code, Chapter 682, Florida Statutes, shall not apply. Except as modified by the provisions of this Agreement or by other agreement of the parties, arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association.
11.19	Effect of Decision. The decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the UBOT, UFF, and the grievant, provided that either party may appeal to an appropriate court of law a decision that was rendered by the arbitrator acting outside of or beyond the arbitrator's jurisdiction, pursuant to Section 682.0, Florida Statutes.
11.20	Fees and Expenses. All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the parties. Each party shall bear the cost of preparing and presenting its own case. The party desiring a transcript of the arbitration proceedings shall provide written notice to the other party of its intention to have a transcript of the arbitration made at least one (1) week prior to the date of the arbitration. The party desiring such transcript shall be responsible for scheduling a stenotype reporter to record the proceedings. The parties shall share equally the appearance fee of the stenotype reporter and the cost of obtaining an original transcript and one (1) copy for the party originally requesting a transcript of the proceedings. The requesting party shall, at its expense, photocopy the copy of the transcript received

11.21	Time Limits. All time limits contained in this Article may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, except that the time limits for the initial filing of a grievance may be extended only by agreement between the UBOT and UFF or their representatives. Upon failure of the UBOT or the University to provide a decision within the time limits provided in this Article, the grievant or UFF, where appropriate, may appeal to the next step. Upon the failure of the grievant or UFF, where appropriate, to file an appeal within the time limits provided in this Article, the grievance shall be deemed to have been resolved by the decision at the prior step.
11.22	Notification. All grievances, requests for review, notices, and decisions shall be transmitted in person or by certified or registered mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested. In the event of a question as to the timeliness of any grievance, request for review, notice, or decision, the date of receipt shall be determinative. In the event that any action falls due on a day when the University or the UBOT (as appropriate) is closed for normal business, the action will be considered timely if it is accomplished by 5:00 p.m. on the following business day.
11.23	Precedent.
(a)	No complaint informally resolved or grievance resolved prior to arbitration shall constitute a precedent for any purpose unless agreed to in writing by the UBOT and UFF acting through its president or representative.
(b)	The interpretation of a provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a precedent for interpretation of the same or similar provisions in other collective bargaining agreements operative in the State University System.
11.24	Retroactivity. An arbitrator's award may or may not be retroactive as the equities of each case may demand, but in no case shall an award be retroactive to a date earlier than thirty-five (35) days prior to the date the grievance was initially filed in accordance with this Article or the date on which the act or omission occurred, whichever is later.
11.25	Processing. The filing or pendency of any grievance, or of arbitration proceedings, under this Article shall not operate to impede, preclude, or delay the UBOT or University from taking the action complained of. Reasonable efforts, including the shortening of time limits when practical, shall be made to conclude the processing of a grievance prior to the expiration of the grievant’s employment, whether by termination or failure to reappoint. In no event shall any employee, as a result of a pending grievance, receive compensation following cessation of employment.
11.26	Reprisal. No reprisal of any kind will be made by the UBOT, University, UFF or their representatives against any grievant, any witness, any UFF representative, or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.
11.27	Records. All written materials pertinent to a grievance shall be filed separately from the evaluation file of the grievant or witnesses, except decisions resulting from arbitration or settlement.

MATRICULATION AND TUITION PROGRAM
12.1	Policy. The UBOT and the UFF-GAU agree that payment by the university of tuition for graduate assistants, and non-resident fee charges for all out-of-state graduate assistants, which results in those employees being allowed to waive such payment, is highly desirable in order to attract high quality graduate students to the University of Florida and to improve the quality of education.

Waivers shall be for at least the minimum number of credit hours required to hold the employee’s graduate assistant appointment. If sufficient waivers are not available to provide all graduate assistants with such waivers, first consideration for receipt of these waivers shall be given to graduate assistants who were employed and receiving a waiver for at least one (1) semester during the prior academic year and who are students in good standing.
(b)	In order to supplement the waivers provided by the Legislature for this program and following the practice of other major research institutions throughout the country, the University shall require those individuals who make application for contracts or grants to incorporate the costs of the tuition and non-resident fee charges which are associated with graduate assistants who are to be supported by such contract or grant into the contract or grant proposal.
12.3	Report to UFF-GAU. A report of the distribution of tuition and non-resident fees paid by the university shall be provided to UFF-GAU within two (2) weeks after the report is final. This report shall include information regarding the total amount of tuition and nonresident fee waivers as well as employee name, academic department, and the number of hours the employee was authorized to waive.
