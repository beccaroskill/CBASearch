Plan Type	How It Works	Relative Advantages
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO/EPA)	You usually must select a primary care physician (PC?) from the HMO's pool of doctors and pay a small fixed amount for each visit. Typically, the PCP must approve any trips to specialists and non-emergency visits to HMO network hospitals.	You want to know in advance what your annual health cost will be, more or less. You’ll need to be comfortable using only your HMO’s physicians and hospitals and depending on your primary cure doctor for referrals.
Point-of-Scrvicc Plan (POS)	These are plans administered by insurance companies or HMO’s that let members go to providers without a PCP referral-for a price.	You want the coordinated care of an HMO with the safety net of being able to go to providers without a referral from the PCP.
Traditional Medical Plan*	You select your own doctors and hospitals and pay on a fee-for-service basis. You don’t need a referral to see a specialist	"	Cost is not an issue and you have already established relationships with doctors who do not belong to a managed care network.
*The Traditional Plan has a Preferred Provider overlay. This is a network of doctors that offer plan discounted rates. Employees who use a PPO provider may have lower out-of-pocket expenses.

Article V] 11
(g)	Norma] Retirement Benefit - Under the Retirement Plan, the amount you will receive each month as a Normal Retirement Benefit depends on several factors: (I) your Final Average Monthly Earnings, or FAME (see below). Note that FAME includes shift premiums and sales commissions, but not overtime or premium pay; (2) your Years of Credited Service; (3) the Covered Compensation limit - each year the IRS determines the maximum amount of earnings on which Social Security taxes and benefits are paid. This is called the taxable wage base. Covered compensation is the average of taxable wage bases for the 35-year period ending with the year you reach your Social Security normal retirement age. The average changes each year; and (4) your monthly annuity benefit, if any, under any other pension plan of the Company. Your monthly normal retirement benefit is calculated according to the following formula:
Step 1.	1,33% X Final Average Monthly Earnings
1,33% X Years of Credited Service
(Final Average Monthly Earnings (FAME) is the highest average of your monthly earnings for the best 60 consecutive months in the last 15 years prior to your retirement or termination date. Normally, this is your last 60 months of work.)

PLUS

The normal retirement benefit described above is the amount you would receive under a Single Life Annuity - that is, monthly payments for life that end when you die, with no payments io a beneficiary after your death. If you are married, or if you choose some other way to receive your benefits, the amount you will receive will be somewhat less, to account for payments after your death to your spouse or other beneficiary.

Other supervisory steps, such as training sessions, visual observations, and, individual discussions and coaching may_be_used in addition to monitoring to assess and improve an employee’s performance. Service observations will be utilized no more than four times per month for coaching. The employee’s direct supervisor will conduct this monitoring.
