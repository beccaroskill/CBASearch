ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT governing Retail Meat Markets entered into between JEWEL FOOD STORES, INC., hereinafter called the "Employer", and LOCAL 1546, UNITED FOOD & COMMERCIAL WORKERS INTERNATIONAL UNION, AFL-CIO & CLC, hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Union", acting as the exclusive collective bargaining agent for all employees covered by this Agreement.
ARTICLE I GENERAL
Section 1.1	Scope of Contract
It is agreed that this Contract shall govern the hours, wages and other conditions of employment of Employer's meat department employees in Retail Meat Markets within the geographical jurisdiction of Local 1546.
Section 1.2	Definitions
(A)	Apprentice Hired After 1/7/98
1.	Two (2) part-time apprentices will be allowed per store calculated and distributed on a system wide basis.
2.	Effective 7/26/98, the Employer agrees to a full-time ratio of 30% full time and 70% part-time for the apprentice/joumeyman classification. The ratio is calculated on a system wide basis. The ratio will be reviewed on a semi-annual basis (January 1 and July 1). The full-time placement will be pursuant to the job bid process of the Employer. The Company will provide names and locations of newly hired apprentices.
3.	All employees hired on or before January 7, 1998, that apply pursuant to a job posting, will be given first preference for an apprentice position with a 90 day trial period. All employees hired on or before January 7, 1998, whose rate is above the 0 - 6 month rate will remain at their rate of pay at time of promotion until they have the required time in the apprentice position to progress to the next rate of pay.
4.	All Market Managers and meat cutters hired before January 7, 1998, shall have preference for all meat cutting hours on Sundays and Holidays before apprentices hired or promoted into the classification on or after January 7, 1998.
5.	Once an apprentice completes the 84 month wage structure, the employee will become a journeyman meat cutter based on the new hire wage structure. The terms of employment shall continue as provided for apprentices and journeymen hired after January 7, 1998.
6.	An apprentice promoted from the new classification to market manager shall receive the current market manager rate of pay in the contract.
7.	Work restrictions contained in Section 2.3, Section 4.1(2), Section 4.2 of the contract do not apply to apprentices/joumeymen hired into the new classification.
(B)	Journeyman
After serving the apprenticeship, an employee shall be classified as a journeyman meat cutter and shall be paid the journeyman rate of pay, based.on the new hire pay structure.
(C)	Part-Time Journeymen Hired on or Before 1/7/98
The Employer may hire and utilize part-time journeymen on the following basis:
(1)	Wage rate fifty cents ($0.50) per hour below the regular journeyman rate.
(2)	First refusal on full-time openings.
(3)	One (1) part-time journeyman per store except in markets where the sum of the head meat cutter, journeymen and apprentices equal eight (8) in which event the Employer can utilize a second part-time journeyman.
(D)	Head Meat Cutter
The term "Head Meat Cutter" means a journeyman meat cutter who is responsible for the efficient management of the market. Each store will have only one (1) head meat cutter.
4
If a Head Meatcutter requests to step down to a meatcutter position he will be allowed to do so if an opening exists based on the needs of the business. In the event no qualified candidate bids on the Head Mcatcutter position are received, the supervisory duties performed by a Head meatcutter may be performed by persons outside the bargaining unit or the incumbent head meatcutter may be required by the Employer to remain in his head meatcutter position until a replacement head meatcutter is available for placement.
(E)	Wrappers
Wrappers may be employed and their duties shall be confined to slicing luncheon meats and sausages; clean-up work in the market; stocking cases; and wrapping, scaling, and pricing. Wrappers are allowed to marinate, assemble and stuff all prepared foods for sale. Wrappers hired on or before 1/7/98 may work in the Seafood Department on a voluntary basis in addition to the rights set forth in Section 1.4 of the Seafood Supplement. Wrappers who are hired after 1/7/98 or promoted to full-time after 1/7/98 may also be assigned to work in the Seafood Department. Their duties shall include all activities assigned to the Seafood Department with the understanding that the Employer may receive into and utilize in such departments, frozen fish items without the requirement that those items be price marked and may receive into and utilize in such departments, fresh fish items without the requirement that those items be cut, prepared, fabricated, etc., priced or packaged on the premises. Seafood Department employees are not required to be craft people, however, they may perform all operations pertaining to fish including the cutting, filleting, packaging, wrapping, pricing, displaying, etc. of either fresh or frozen fish.
No Wrappers shall use knives, saws, grinders, cube machines or other mechanical equipment used in the preparation or processing of fresh meats or poultry other than as specified in this section, with the exception that wrappers may perform all market functions excluding the use of power saws in servicing individual customer requests.
Wrappers who want to transfer to available apprentice positions shall make their desire known to the Employer in writing and they shall be given equal consideration for such vacancies along with other applicants. There shall be no reduction in pay to any wrapper as a result of entering the apprentice program, i.e., wrappers rate of pay shall apply until such time as the apprentice rate exceeds the wrapper rate at which time the apprentice rate shall apply. The wrapper entering the apprenticeship program shall have a ninety (90) day trial period. The trial period shall not jeopardize the employee’s former classification or seniority except such wrapper transferred to the apprentice classification will have seniority for the purpose of lay off and recall from the date of such transfer.
Part-time wrappers may be employed on the following basis:
1)	Part-time wrappers can only be new hires or employees who transfer into that classification from the Delicatessen Department, it being understood that the transfer of an employee from the Delicatessen Department classification to the part-time wrapper classification is optional with the Employer and that any full-time Delicatessen Department employee so transferred would be “red-circled” until such time as the part-time wrapper rate reached the red-circled employees rate of pay.
2)	When a full-time wrapper is needed in a given store, the Employer will endeavor to fill said position by the employer’s job posting and bidding process. The determination of the relative qualification of all applicants is expressly reserved to the Employer.

2.	Journeymen and Apprentices
3.	Wrappers
The Employer shall give a two (2) week notice to regular full-time employees only when it becomes necessary to layoff an employee or two (2) weeks pay in lieu of notice. If a journeyman or a market manager in one seniority area is laid off, that employee may displace another less senior employee in another seniority area in the same classification.

The Employer shall notify the Union in writing of the areas comprising its seniority areas as modified from time to time. The Employer agrees to notify the Union in advance of any changes in the seniority area. The Employer agrees to discuss with the union seniority areas before they are changed.
It is mutually agreed that for the term of this Agreement there shall be no in-classification transfers of employees from one "seniority area" to another "seniority area" as defined above in the instance where there are employees on layoff status in that particular classification in the area in which an employee from another area is sought to be transferred.
A series of store cluster groups will be set up that will be seniority areas for part-time employees. The Company will provide to the Union on a yearly basis the stores that define the part-time cluster groups.
No meat cutter, wrapper or service deli employee in service on or before 1/7/98, will be laid off or reduced in hours as a result of the new apprentice/joumeymen classification.
In the event of a layoff in the apprentice classification, any wrapper who bids into the apprentice classification will be allowed upon written request to bump the wrapper with the lowest seniority in the job classification. The bumping area for full-time shall be the region and for part-time shall be the cluster group.
Part-time journeymen must be laid off prior to the layoff of any full-time journeymen (by area by seniority).
AH part-time wrappers must be laid off before the layoff of any full-time wrappers. All part-time wrappers in a given store must be laid off before any journeyman hired or promoted as of August 27, 2004 are laid off in that same given store.

SEAFOOD AND SERVICE DEPARTMENT SUPPLEMENT
ARTICLE I
GENERAL - RECOGNITION
Unless otherwise specified herein, the general conditions and obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Master Contract covering market operations shall be applicable and are hereby incorporated by reference. This supplement shall cover Seafood and Service Departments employees. The Employer shall determine methods of merchandising to be used in the Seafood Department and Service Department. The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole bargaining agent for all Seafood and Service Department employees in Seafood and Service Department operations assigned to the Meat Department.
SECTION 1.1	Seafood Department Duties
The Employer may employ regular full-time and/or part-time Seafood Department employees. Their duties shall include all activities assigned to the Seafood Department with the understanding that the Employer may receive into and utilize in such departments, frozen fish items without the requirement that those items be price marked and may receive into and utilize in such departments, fresh fish items without the requirement that those items be cut, prepared, fabricated, etc., priced or packaged on the premises. Seafood Department employees are not required to be craft people, however, they may perform all operations pertaining to fish including the cutting, filleting, packaging, wrapping, pricing, displaying, etc. of either fresh or frozen fish.
SECTION 1.2	Service Department Duties
The Employer may employ regular full-time and/or part-time employees in the Service Departments. Their duties shall include all activities assigned to the Service Departments. Service department employees are not required to be craft people, however, they may perform all operations pertaining to the product in the service department including the cutting, filleting, packaging, wrapping, pricing, displaying etc. of either fresh or frozen product in servicing of individual customer requests. Service department employee's duties will not include production work.
SECTION 1.3	Fish Department Employees
Inasmuch as the Seafood Departments are now the responsibility of the Market Manager (Head Meat Cutter), we will no longer utilize the classification of Seafood Head. However, in those instances where a person is given the responsibility for the ordering, display and general operations of the department, they will be paid at the journeyman meat cutter rate specified in the master Contract. However, any former Seafood Head who was not a journeyman and therefore not reassigned a journeyman’s position within the market, shall continue to be paid the journeyman rate. Also, the Seafood handlers who were in service on or before October 5, 1985, shall continue to be paid at the full-time delicatessen rate applicable to delicatessen employees in service on or before October 5, 1985, plus a premium of Four dollars ($4.00) per week.
Effective January 7, 1998, the Seafood classification will merge into the Wrapper classification. Pier and Wrapper employees as of January 7, 1998 shall be red circled and will not have hours reduced as a result of current Pier employees doing wrapper duties or current Wrappers doing Pier duties. As of January 7, 1998 Pier employees or wrappers may agree with the Employer to work in the other department. As of January 7, 1998, employees will only be hired in as wrappers and may be assigned Pier work as determined by the Employer.
No employee hired after January 7, 1998, will be classified as a Seafood employee.
Furthermore, the Employer may continue to receive into and utilize frozen fish items without the requirement that those items be price marked and continue to receive into and utilize fresh fish without the requirement that the product be cut, prepared, fabricated, etc., priced or packaged on the premises. Fish department employees need not be craft people, however, they may perform all operations relative to fish, including the cutting, filleting, packaging, wrapping, pricing, etc. of either fresh or frozen fish.
SECTION 1.4	CUSTOMER SERVICE
Pier and Market employees can cross over to wait on customers. Pier and Chopping Block employees can relieve each other for breaks and lunches and if an employee in one shop calls in sick and a replacement cannot be found, then an employee of one shop can service both shops. Pier and Wrappers hired on or before 1/7/98, may work in the Chopping Block on a voluntary basis.
