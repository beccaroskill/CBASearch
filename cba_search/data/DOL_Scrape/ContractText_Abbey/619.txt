3.5	Pyramiding of Overtime and Premium Pay Prohibited
Premiums paid for Sunday work, holiday work or for undesirable hours shall not be duplicated and only the higher of two available premiums will be paid. However, where a “third person” or a Dairy/Frozen Food Manager works on Sunday, they shall be paid time and one-half (1-1/2) their regular hourly rate plus the appropriate premium. Premium hours paid at time and one-half (1-1/2) straight-time rate or in excess shall not be counted in computing daily or weekly overtime. Overtime hours paid on a daily or shift basis shall not be included in calculating overtime on a weekly basis.

Part-time clerks called in to work and who report shall receive a minimum of three (3) hours work or the equivalent pay in lieu thereof provided they are available to perform the work. Part-time employees shall be called in for additional hours in accordance with seniority and type of work within the store they work.
The call-in guarantees are subject to the employees availability to work the guaranteed hours, nor shall such guarantee be applicable due to disruption of normal store opera
3.8
3.9
tions by conditions beyond the control of the Employer, such as Acts of God, civil commotion, fires, work stoppages due to strikes, or governmental intervention.
No employee shall have his/her scheduled hours reduced due to a call-in unless notice of schedule reduction is given at the time of the call-in.
Full-Time Employment Required When Practicable
It is the intent of the parties that two employees shall not be employed on a part-time basis when it is practicable to employ one employee on a full-time basis. Therefore, if two part-time employees in the same job classification are regularly working a combined total of forty (40) hours, or more, on a split week basis, then the Employer shall employ one person on a full-time basis. The selection of such employee shall be in accordance with Article VII, Section 7.5.

In the event an employee is required to work temporarily in a lesser paying job, he/she shall not suffer a reduction in pay while on such temporary assignment.
Scheduling of Part-Time Employees
A. Part-Time Regular Clerks. Part-Time Bakery
Clerks, and Part-Time
General Merchandise Clerks
Part-time regular clerks, part-time Bakery clerks and part-time General Merchandise clerks will be scheduled for hours of work in accordance with seniority and the type of work they do within the store in which they work. More senior part-time employees will maintain a reasonable difference in the number of hours they are scheduled each week as compared to less senior part-time employees. To ensure an equitable spread of scheduled hours to acknowledge seniority within an employee’s current classification, the following schedule will be followed:
Completed Years of Service	Minimum
in Current Classification	Scheduled Hours
0-4, inclusive	12
5-9, inclusive	15
10 - 14, inclusive	19
Over 14	23
Any hours of work in addition to the above, whether occasionally, seasonally or permanently available, will be distributed to part-time employees by seniority in accordance with the type of work they do within the store.
5

B.	Service Clerks, Bulk Food Clerks and Salad Bar Clerics
(1)	Service Clerks, Bulk Food Clerics and Salad Bar Clerics will be scheduled a minimum of twelve (12) hours per week in the store in which they work. However, this shall not apply to an employee called in to replace another employee or to an employee whose available hours are beyond the Employer’s control, or to an employee called in to work when fewer than twelve (12) available hours remain in the week.
(2)	Qualified Service Clerks, Bulk Food Clerks and Salad Bar Clerics shall be scheduled for available hours in accordance with seniority and type of work within the store they work. It is agreed that the Employer may employ such Service Clerics, Bulk Food Clerks and Salad Bar Clerks as may be required for the efficient operation of the store.
C.	Part-time employees shall be scheduled for a minimum of four (4) hours in any one (1) day, provided they are available for work.
3.10	Dress and Appearance Code

The Union shall be furnished copies of the code adopted and shall be consulted prior to any major changes in said code.

ARTICLE VII-SENIORITY
7.1
Hun
andQther Definitions
Seniority
Seniority means the rights secured by an employee by length of continuous employment service as provided herein. Seniority starts from the last date when the employee is hired by the Employer except that new employees shall not acquire any seniority rights until they have completed a probationary period of thirty (30) days, after which their seniority shall date back to the date of last hiring. The probationary period for employees in new stores shall be thirty (30) days from the date that the store opens. The probationary period for service clerks shall be sixty (60) days.
Service Clerks promoted after March 29, 1993 may, for thirty (30) days following promotion, request to be returned to the job of Service Clerk. If the request is approved by store management, the Service Clerk will be returned to the former job, wage rate, and seniority.
An employee’s seniority shall be broken if he/she: (1) quits; (2) retires; (3) is discharged; (4) fails to report after a layoff within seven (7) calendar days after the Employer sends to the last known address known to the Employer a written notification to return to work; or (5) has been out of employment by the Employer for a period of twelve (12) months.
Seniority ranking for employees, hired after March 29, 1993, commencing employment on the same date shall be determined by the day and month of birth. The employee whose day and month of birth is closest to January 1 within the calendar year, shall have the greatest seniority. Employees hired on the same day, on or before March 29, 1993 had their relative seniority determined by the Employer.
7.2	Seniority Area - Full-Time Employees
For purposes of layoff and recalls after layoff, there shall be the following seniority areas:
Established Zone
North Area
Central Area
South Area
The Employer agrees to provide the Union with a map outlining the above areas.
The Union and the Employer reserve the right to mutually modify or amend the seniority areas where changes occur in operating conditions which may affect the balance the parties have tried to achieve and maintain.
7.3	Layoffs and Recalls after Layoffs • Full-Time Employees
Where the employee’s qualifications, such as skill, efficien
12
cy, and in the cases of such semi-supervisory positions as department heads, the ability to organize, direct and supervise the work of others, are equal, seniority shall control the order of layoffs and recalls after layoffs of full-time employees.
In the event of layoff full-time employees shall have seniority preference over part-time employees and a laid off full-time employee may elect to bump a part-time employee within his/her seniority area. If a full-time employee claims bumping rights in lieu of layoff the Union and the Employer shall resolve the methods to be employed.
The Employer shall determine the relative qualifications of employees, but when the qualifications of employees for the particular job or jobs are equal, this seniority principle requires that:
(A)	The employee with the lowest seniority in the job classification in the store shall be the first laid off.
(B)	The employee being laid off may as an alternative bump that employee in the same job classification with the lowest seniority in the seniority area.
(C)	No new full-time employee shall be hired in a job classification until all laid off employees in that classification and seniority recall area who are qualified to fill the open job have been given an opportunity to return to work.
(D)	Qualified laid off employees shall be recalled in the order of their seniority in the recall area in which their store is located.
In the case of semi-supervisory department heads, namely, Assistant Managers, Produce Managers, and Service Managers the Employer may reclassify to full-time clerk status any surplus department heads not required by contract by reclassifying the most junior person in such classification based on continuous employment date. Such reclassified employee may bump the most junior full-time clerk in his/her seniority area if his/her seniority is greater. Other classified positions may also be reduced in accordance with the foregoing process.
7.4	Layoffs and Recalls after Layoffs • Part-Time Employees
Where fitness and ability are equal, length of service of part-time personnel shall control the order of layoffs and recalls after layoffs on the following basis.
Within an area encompassing the six closest stores to the store where the layoff occurs within the North Area, Central Area or South Area.
When a store is permanently closed (not relocated) or when a store is destroyed by Acts of God, fire or other reason,
part-time employees may exercise their seniority to transfer in their seniority area and displace the most junior part-time employee within such area. Employees exercising their seniority right shall retain their length of service date for vacations and other benefits.
Service Clerks will be treated as a separate classification for purposes of layoff. Accordingly, Service Clerks need not be laid off prior to the laying off of any other classification.
7.5	Selection of Employees for Full-Time Employment
The Employer will welcome applications for full-time employment from part-time employees with six (6) months or more continuous service. When a full-time clerk is needed, the Employer will endeavor to fill said position by selecting from all applicants, the applicant whose qualifications, ability and availability for work are the greatest; provided, however, that where qualifications are equal, preference shall be given to part-time applicants within the collective bargaining unit on the basis of their length of service. The determination of the relative qualifications of all applicants is expressly reserved to the Employer.
A part-time employee applying for a full-time position will be given an interview with a Personnel Department representative provided the following criteria have been met.
1)	The provisions in this section have been followed and;
2)	The Resident/Store Manager and employee have met and the Resident/Store Manager has explained to the employee why he/she is not being recommended for a full-time position.
Where an interview is requested the Resident/Store Manager should contact the Personnel Manager to arrange an interview.
7.6	Promotion of Service Clerks
Where qualifications are equal, seniority shall prevail with respect to the promotion of Service Clerks.
7.7	Promotion to Supervision
If an employee is promoted from a bargaining unit job to a supervisory position with the Employer, he/she shall continue to accumulate seniority while working in said position for a period of one (1) year. If during said year the employee proves unsatisfactory or deems it to be in his/her best interest, he/she shall be returned to the bargaining unit within the same seniority area at the same job classification and pay rate he/she held prior to his/her promotion, plus the seniority accumulated while working in the supervisory position.
7.8	Seniority of Employees on Leaves of Absence
The seniority rights of an employee who, either by volun-
13
tary action or draft entered the Armed Forces of the United States shall continue as though he/she had not been absent, and he/she shall have the right to be reinstated to his/her employment as provided by law and regulations thereunder.
An employee who requests and is granted a personal leave of absence by the Employer shall have his/her seniority rights and provisions maintained for the duration of such leave of absence, provided the employee does not hold any other employment while on such personal leave of absence.

ARTICLE IX • NO STRIKES: NO LOCKOUTS: GRIEVANCES & ARBITRATION
9.1	No Strikes: No Lockouts
The Union and the Employer agree on the need for the continuance of their service to the public without interruption. Both recognize this objective as necessary to the security of the Employer and its people. Both, therefore, specifically pledge themselves to help assure that security by using the procedures agreed upon between them for the adjustment of disputes and grievances in all cases where there is any difference of opinion concerning the rights of either under this Contract or the interpretation or application of any provision of it. Therefore, during the term of this Agreement there shall be no strikes, stoppages, diminution or suspension of work of any kind whatsoever on the part of the Union or its membership; nor shall there be any lockout on the part of the Employer.
9.2	Grievances
(A)	Grievance Defined
A grievance is hereby defined as any dispute involving the interpretation or application of the provisions of the Contract.
(B)	Procedure
A grievance may be initiated by any individual employee, by the Union or by the Employer. Once initiated, the following steps shall be taken to settle such grievance:
Step 1:
By conference between the aggrieved employee, the shop steward, or both, and the Store Manager or Resident.
Step 2:
By conference between a Union representative and the Store Manager and/or the Divisional Manager or other representative designated by the Divisional Manager. Failure to resolve or respond to a Step 2 grievance within fifteen (15) calendar days of it becoming a Step 2 grievance will automatically advance the grievance to Step 3.
Step 3:
By conference between a Union representative and the Area Vice President or such other official as the Employer may designate to represent it in such conference. Failure to resolve or respond to a Step 3 grievance within thirty (30) calendar days of it becoming a Step 3 grievance will automatically advance the grievance to step 4.
Step 4:
By conference between the President of the Union or his designate and the Labor Relations official of the Company. Failure to resolve or respond to a step 4 grievance within fifteen (15) days of it becoming a step 4 grievance provides the parties with the right to advance the grievance to the arbitration level.
Any grievance initiated or carried to Step 3 shall be reduced to writing. Grievances involving only one (1) store shall be introduced only at Steps 1 or 2, while grievances involving more than one (1) store may be introduced at any step. All grievances shall be investigated and answered promptly.
(C)	Time Limits on Grievances
Any grievance involving a claim of improper discharge or other discipline must be presented within seven (7) days after discharge or disciplinary action. All other grievances excluding discharge or disciplinary action must be made within thirty (30) calendar days after the cause giving rise to the grievance becomes evident. Wage claims involving the proper application of wage rates shall not be valid and collectible for a period earlier than 180 calendar days prior to the date of filing the claims. Grievances involving improper scheduling must be filed within the workweek in which the violation occurs in order that the Company can correct such violations without incurring a back pay liability.
17
9.3	Arbitration
(A)	Either the Union or the Employer may, within thirty (30) calendar days after failure to adjust the grievance in accordance with the grievance procedure, serve upon the other party a written demand for arbitration stating the issue to be arbitrated. The parties shall endeavor to select an impartial arbitrator. However, if the parties fail to agree upon an arbitrator who is willing and able to serve within fifteen (15) calendar days after service of the demand for arbitration, either party may, within seven (7) calendar days thereafter, request the American Arbitration Association to submit a list of not less than five (5) disinterested persons who are qualified and willing to act as impartial arbitrators. Upon receipt of this list, an authorized representative of the Union and of the Employer shall flip a coin to determine who shall have first choice to strike a name. The party winning the toss shall then strike a name from the panel. Thereafter, the parties shall alternately strike one name each until only one name remains. The person whose name remains shall be the selected arbitrator.
(B)	The arbitrator shall commence hearings as quickly as possible after his/her selection and shall render his/her award in writing together with his/her written findings and conclusions as quickly as reasonably possible after the hearing. The award shall be final and binding upon the parties to this Agreement and upon the complaining employee or employees, if any.
The arbitrator shall have no power to determine arbitrability nor to add or subtract from, modify, or amend any provision of this Agreement, nor to substitute his/her discretion for the discretion of the Union or the Employer, change existing wage rates, or arbitrate proposals for the amendment or renewal of this Agreement.
The arbitrator’s fees and expenses, the cost of any hearing room and the cost of a shorthand reporter and of the original transcript shall be borne equally by the parties. All other cost and expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them.
(C)	For the purpose of entertaining a written request from either of the parties for rehearing to correct any material error of omission or commission, ambiguity, or question of application allegedly evident in the opinion or award the arbitrator shall, for a period of seven (7) calendar days next following the date of his/her award, retain jurisdiction of the matter submitted to arbitration by the parties hereto, and until the expiration of the
period of time stated in this provision for rehearing the award shall not be deemed to have been issued. If, however, no request for rehearing is duly filed within this seven (7) day period, this award shall be deemed to be issued effective as of its date. A written request for rehearing shall detail the specific grounds relied upon for alleging a material error, or ambiguity, and a copy thereof shall be mailed by certified mail to the other party or parties. If the written request is postmarked no later than the seventh (7th) day next following the date of this award, it shall extend the jurisdiction of the arbitrator for a period of seven (7) days next following the date of the written request. Within those seven (7) days the arbitrator, having re-examined the matter, shall in writing either reject the request for a rehearing or set a date for the requested rehearing. If the request for rehearing be denied, this award shall thereupon be deemed to be issued effective that date and the jurisdiction of the arbitrator shall accordingly cease. If the request for rehearing be granted, the jurisdiction of the arbitrator shall continue until issuance of a final amended award incorporating or rejecting the substances of the allegations contained in the request.
(D)	The'participation by the parties in an arbitration
proceeding under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of or prejudicial to the right of either party to contest the arbitrability of the grievance or the jurisdiction and authority of the arbitrator in proceedings to set aside the award or in other appropriate proceedings in any State or Federal Court of competent jurisdiction; provided such judicial proceedings are instituted within thirty (30) days of the date of the arbitrator’s award.
