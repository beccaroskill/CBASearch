(a)	If the percentage increase of the CPI-W exceeds the cumulative percentage increase to the Maximum Rates of each wage schedule for the Initial General Wage Increase (GWI), plus the second, third and fourth GWI’s, an Escalation Adjustment shall be applied by multiplying the percentage increase in the CPI-W. The result shall be added to the fourth scheduled GWI and applied to the Maximum Rates and Minimum Rates in effect oh May 26, 2001.
(b)	A partial percent increase shall be rounded to the nearest one tenth of one percent.

(a)	If the percentage increase of the CPI-W exceeds the cumulative percentage increase to the Maximum Rates of each wage schedule for the Initial GWI, plus the second, third, fourth and fifth GWI’s, plus the Escalation Adjustment for the prior year, if any, an Escalation Adjustment shall be applied by multiplying the percentage increase in the CPI-W. The result shall be added to the fifth scheduled GWI and applied to the Maximum Rates and Minimum Rates in effect on May 25, 2002.
(b)	A partial percent increase shall be rounded to the nearest one tenth of one percent.
3	In no event shall a decrease in the CPI-W result in a reduction of any wage rate.

In the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics changes the form or the basis of calculating the CPI-W the Company and the Union agree to request the Bureau to make available, for the life of this Agreement, a CPI-W in its present form and calculated on the same basis as the CPI-W for March 1998, which was 158.7 (1982-1984=100).

The JHCC is responsible for assuring successful implementation and continued operation of a quality health care program for current bargaining unit members.
The JHCC will be a forum for addressing and resolving issues involved in the implementation and ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the managed cared programs of the Medical Expense Plan for Occupational Employees. To accomplish these objectives the JHCC will:
-	review and comment on bid specifications for the Managed Care Programs of the Medical Expense Plan for Occupational Employees, provide input on who should be invited to bid, meet with various vendors as they make clarifying presentations on their programs and capabilities, attend briefings on the outcome of the bid analysis, and make recommendations on the selection of the carrier to senior management.

•	Based on any such review and evaluation, the JHCC may recommend to the Company to change an existing occupational POS network plan administrator in that area to an administrator that presently administers a network under any other medical plan sponsored by the Company in that area. If the Company adopts such recommendation, it shall have, if it deems necessary to effectuate such change, at least one full calendar year to implement such change.
-	recommend changes in administrative procedures in order to improve the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the Managed Care Programs.
-	review any evaluations and reports (e.g., NCQA/HEDIS) relating to the POS programs of the Medical Expense Plan for Occupational Employees.

The unlimited lifetime maximum shall not apply to any in-network benefits or any benefits under the separately administered mental health, chemical dependency Or prescription drug programs.
Retiree Medical Caps
Effective January 1, 1999, the amount of Company contributions toward coverage shall be determined in the same manner as immediately prior to this 1998 National Memorandum, except that costs used to determine the amount of Company contribution shall also take into account postretirement dental costs and coverage under the Lucent Technologies Inc. Dental Expense Plan for Retired Employees. For purposes of determining whether the costs of coverage have exceeded the applicable cap, the costs of medical and dental coverage for retired employees subject to the caps shall be based on the cost experience of only those employees who retired on or after March 1, 1990, and shall include their costs of coverage provided under the Point of Service (“PCS”) programs, indemnity plan, Health Maintenance Organizations (“HMO”) and Medicare HMOs provided under the Medical Expense Plan for Retired Employees.
129
National Memorandum
The caps on the Company contributions to provide the combination of medical and dental coverage for the term of this 1998 National Memorandum shall be as follows:
Under age 65 - single coverage: $4,225
Under age 65 - family coverage: $8,600
Age 65 and over—single coverage: $2,000
Age 65 and over - family coverage: $4,625
These revised caps reflect the continuation of the current cap for post retirement medical benefits and the addition of a cap of $425 for single and $850 for family for post retirement dental benefits so as to produce a combined cap for all retiree health benefits.
No retired employee shall be required to contribute towards the cost of post retirement medical and dental coverage for the duration of this 1998 National Memorandum. It is anticipated that the combined medical and dental cap Will not be exceeded during the term of the 1998 National Memorandum.
Calculation of Required Retired Employee Contribution
For purposes of determining whether the average projected costs of the Plan for the four types of coverage (i.e., single or family, pre or post age 65) will exceed the applicable Company contribution limit for the next succeeding calendar year and, if so, determining the amount of the required applicable retired employee contribution, Lucent will annually:
1.	Determine the actual aggregate cost of all incurred claims (including the cost of administration) for the. second preceding calendar year prior to the year for which premiums are being set for (1) retired employees with single coverage under 65; (2) retired employees with family coverage under 65; (3) retired employees 65 and over with single coverage; and (4) retired employees 65 and over With family coverage.
2.	Based upon such actual aggregate costs, determine the average cost (including dependent costs) for such year per retired employee in each group.
3.	Adjust the four average amounts determined in item 2 by an amount to be determined by the Special Research Group, as described below.
4.	Calculate the difference between the amounts determined in item 3 and the applicable Company contribution limits and subtract the average claim for each group from the applicable cap for the group, and determine whether the cap has been exceeded. If no cap for any group has been exceeded, then no retiree contributions are required. If one or more caps are exceeded then all caps are aggregated, on a weighted basis. If the result is a positive number, then retiree premiums are due from each group that has exceeded the caps. If the result is a negative number then retiree, premiums are not due from any group.
Medical Inflation and Projected Costs
The determination of medical inflation and projected costs used to calculate any required employee contributions as described above in item 2 shall be made by a Special Research Group whose members shall include expert representatives from the Company and no more than two expert representatives from each union.
Adjustment to Retired Employee Contribution
Subsequent to each year, Lucent shall compare the aggregate costs for actual incurred claims (plus administrative expenses) for such year to the aggregate of the sum of all Company and
130
National Memorandum
I
I
retired employee contributions, for retired employees under age 65 and retired employees 65 and over, respectively.
For each of such two groups of retired employees, the Company shall determine whether there has been a surplus or deficit and the amount of such for each year. If there has been a surplus 1	in the amount of prior employee contributions, the amount of such surplus will be used to offset
।	any future retired employee contributions. If there has been a deficit in the amount of prior
retired employee contributions, the amount of such deficit will be applied to increase any future required retired employee contributions.
I
. Medical Options for Retired Occupational Employees
i Effective January 1, 1999, retired occupational employees who currently reside in a zip code which denominates them as residing in an “Out of Network” area under the Plan, may elect to participate in a POS program offered under the Medical Expense Plan if such program is geographically proximate to the primary residence of the retired occupational employee.

Re: Future Negotiation of Retiree Medical Caps
Dear Morty and Jack,
As you know, in 1989 bargaining the parties amended the AT&T Medical Expense Plan "to provide that the amount of the Company contribution for coverage of a retired employee (i.e., those who retire after March 1, 1990) shall not exceed..." certain amounts set forth in the National Memorandum of Understanding ("retiree medical caps"). After the 1989 bargaining the Company agreed to negotiate these amounts in future bargaining sessions with CWA and IBEW.
Effective October 1, 1996, Lucent Technologies "cloned" the AT&T Medical Expense Plan and renamed it the Lucent Technologies Medical Expense Plan. Now, in the 1998 negotiations, Lucent has bargained about retiree medical CAPS, and has as a result increased them.
This letter will confirm my statement to you that Lucent Technologies will negotiate the level of health care caps and company contributions for retiree medical coverage and vehicles for providing such contributions for those who retired after March 1, 1990, in all future bargaining sessions with the two unions.

Negotiations shall then take place if requested by the Union. In the event of such negotiations, the changes proposed by the Company shall not be implemented until (a) agreement is reached, or (b) the Company determines that timely action is required by law, regulation, order, determination or ruling whichever occurs sooner.

IMPROVEMENTS TO LTP
May 31, 1998
Mr. R. V. Maly, Assistant to the Vice President, C\NA.
Mr. F. P. Possinger, President, System Council EM-3, IBEW
Mr. R. F. Morrison, Chairman, System Council T-3, IBEW
Gentlemen:
Re: Improvements to LTP
This will confirm the discussions and agreement reached in 1998 Bargaining by the Unions and the Company concerning improvements to the Lucent Transfer Program (LTP) over the life of the Agreement.
Recognizing that the LTP will be implemented initially utilizing technology and programming that replicate the existing AT&T Transfer System/AT&T Rehire System, the Unions and the Company agree to strictly limit investment in the existing systems infrastructure and programming. Until the LTP can be built utilizing appropriate current technology within or interfacing with Global PeopleSoft, the only changes and improvements which will be implemented are those which can be effected by process changes or through current technology outside of the LTP.
Examples of changes and improvements which will be explored for early implementation include:
•	allowing occupational employees to access additional information more quickly and easily;
•	making documentation concerning LTP easy to use;
•	allowing additional avenues for employees to update profiles and submit placement requests.
The schedule for implementation of all changes and improvements will be established and monitored by the Joint LTP Review Board in consultation with the Human Resources Applications (HRA) group.
173
National Memorandum
The Company and the Unions further agree that the Joint LTP Review Board is authorized to:
•	establish a task force to study and resolve problems in the staffing through the LTP of positions requiring a security clearance
•	remind Business Units of the impacts and expense of canceled job requisitions

Regular full-time and part-time occupational employees covered. by this 1998 National J	Memorandum are eligible for the provisions	of LCTOP. The provisions of LCTOP are not
s	intended to alter, modify or eliminate the force	adjustment provisions of the local contracts.
If the Company notifies the Union in writing of a surplus which will necessitate layoffs, the i	Company may, to the degree necessary to	resolve the surplus, in order of seniority, offer
j	employees in the surplus universe the opportunity to elect one (1) of the following options,
provided they meet the conditions of the option selected.
1.	Special Leave Program, or
2.	Optional Termination Pay, or
3.	Extended Compensation Option, and/or
4.	Transition Leave of Absence
1	Special Leave Program

Employees declared surplus upon returning to the active payroll will be given normal surplus treatment.
(e)	Service credit for the period of the SLP shall be granted to those individuals who return to the Company payroll at the end of the leave, except that such credit shall not be granted or recognized for force adjustment purposes and pension purposes (including eligibility, benefit accrual and calculation); however, the period of the leave shall be
175
National Memorandum
counted in the years of service to determine termination pay that the. employee may receive thereafter.

Gentlemen:
Re: Extended Compensation Participant in Alliance or ETOP
This is to confirm our mutual understanding that an eligible occupational employee who has chosen to participate in the Extended Compensation Option of the Lucent Career Transition Option Program and is available for temporary assignments through the Job Match Center, and who is also a participant in an Alliance or and ETOP training program, may reject a Job Match Center temporary assignment if that assignment conflicts with a verified Alliance or ETOP training program in which the employee is participating at the time.
It is also the Company's intent to develop administrative practices for the Job Match Center that foster a reasonable approach to unanticipated personal situations beyond the control of the employee which result in the declination of a Job Match Center temporary assignment.

WORKPLACE OF THE FUTURE
Lucent, CWA and IBEW reaffirm their commitment to the basic goals and principles of Workplace of the Future (WPOF) as expressed in past contracts. The parties also recognize that WPOF at Lucent needs to be revitalized in order to achieve its goals. All parties see the need for significant culture change at all levels of their respective organizations in Order to achieve greater responsiveness and involvement, and for shared involvement of the Unions and management from the beginning of this change process. They therefore agree on the'need to jointly re-examine and renew the approach for WPOF in order to move it to a new level.
This re-examination will be pursued separately from the 1998 collective bargaining process. It will begin within six weeks of the ratification of all contracts with a thorough re-evaluation of the process and program structure so far and a joint commitment to future courses of action.
With respect to 1998 bargaining, the parties agree to continue existing language of the Workplace of the Future provisions contained in the 1995 National Memorandum of Understanding between the CWA, IBEW and AT&T. The parties reserve their right to redraft language to reflect their renewed commitment and agreement. The parties will redraft language to reflect their renewed commitment and agreement by the end of 1998.

National Memorandum
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
This agreement between CWA, IBEW and Lucent Technologies addresses Union organizing and consent elections in those job titles and occupations in Lucent organizations that are not covered by the 1986 Union-Management Relations Agreement, separately attached hereto. It is effective on July 1, 1998.
As recognized by their participation in Work Place of the Future, and as a part thereof, the Unions and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to operate in the spirit of partnership and common vision. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development.
The parties also recognize the Unions’ goal of growing membership. In order to maintain this perspective and to also avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to all wholly owned Lucent Business Operating Groups and Divisions throughout the country and shall be the exclusive means by which the Unions, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize non-management employees in the covered Lucent Business Operating Groups or Divisions.
1	Employee Choice
Both the Unions and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a Union is.one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties’ mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage, and nurture an environment during a Union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct, and voting will be performed by local management and local Union officials, i.e., those directly impacted by these discussions. The local Union and management officials may request a meeting with the appropriate Union and Company headquarters representatives at the beginning of this process.
2	Neutrality
The Company and the Unions agree that an organizing drive should be and will be met by Company conduct that neither helps nor hinders organizing efforts. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. The environment is intended to foster employee choice and information communicated by either party should be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be anti-management.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should vote against Union representation .
(c)	The Union(s) will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to communicate with employees.
(d)	Management may respond to individual employee questions, and may correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
185
National Memorandum
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a "third party" or "outsider".
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be simultaneously shared with the other. The parties' communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire or seek the assistance of consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked, by name or by descriptive reference, in campaign literature or discussions.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct "captive" audience meetings.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3	Election Procedures
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show that a majority of employees in a unit appropriate for collective bargaining have signed show of interest cards indicating their desire for a representation election. The cards must be dated within three months of the date they are-presented to the Third Party Neutral (TPN). Cards signed by persons who are no longer employed by Lucent at the time of submission to the TPN will not be valid.
(b)	If an election is conducted and the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months. During this time, no Union organizing campaign for that unit will be permitted.
(c)	A majority of those who vote, validated by the TPN, will determine the outcome.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots by following the NLRB’s rules and decisions.
4	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will “start the clock”. The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90 day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the-scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process, exceed 120 days. If the employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local union from having contact with the workers in the group outside of the workplace. If the. employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and any resulting collective bargaining agreement will apply only to the agreed upon unit.
186
National Memorandum
5	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a labor union. Management’s role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including any obligations and responsibilities of the parties
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies or misstatements or any employee misunderstandings of information disseminated during the campaign process.
6	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union, or any other persons or entities during any part of this process . One way to ensure this objective is to have an NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a. process called “Consent Election”. This process will work as follows:
(a)	The Unions shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a third party neutral (TPN) proof of support by means of show of interest cards as described in Paragraph 3(a), above. " The TPN will then notify Lucent and request a list of names, job titles and work addresses. The Company will furnish the list within three business days. The applicable Union will also be furnished with the list. The "show of interest" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union(s) has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(b)	The election process will be Supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role it is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two (2) weeks of the submission of the Union's show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a secret ballot election. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with Paragraph 3(c) of this agreement, a majority of those who vote will control. Each party may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(c)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union's show of interest cards by the TPN . In those cases in which there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of the TPN and/or of using a neutral site will be shared equally by the parties.
187
National Memorandum
If there is a dispute as to the composition of the unit, the TPN shall either decide the issue within an additional seven days, or order an election as described above with the decision as to the composition of the unit to follow the election within no more than seven days.
7	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the Union(s) for access, local management and Union representatives will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by Union representatives. The Union(s) will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Lucent facilities. It is the intent and commitment of the parties that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Lucent generally and, specifically, the unit which is the subject of the organizing campaign. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times.
If Lucent and the Union(s) are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other Lucent units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Lucent and the Union(s) commit that they will negotiate an access agreement in an expeditious manner.
8	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, local Lucent management and appropriate Union representatives. It is the intent and desire of Lucent and the Union(s) that such matters be dealt with and are best dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that, if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter still remains unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. The TPN must be an active or retired attorney who has experience in, and is familiar with, NLRB procedures and precedents regarding unit determination issues. Either Lucent or the Union(s) can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three business days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide a complete statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between themselves.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.), the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
188
National Memorandum
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived access problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five (5) days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to the TPN and an expeditious hearing shall be conducted. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN , the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Lucent and the Unions believe that these matters are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Lucent and the Union(s) agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses resulting from the use of the TPN process shall be shared equally by Lucent and the Union.
9	Acquisitions And Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications equipment industry. Lucent may acquire another entity, it has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in these entities may be unrepresented, represented in whole or in part by the CWA or IBEW, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement. Nevertheless, Lucent will, after an initial transition, period of one year following the closing on an acquisition, and subject to any contrary legal or contractual requirements, apply this Neutrality and Consent Election agreement to any wholly owned subsidiary.
i •*
189
National Memorandum
10	Annual Review
On an annual basis , the Lucent Vice President of Workforce Effectiveness, the President of the CWA and the President of the IBEW may review whether there has been substantial compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and, if the parties find repeated instances of violations or repeated instances of interference during the period up to the review, may implement a process for recognition based on "card check" to replace elections in all cases or, if not, this Agreement shall continue in effect for the remaining term of the Agreement.

(b)	The Company and Union have mutually-agreed upon the number and identity of the employees eligible for representation in such a unit; and
(c)	The Union submits to a mutually selected third party signed authorization cards from a majority of the employees in the agreed upon bargaining unit, all of which expressly state that by signing the card the employee designates the Union as his/her exclusive bargaining representative and,, further, understands that if a majority of the employees in the unit also sign such cards, the Company will recognize the Union without an NLRB-supervised election; and
(d)	The Union’s majority status in the agreed-upon bargaining unit is confirmed by the mutually selected third party.
If the Company and Union fail to agree upon either of the conditions set forth in Paragraphs (a) and (b), above, the matter may be referred to the NLRB for determination.

UNION DUES PORTABILITY
May 31, 1998
Mr. R. V. Maly, Assistant to the Vice President, CWA
Mr. F. P. Possinger, President, System Council EM-3, IBEW
Mr. R. F. Morrison, Chairman, System Council T-3, IBEW
Gentlemen:
Re:	Union Dues Portability
As you are aware, our current labor contracts contain provisions for continuing the deduction of dues for employees who authorize deductions. All contracts with the CWA and contracts with the IBEW System Council EM-3 contain the following language in their union dues Payroll Deduction Authorization forms:
This authorization shall remain in effect when I am employed by Lucent unless canceled by me.
When that language* was agreed upon in 1992, the intent was to continue deductions for employees who used those authorization forms for as long as they were in jobs represented by the same union, irrespective of the individual labor contract. In addition, it was intended to reactivate the deductions following periods of separation from their represented universe. Those commitments were predicated on AT&T’s intention to adopt a single payroll system for all employees and the development of mechanized procedures to support the commitments.
A similar provision is contained in the Payroll Deduction Authorization form contained in the contract with the IBEW System Council T-3 which provides:
The amount equal to regular monthly Union dues shall be that which is certified to Lucent by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers for the bargaining unit and job in which I am employed and shall automatically be adjusted for any bargaining unit and job changes, if applicable.
This authorization shall remain in effect when ! am employed by Lucent unless canceled by me.
In that case, the continuation of the dues deductions were predicated upon changes of jobs within that contract and not to other jobs represented by the IBEW.
Since 1992, AT&T’s intentions with respect to the single payroll system changed, and were additionally impacted by the separation of Lucent Technologies from AT&T. During that period, administrative procedures were implemented to enable Lucent to honor its commitments. Those procedures have been generally successful.when employees have changed jobs within the same payroll system and when large numbers of employees changed from one payroll system to another. In those cases, the dues deductions continued. However, in some cases, especially for individual transfers of employees from one payroll system to another, the deductions stopped and needed to be reactivated later.
As you know, Lucent plans to adopt a single payroll system (SAP) for all employees. That system will be configured to ensure that the commitments expressed above will be met on a
195

regular basis. In the meantime, the Company will make every practicable attempt to ensure that we meet those commitments.

This will confirm our agreement concerning drug testing of employees pursuant to current regulations of the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Transportation (DOT).
The Company and the Unions recognize that, during the life of the agreement, certain of the Company’s employees will be or may become subject to such laws or regulations. The Company and the Unions agree that drug testing including, but not limited to, random drug testing, of bargaining unit employees may be conducted as required by law or government regulation. The Company and the Unions further recognize that current DOD and DOT regulations do not require the imposition of sanctions or disciplinary action against any employee to be found to be using drugs illegally. Accordingly, the Company further agrees that it will take no adverse action against such an employee, as a direct and immediate result of information obtained in a test applied under DOD or DOT regulation, other than to transfer the employee from a position that is subject to the regulations. In the event an employee sues the Union and/or the Company because of the enforcement or Company’s compliance with such regulations, the Union shall be held harmless by the Company.
The Company further agrees to notify the Unions if it enters into a contract with the DOD which includes the “Drug-Free Work Force” clause currently prescribed by DOD regulations or has positions which are subject to regulations under the DOT, and to submit in written form its proposal regarding any testing program. Upon; such notification, the Unions agree to enter into negotiations concerning the program. Should agreement not be reached within thirty days from such date of notification, the Company may implement the program only to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of the Drug-Free Work Force clause and applicable DOD/DOT regulations.

STANDING JOINT SUBCOMMITTEE ON TESTING

Mr. F. P. Possinger, President, System Council EM-3, IBEW
Gentlemen:
Re: Standing Joint Subcommittee on Testing
This will confirm our understanding reached during 1998 Bargaining that a CWA-IBEW-Lucent Technologies standing joint subcommittee on testing will be formed. The subcommittee, to be appointed by the bargaining chairs, will consist of four (4) representatives from the Unions, two (2) from IBEW and two (2) from CWA, and four (4) representatives from the Company.
Measurement and Selection Systems (M&SS), part of Lucent’s corporate human resources organization, is the organization with sole responsibility for the development or selection, validation, and authorization of all tests and policy and procedures used in the selection of candidates for Lucent occupational positions. M&SS is responsible to ensure that such tests meet Federal and professional standards for relevance and non-discrimination.
If the committee identifies a test currently in use which has not been authorized by M&SS, the test will be suspended pending the outcome of a review and report to the committee by M&SS.
At least thirty days prior to implementation, M&SS will notify the members Of the committee of the intent to implement a new test or to revise a test or critical test score. ..M&SS will communicate to members of the committee the following pertinent information concerning the test:
the purpose
the objective
the need for the test or change
the title(s) for which it will be a requirement
the business groups which will use it
After receiving the information described above, if the committee so requests, a meeting will be held to explore appropriate ways for the Company and the Unions to make available opportunities to assist employees in development of the new skills or job knowledge. The committee will also be expected to identify and recommend ways to maximize the many advantages and resources offered through the Alliance, ETOP, and ERC’s in meeting the goals described above.
In addition, the committee may explore other issues with M&SS, including such matters as an apparent low percentage of employees qualifying on a specific test. Where the Committee agrees, a Third Party Neutral (TPN) may be selected to review any disputed new or revised test for relevancy and validity, applying appropriate legal standards. The TPN shall guarantee confidentiality of all tests under review and shall not release test items or scores to any person or entity. The TPN shall make recommendations to the Committee about the disputed test or score. Nothing herein shall prevent the implementation or use of a test during the TPN review.
204
National Memorandum
The committee will meet upon request of the members, but no less than four (4) times a year to review new or revised tests.

National Memorandum
Attachment A
TECHNOLOGY CHANGE COMMITTEE
1	The Company and the Union recognize that technological changes in equipment, organization, or methods of operation have a tendency to affect job security and the nature of the work to be performed. The parties, therefore, will attempt to diminish or abolish the detrimental effects of any such technological change by creating a joint committee to be known as the Technology Change Committee to oversee problems and recommend solutions of problems in this area as set forth below.
(a)	Such Committee will consist of not more than six (6) representatives of the Company and not more than six (6) representatives of the Unions (3 CWA, 3 IBEW). Such committee may be convened at the option of either party at mutually agreeable times.
(b)	The purpose of the Committee is to provide for discussion of technological changes (including changes in equipment, organization, or methods or operation) which may affect employees represented by the Unions. The Company will notify the Unions at lease six (6) months in advance of planned technological changes.
Meetings of the Committee will be held as soon thereafter as can be mutually arranged. At such meetings, the Company will advise the Unions of its plans with respect to the introduction of such changes and will familiarize the Unions with the progress being made.
(c)	The impact and effect of such changes on the employees shall be appropriate matters for discussion. The Company will discuss with the Unions:
(1)	What steps might be taken to offer employment to employees affected:
(i)	In the same locality or other localities in jobs which may be available in occupations covered by the collective bargaining agreements between the parties.
(ii)	In other occupations in the Company not covered by the collective bargaining agreement.
(iii)	In other Lucent Companies or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries or entities.
(2)	The applicability of various Company programs and agreement provisions relating to force adjustment plans and procedures, including LCTOP, Reassignment Pay Protection Plan termination payments, retirement, transfer procedures and the like.
(3)	The feasibility of the Company providing training for other assignments for the employees affected. (Example: sponsorship of typing training on Company time).
(d)	The Committee shall not formulate policy or arrive at binding decisions or agreements, but rather shall be charged with the responsibility to develop facts and recommendations so that the Company can make well-informed decisions regarding the matters covered by these provisions.

SUBCONTRACTING SUBCOMMITTEE STRUCTURE AND GUIDELINES
During 1998 negotiations, the Company and the Unions expressed mutual concerns over the employment security of on-roll Lucent employees represented by the Unions and their desire to retain work traditionally performed by those employees. The parties also understood the Company’s need to maintain flexibility in making business decisions involving subcontracting of 1 work traditionally performed by represented employees and the potential that such decisions i may have a detrimental effect on the employment security of on-roll Lucent employees.
In recognition of these mutual concerns, the parties agree that a process should be developed to address these issues. Thus, it is agreed that the Unions will be provided, in advance, pertinent information such as, but not limited to, the economics, skills necessary to perform the work, and the impact such subcontracting may have on the employment security of on-roll Lucent employees. In addition, the Unions will be given an opportunity to discuss such matters relating to the Company’s intentions to subcontract work traditionally performed by members of the affected- bargaining unit. It is further agreed that any process cannot interfere with the Company’s right to make timely decisions consistent with the overall interests of the business, ' including the employment security of on-roll Lucent employees.
In an effort to reach a better understanding of this complex issue, the parties agree that it is in their mutual interest to establish appropriate subcommittee(s) for advanced information sharing and open and thorough discussion of matters involving subcontracting. The subcommittee(s) shall be established by the Business Group or Division, as appropriate. By January 1, 1999 or 90 days after ratification, which ever is longer, the specific composition of the subcommittee(s) ' shall be determined between the Company and the Union(s) at the appropriate plant, facility or geographical region.
Subcommittee Structure and Purpose
Subcontracting Subcommittees consisting of Union and Company representatives will be established at each factory location. For non-manufacturing locations, the Subcontracting i Subcommittee will be established within the organization or other appropriate mutually agreed upon groups.
The purpose of the subcommittee is to give the parties the opportunity to conduct open and thorough discussion concerning the Company’s intention to subcontract work presently performed by on-roll Lucent employees. The process each subcommittee will use to facilitate discussions will be determined by the subcommittee. Attached hereto is a form used by one location, which the parties recommend as a model. It is understood that in non-manufacturing organizations, other processes may be more appropriate.
Subcommittee Information Sharing Guidelines
Sharing information on the Company’s intention to subcontract should include the following:
•	Advance information
•	Economics
215
•	Skills necessary to do the work
® Impact subcontracting may have upon on-roll Lucent employees at the affected location(s)
•	Other pertinent information (e.g., time constraints, market opportunities, flexibility, other and viable alternatives)
Role of Workforce Relations
Corporate Workforce Relations will have final responsibility to assure that the Information Sharing Guidelines are followed. Workforce Relations will be notified of each intention to subcontract work presently performed by bargaining unit employees. Once notification is provided, the local subcommittee process described above may be initiated.
Any dispute that may arise as to whether the Information Sharing Guidelines have been followed shall be submitted to Corporate Workforce Relations for final resolution. Nothing contained herein is subject to the Grievance and Arbitration provision of the General Agreement.

EMPLOYEE RESOURCE CENTERS
The language contained in the attached document shall replace the existing language pertaining to Employee Resource Centers contained in all Manufacturing contracts that are supported by the 1998 National Manufacturing and National Units Table and shall be added to the Operations Agreements (CWA and IBEW).
222
EMPLOYEE RESOURCE CENTER PROGRAM
Purpose
1 Lucent Technologies, the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International ;	Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, System Council EM-3 (IBEW SC EM-3), and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, System Council T-3 (IBEW SC T-3) continue to recognize that, where practicable; the provision of certain services associated with employee training, career development, and various personnel and benefit programs should be made more readily available to employees in the manufacturing environment.
i	(a) In an effort to achieve this objective, Lucent Technologies and the Unions have agreed
to continue to support and fund Employee Resource Centers during the term of the 1	1998 Agreement.
(b)	Each Employee Resource Center will continue to represent strong physical evidence of the joint concern that Lucent Technologies and the Unions have for employees and their welfare, which is manifested by a shared commitment of the parties to jointly administer and staff the Centers.
(c)	Each Center will continue to augment services already provided by Lucent Technologies and serve as a means to centralize those information and service resources which most personally affect employees. The role of the Center is to assist employees in making decisions about future training and career plans, interfacing with various personnel programs and providing assistance and referral for employee benefit issues.
) Services
)	2 The Employee Resource Center will continue to provide services to employees which
'i	include the following:
education and training;
( i	-	career and personal counseling;
>	-	resource data for local area jobs and skills' required;
interface with Lucent Transfer Program and the Facility Closing Program;
assistance and referral concerning benefit programs;
other services arid counseling deemed to be appropriate by the local Joint Labor-Management Oversight Committee.
'	(a) It is recognized that certain services provided in the Center are provided for at the
location by the Alliance for Employee Growth and Development (Alliance), the Enhanced Training Opportunities Program (ETOP) or Lucent Technologies. It is not intended that such services be duplicated but rather that the Center will centralize and focus the services to facilitate access by employees.
223
(b)	Employees interested in visiting the Employee Resource Center will, upon request, normally be. granted reasonable time off with pay during their SCHEDULED DAILY TOUR to visit the Center. However the parties recognize that the job situation may require that such requests be accommodated at a time other than when initially requested.
(c)	In recognition of the parties' shared commitment to the joint administration of the Employee Resource Center, such Center' will be referred to as the "Lucent Technologies/ (“CWA”, “IBEW SC EM-3" or “IBEW SC T-3”) Employee Resource Center. This title shall be used in all references to this operation at the location and shall be prominently displayed at the entrance to the Employee Resource Center facility.
Staffing
3	Each Employee Resource Center will continue to be staffed by a mutually agreed upon number of COMPANY and UNION appointees. The appointment of Employee Resource Center personnel is a joint responsibility of the local Labor-Management Oversight Committee; however both the COMPANY and the UNION are free to select their own representatives.
(a) Represented employees appointed to work in the Center will retain the Occupational Job Classification and wages they were receiving immediately prior to that assignment.
(1)	If such an employee subsequently accepts a promotion to another Occupational Job Classification within the bargaining unit, he or she may be retained on the Employee Resource Center assignment. In such case, the employee will be assigned the Occupational Job Classification and wages which would have been applicable on the Occupational Job Classification to which promoted.
(2)	For movement of personnel purposes, such employees shall be exempt from displacement by surplus employees outside the Employee Resource Center but shall be subject to LAYOFF in accordance with the contract as a result of a lack of work situation in the bargaining unit.
(3)	In those instances where the employee would otherwise have been displaced, he or she shall be assigned the Occupational Job Classification and wages which would have been applicable as a result of such displacement.
Structure
4	The National Employee Resource Center Steering Committee established by Lucent Technologies and the Unions will continue to include two representatives each from the IBEW SC EM-3 and the CWA, and four Lucent Technologies representatives. The members of this Committee shall be appointed by the Chairpersons of the National Manufacturing Bargaining Committees for the CWA, IBEW SC EM-3 and Lucent Technologies. One additional representative’from CWA Operations and IBEW SC T-3 will be appointed by their respective chairs.
(a) The Joint National Steering Committee will continue to be responsible for the implementation, coordination and review of Employee Resource Center activities in Manufacturing, Operations, Repair and Distribution, Installation, OSC, Network Reliability Center and Cockeysville. The Committee's specific responsibilities will include:
determining at which locations an Employee Resource Center will be implemented;
224
o
1
1
establishing the timetable for implementation at designated locations;
determining the staffing level requirements for each Employee Resource Center;
4)	except those supporting repair and distribution and material distribution center
locations which shall be determined by the National Joint Labor-Management
i	Oversight Committee established in paragraph 4(b),
1	-	managing available funds including authorizing the distribution of such funds to
।	cover applicable costs at locations with Employee Resource Centers;
:	-	overseeing the services and activities provided by the individual Employee
Resource Centers.
(b)	At each location having an Employee Resource Center, a local Joint Labor-Managemerit Oversight Committee comprised of an equal number of COMPANY and UNION members will be established. For repair and distribution and material distribution center locations, a National Joint Labor-Management Oversight Committee comprised of one CWA and one IBEW System Council T-3 and two Lucent Technologies members shall be established. These committees will coordinate Alliance and ETOP activities at the local/national level and be responsible for the implementation, staffing and administration of the local Employee Resource Center.
Funding the Employee Resource Center
5 The cost of constructing an Employee Resource Center and all ongoing tenant expenses shall continue to be the responsibility of the COMPANY.
(a) The COMPANY will be responsible for the pay and related expenses of those management designated employees who are assigned to work in the Employee Resource Center.
'	(b) For the period May 31, 1998 through May 31, 2003, inclusive, Lucent Technologies
and the Unions agree funds will be made available each month for the Employee.
;	Resource Center Program which shall be calculated by multiplying the total number of
regular full time IBEW SC EM-3, IBEW SC T-3, and CWA Operations/Manufacturing represented employees on the payroll of the applicable facilities/organizations as of December 31, 1997 by $3.00 for all organizations except Installation, OSC, Network Reliability Center and Cockeysville where the applicable rate shall be $1.50. Annually thereafter, the National Employee Resource Center Steering Committee will review the funding level to determine if an increase in funding is warranted to ensure the efficient operation of the ERC's. If so determined, the funding level in subsequent years will be
;	increased back to the original 1992 level of $3.50. However, the rate for Installation,
OSC, Network Reliability Center and Cockeysville shall remain at $1.50. Lucent Technologies shall credit these funds to an account designated for the Program and its 1	activities within fifteen (15) days of the end of each such month.
(c)	Each location which has an Employee Resource Center will be periodically reimbursed from this account for the wages and expenses incurred by the represented employees assigned to work in the Employee Resource Center.
(d)	At the end of calendar years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002 funding balances in the Program's account which were accrued during any of those years will be carried forward into the ensuing year's account.
225
(e)	If, at the expiration of the 1998 Manufacturing and National Units National Memorandum of Understanding, the parties should not agree to continue the Employee Resource Center Program, all outstanding claims to monies on the books of the Program shall be settled and any remaining monies shall be disposed of in such a manner consistent with the purposes of the Program.
Reports
6 The Joint National Steering Committee will publish an Annual Report summarizing the status of Employee Resource Centers, the funds expended and the manner in which the funds were Utilized.

Effective May 31, 1992, for all employees on the active roll on or after that date, who were laid off and have been rehired by the Company and have prior periods of three (3) years or more 1	net credited service (which is eligible for recognition under the Lucent Technologies Pension
!	Plan upon completion of a three year bridge) that are not yet included in current net credited

1989 National Agreement Item
Attachment A
FOUR DAY WORK WEEK
The Union and the Company recognize that in certain administrative work units or work groups it may be beneficial to the employees and in the best interest of the business to establish a four day schedule as a normal work: week. Accordingly, where the parties involved agree, on a local basis, the number of hours which presently constitute a normal five day work week schedule will be scheduled in equal amounts over four consecutive days. No daily overtime payment shall be made for any of the hours worked which constitute the normal work week even though scheduled over four days. No differential payments for evening and night work shall be made unless some or all of the hours which would otherwise constitute a normal workday if scheduled over five days fall within the period of time for which such differential is paid, in which event differential payments shall be made in accordance with the agreement.
Subject to the above, and before local implementation of a four day schedule in any work group, the Company and the Union, at the National Level will establish the parameters and implementation procedures for such four day work week.

TREATMENT OF LAID OFF EMPLOYEES
June 1,1986
THE IBEW NATIONAL BARGAINING COMMITTEE
Washington, D.C.
Gentlemen:
This will confirm our understanding of June 1, 1986, concerning the treatment to be afforded an employee who has been identified for LAYOFF and on the effective date of such LAYOFF is absent due to a sickness or accident disability.
1.	If such an employee is not on the Sickness Disability Benefit roll or the Accident Disability Benefit roil as of the effective date of LAYOFF, (s)he will be terminated as LAID OFF as of that date.
2.	If such an employee is on either the Sickness Disability Benefit roll or the Accident Disability Benefit roll as of the effective date of LAYOFF, the employee will remain on the Company roll, and except as provided in Paragraph 2.1, will be LAID OFF when and if (s)he is found fit to return to work prior to the expiration of benefits. For recall purposes, the employee's TERM OF EMPLOYMENT as of the originally scheduled LAYOFF date shall apply.
2.1	If the employee has a service bridging anniversary during the Sickness or Accident Disability Benefit absence and if the employee's revised TERM OF EMPLOYMENT would have protected him/her from LAYOFF, then the employee will be retained on the roll after being found fit to return to work.

Gentlemen:
Re: Medical Disagreements re Employee's Ability to Return to Work
This will confirm bur understanding of today regarding the disposition of the Unions' demand at the Manufacturing and National Units Table to establish a third party doctor routine for all medical disagreements between an employee's personal doctor and a Company doctor concerning ability to work.
The Company and the Unions recognize that these types of disagreements between professionals in the medical community have at times been the basis for disputes among the parties at the local level. Therefore, we have agreed that the process for resolving such disagreements should be addressed at the local bargaining tables where the problem may exist.

SUBCONTRACTING - MANUFACTURING AND NATIONAL UNITS
May 27, 1995
Mr. R. J. Allen, Assistant to the Vice President, CWA
Mr. E. A. Keller, President, System Council EM-3, IBEW
During 1995 negotiations, the Company and the Unions expressed mutual concerns over the employment security of on-roll AT&T employees represented by the Unions and their desire to retain work traditionally performed by those employees. The parties also understood the Company’s need to maintain flexibility in making business decisions involving subcontracting of work traditionally performed by represented employees and the potential that such decisions may have a detrimental effect on the employment security of on-roll AT&T employees.
In recognition of these mutual concerns and the parties mutual commitment to Work Place of the Future, the parties agree that a process should be developed to address these issues. Thus, it is agreed that the Unions will be provided, in advance where practicable, pertinent information such as, but not limited to, the economics, skills necessary to perform the work, and the impact such subcontracting may have on the employment security of on-roll AT&T employees. In addition the Unions, will be given an opportunity to discuss such matters relating to the Company’s intentions to subcontract work traditionally performed by members of the affected bargaining unit to other than AT&T locations.
Therefore, it is agreed that these mutual concerns and interests for the Manufacturing Bargaining Units are better addressed at the Manufacturing and National Units Table, where process guidelines may be fully discussed and developed for implementation by the respective Business Unit Planning Council(s) or by the Business Unit(s), as appropriate. It is further agreed that any process cannot interfere with the Company’s right to make timely decisions consistent with the overall interests of the business, including the employment security of on-roll AT&T employees.

1	This Memorandum of Agreement, and any supplements or attachments hereto, hereinafter referred to collectively as “Agreement,” shall be binding on the parties hereto. It is further agreed that the new microelectronics company (Agere Systems, Inc.) and any other “spinoff’ of Lucent or the new microelectronics company shall be bound by the 1998 National Memorandum of Understanding and the applicable local collective bargaining agreements by and between Lucent and the Union throughout their term.

3	This Agreement sets forth the understandings reached as to the following:
(a)	the treatment to be afforded eligible employees in a production and maintenance and/or salaried bargaining unit represented by the Union when a decision by the Company to subcontract or outsource work performed by bargaining unit employees, or work that is or has been traditionally performed by bargaining unit employees, directly results in the layoff, termination or separation of employees in the bargaining unit.

Manufacturing and National Units
Supplement
4	A new provision shall be added to the applicable collective bargaining agreement(s) titled “Application of LCTOP (dr applicable successor plan) in ,the Event of Subcontracting or Outsourcing Directly Resulting in Surplus Conditions.” The provision shall read:
“In the event the Company decides to subcontract or outsource any work performed by production and maintenance and/or salaried bargaining unit employees, or work that is, or has been traditionally performed by production and maintenance and/or salaried bargaining unit employees and such decision, directly causes a surplus condition resulting in a layoff of employees with a term of employment of two or more years within the affected bargaining unit, the Company shall, to the extent necessary to relieve the surplus, offer to eligible employees in the affected universe the full range of options provided for under the parties’ LCTOP Agreement. It is further agreed that, in the event the provision set forth herein is triggered, the $30,500 limit set forth in paragraphs (2)(d), Optional Termination Pay in the Lucent Career Transition Option Program, and 3(b), Extended Compensation Option, of the 1998 National Memorandum shall be increased to $40,000. The Company may, in its discretion, extend the application of this paragraph beyond the normal surplus universe.
It is understood and agreed by the parties that employees who elect to receive benefits described under this provision shall not be eligible for recall, termination allowances under the collective bargaining agreement or benefits otherwise provided by application of the provision titled “Treatment of Employees Directly Impacted by the Company’s Decision to Subcontract or Outsource Bargaining Unit Work - Application of Certain Employee Benefit Plans and Programs.”
5	A new provision shall be added to the applicable collective bargaining agreement(s) titled “Treatment of Employees Directly Impacted by the Company’s Decision to Subcontract or Outsource Bargaining Unit Work - Application of Certain Employee Benefit Plans and Programs.” The provision shall read:
“In the event the Company decides to subcontract or outsource bargaining unit work or to accomplish such subcontracting or outsourcing through any form of business transaction, including but not limited to lease arrangements or similar transactions, that effectively constitute subcontracting or outsourcing, each employee who is laid off, involuntarily terminated or involuntarily separated from the Company as a direct result of a decision by the Company to subcontract or outsource, and who has a term of employment of two (2) or more years (hereinafter “Affected Employees”), shall, iri addition to any other rights or benefits set forth in the collective bargaining agreement (unless specifically stated to the contrary herein), receive the benefits set forth in this Paragraph 5.
“Affected Employees” include employees at the affected facilities with a term of employment of two (2) or more years who are on an approved leave of absence, disability benefits or accident/worker’s compensation benefits on the date their employment would have ended had they been actively employed if and when they present themselves for employment at or before the end of the approved leave, or are certified as fit to return to work under the applicable plan and present themselves for employment, as'applicable.
(a)	Five Year Enhanced Transition Leave of Absence Under the Lucent Technologies Inc. Pension Plan. The Pension Plan shall be amended to provide that Affected Employees who, as of the day their- employment with the Company ends, have not met the eligibility requirements for a service pension and are within five (5) years of the age and/or service requirement for attaining service pension eligibility, shall, on the day their employment with the Company ends, be eligible for an enhanced eligibility provision (the “Enhanced TLA”). Under the Enhanced TLA, such employees will be credited with up to five (5) years of age and/or service, to the extent necessary to obtain service pension eligibility. Such credit shall be extended as of the
267
Manufacturing and National Units
Supplement
Affected Employee’s off-roll date and the pension benefit may be commenced immediately. The additional age and service credit will not be counted for the purposes of computing the employee^ pension. The additional age and service credit will be counted and applied for purposes of reducing the discount for early retirement for all Affected Employees. It is the intent of the parties that the addition of five .(5) years of age and/or service may be used by an Affected Employee not only to attain eligibility for a service pension as set forth above, but to reduce, to the maximum extent possible by adding five (5) years of age and/or service, any discount for early retirement that may have otherwise applied to such Affected Employee.
Neither the Company nor the applicable pension plan may reduce or eliminate an Affected Employee’s entitlements to the rights set forth in Paragraph 5 (a).
(b)	Expanded and Enhanced Social Security Supplement. The Pension Plan shall be amended to extend a Social Security supplement to the Affected Employees who are service pension eligible when their employment with the Company ends (including those who are service pension eligible as a result of the Enhanced TLA), and whose service pension is subject to a discount for early retirerhent. The amount of the Social Security supplement shall equal the amount of the reduction in the employee’s monthly pension annuity payment because of retirement prior to age 55. Social Security supplement payments will continue until the first to occur of the attainment of age 62 or death of the retired employee. All other provisions of the existing Social Security supplement provided under the Pension Plan apply.
(c)	Special Pension Benefit. The Pension Plan shall be amended to provide a special pension benefit (“SPB”) for the Affected Employees in addition to ariy other accrued benefit. The SPB also applies to Affected Employees who have not yet reached age 21, even though they are not otherwise eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. The amount of the SPB shall be equal to a percentage of Eligible Annual Pay, computed in accordance with the Schedule of SPB Benefits below. The Affected Employee’s service will be determined at the time the employee is no, longer employed by the Company. Eligible Annual Pay shall be determined as of the first of the month in which the off-roll date occurs, unless Lucent elects a date one month earlier to facilitate the faster payment of the SPB. Eligible Annual Pay shall be determined in accordance with the description below.
With respect to Affected Employees who are service pension eligible (after application of the Enhanced TLA), or whose entire benefit under the Pension Plan is otherwise immediately distributable, the SPB shall be available in the form of a lump sum or in any other form of benefit so long as such other form is the same form selected for the immediately distributable benefit under the Pension Plan. With respect to other Affected Employees, the SPB shall be available in the form of a lump sum, a single life annuity or a joint and 50% surviving spouse annuity. In all cases, the form of benefit shall be subject to the normal spousal consent requirements of the Pension Plan. The SPB may be commenced, at the election of the employee, at any time beginning as soon as administratively practicable after employment with the Company ends, and until distribution is required to commence. However, if the present value of the SPB and all other accrued benefits under the Pension Plan (determined in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 417(e)) does not exceed the amount (currently $5,000) permitted to be distributed without consent under Internal Revenue Code Section 411(a)(T1), or any successor provision, such present value shall be distributed in a lump sum.
If distribution of the SPB is deferred, the amount of the SPB shall bear interest equal to the average yield on 10-year Treasury bills for August of the preceding calendar year,
268
Manufacturing and National Units
Supplement
determined in accordance with IRS guidelines. Interest shall be credited at the end of each plan year except that in the case of a distribution during the year, interest shall be credited through the end of the month preceding the annuity starting date.
For purposes of the SPB, Eligible Annual Pay shall be equal to an employees annualized weekly rate of pay, based on his or her Adjusted Rate plus applicable Night Work and 7-Day Coverage Bonuses in effect as of the date specified for the calculation of the affected Employee’s SPB with a minimum, for other than a part-time employee, equal to four (4) of the employee’s Scheduled Daily Tours per week. In no event shall the SPB for any Affected Employees be less than 110% of the termination allowance that the Affected Employees would have been eligible for under the applicable collective bargaining agreement if laid off.
When an employee’s Standard Rate has been reduced and the effective date of such reduction falls within the twenty-six (26) week period preceding the date specified for the calculation of the affected employee’s SPB, the. Standard Rate used shall be that in effect immediately preceding the reduction from the highest standard rate which was effective within such twenty-six (26) Week period, if it is' higher than the Standard Rate in effect as of the date specified for the calculation of the affected Employee’s SPB. Any decrease in an employee’s Standard Rate immediately following a temporary increase which was in effect for a period not to exceed eight (8) weeks shall not be considered a “reduction” when applying this paragraph.
Neither the Company nor the applicable pension plan may reduce or eliminate the SPB of an Affected Employee.
Any term not defined in this Memorandum of Agreement shall have the meaning set forth in Article 3 of the applicable collective bargaining agreements dated as of May 31, 1998 between the Company and the Union.
It is understood that employees who receive the treatment described in this subparagraph 5(c) are not eligible for recall, termination allowances • under the collective bargaining agreement, or any provisions of the Lucent Career Transition Option Program. Duplicate payments of the SPB and termination allowance are not intended or permitted.
The parties also agree that nothing in this Agreement or in this provision is intended to deprive an otherwise eligible employee of termination allowance that is otherwise payable under the collective bargaining agreement in circumstances where this Agreement does not apply.

The parties agree that such payment will normally be paid within 30 days of the employee’s date of termination but in no event later than 60 days of such termination date.
Before making a decision to subcontract or outsource bargaining unit work at a manufacturing location(s), the Company may amend the Pension Plan to provide an enhanced pension benefit for Affected Employees at such manufacturing location(s), in addition to any other accrued benefit (including the Special Pension Benefit). Such enhanced pension benefit shall be payable, at the election of the Affected Employee, in a lump sum with ah immediate present value equal to $11,000, and shall be subject to terms and conditions otherwise identical to the Special Pension Benefit described under Paragraph 5(c) above. An Affected Employee who receives such enhanced pension benefit shall not be eligible to receive the special one-time lump sum transition payment, as described in the first subparagraph of this Paragraph 5(d).
(e)	Extended Benefit Coverage for Affected Employees. The Company’s retiree medical, dental and life insurance plans shall be amended to the extent necessary to provide that an Affected Employee who becomes eligible for a service pension under the enhanced TLA will also become immediately eligible for retiree medical, dental and life insurance benefits. In addition:
(1)	An Affected Employee who is not service pension eligible, who is offered employment by the company to which Lucent is subcontracting or outsourcing and who accepts such offer within 30 days and commences employment on the date designated by the new employer shall be- eligible to receive a one-time payment in an amount equal to the employee’s monthly premium under the other company’s medical, dental and vision plans (on a family basis) at the time such employment commences multiplied by 12.

The Company and the Union acknowledge that, under current law, the subcontracting or outsourcing arrangement may not constitute a distribution event permitting distribution. of the LTSSP account balances of those Affected Employees who are employed by a new company. As a result such account balances may continue to be held in the LTSSP. The Company agrees that such Affected Employees shall have access to in-service withdrawals and loans as if they remained employed by the Company, except that loan payments rnust be made by coupon payments rather than payroll deduction. If the Company determines that the law has changed so as to permit distribution of the LTSSP account balances, the Company shall take such steps as are necessary to permit Affected Employees to elect a distribution, unless such account balance does not exceed the amount (currently $5,000) permitted to be distributed without consent under the Internal Revenue Code Section 411(a)(11), or any successor provision, in which event such account balances shall be distributed in a lump sum.

The parties agree, however, that the Company (or any spinoff thereof) shall not be required to be successful in such good faith efforts and that the Union shall have no right, under this paragraph, to require that any such sale of the

Company business include a provision relating to the adoption of this Agreement as a condition of such sale except to the extent required by law.”
7	A new provision shall be added to the applicable collective bargaining agreements titled “Subcontracting and Outsourcing of Production or Salaried Graded Work - Notification to Union.” The provision shall read:
“Subcontracting and Outsourcing of Production or Salaried Graded Work -Notification to the Union. The Company shall not subcontract or outsource any production or salaried graded work performed by the bargaining unit employees, or work that is, or has been, traditionally performed by bargaining unit employees, unless all of the following conditions have been satisfied.
(1)	Prior to any decision to subcontract or outsource bargaining unit work, the Company will provide the Union with written notice that it intends to consider.the use of subcontracting and outsourcing. This notification by the Company will be given at an early stage of its consideration of any potential subcontracting or outsourcing but substantially before any final decision is made to subcontract or outsource bargaining unit work. The purpose of this notice will be to engage the Union in meaningful discussion concerning the possibility of such subcontracting or outsourcing, and to examine any proposals by the Union that will maintain the work and job. security of bargaining unit members. The parties recognize that in a competitive environment the Company must have the ability to make timely decisions consistent with the overall interests of the business, including the employment security of on-roll Company employees.
(2)	The Company will share all information that is relevant to the subcontracting or outsourcing of production or salaried graded work. In addition, the Company agrees to meet with the Union on a regular basis to engage in dialogue prior to making a final decision to subcontract or outsource the production or salaried graded work.
(3)	No final decision by the Company to subcontract or outsource any production or salaried graded work performed by bargaining unit employees, or .work that is, or has been, traditionally performed by bargaining unit employees, shall be made until after the Union has been notified in writing of the Company’s decision or, in any event, prior to the Company’s compliance with the provisions of subparagraphs (1) and (2).
(4)	The notification, commitment to dialogue and exchange of information provisions set forth in subparagraphs (1) through (3) above shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, the responsibility and obligation of the Company under the parties’ Workplace of the Future Agreement (or its applicable successor agreement) and any other relevant provisions set forth in the collective bargaining agreement related to subcontracting or outsourcing of production work or salaried graded work. The commitments set forth in subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) do not alter or otherwise modify the provisions in the collective bargaining agreement relating to subcontracting or outsourcing of work performed by Trades personnel.
(5)	The provisions of these subparagraphs (1) through (4) shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure and the National Grievance Step outlined in Article 6, and will not be subject to the provisions of Article 7 (Arbitration) of the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Instead, when alleged violations of this “Notification to the Union” procedure occur, the dispute resolution process set forth below will apply:
(a)	The Union may file a grievance directly with the bargaining agent who shall have five (5) days to discuss and resolve the grievance. Should the grievance not be
Manufacturing and National Units
Supplement
resolved within five (5) days, the Union may request, in writing, that the grievance be submitted to a neutral third party, selected from a list of neutrals previously agreed upon by the parties.
(b)	The parties shall schedule a hearing with the neutral third party within ten (10) days of the Union’s request. At the hearing with the neutral third party, the Union shall present its case concerning why the “Notification to the Union” procedures set forth in this provision were violated, and the Company shall present its case in defense. In order to expedite the hearing and decisional process, no transcript of the hearing shall be required. Each party may be represented by legal counsel. Post-hearing briefs shall not be permitted. Each party shall present its entire case at the hearing.
(c)	The neutral third party shall issue a written decision within ten (10) days of the hearing. The written decision will settle the grievance at issue, but will not constitute a precedent in any other case. No written opinion will be prepared unless specifically requested by both parties, in which case such opinion will follow within thirty (30) days thereafter.
(d)	The parties agree that the issue to be determined by the neutral third party under this special resolution process is limited to whether the Company violated the “Notification to the Union” provisions set forth in this provision. The neutral third party shall not, under this process, be empowered to determine issues relating to whether the Company has a right to subcontract or outsource bargaining unit work. Any issues that arise, between the parties relating to whether the Company has a right to subcontract or outsource bargaining unit work are reserved for resolution through the traditional grievance process set forth in the agreement under Articles 6 and 7, it being understood that each party is permitted to raise any appropriate claims or defenses, including arbitrability.
This limitation on the authority of the neutral third party under this special procedure shall not, however, limit the neutral third party, in any manner, from imposing any reasonable or traditional remedy, as part of his/her award, against the Company, in the event a violation of this Article is found to have occurred. Such remedies may include, but not be limited to, an order that all subcontracting or outsourcing at issue be stopped until the Company has complied with the provisions set forth in this article. Any back pay award shall be limited to a period not to exceed one hundred and twenty (120) days.
8	Continuation of “Consultant Arrangement” by and between the Company and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The parties agree that the terms, provisions and commitments set forth in the attached transaction letter by and between the Company and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers are incorporated herein by reference. The letter is titled “Sale of a Business or Spin-off of a Business - Notification to the Union.”
9	Employment Opportunities for Bargaining Unit Employees at Columbus Works and Oklahoma City Works. Because of special circumstances relating to employees in the bargaining units at the Columbus Works and the .Oklahoma City Works, the parties agree that the commitment(s) set forth in the attached letter shall apply.
10	The Union agrees to request in writing the immediate withdrawal of the unfair labor practice charges, Case Nos. 6-CA-30583 (formerly 4-CA-28196) and 6-CA-31076 (formerly 4-CA-28858), pending with the National Labor Relations Board. The Union further agrees that this Agreement will not be effective until the National Labor Relations Board notifies the

Supplement
parties that the above-referenced charges are dismissed. The Union agrees it shall not file any further unfair labor practice charge with respect to or arising out of the facts giving rise to the charges specified above. In addition, the Company and the Union shall promptly form a Joint National Committee to review any national or local grievances that are pending relating to “subcontracting/outsourcing of bargaining unit work.” The parties agree that the objective of the Committee shall be to define any such grievances that were filed to protect the Union’s interests as a result of the pendency of the NLRB case and that such grievances shall be construed, under this Memorandum of Agreement, as resolved. The parties also understand that' some local grievances may be pending that pre-date or are distinguishable from the underlying circumstances relating to the NLRB case and this commitment is not intended to affect the pendency or viability of such grievances.
11	The parties agree that this Memorandum of Agreement will supplement the existing 1998 National Memorandum of Understanding between the parties, as well as the applicable local collective bargaining agreements, the terms of which shall remain in full force and effect, as supplemented by the provisions set forth herein.
Subject to the National Labor Relations Board’s dismissal of the unfair labor practice charges referenced in paragraph 10 above, and subject to approval of this Agreement by the IBEW System Council EM-3, the understandings set forth herein shall become effective as the date of the execution of this Agreement. Except as modified herein, the existing terms and conditions of the 1998 National Memorandum of Understanding and the applicable collective bargaining agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with their original terms.

SALE OF A BUSINESS OR SPIN OFF OF A BUSINESS -NOTIFICATION TO THE UNION
I General
In the event that Lucent considers a closing, sale, spinoff or other disposition to any third party firm or entity of any business (or any part thereof, hereafter called the “business” ) having a bargaining unit represented by the IBEW System Council EM-3, and the proposed course of action directly results in the layoff or termination of employees in the bargaining unit, the Company will provide the IBEW with written notification of its proposed course of action, will provide the IBEW with pertinent information to explain the reasons for the proposed course of action, and will make available knowledgeable personnel to discuss the proposal in detail. It is the intent of the parties that there be an education and information sharing' process as a prelude to a, substantive discussion wherein the IBEW will have a meaningful opportunity to offer alternatives to the proposed course of action, and that such alternatives will be considered by the Company before the decision is made final.
II	Business Disposition
In the case of any proposed sale of a business in which bargaining unit employees represented by the IBEW are employed, and which directly results in the layoff or termination of employees in the bargaining unit, the Company will provide the IBEW the opportunity to organize a transaction to purchase the business. The process will begin with the Company providing the IBEW with written notification of a proposal to sell a business, which notification will be provided sufficiently in advance of the Company’s solicitation of external bids so that the IBEW can determine whether to organize a transaction to purchase the business. If the IBEW wishes to pursue such a transaction, it will deliver to the Company written notification of its intention to do so within 10 days after the receipt of written notice of the proposed sale. Thereafter, the parties will form a Committee pursuant to the Labor-Management Cooperation Act of 1978 to assess the feasibility of a purchase transaction, and will engage in the information sharing process set forth below.
(a)	The Committee will be empowered to retain financial advisors to assist the parties during the information sharing process and/or any purchase proposal made by the IBEW, and the Company agrees to pay a reasonable fee for the financial advisors in an amount to be agreed to by the parties when the financial advisors are retained.
(b)	Should the IBEW seek to introduce any entities or firms into the proposed transaction, the Union will inform the Company of the identity of those firms within 5 days after the IBEW commences discussions with the entity or firm. The purpose for this notification is to permit the Company to screen prospective purchasers, and to inform the IBEW of the acceptability of any proposed purchaser.
(c)	The Company will make available to the IBEW, to any financial advisors retained pursuant to Section II (a) above, and to any acceptable business partner of the IBEW in a proposed purchase of a business the pertinent documentation (including but not limited to financial information) supporting the proposal to sell the business. Additionally, the Company will make available knowledgeable personnel to discuss the proposed sale, and/or the supporting documentation.
277
Manufacturing and National Units
Supplement
(d)	Upon expiration of ten (10) days from the time the IBEW is notified of a proposed sale transaction, the Company may solicit bid proposals from external sources. The Company reserves the right to establish reasonable time limits for the bidding process, which time limits shall apply to all bidders (including the IBEW) submitting proposals.
(e)	Should the Company seek and obtain proposals from external sources, it is agreed that the IBEW will be informed of the general nature of the proposals , but will not be told the identity of the bidder(s). The purpose for this information sharing is to enable the IBEW to provide input to the Company on the bid proposals, from a business perspective and from a Collective Bargaining Agreement perspective , while maintaining the integrity of the bid proposal process.
(f)	If the Company selects a proposal other than that submitted by the IBEW (including any of the IBEW’s acceptable partners), the Company will inform the IBEW of the selection arid will furnish it with a summary of the bids in order to'provide the IBEW with one opportunity to improve its previous bid. The IBEW will have 5 days to respond to the Corripany, and thereafter the Company shall, in its discretion, make its final decision on the proposal(s) for the purchase of the business.
(g)	The parties recognize that as part of the process set forth herein, the IBEW and any of its acceptable business partners and/or financial advisors will have access to propriety and confidential business and strategic information.which, if revealed to anyone, could cause significant and irreparable harm to the Company. Accordingly, the information process described herein is conditioned upon the execution of binding non-disclosure agreements in favor of the Company by. anyone participating in the foregoing information sharing process. If any person refuses to execute the non-disclosure agreement, this information sharing process will not apply.
(h)	The parties agree that, in the event the IBEW declines to offer a proposed transaction as set forth herein, the IBEW shall, nevertheless, be given all information concerning the bidding process that it would have received under these provisions and be kept informed of all developments and decisions by the Company during this process.
Ill	Applicability
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the foregoing provisions of this section will not apply to proposed transactions within the Company or between the Company and one or more of its subsidiaries or between two of such subsidiaries.
