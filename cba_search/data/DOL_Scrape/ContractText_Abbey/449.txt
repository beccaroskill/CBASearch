Section 2.	Family and Medical Leave
It is the Company’s and Union’s intention that the leave policy set forth in this article comply in all respects with the Family and Medical Leave Act. Leaves of Absence without pay granted under this Section shall be in one of the following categories.
A.	Leave of Absence due to employee illness or accident. Regular employees whose illness or injury requires that they be absent from work are entitled to a Leave of Absence up to 12 workweeks. A medical certification shall be required to obtain or extend a medical Leave of Absence. An employee returning from a Leave of Absence for the employee’s illness or injury shall be required to furnish a fitness for duty statement prior to assuming his/her job duties.

Section 3.	Accident and Sickness Benefit Plan
A.	Effective with the first payroll period beginning three months after ratification, the Company agrees to provide accident and sickness benefits for all regular employees on a non-contributory basis, provided, however, the Company reserves the right to change insurance carriers or to establish other arrangements for accident and sickness benefits, so long as it maintains all present benefit practices, except scheduled benefits. The provisions of the Accident and Sickness Benefits Plan shall govern in all matters pertaining to accident and sickness benefits.
1.	Any eligible employee receiving benefits under a previous plan on the effective date will continue to receive benefits under that plan until either of the following first occurs:
28
a)	exhaustion of benefits
b)	the employee returns to work on his/her regular work schedule.
2.	To be a participant covered by the A&S Benefit Plan an employee must:
a)	complete 90 calendar days of employment not counting time lost for illness, injury, or employee initiated non-paid absence.
b)	be a regular full-time (scheduled to work 40 hours per week) or regular part-time (scheduled to work at least twenty hours per week).
B.	Employees qualify for STD benefits when they are participants who cannot work at their usual job due to an illness or injury incurred, either on or off the job; and satisfy the requirements as outlined in this Article.
C.	STD benefits begin on the first day of illness or injury for participants who miss consecutive workdays for a period of at least their regular workweek. STD benefits for occupational illness/injury begin on the first day of illness/injury.
1.	Written medical certification will be required for any STD qualifying absence. Absences of a shorter duration will be considered as incidental absence (see “Paid Days Off Program”) and not a part of STD. At the Company’s discretion, medical certification, including an IME, may be required for such absences.
2.	The employee is solely responsible for providing medical certification when requested by the Company. The Company may, at its own expense, require a subsequent evaluation or second opinion(s).
D.	Employees do not qualify for STD benefits if:
1.	they engage in any activity which is inconsistent with the application for STD.
2.	the physician or counselor is not licensed by the state where treatment is received.
3.	cosmetic surgery is performed except when medically necessary.
4.	they refuse restricted or temporary alternate (light) duty assignments that are in compliance with work restrictions while receiving STD benefits; or
5.	the illness or injury is caused by armed conflict, results from committing a felony or attempted felony, occurs while engaging in an illegal activity, or is intentionally self-inflicted.
E.	If employment is involuntarily terminated due to reasons including but not limited to reduction in work force, resolution of a Workers’ Compensation claim, plant/office closure, etc., while the employee is receiving STD benefits, the employee may continue to receive benefits until either the benefits are exhausted or the employee’s doctor (or the IME doctor) states the employee can return to work. If employment is involuntarily terminated for just cause, STD benefits may be terminated immediately.
1.	Other company benefits will cease as provided by each program. The Company may suspend or deny STD benefits if the employee fails to submit all forms/documentation as required, or if the employee does not comply with a Company request for an IME.
29
2.	Failure to qualify for STD benefits does not preclude application for unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA).
F.	An employee may become or remain eligible for temporary restricted STD Benefits for a partial schedule if the certifying physician’s opinion, or an IME physician’s opinion, indicates a return to work in a temporary restricted duty capacity is permissible and the Company is able to accommodate the restrictions. Temporary restricted schedule STD benefits are paid when an employee misses portions of a workday or works a shortened workweek (partial schedule) due to illness or injury incurred on or off the job. The physician must state that the partial schedule will be temporary - no more than 90 days.
1.	The restricted duty schedule must be consistent with the business unit’s permitted schedules. The duration of the temporary restricted schedule will be at the Company’s discretion, but in no case will it be longer than 90 days.
G Employees released to a full work schedule with work restrictions may be allowed to perform temporary alternate (light) duty assignments at the Company’s discretion. Light duty assignments are permitted provided there is meaningful business unit work available to be performed which does not violate the stated medical restrictions; and the prognosis from the treating physician (or IME) clearly indicates the employee will be able to return to his/her normal job duties within ninety (90) calendar days from the initiation date of light duty.
H.	Application for non-occupational injury/illness related STD benefits must be submitted on properly completed Company forms and must be signed as directed. The forms will require a physician’s written certification of inability to work to include the specific diagnosis, prognosis, expected date of return and any work restrictions which may apply.
1.	The Company may suspend or deny STD benefits if proper certification is not received within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the forms are provided to the employee.
2.	When foreseeable, requests for absences should be submitted at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the planned absence. In all cases, required forms should be returned as far in advance as possible.
I.	Independent Medical Examination
The Company may, at its own expense, require an independent medical examination (IME) and certification by a second physician at anytime during an illness/injury period. If the IME physician’s determination does not support the need for time away from work, the pay for incidental absence or STD benefits will cease.
A third opinion may be requested by the employee at their own expense to resolve the conflict of opinion. The third examination and certification must be performed by a physician mutually agreeable to the Company and the employee. The third opinion is final and binding. If the results support the initial certification, pay for incidental absence and/or STD benefits will be reinstated retroactively and the Company will assume responsibility for the payment of the third opinion.
When there is evidence of fraudulent activity/abuse related to the illness/injury absence, pay for incidental absence or STD benefits may be suspended while an IME is pending. An employee’s failure to cooperate or to maintain scheduled appointments for a second or third opinion will result in the suspension of pay for incidental absence or STD benefits.
30
If the initial disability qualification is not sustained by the second or third opinion, the employee must return to work unless qualified for an unpaid FMLA leave. Failure to return to work other than while on FMLA leave will result in termination for job abandonment.
As a condition of this STD Policy, employees must give their consent for their treating doctor to provide information about their condition to the Company or to an IME doctor.
J.	Benefits may be paid up to a maximum of fifty-two (52) weeks. The amount of pay (half or full pay benefits) is a percentage of “base salary”. Base salary for the purpose of determining the appropriate STD benefit will be based on the rate of pay in effect on the last regular scheduled workday prior to cessation of active work. Base salary does not include incentive compensation, overtime, shift differential or other special payments or calculations.
1.	The STD benefit is either fifty percent (50%) or one hundred percent (100%) of base salary. The percentage paid is based on the length of service with the Company. An employee’s service anniversary date determines the timeframe for which an employee can receive benefits. The following STD benefit payment schedule is based on completed years of service as determined by the employee’s system anniversary date.
2.	A higher level of benefits does not take place if an employment anniversary occurs before the employee works thirteen (13) consecutive weeks after any STD benefit usage.
If your service is:	Benefits are 100%	Benefits are 50% of
	Of Base Salary For:	Base Salary for:
Less than 91 calendar days	0 weeks	0 weeks
91 days but <1 year	1 week	12 weeks
1 year but <5 years	5 weeks	47 weeks
5 years but <10 years	13 weeks	39 weeks
10 years but <15 years	26 weeks	26 weeks
15 years but <20 years	39 weeks	13 weeks
20 years but <25 years	47 weeks	5 weeks
25 years or more	52 weeks	0 weeks
3.	STD benefits cease when either the employee is released to return to work or benefits exhaust.
K.	For time lost on account of occupational accidents, the Company shall pay the employee the difference between the payments received under Workers’ Compensation and the benefits as provided by the provisions of the Accident & Sickness Benefits Plan. The employee will receive his/her basic rate of pay in accordance with the schedule provided in this Article. In certain circumstances the employee may be required to endorse his/her Workers’ Compensation insurance payment check over to the Company.
L.	Overpayments occur when the employee is paid more STD benefits than they are entitled to receive. The Company will recover overpayments by offsets against future payments or any other method permitted by applicable law.
M.	Paid Days Off Programs
Incidental absence is defined as a non-occupational personal illness/injury absence prior to eligibility or qualification for STD benefits. Payment for such absence prior to eligibility or qualification for STD benefits is at the
31
employee’s base rate of pay and is available for up to a maximum of consecutive workdays for a period of the normally or regularly scheduled workweek, per personal non-occupational illness/injury. (For example, incidental absence will be paid up to a maximum of five consecutive work days for an employee who is normally or regularly scheduled to work the standard five day workweek).
All other programs or policies, including but not limited to occasional sick time, departmental sick time, etc., previously provided, are terminated on the effective date of this policy.
N.	Coordination with other Benefits - STD benefits are coordinated with any Workers’ Compensation benefits and with Social Security Disability for wage replacement. The employee receives the maximum benefit payment available under either this policy or Workers’ Compensation and/or Social Security Disability, but no greater than 100% of base salary.
O.	When non-occupational illness or injury keeps an employee from working at his/her regular work schedule after a return from an STD benefit period, further benefits are paid as shown:
IF..................... THEN............................................
An employee returns to work on his/her	STD benefits begin immediately at the benefit
regular work schedule for less than	level which applied when the employee returned
thirteen (13) continuous weeks.... to work.
An employee returns to work on his/her the STD benefit level is reinstated, in total, regular work schedule for at least	according to the payment schedule,
thirteen (13) continuous weeks....
1.	When occupational illness or injury prevents employees from working, the above reinstatement schedule does not apply as benefits are paid on a per injury/illness basis.
2.	Vacation, floating or fixed holidays, bereavement, jury duty and other excused paid time is included in thirteen (13) week benefit reinstatement periods.
P.	An employee’s job is normally held available during the period of paid STD benefits. If medical documentation indicates an employee will not return to work upon exhaustion of STD benefits, and the STD benefit period is less than 52 weeks, the employee is placed on an excused, unpaid absence for up to 30 days, but unused vacation or personal holidays may be substituted during this unpaid absence. After 30 days, if the employee is still unable to return to work, the employee is placed on an unpaid leave of absence until the total absence is 52 weeks.
The total period of absence associated with the illness or injury, including paid STD benefits, excused unpaid absence (or vacation/personal holidays substitutions), unpaid leave of absence, and Family and Medical Leave Act entitlement (if available) shall not exceed 52 weeks. Earned, embedded, and banked vacation time, if available, may not be used to extend the STD absence beyond 52 weeks. Any earned, but unused vacation will be paid in a lump sum at the end of the STD period. When this period of absence ends, employment will be terminated.
Employment is terminated when an employee cannot return to work after a total absence of 52 weeks.
Long-term disability, if applicable, and/or retirement benefits may be available as described in the applicable Summary Plan Description.

Grievances of this type which are not resolved under the steps of this grievance article, will not be subject to the arbitration provisions of Article 25.
53
In the event the Company considers that the number of non-arbitrable grievances presented are excessive, abusive or of a harassing nature, it may submit a determination of that issue to the permanent arbitrator provided under Article 25, Section 2. If the arbitrator answers the issue in the affirmative, he/she has the authority to limit, suspend or cancel this provision of the grievance procedure.
Section 2.	The provisions of this article are the sole and exclusive procedure for the adjustment of a grievance of an employee, employees, the Union, or the Company.
Section 3.	Casual corrections, routine changes and questions concerning the supervision and direction of the working forces may be handled by the foreman directly with the employee or employees concerned and will be subject to the grievance procedure should the application of such matters create a grievance as herein described.
Section 4.	Should any grievance as defined in Section 1. above arise during the term of this Agreement, an earnest effort shall be made to settle such grievance in the manner described in this section: (It is understood and agreed that in the event an arbitrator should suspend or cancel the provisions of Section 1 .B. of this article, thereafter an employee’s Union or management representative shall not be required to receive or process such non-arbitrable grievances under the terms of this Agreement.)
STEP 1. An employee having a grievance may present it to the employee’s immediate management representative at the level of the exchange in which the aggrieved employee is employed, or may present it to his/her local Union representative for processing with the employee’s immediate management representative.
Normally, the grievance will be handled with the Company by a local Union representative, but it is agreed that any individual employee or a group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to the Company and to have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as long as the adjustment shall not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, and provided that the Union representative has been given opportunity to be present at such adjustment.
A grievance shall be presented at Step 1 of the grievance procedure as soon as possible after it arises, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after it occurred, and the failure to present the matter within this time shall constitute an abandonment and waiver of the grievance.
The management representative will make an earnest effort to reach a satisfactory settlement of the grievance and will give his/her answer within fourteen (14) calendar days after its presentation to him/her.
At the request of either party, the aggrieved employee may be present at the presentation and settlement of his/her grievance at this step of the grievance procedure only. If more than one aggrieved employee is involved, participation of more than one aggrieved employee shall be by mutual agreement.
STEP 2. If the grievance is not settled satisfactorily in accordance with the procedure of Step 1, it may be presented to the management representative at the district or area level by the Union’s local representative within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the management representative’s answer under Step 1, and a failure to present the matter within this time shall constitute an abandonment and waiver of the grievance.
The grievance at this level shall be presented in writing, signed by the grievant and the Union representative, and shall contain a brief statement of the grievance and list the specific provisions(s) of the Agreement claimed to have been violated (or in the case of a non-arbitrable grievance as defined in Section I.B., a statement of the dispute).
54
The Company shall furnish the Union with a written reply to the grievance within fourteen (14) calendar days after the matter was presented to it, and this reply shall contain a brief statement of the Company’s reasons for granting or denying the grievance, and where applicable, will list the provision(s) of the Agreement which it contends applies. If no decision is given by the Company within the fourteen (14) calendar day period, or such time as may be mutually extended, the grievance may be appealed to the next step of the grievance procedure.
STEP 3. If the grievance is not settled satisfactorily in accordance with the procedure at Step 2, it may be presented to the Company’s designated Human Resources Department representative by the Union’s local president. In addition, the International Representative of the Union may attend such third step grievance meetings. A grievance at this step must be presented within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the answer under Step 2, and a failure to present the grievance within the time shall constitute an abandonment and waiver of the grievance.
The grievance at this level shall be presented in writing, and shall contain a brief statement of the grievance and list the specific provision(s) of the Agreement claimed to have been violated (or in the case of a non-arbitrable grievance as defined in Section l.B., a statement of the dispute).
The Company shall furnish the Union a written reply to the grievance within thirty (30) calendar days after the matter was presented to it, and this reply shall contain a brief statement of the Company’s reasons for granting or denying the grievance, and where applicable, will list the provision(s) of the Agreement which it contends applies.
If no decision is given by the Company within the thirty (30) calendar day period, or such time as may be mutually extended, the grievance shall be deemed resolved on the basis claimed by the Union. The duly accredited International Representative of the Union shall have access to the Company premises for the purpose of investigating grievances normally at Step 3 of the grievance procedure when accompanied by, or in accordance with permission granted by, the management representative at Step 3. Such representative shall assume all risk and if injured on the premises, the Union agrees to save harmless and indemnify the Company from any claim made by such representative for any such injury.
Section 5.	After any matter appropriate for grievance handling under this Agreement shall have been referred to the Union for grievance handling and the Company informed of such reference, the Company agrees that it will neither initiate nor participate in any discussion of the matter with the individual employees affected except in the presence of a Union representative.
Section 6. Insofar as practicable, the investigation of a grievance by the Union or its representatives will be handled only during non-work time and shall not interfere with the performance of duties by employees. It is recognized that there may be occasions when in an investigation of a grievance it may be impossible to handle such investigation during non-work time, and the Company will not unreasonably withhold its permission for the investigation of such grievance during work time.
Section 7. At the grievance meetings under this article, the Union may have up to two (2) employees present from within the Company. Grievance meetings under the grievance procedure will be held at reasonable hours and usually during work hours. Time devoted by employees in grievance meetings and in handling grievances outside of normally scheduled work hours will not be paid by the Company. Time spent by employees during grievance meetings will be treated as time worked for the purpose of computing premium pay under this Agreement.

“Business Certification Program”
The Company and the Union do hereby agree to incorporate this memorandum of agreement regarding the certification of Business Services Technicians I, II, and III into the collective bargaining agreement between the Company and the Union. This agreement provides for additional compensation to Business Services Technicians II and for Business Services Technicians III. This additional compensation shall be reflected in pension bands, the Sprint Savings Plan tables and new wage schedules attached.
Current Business Service Technicians shall have their title changed to Business Service Technician I. The wage rates, pension bands, and savings plan tables listed in the collective bargaining agreement applicable for Business Services Technicians shall apply to the new title. They shall not be required to certify in the titles of Business Services Technicians II or III but shall be offered the opportunity to do so in order of seniority within their respective work group. No new entrants within the work group shall be given the opportunity to certify until all current employees in the current classification or its replacement have been given the opportunity to certify. Those Business Service Technicians who have been certified prior to the Agreement shall be placed in the appropriate title of Business Service Technician II or Business Service Technician III.
All job postings shall be for Business Services Technicians I but new entrants shall be offered the opportunity to certify as Business Services Technicians II or III within 18 months of being placed in the classification of Business Services Technician I. There may be circumstances which would prevent this certification such as all incumbents haven’t been given the opportunity to certify or the availability of training and in such case the Company shall have a reasonable amount of additional time for the certification process. Nothing in this memorandum will be construed to restrict management’s right to hire Business Service Technicians I under Article 16, Section 6 of the Labor Agreement.
The Company shall assist employees in getting the necessary training for certification through Company sponsored schools or tuition assistance programs. Management may consider seniority in determining how training ; opportunities will be scheduled.
85
Employees who successfully certify will be moved to the appropriate wage schedule at the beginning of the next pay period and shall be allowed to make appropriate changes in their savings plan contributions, if they so desire.
The Company may make changes in the requirements for certification based on technological changes and business needs after meeting with the Union and explaining the need for such changes. No technician shall decertified due to changes in the program without first being given the opportunity for the formal training necessary to remain certified.
Employees, regardless of certification, shall remain a part of the same work group and shall continue to exercise seniority within that work group. If, for what ever reason, there is a reduction in the work force, the employees shall be displaced in the inverse order of seniority without regard to certification.
Work assignments shall be handled based upon the needs of the customers and the business and not the certification level of the employees except to the extent that the employees are qualified to perform the work assigned.
