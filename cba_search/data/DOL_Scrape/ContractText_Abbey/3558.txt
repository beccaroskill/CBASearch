6
Article 6
ARTICLE 5
PROHIBITION OF UNILATERAL ACTION
The Employer will not take any actions affecting wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment as defined in Section 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act which violate the terms of this Agreement or are otherwise inconsistent with its obligations under law.
(The preceding Article, Article 5, shall apply to City Carrier Assistant Employees.)
ARTICLE 6
NO LAYOFFS OR REDUCTION IN FORCE
(1)	Each employee who is employed in the regular work force as of the date of the Award of Arbitrator James J. Healy, September 15, 1978, shall be protected henceforth against any involuntary layoff or force reduction.
It is the intent of this provision to provide security to each such employee during his or her work lifetime.
Members of the regular work force, as defined in Article 7 of the Agreement, include full-time regulars, part-time employees assigned to regular schedules and part-time employees assigned to flexible schedules.
(2)	Employees who become members of the regular work force after the date of this Award, September 15, 1978, shall be provided the same protection afforded under (1) above on completion of six years of continuous service and having worked in at least 20 pay periods during each of the six years.
(3)	With respect to employees hired into the regular work force after the date of this Award and who have not acquired the protection provided under (2) above, the Employer shall have the right to effect layoffs for lack of work or for other legitimate reasons. This right may be exercised in lieu of reassigning employees under the provisions of Article 12, except as such right may be modified by agreement. Should the exer
7
Article 6
cise of the Employer’s right to lay off employees require the application of the provisions of Chapter 35 of Title 5, United States Code, employees covered by that Chapter with less than three years of continuous civilian federal service will be treated as “career conditional” employees.
The Employer’s right as established in this Section shall be effective July 20, 1979.
The following terms as to the employees’ and Employer’s rights and the rules and procedures to be followed in the implementation of Article 6 are a part of the September 15, 1978 Final Resolution and shall be final and binding upon the parties:
A.	Coverage
1.	Employees protected against any involuntary layoff or force reduction.
Those employees who occupy full-time, part-time regular or part-time flexible positions in the regular work force (as defined in Article 7) on September 15, 1978, are protected against layoff and reduction in force during any period of employment in the regular work force with the United States Postal Service or successor organization in his or her lifetime. Such employees are referred to as “protected employees.”
Other employees achieve protected status under the provisions of A.3 below.
2.	Employees subject to involuntary layoff or force reduction.
Except as provided in A.l and A.3, all employees who enter the regular work force, whether by hire, transfer, demotion, reassignment, reinstatement, and reemployment on or after September 16, 1978, are subject to layoff or force reduction and are referred to as “non-pro-tected employees.”
3.	Non-protected employees achieving protected status.
(a)	A non-protected employee achieves protected status upon completion of six years of continuous service
8
Article 6.A.3(d)
in their regular work force. The service requirement is computed from the first day of the pay period in which the employee enters the regular work force. To receive credit for the year, the employee must work at least one hour or receive a call-in guarantee in lieu of work in at least 20 of the 26 pay periods during that anniversary year.
Absence from actual duty for any of the following reasons will be considered as “work” solely for the purposes of this requirement:
(1)	To the extent required by law, court leave, time spent in military service covered by Chapter 43 of Title 38, or time spent on continuation of pay, leave without pay or on OWCP rolls because of compensable injury on duty.
(2)	Time spent on paid annual leave or sick leave, as provided for in Article 10 of the Agreement.
(3)	Leave without pay for performing Union business as provided for in Article 24 of the Agreement.
All other unpaid leave and periods of suspension or time spent in layoff or R.IF status will not be considered work. Failure to meet the 20 pay period requirement in any given anniversary year means the employee must begin a new six year continuous service period to achieve protected status.
(b)	Temporary details outside of the regular work force in which the employee’s position of record remains in the regular work force count toward fulfilling the 20 pay periods of work requirement per year.
(c)	If a non-protected employee leaves the regular work force for a position outside the Postal Service and remains there more than 30 calendar days, upon return the employee begins a new service period for purposes of attaining six years continuous service.
(d)	If a non-protected employee leaves the regular work
9
Article 6.A.3(d)
force and returns within two years from a position within the Postal Service the employee will receive credit for previously completed full anniversary years, for purposes of attaining the six years continuous service.
B.	Preconditions for Implementation of Layoff and Reduction in Force.
1.	The affected Union(s) shall be notified at the Regional level no less than 90 days in advance of any layoff or reduction in force that an excess of employees exists or will exist at an installation and that a layoff and reduction in force may be necessary. The Employer will explain to the Union(s) the basis for its conclusion that legitimate business reasons require the excessing and possible separation of employees.
2.	No employee shall be reassigned under this Article or laid off or reduced in force unless and until that employee has been notified at least 60 days in advance that he or she may be affected by one or the other of these actions.
3.	The maximum number of excess employees within an installation shall be determined by seniority unit within each category of employees (full-time, part-time regular, part-time flexible). This number determined by the Employer will be given to the Union(s) at the time of the 90-day notice.
4.	Before implementation of reassignment under this Article or, if necessary, layoff and reduction in force of excess employees within the installation, the Employer will, to the fullest extent possible, separate all casuals within the craft and minimize the amount of overtime work and part-time flexible hours in the positions or group of positions covered by the seniority unit as defined in this Agreement or as agreed to by the parties. In addition, the Employer shall solicit volunteers from among employees in the same craft within the installation to terminate their employment with the Employer.
10
Article 6.C.1
Employees who elect to terminate their employment will receive a lump sum severance payment in the amount provided by Part 435 of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual, will receive benefit coverage to the extent provided by such Manual, and, if eligible, will be given the early retirement benefits provided by Section 8336(d)(2) of Title 5, United States Code and the regulations implementing that statute.
5.	No less than 20 days prior to effecting a layoff, the Employer will post a list of all vacancies in other seniority units and crafts at the same or lower level which exist within the installation and within the commuting area of the losing installation. Employees in an affected seniority unit may, within 10 days after the posting, request a reassignment under this Article to a posted vacancy. Qualified employees will be assigned to such vacancies on the basis of seniority. If a senior non-pref-erence eligible employee within the seniority unit indicates no interest in available reassignment, then such employee becomes exposed to layoff. A preference eligible employee within the seniority unit shall be required to accept such a reassignment to a vacancy in the same level at the installation, or, if none exists at the installation, to a vacancy in the same level at an installation within the commuting area of the losing installation.
If the reassignment is to a different craft, the employee’s seniority in the new craft shall be established in accordance with the applicable seniority provisions of the new craft.
C.	Layoff and Reduction in Force
1.	Definition. The term “layoff” as used herein refers to the separation of non-protected, non-preference eligible employees in the regular work force because of lack of work or other legitimate, non-disciplinary reasons. The term “reduction in force” as used herein refers to the separation or reduction in the grade of a non-protected veterans’ preference eligible in the regular work force because of lack of work or other legitimate non-discipli-nary reasons.
11
Article 6.C.2
2.	Order of layoff. If an excess of employees exists at an installation after satisfaction of the preconditions set forth in (B) above, the Employer may lay off employees within their respective seniority units as defined in the Agreement.
3.	Seniority units for purposes of layoff. Seniority units within the categories of full-time regular, part-time regular, and part-time flexible, will consist of all non-protected persons at a given level within an established craft at an installation unless the parties agree otherwise. It is the intent to provide the broadest possible unit consistent with the equities of senior non-protected employees and with the efficient operation of the installation.
4.	Union representation. Chief stewards and union stewards whose responsibilities bear a direct relationship to the effective and efficient representation of bargaining unit employees shall be placed at the top of the seniority unit roster in the order of their relative craft seniority for the purposes of layoff, reduction in force, and recall.
5.	Reduction in force. If an excess of employees exists at an installation after satisfaction of the preconditions set forth in (B) above and after the layoff procedure has been applied, the Employer may implement a reduction in force as defined above. Such reduction will be conducted in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements that prevail at the time the force reduction is effected. Should applicable law and regulations require that other non-protected, non-preference eligible employees from other seniority units be laid off prior to reduction in force, such employees will be laid off in inverse order of their craft seniority in the seniority unit.
In determining competitive levels and competitive areas applicable in a force reduction, the Employer will submit its proposal to the Union(s) at least 30 days prior to the reduction. The Union(s) will be afforded a full opportunity to make suggested revisions in the proposal.
12
Article 6.D.2
However, the Employer, having the primary responsibility for compliance with the statute and regulations, reserves the right to make the final decision with respect to competitive levels and competitive areas. In making its decision with respect to competitive levels and competitive areas the Employer shall give no greater retention security to preference eligibles than to non-preference eligi-bles except as may be required by law.
D.	Recall Rights
1.	Employees who are laid off or reduced in force shall be placed on recall lists within their seniority units and shall be entitled to remain on such lists for two years. Such employees shall keep the Employer informed of their current address. Employees on the lists shall be notified in order of craft seniority within the seniority unit of all vacant assignments in the same category and level from which they were laid off or reduced in force. Preference eligibles will be accorded no recall rights greater than non-preference eligibles except as required by law. Notice of vacant assignments shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested, and a copy of such notice shall be furnished to the local union president. An employee so notified must acknowledge receipt of the notice and advise the Employer of his or her intentions within 5 days after receipt of the notice. If the employee accepts the position offered he or she must report for work within 2 weeks after receipt of notice. If the employee fails to reply to the notice within 5 days after the notice is received or delivery cannot be accomplished, the Employer shall offer the vacancy to the next employee on the list. If an employee declines the offer of a vacant assignment in his or her seniority unit or does not have a satisfactory reason for failure to reply to a notice, the employee shall be removed from the recall list.
2.	An employee reassigned from a losing installation pursuant to B.5 above and who has retreat rights shall be entitled under this Article to exercise those retreat rights before a vacancy is offered to an employee on the recall
13
Article 6.D.2
list who is junior to the reassigned employee in craft seniority.
E.	Protective Benefits
1.	Severance pay. Employees who are separated because of a layoff or reduction in force shall be entitled to severance pay in accordance with Part 435 of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual.
2.	Health and Life Insurance Coverage. Employees who are separated because of a layoff or a reduction in force shall be entitled to the health insurance and life insurance coverage and to the conversion rights provided for in the Employee and Labor Relations Manual.
F.	Union Representation Rights
1.	The interpretation and application of the provisions of this Award shall be grievable under Article 15. Any such grievance may be introduced at Step B and shall be subject to priority arbitration.
2.	The Employer shall provide to the affected Union(s) a quarterly report on all reassignments, layoff and reductions in force made under this Article.
3.	Preference eligibles are not deprived of whatever rights of appeal such employees may have under applicable laws and regulations. If the employee appeals under the Veterans’ Preference Act, however, the time limits for appeal to arbitration and the normal contractual arbitration scheduling procedures are not to be delayed as a consequence of that appeal; if there is an MSPB appeal pending as of the date the arbitration is scheduled by the parties, the grievant waives access to the grievance-arbitration procedure beyond Step B.
G Intent
The Employer shall not lay off, reduce in force, or take any other action against a non-protected employee solely to prevent the attainment of that employee of protection status.
14
Article 7.1.B.2
(Additional no layoffs or reduction in force provisions regarding City Carrier Assistant Employees are found in Appendix B.)

Over the course of a service week, the Employer will make every effort to ensure that qualified and available part-time flexible employees are utilized at the straight-time rate prior to assigning such work to CCAs working in the same work location and on the same tour, provided that the reporting guarantee for CCA employees is met.
Section 2.	Employment and Work Assignments
A.	Normally, work in different crafts, occupational groups or levels will not be combined into one job. However, to provide maximum full-time employment and provide necessary flexibility, management may establish full-time schedule assignments by including work within different crafts or occupational groups after the following sequential actions have been taken:
1.	All available work within each separate craft by tour has been combined.
2.	Work of different crafts in the same wage level by tour has been combined.
The appropriate representatives of the affected Unions will be informed in advance of the reasons for establishing the combination full-time assignments within different crafts in accordance with this Article.
B.	In the event of insufficient work on any particular day or days in a full-time or part-time employee’s own scheduled assignment, management may assign the employee to any available work in the same wage level for which the employee is qualified, consistent with the employee’s knowledge and experience, in order to maintain the number of work hours of the employee’s basic work schedule.
C.	During exceptionally heavy workload periods for one occupational group, employees in an occupational group experiencing a light workload period may be assigned to work in the same wage level, commensurate with their capabilities, to the heavy workload area for such time as management determines necessary.

C.	A part-time flexible employee working eight (8) hours within ten (10), on the same five (5) days each week and the same assignment over a six month period will demonstrate the need for converting the assignment to a full-time position.

For work performed on December 25, a part-time flexible schedule employee shall be paid in addition to the employee’s regular straight time hourly rate, one-half (1/2) times the employee’s regular straight time hourly rate for each hour worked up to eight (8) hours.
ARTICLE 12
PRINCIPLES OF SENIORITY, POSTING AND REASSIGNMENTS
Section 1.	Probationary Period
A.	The probationary period for a new employee shall be ninety (90) calendar days. The Employer shall have the right to separate from its employ any probationary employee at any time during the probationary period and these probationary employees shall not be permitted access to the grievance procedure in relation thereto. If the Employer intends to separate an employee during the probationary period for scheme failure, the employee shall be given at least seven (7) days advance notice of such intent to separate the employee. If the employee qualifies on the scheme within the notice period, the employee will not be separated for prior scheme failure.
|see Memo, page 150]
B.	The parties recognize that the failure of the Employer to discover a falsification by an employee in the employment application prior to the expiration of the probationary period shall not
34
Article 12.3.B
bar the use of such falsification as a reason for discharge.
C.	When an employee completes the probationary period, seniority will be computed in accordance with this Agreement as of the initial day of full-time or part-time employment.
D.	When an employee who is separated from the Postal Service for any reason is re-hired, the employee shall serve a new probationary period. If the separation was due to disability, the employee’s seniority shall be established in accordance with Section 2, if applicable.
Section 2.	Principles of Seniority
A.	Except as specifically provided in this Article, the principles of seniority are established in the craft Articles of this Agreement.
B.	An employee who left the bargaining unit on or after July 21,1973 and returns to the same craft:
1.	will begin a new period of seniority if the employee returns from a position outside the Postal Service; or
2.	will begin a new period of seniority if the employee returns from a non-bargaining unit position within the Postal Service, unless the employee returns within 2 years from the date the employee left the unit.
Section 3.	Principles of Posting
A.	To insure a more efficient and stable work force, an employee may be designated a successful bidder no more than seven (7) times during the duration of this Agreement unless such bid:
1.	is to a job in a higher wage level;:
2.	is due to elimination or reposting of the employee’s duty assignment; or
3.	enables an employee to become assigned to a station closer to the employee’s place of residence.
B.	Specific provisions for posting for each craft are contained in the craft posting provisions of this Agreement.
35
Article 12.4
Section 4.	Principles of Reassignments
A.	A primary principle in effecting reassignments will be that dislocation and inconvenience to employees in the regular work force shall be kept to a minimum, consistent with the needs of the service. Reassignments will be made in accordance with this Section and the provisions of Section 5 below.
B.	When a major relocation of employees is planned in major metropolitan areas or due to the implementation of national postal mail networks, the Employer will apply this Article in the development of the relocation and reassignment plan. At least 90 days in advance of implementation of such plan, the Employer will meet with the Unions at the national level to fully advise the Unions how it intends to implement the plan. If the Unions believes such plan violates the National Agreement, the matter may be grieved.
Such plan shall include a meeting at the regional level in advance (as much as six months whenever possible) of the reassignments anticipated. The Employer will advise the Unions, based on the best estimates available at the time, of the anticipated impact; the numbers of employees affected by craft; the locations to which they will be reassigned; and, in the case of a new installation, the anticipated complement by tour and craft. The Unions will be periodically updated by the Region should any of the information change due to more current data being available.
C.	When employees are excessed out of their installation, the National Business Agent of the Union may request at the Area level a comparative work hour report of the losing installation 60 days after the excessing of such employees.
If a review of the report does not substantiate that business conditions warranted the action taken, such employees shall have their retreat rights activated. If the retreat right is denied, the employees have the right to the grievance-arbitration procedure.
D.	In order to minimize the impact on employees in the regular work force, the Employer agrees to separate, to the extent possible, casual employees working in the affected craft and installation prior to excessing any regular employee in that
36
Article 12.5.B.2
craft out of the installation. The junior full-time employee who is being excessed has the option of reverting to part-time flexible status in his/her craft, or of being reassigned to the gaining installation.
Section 5.	Reassignments
A.	Basic Principles and Reassignments
When it is proposed to:
1.	Discontinue an independent installation;
2.	Consolidate an independent installation (i.e., discontinue the independent identity of an installation by making it part of another and continuing independent installation);
3.	Transfer a classified station or classified branch to the jurisdiction of another installation or make an independent installation;
4.	Reassign within an installation employees excess to the needs of a section of that installation;
5.	Reduce the number of regular work force employees of an installation other than by attrition;
6.	Centralized mail processing and/or delivery installation (Clerk Craft only);
7.	Reassignment—motor vehicles;
8	. Reassignment—part-time flexibles in excess of quota; such actions shall be subject to the following principles and requirements.
B.	Principles and Requirements
1.	Dislocation and inconvenience to full-time and part-time flexible employees shall be kept to the minimum consistent with the needs of the service.
2.	The Vice Presidents Area Operations shall give full consideration to withholding sufficient full-time and part-time flexible positions within the area for full-time and part-time flexible employees who may be
37
Article 12.5.B.2
involuntarily reassigned. When positions are withheld, management will periodically review the continuing need for withholding such positions and discuss with the NBA the results of such review.
3.	No employee shall be allowed to displace, or “bump” another employee, properly holding a position or duty assignment.
4.	Unions affected shall be notified in advance (as much as six (6) months whenever possible), such notification to be at the regional level, except under A.4 above, which shall be at the local level.
5.	Full-time and part-time flexible employees involuntarily detailed or reassigned from one installation to another shall be given not less than 60 days advance notice, if possible. They shall receive moving, mileage, per diem and reimbursement for movement of household goods, as appropriate, if legally payable, as governed by the standardized Government travel regulations as set forth in the applicable Handbook.
6.	Any employee volunteering to accept reassignment to another craft or occupational group, another branch of the Postal Service, or another installation shall start a new period of seniority beginning with such assignment, except as provided herein.
7.	Whenever changes in mail handling patterns are undertaken in an area including one or more postal installations with resultant successive reassignments of clerks from those installations to one or more central installations, the reassignment of clerks shall be treated as details for the first 180 days in order to prevent inequities in the seniority lists at the gaining installations. The 180 days is computed from the date of the first detail of a clerk to the central, consolidated or new installation in that specific planning program. If a tie develops in establishing the merged seniority roster at the gaining installation, it shall be broken by total continuous service in the regular
38
Article 12.5.C.l.b
work force in the same craft.
8.	In determining seniority of special delivery messengers who received career status under Civil Service Regulation 3.101, that period of continuous service as a special delivery messenger prior to attaining career status shall be included.
9.	Whenever in this Agreement provision is made for reassignments, it is understood that any full-time or part-time flexible employee reassigned must meet the qualification requirements of the position to which reassigned.
10.	Whenever the provisions of this Section establishing seniority are inconsistent with the provisions of the Craft Article of this Agreement, the provisions of the Craft Article shall prevail.
11.	It is understood that any employee entitled hereunder to a specific placement may exercise such entitlement only if no other employee has a superior claim hereunder to the same position.
12.	Surplus U.S. Postal Service Employees-Surplus U.S. Postal Service employees from non-mail processing and non-mail delivery installations, regional offices, the U.S. Postal Service Headquarters or from other Federal departments or agencies shall be placed at the foot of the part-time flexible roll and begin a new period of seniority effective the date of reassignment.
C.	Special Provisions on Reassignments
In addition to the general principles and requirements above specified, the following specific provisions are applicable:
1.	Discontinuance of an Independent Installation
a.	When an independent installation is discontinued, all full-time and part-time flexible employees shall, to the maximum extent possible, be involuntarily reassigned to continuing postal positions in accordance with the following:
b.	Involuntary reassignment of full-time employees
39
Article 12.5.C.l.b
with their seniority for duty assignments to vacancies in the same or lower level in the same craft or occupational group in installations within 100 miles of the discontinued installation, or in more distant installations, if after consultation with the affected Unions, it is determined that it is necessary. The Postal Service will designate such installations for the reassignment of excess full-time employees. When two or more such vacancies are simultaneously available, first choice of duty assignment shall go to the senior employee entitled by displacement from a discontinued installation to such placement.
c.	Involuntary reassignment of full-time employees for whom consultation did not provide for placement under C.l.b above in other crafts or occupational groups in which they meet minimum qualifications at the same or lower level with permanent seniority for duty assignments under (1) and (2) below, whichever is lesser:
(1)	One day junior to the seniority of the junior full-time employee in the same level and craft or occupation in the installation to which assigned, or
(2)	The seniority the employee had in the craft from which reassigned.
d.	Involuntary reassignment of part-time flexible employees with seniority in any vacancy in the part-time flexible quota in the same craft or occupational group at any installation within 100 miles of the discontinued installation, or in more distant installations, if after consultation with the affected Unions it is determined that it is necessary, the Postal Service will designate such installations for the reassignment of the part-time flexible employees.
e.	Involuntary reassignment of part-time flexible employees for whom consultation did not provide for placement under C.l.d above in other crafts or
40
Article 12.5.C.2.b
occupational groups in which they meet minimum qualification at the same or lower level at the foot of the existing part-time flexible roster at the receiving installation and begin a new period of seniority.
f.	Full-time employees for whom no full-time vacancies are available by the time the installation is discontinued shall be changed to part-time flexible employees in the same craft and placed as such, but shall for six months retain placement rights to full-time vacancies developing within that time within any installation within 100 miles of the discontinued installation, or in more distant installations, if after consultation with affected Unions it is necessary, U.S. Postal Service will designate such installations for the reassignment of excess full-time employees on the same basis as if they had remained full-time.
g.	Employees, full-time or part-time flexible, involuntarily reassigned as above provided shall upon the reestablishment of the discontinued installation be entitled to reassignment with full seniority to the first vacancy in the reestablished installation in the level, craft or occupational group from which reassigned.
2.	Consolidation of an Independent Installation
a.	When an independent postal installation is consolidated with another postal installation, each full-time or part-time flexible employee shall be involuntarily reassigned to the continuing installation without loss of seniority in the employee’s craft or occupational group.
b.	Where reassignments under 2.a, preceding, result in an excess of employees in any craft or occupational group in the continuing installation, identification and placement of excess employees shall be accomplished by the continuing installation in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
41
Article 12.5.C.2.b
covering such situations.
c.	If the consolidated installation again becomes an independent installation, each full-time and part-time flexible employee whose reassignment was necessitated by the previous consolidation shall be entitled to the first vacancy in the reestablished installation in the level and craft or occupational group held at the time the installation was discontinued.
3.	Transfer of a Classified Station or Classified Branch to the Jurisdiction of Another Installation or Made an Independent Installation
a.	When a classified station or classified branch is transferred to the jurisdiction of another installation or made an independent installation, all full-time employees shall at their option remain with the classified station or classified branch without loss of seniority, or remain with the installation from which the classified station or classified branch is being transferred.
b.	A realistic appraisal shall be made of the number of employees by crafts or occupations who will be needed in the station after transfer, and potential vacancies within these requirements created by the unwillingness of employees to follow the station to the new jurisdiction shall be posted for bid on an office-wide basis in the losing installation.
c.	If the postings provided in paragraph 3.b, preceding, do not result in sufficient employees to staff the transferred classified station or classified branch, junior employees, by craft or occupational group on an installation-wide seniority basis in the losing installation, shall be involuntarily reassigned to the classified station or classified branch and each employee thus involuntarily reassigned shall be entitled to the first vacancy in such employee’s level and craft or occupational group in the installation from which transferred.
42
Article 12.5.C.4.d
4.	Reassignment Within an Installation of Employees Excess to the Needs of a Section
a.	The identification of assignments comprising for this purpose a section shall be determined locally by local negotiations. If no sections are established immediately by local negotiations, the entire installation shall comprise the section.
b.	Full-time employees, excess to the needs of a section, starting with that employee who is junior in the same craft or occupational group and in the same level assigned in that section, shall be reassigned outside the section but within the same craft or occupational group. They shall retain their seniority and may bid on any existing vacancies for which they are eligible to bid. If they do not bid, they may be assigned in any vacant duty assignment for which there was no senior bidder in the same craft and installation. Their preference is to be considered if more than one such assignment is available.
c.	Such reassigned full-time employee retains the right to retreat to the section from which withdrawn only upon the occurrence of the first residual vacancy in the salary level after employees in the section have completed bidding. Such bidding in the section is limited to employees in the same salary level as the vacancy. Failure to bid for the first available vacancy will end such retreat right. The right to retreat to the section is optional with the employee who has retreat rights with respect to a vacancy in a lower salary level. Failure to exercise the option does not terminate the retreat rights in the salary level in which the employee was reassigned away from the section. In the Clerk Craft, an employee may exercise the option to retreat to a vacancy in a lower salary level only to an assignment for which the employee would have been otherwise eligible to bid.
d.	The duty assignment vacated by the reassignment
43
Article 12.5.C.4.d
of the junior full-time employee from the section shall be posted for bid of the full-time employees in the section. If there are no bids, the junior remaining unassigned full-time employee in the section shall be assigned to the vacancy.
5.	Reduction in the Number of Employees in an Installation Other Than by Attrition
a.	Reassignments within installation. When for any reason an installation must reduce the number of employees more rapidly than is possible by normal attrition, that installation:
(I)	Shall determine by craft and occupational group the number of excess employees;
(2)	Shall, to the extent possible, minimize the impact on regular work force employees by separation of all casuals;
(3)	Shall, to the extent possible, minimize the impact on full-time positions by reducing part-time flexible hours;
(4)	Shall identify as excess the necessary number of junior full-time employees in the salary level, craft, and occupational group affected on an installation-wide basis within the installation; make reassignments of excess full-time employees who meet the minimum qualifications for vacant assignments in other crafts in the same installation; involuntarily reassign them (except as provided for letter carriers and special delivery messengers and vehicle service employees in Section C.5.b below) in the same or lower level with seniority, whichever is the lesser of:
(a)	One day junior to the seniority of the junior full-time employee in the same level and craft or occupational group in the installation to which assigned, or
(b)	The seniority the employee had in the craft from which reassigned.
44
Article 12.5.C.5.b.l.b
(5)	The employee shall be returned at the first opportunity to the craft from which reassigned.
(6)	When returned, the employee retains seniority previously attained in the craft augmented by intervening employment in the other craft.
(7)	The right of election by a senior employee provided in paragraph b(3), below is not available for this cross-craft reassignment within the installation.
b.	Reassignments to other installations after making reassignments within the installation:
(1) Involuntarily reassign such excess full-time employees starting with the junior with their seniority for duty assignments to vacancies in the same or lower level in the same craft or occupational group in installations within 100 miles of the losing installation, or in more distant installations if after consultation with the affected Union it is determined that it is necessary, the Postal Service will designate such installations for the reassignment of excess full-time employees. However:
(a)	Whenever full-time letter carrier routes, carrier technician or router assignments are transferred from one installation to another, the full-time letter carriers whose complete routes or assignments are transferred shall have the option of transferring with their routes or assignments, with their seniority. If a full-time letter carrier declines the option of transferring with the route or assignment, any qualified full-time letter carrier in the delivery unit may request, by seniority, to be reassigned with the route or assignment, with their seniority. The request of the senior qualified carrier shall be granted, and shall be counted in accordance with Article 12.3.
(b)	Whenever full-time or part-time motor
45
Article 12.5.C.5.b.l.b
vehicle craft assignments are discontinued in an installation and there is an excess in a position designation and salary level, the excess shall be adjusted to the maximum extent possible by making voluntary reassignments to vacant motor vehicle craft positions in installations within 100 miles unless the employee applies for a vacancy in a more distant installation. Senior qualified applicants for such vacant positions shall be reassigned. When reassignment is in the same designation and salary level, the reassigned employee retains his/her seniority.
(c)	When the entire special delivery messenger unit is moved from one independent installation to another and all special delivery territory is transferred, the special delivery messengers will be reassigned in the gaining unit with full seniority credit for all seniority gained in the craft and installation. When less than the entire special delivery messenger unit is transferred and it is necessary to reassign one or more special delivery messengers to the gaining installation, senior special delivery messengers shall be given option for reassignment. If no special delivery messenger elects to be reassigned, the junior special delivery messenger shall be reassigned.
(2)	Involuntarily reassign full-time employees for whom consultation did not provide for placement under b(l) above in other crafts or occupational groups in which they meet minimum qualifications at the same or lower level with permanent seniority for duty assignments whichever is lesser of:
(a)	one day junior to the seniority of the junior full-time employee in the same level and craft or occupational group in the installation to which assigned, or
46
Article 12.5.C.5.b.6
(b)	the seniority he/she had in the craft from which reassigned.
(3)	Any senior employee in the same craft or occupational group in the same installation may elect to be reassigned to the gaining installation and take the seniority of the senior full-time employee subject to involuntary reassignment. Such senior employees who accept reassignment to the gaining installation do not have retreat rights.
(4)	When two or more such vacancies are simultaneously available, first choice of duty assignment shall go to the senior employee entitled by displacement from a discontinued installation to such placement.
(5)	A full-time employee shall have the option of changing to part-time flexible in the same craft or occupational group in lieu of involuntary reassignment.
(6)	Employees involuntarily reassigned under b( 1) and (2) above, other than senior employees who elect to be reassigned in place of junior employees, shall be entitled at the time of such reassignment to file a written request to be returned to the first vacancy in the level, in the craft or occupational group in the installation from which reassigned, and such request shall be honored so long as the employee does not withdraw it or decline to accept an opportunity to return in accordance with such request.
In the Clerk Craft, an employee(s) involuntarily reassigned shall be entitled at the time of such reassignment to file a written request to return to the first vacancy in the craft and installation from which reassigned. Such request for retreat rights must indicate whether the employee(s) desires to retreat to the same, lower, and/or higher salary level assignment and, if so, what salary level(s). The
47
Article 12.5.C.5.b.6
employee(s) shall have the right to bid for vacancies within the former installation and the written request for retreat rights shall serve as a bid for all vacancies in the level from which the employee was reassigned and for all residual vacancies in other levels for which the employee has expressed a desire to retreat. The employee(s) may retreat to only those assignments for which the employee(s) would have been otherwise eligible to bid. If vacancies are available in a specified lower, higher or same salary level, the employee will be given the option. Failure to exercise retreat rights to the first available vacancy terminates such rights. Furthermore, employee(s) electing to retreat to a lower level assignment are not entitled to salary protection.
6.	Centralized Mail, Processing and/or Delivery Installation (Clerk Craft Only)
a.	When the operations at a centralized installation or other mail processing and/or delivery installation result in an excess of full-time clerks at another installation(s), full-time clerks who are excess in a losing installation(s) by reason of the change, shall be reassigned as provided in Section C.5.b. Reassignments of clerks shall be treated as details for the first 180 days to avoid inequities in the selection of preferred duty assignments by full-time clerks in the gaining installation.
b.	Previously established preferred duty assignments which become vacant before expiration of the detail period must be posted for bid and awarded to eligible full-time clerks then permanently assigned in the gaining installation. Excess part-time flexible clerks may be reassigned as provided for in Section C.8.
c.	All new duty assignments created in the gaining installation and all other vacant duty assignments in the centralized installation shall be posted for
48
Article 12.5.C.7.b
bid. One hundred eighty (180) days is computed from the date of the first detail of an employee. Bidding shall be open to all full-time clerks of the craft involved at the gaining installation. This includes full-time clerks assigned to the gaining installation.
d.	When the centralized installation is a new one:
(1)	Full-time clerks who apply for reassignment from the losing installation, shall be reassigned with their seniority.
(2)	Reassignments shall be in the order of seniority and shall not exceed the number of excess full-time clerks in the losing installation.
(3)	The provisions of 5.a, above, apply to reassign junior full-time excess clerks, with their seniority, when there are excess full-time clerks after the reassignment of senior full-time clerks who apply for reassignment.
7.	Reassignments - Motor Vehicle
a.	When a vehicle maintenance facility is established to replace an auxiliary garage, full-time and part-time flexible craft positions in the gaining installation are to be posted in the losing installation for applications by full-time and part-time flexible employees, respectively. Senior qualified applicants shall be reassigned without loss of seniority, but not to exceed the number of excess employees in the losing installation.
b.	When a vehicle maintenance facility is established to replace vehicle maintenance in a perimeter office, full-time and part-time flexible craft positions in the new maintenance facility shall be posted in the losing installation for applications by full-time and part-time flexible employees, respectively. Senior qualified applicants shall be reassigned without loss of seniority, but not to exceed the number of excess employees in the losing installation.
49
Article 12.5.C.7.C
c.	When vehicle operations are changed by transfer from one installation to another, new full-time and part-time flexible craft positions shall be posted for applications in the losing installation by full-time and part-time flexible employees in the craft, respectively. Senior qualified applicants shall be reassigned without loss of seniority, but not to exceed the number of excess employees in the losing installation.
d.	After all reassignments have been made to the gaining installation, pursuant to Subsections a, b and c, the new full-time assignments in the gaining installation shall be posted for bids.
e.	If, after establishment of a new installation, operations result in further excess at losing installation(s), the procedures in Subsections a, b, c and d, above, apply to reassign senior applicants from the losing installation(s) to positions in the new installation.
8.	Reassignment—Part-Time Flexible Employees in Excess of Quota (Other Than Motor Vehicle)
Where there are part-time flexible employees in excess of the part-time flexible quota for the craft for whom work is not available, part-time flexibles lowest on the part-time flexible roll equal in number to such excess may at their option be reassigned to the foot of the part-time flexible roll in the same or another craft in another installation.
a.	An excess employee reassigned to another craft in the same or another installation shall be assigned to the foot of the part-time flexible roll and begin a new period of seniority.
b.	An excess part-time flexible employee reassigned to the same craft in another installation shall be placed at the foot of the part-time flexible roll. Upon change to full-time from the top of the part-time flexible roll, the employee’s seniority for preferred assignments shall include the seniority the
50
Article 12.5.D
employee had in losing installation augmented by part-time flexible service in the gaining installation.
c.	A senior part-time flexible in the same craft or occupational group in the same installation may elect to be reassigned in another installation in the same or another craft and take the seniority, if any, of the senior excess part-time flexible being reassigned, as set forth in a and b, above.
d.	The Postal Service will designate, after consultation with the affected Union, vacancies at installations in which excess part-time flexibles may request to be reassigned beginning with vacancies in other crafts in the same installation; then vacancies in the same craft in other installations; and finally vacancies in other crafts in other installations making the designations to minimize relocation hardships to the extent practicable.
e.	Part-time flexibles reassigned to another craft in the same installation shall be returned to the first part-time flexible vacancy within the craft and level from which reassigned.
f.	Part-time flexibles reassigned to other installations have retreat rights to the next such vacancy according to their standing on the part-time flexible roll in the losing installation but such retreat right does not extend to part-time flexibles who elect to request reassignment in place of the junior part-time flexibles.
g.	The right to return is dependent upon a written request made at the time of reassignment from the losing installation and such request shall be honored unless it is withdrawn or an opportunity to return is declined.
D. Part-Time Regular Employees
Part-time regular employees assigned in the craft units shall be considered to be in a separate category. All provisions of this Section apply to part-time regular employees within their own category.
51
Article 12.6
Section 6. Transfers
A.	Installation heads will consider requests for transfers submitted by employees from other installations.
B.	Providing a written request for a voluntary transfer has been submitted, a written acknowledgement shall be given in a timely manner.
(Additional reassignment and probationary period provisions regarding City Carrier Assistant Employees are found in Appendix B.)
[see Memos, pages 188-193]
ARTICLE 13
ASSIGNMENT OF ILL OR INJURED REGULAR
WORKFORCE EMPLOYEES
Section 1.	Introduction
A.	Part-time regular schedule employees assigned in the craft unit shall be considered to be in a separate category. All provisions of this Article apply to part-time regular schedule employees within their own category.
B.	The U.S. Postal Service and the Union recognizing their responsibility to aid and assist deserving full-time regular or part-time flexible employees who through illness or injury are unable to perform their regularly assigned duties, agree to the following provisions and conditions for reassignment to temporary or permanent light duty or other assignments. It will be the responsibility of each installation head to implement the provisions of this Agreement within the installation, after local negotiations.
Section 2.	Employee’s Request for Reassignment
A.	Temporary Reassignment
Any full-time regular or part-time flexible employee recuperating from a serious illness or injury and temporarily unable to perform the assigned duties may voluntarily submit a written
52
Article I3.2.B.2
request to the installation head for temporary assignment to a light duty or other assignment. The request shall be supported by a medical statement from a licensed physician or by a written statement from a licensed chiropractor stating, when possible, the anticipated duration of the convalescence period. Such employee agrees to submit to a further examination by a physician designated by the installation head, if that official so requests.
B.	Permanent Reassignment
1.	Any ill or injured full-time regular or part-time flexible employee having a minimum of five years of postal service, or any full-time regular or part-time flexible employee who sustained injury on duty, regardless of years of service, while performing the assigned duties can submit a voluntary request for permanent reassignment to light duty or other assignment to the installation head if the employee is permanently unable to perform all or part of the assigned duties. The request shall be accompanied by a medical certificate from a physician designated by the installation head giving full evidence of the physical condition of the employee, the need for reassignment, and the ability of the employee to perform other duties. A certificate from the employee’s personal physician will not be acceptable.
2.	The following procedures are the exclusive procedures for resolving a disagreement between the employee’s physician and the physician designated by the USPS concerning the medical condition of an employee who has requested a permanent light duty assignment. These procedures shall not apply to cases where the employee’s medical condition arose out of an occupational illness or injury. On request of the Union, a third physician will be selected from a list of five Board Certified Specialists in the medical field for the condition in question, the list to be supplied by the local Medical Society. The physician will be selected by the alternate striking of names from the list by the Union and the Employer. The
53
Article 13.2.B.2
Employer will supply the selected physician with all relevant facts including job description and occupational physical requirements. The decision of the third physician will be final as to the employee’s medical condition and occupational limitations, if any. Any other issues relating to the employee’s entitlement to a light duty assignment shall be resolved through the grievance-arbitration procedure. The costs of the services of the third physician shall be shared by the Union and the Employer.
C.	Installation heads shall show the greatest consideration for full-time regular or part-time flexible employees requiring light duty or other assignments, giving each request careful attention, and reassign such employees to the extent possible in the employee’s office. When a request is refused, the installation head shall notify the concerned employee in writing, stating the reasons for the inability to reassign the employee.
Section 3.	Local Implementation
Due to varied size installations and conditions within installations, the following important items having a direct bearing on these reassignment procedures (establishment of light duty assignments) should be determined by local negotiations.
A.	Through local negotiations, each office will establish the assignments that are to be considered light duty within each craft represented in the office. These negotiations should explore ways and means to make adjustments in normal assignments, to convert them to light duty assignments without seriously affecting the production of the assignment.
B.	Light duty assignments may be established from part-time hours, to consist of 8 hours or less in a service day and 40 hours or less in a service week. The establishment of such assignment does not guarantee any hours to a part-time flexible employee.
C.	Number of Light Duty Assignments. The number of assignments within each craft that may be reserved for temporary or permanent light duty assignments, consistent with good business practices, shall be determined by past experience as to the number of reassignments that can be expected during
54
Article 13.4.E
each year, and the method used in reserving these assignments to insure that no assigned full-time regular employee will be adversely affected, will be defined through local negotiations. The light duty employee’s tour hours, work location and basic work week shall be those of the light duty assignment and the needs of the service, whether or not the same as for the employee’s previous duty assignment.
Section 4.	General Policy Procedures
A.	Every effort shall be made to reassign the concerned employee within the employee’s present craft or occupational group, even if such assignment reduces the number of hours of work for the supplemental work force. After all efforts are exhausted in this area, consideration will be given to reassignment to another craft or occupational group within the same installation.
B.	The full-time regular or part-time flexible employee must be able to meet the qualifications of the position to which the employee is reassigned on a permanent basis. On a temporary reassignment, qualifications can be modified provided excessive hours are not used in the operation.
C.	The reassignment of a full-time regular or part-time flexible employee to a temporary or permanent light duty or other assignment shall not be made to the detriment of any full-time regular on a scheduled assignment or give a reassigned part-time flexible preference over other part-time flexible employees.
D.	The reassignment of a full-time regular or part-time flexible employee under the provisions of this Article to an agreed-upon light duty temporary or permanent or other assignment within the office, such as type of assignment, area of assignment, hours of duty, etc., will be the decision of the installation head who will be guided by the examining physician’s report, employee’s ability to reach the place of employment and ability to perform the duties involved.
E.	An additional full-time regular position can be authorized within the craft or occupational group to which the employee is being reassigned, if the additional position can be established out of the part-time hours being used in that opera
55
Article 13.4.E
tion without increasing the overall hour usage. If this cannot be accomplished, then consideration will be given to reassignment to an existing vacancy.
F.	The installation head shall review each light duty reassignment at least once each year, or at any time the installation head has reason to believe the incumbent is able to perform satisfactorily in other than the light duty assignment the employee occupies. This review is to determine the need for continuation of the employee in the light duty assignment. Such employee may be requested to submit to a medical review by a physician designated by the installation head if the installation head believes such examination to be necessary.
G.	The following procedures are the exclusive procedures for resolving a disagreement between the employee’s physician and the physician designated by the USPS concerning the medical condition of an employee who is on a light duty assignment. These procedures shall not apply to cases where the employee’s medical condition arose out of an occupational illness or injury. On request of the Union, a third physician will be selected from a list of five Board Certified Specialists in the medical field for the condition in question, the list to be supplied by the local Medical Society. The physician will be selected by the alternate striking of names from the list by the Union and the Employer. The Employer will supply the selected physician with all relevant facts including job description and occupational physical requirements. The decision of the third physician will be final as to the employee’s medical condition and occupational limitations, if any. Any other issues relating to the employee’s entitlement to a light duty assignment shall be resolved through the grievance-arbitration procedure. The costs of the services of the third physician shall be shared by the Union and the Employer.
H.	When a full-time regular employee in a temporary light duty assignment is declared recovered on medical review, the employee shall be returned to the employee’s former duty assignment, if it has not been discontinued. If such former regular assignment has been discontinued, the employee becomes an unassigned full-time regular employee.
I.	If a full-time regular employee is reassigned in another
56
Article 13.5.B
craft for permanent light duty and later is declared recovered, on medical review, the employee shall be returned to the first available full-time regular vacancy in complement in the employee’s former craft. Pending return to such former craft, the employee shall be an unassigned full-time regular employee. The employee’s seniority shall be restored to include service in the light duty assignment.
J.	When a full-time regular employee who has been awarded a permanent light duty assignment within the employee’s own craft is declared recovered, on medical review, the employee shall become an unassigned full-time regular employee.
K.	When a part-time flexible on temporary light duty is declared recovered, the employee’s detail to light duty shall be terminated.
L.	When a part-time flexible who has been reassigned in another craft on permanent light duty is declared recovered, such assignment to light duty shall be terminated. Section 4.1, above, does not apply even though the employee has advanced to full-time regular while on light duty.
Section 5.	Filling Vacancies Due to Reassignment of an Employee to Another Craft
When it is necessary to permanently reassign an ill or injured full-time regular or part-time flexible employee who is unable to perform the regularly assigned duties, from one craft to another craft within the office, the following procedures will be followed:
A.	When the reassigned employee is a full-time regular employee, the resulting full-time regular vacancy in the complement, not necessarily in the particular duty assignment of the losing craft from which the employee is being reassigned, shall be posted to give the senior of the full-time regular employees in the gaining craft the opportunity to be reassigned to the vacancy, if desired.
B.	If no full-time regular employee accepts the opportunity to be assigned to the vacancy in the complement, not necessarily in the particular duty assignment in the other craft, the sen-
57
Article 13.5.B
ior of the part-time flexibles on the opposite roll who wishes to accept the vacancy shall be assigned to the full-time regular vacancy in the complement of the craft of the reassigned employee.
C.	When the reassigned employee is a part-time flexible, the resulting vacancy in the losing craft shall be posted to give the senior of the full-time regular or part-time flexible employees in the gaining craft the opportunity to be assigned to the part-time flexible vacancy, if desired, to begin a new period of seniority at the foot of the part-time flexible roll.
D.	The rule in A and B, above, applies when a full-time regular employee on permanent light duty is declared recovered and is returned to the employee’s former craft, to give the senior of the full-time regular or part-time flexible employees in the gaining craft the opportunity, if desired, to be assigned in the resulting full-time regular vacancy in the complement, not necessarily in the particular duty assignment of the losing craft.
Section 6.	Seniority of an Employee Assigned to Another Craft
A.	Except as provided for in Section 4.1, above, a full-time regular employee assigned to another craft or occupational group in the same or lower level in the same installation shall take the seniority for preferred tours and assignments, whichever is the lesser of (a) one day junior to the junior full-time regular employee in the craft or occupational group, (b) retain the seniority the employee had in the employee’s former craft.
B.	A part-time flexible employee who is permanently assigned to a full-time regular or part-time flexible assignment in another craft, under the provisions of this Article, shall begin a new period of seniority. If assigned as a part-time flexible, it shall be at the foot of the part-time flexible roll.
58
Article 14.2
ARTICLE 14
SAFETY AND HEALTH
Section 1.	Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of management to provide safe working conditions in all present and future installations and to develop a safe working force. The Union will cooperate with and assist management to live up to this responsibility. The Employer will meet with the Union on a semiannual basis and inform the Union of its automated systems development programs. The Employer also agrees to give appropriate consideration to human factors in the design and development of automated systems. Human factors and ergonomics of new automated systems are a proper subject for discussion at the National Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee.
Section 2.	Cooperation
The Employer and the Union insist on the observance of safe rules and safe procedures by employees and insist on correction of unsafe conditions. Mechanization, vehicles and vehicle equipment, and the work place must be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition, including adequate occupational health and environmental conditions. The Employer shall make available at each installation forms to be used by employees in reporting unsafe and unhealthful conditions. If an employee believes he/she is being required to work under unsafe conditions, such employee may:
(a)	notify such employee’s supervisor who will immediately investigate the condition and take corrective action if necessary;
(b)	notify such employee’s steward, if available, who may discuss the alleged unsafe condition with such employee’s supervisor;
(c)	file a grievance at Formal Step A of the grievance procedure within fourteen (14) days of notifying such employee’s supervisor if no corrective action is taken during the employee’s tour; and/or
(d)	make a written report to the Union representative from
59
Article 14.2
the local Safety and Health Committee who may discuss the report with such employee’s supervisor.
Upon written request of the employee involved in an accident, a copy of the PS Form 1769 (Accident Report) will be provided.
Any grievance which has as its subject a safety or health issue directly affecting an employee(s) which is subsequently properly appealed to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 may be placed at the head of the appropriate arbitration docket at the request of the Union.
Section 3.	Implementation
To assist in the positive implementation of the program:
A.	There shall be established at the Employer’s Headquarters level, a Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee. Representation on the Committee, to be specifically determined by the Employer and the Union, shall include one person from the Union and representatives from appropriate Departments in the Postal Service. Not later than 60 days following the effective date of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, designated representatives of the Union and Management will meet for the purpose of developing a comprehensive agenda which will include all aspects of the Employer’s Safety Program. Subsequent to the development of this agenda priorities will be established and a tentative schedule will be developed to insure full discussion of all topics. Meetings may also be requested by either party for the specific purpose of discussing additional topics of interest within the scope of the Committee.
The responsibility of the Committee will be to evaluate and make recommendations on all aspects of the Employer’s Safety Program, to include program adequacy, implementation at the local level, and studies being conducted for improving the work environment.
The Chair will be designated by the Employer. The Union may designate a coordinator who, in conjunction with the Chair, shall schedule the meetings, and recommended priorities on new agenda items. In addition, the coordinator may assist the Chair in conducting the activities of the Committee. The
60
Article 14.3.D
Employer shall furnish the Union information relating to injuries, illness and safety, including the morbidity and mortality experience of employees. This report shall be in form of reports furnished OSHA on a quarterly basis.
The Headquarters level Committee will meet quarterly and the Employer and Union Representatives will exchange proposed agenda items two weeks before the scheduled meetings. If problems or items of significant, national nature arise between scheduled quarterly meetings either party may request a special meeting of the Committee. Either party will have the right to be accompanied to any Committee meeting by no more than two technical advisors.
B.	There shall be established at the Employer’s Area level, an Area Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee, which will be scheduled to meet quarterly. The Employer and Union Representatives will exchange proposed agenda items two weeks before the scheduled meetings. If problems or items of a significant, area nature arise between scheduled quarterly meetings, either party may request a special meeting of the Committee. Either party will have the right to be accompanied to any Committee meeting by no more than two technical advisors.
Representation on the Committee shall include one person from the Union and appropriate representatives from the Postal Service Area Office. The Chair will be designated by the Employer.
C.	The Employer will make Health Service available for the treatment of job related injury or illness where it determines they are needed. The Health Service will be available from any of the following sources: U.S. Public Health Service; other government or public medical sources within the area; independent or private medical facilities or services that can be contracted for; or in the event funds, spaces and personnel are available for such purposes, they may be staffed at the installation. The Employer will promulgate appropriate regulations which comply with applicable regulations of the Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs, including employee choice of health services.
D.	The Employer will comply with Section 19 of the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety and Health Act.
61
Article 14.4
Section 4.	Local Safety Committee
At each postal installation having 50 or more employees, a Joint Labor-Management Safety and Health Committee will be established. In installations having fewer than 50 employees, installation heads are encouraged to establish similar committees when requested by the Union. Where no Safety and Health Committee exists, safety and health items may be placed on the agenda and discussed at labor-management meetings. There shall be equal representation on the Committee between the Union and management. The representation on the Committee to be specifically determined by the Employer and the Union shall include one person from the Union and appropriate management representatives. The Chair will be designated by the Employer.
It is recognized that under some circumstances, the presence of an additional employee employed at the installation will be useful to the local Safety and Health Committee because of that employee’s special expertise or experience with the agenda item being discussed. Under these circumstances, which will not normally be applicable to most agenda items, the employee may, at the request of the Union, be in attendance only for the time necessary to discuss that item. Payment for the actual time spent at such meetings by the employee will be at the applicable straight-time rate, providing the time spent is a part of the employee’s regular workday.
Section 5.	Subjects for Discussion
Individual grievances shall not be made the subject of discussion during Safety and Health Committee meetings.
Section 6.	Employee Participation
It is the intent of this program to insure broad exposure to employees, to develop interest by active participation of employees, to insure new ideas being presented to the Committee and to make certain that employees in all areas of an installation have an opportunity to be represented. At the same time, it is recognized that for the program to be effective, it is desirable to provide for a continuity in the committee work from year to year. Therefore, except for the Chair and
62
Article 14.8.A
Secretary, the Committee members shall serve three-year terms and shall at the discretion of the Union be eligible to succeed themselves.
Section 7.	Local Committee Meetings
The Safety and Health Committee shall meet at least quarterly and at such other times as requested by a Committee member and approved by the Chair in order to discuss significant problems or items. The meeting shall be on official time. Each Committee member shall submit agenda items to the Secretary at least three (3) days prior to the meeting. A member of the Health Unit will be invited to participate in the meeting of the Labor-Management Safety and Health Committee when agenda item(s) relate to the activities of the Health Unit.
Section 8.	Local Committee Responsibilities
A. The Committee shall review the progress in accident prevention and health at the installation; determine program areas which should have increased emphasis; and it may investigate major accidents which result in disabling injuries. Items properly relating to employee safety and health shall be considered appropriate discussion items. Upon a timely request, information or records necessary for the local Safety and Health Committee to investigate real or potential safety and health issues will be made available to the Committee.
In addition, the Committee shall promote the cause of safety and health in the installation by:
1.	Reviewing safety and health suggestions, safety training records and reports of unsafe conditions or practices.
2.	Reviewing local safety and health rules.
3.	Identifying employee unsafe work practices and assisting in enforcing safety work rules.
4.	Reviewing updated list of hazardous materials used in the installation.
5.	Reviewing local dog bite prevention efforts.
The Committee shall at its discretion render reports to the installation head and may at its discretion make recommendations to
63
Article 14.8.A
the installation head for action on matters concerning safety and health. The installation head shall within a reasonable period of time advise the Committee that the recommended action has been taken or advise the Headquarters Safety and Health Committee and the President of the local Union as to why it has not. Any member of the Committee may also submit a written report to the Headquarters Safety and Health Committee in the event the Committee’s recommendations are not implemented.
Upon proper written request to the Chair of the Committee, on-the-spot inspection of particular troublesome areas may be made by individual Committee members or a Subcommittee or the Committee as a whole. Such request shall not be unreasonably denied. When so approved, the Committee members shall be on official time while making such inspection.
The Union representative from the local Safety and Health Committee may participate on the annual inspection, conducted by district safety and health services personnel in accordance with ELM Section 824, provided that the Union represents employees at the facility being inspected. In no case shall there be more than one NALC representative on such inspections.
The Union representative from the local Safety and Health Committee may participate on other inspections of the main facility of each post office or other installation with 100 or more workyears of employment in the regular work force, and of an individual station or branch where the station or branch has 100 or more workyears of employment in the regular work force, provided that the Union represents employees at the main facility or station or branch and provided that the Union representative is domiciled at the main facility or station or branch to be inspected. If the Union representative to the local Safety and Health Committee is not domiciled at the main facility or station or branch to be inspected and if the Union represents employees at the main facility or station or branch, at the Union’s option, representatives from the Committee may participate on the inspection (at no additional cost for the Employer) or the Union may designate representatives domiciled at the main facility or station or branch to be inspected to participate on the inspection. In no case shall there be more than one NALC representative on such inspections.
64
Article 14.8.D.2
The Union representative from the local Safety and Health Committee may participate on the annual inspection of each installation with less than 100 workyears of employment in the regular work force, where such Committee exists in the installation being inspected. In those installations that do not have a Safety and Health Committee, the inspector shall afford the opportunity for a bargaining unit employee from the Union, if it represents employees in that installation, to accompany him/her during these inspections. If requested, these bargaining unit employees should be selected by the various exclusive bargaining representatives in that installation. In no case shall there be more than one NALC representative on such inspections.
B.	An appointed member of a local committee will receive an orientation by the Employer which will include:
1.	Responsibilities of the Committee and its members.
2.	Basic elements of the Safety and Health Program.
3.	Identification of hazards and unsafe practices.
4.	Explanation of reports and statistics reviewed and analyzed by the Committee.
C.	Where an investigation board is appointed by a Vice President, Area Operations or a District Manager to investigate a fatal or serious industrial non-criminal accident and/or injury, the appropriate Union at the installation will be advised promptly. When requested by the Union, a representative from the local Safety and Health Committee will be permitted to accompany the board in its investigation.
D.	In installations where employees represented by the Union accept, handle and/or transport hazardous materials, the Employer will establish a program of promoting safety awareness through communications and/or training, as appropriate. Elements of such a program would include, but not be limited to:
1.	Informational postings, pamphlets or articles in Postal Area Bulletins.
2.	Distribution of Publication 52 to employees whose
65
Article 14.8.D.2
duties require acceptance of and handling hazardous or perishable items.
3.	On-the-job training of employees whose duties require the handling and/or transportation of hazardous or perishable items. This training will include, but is not limited to, hazard identification; proper handling of hazardous materials; personal protective equipment availability and its use; cleanup and disposal requirements for hazardous materials.
4.	All mailbags containing any hazardous materials, as defined in Publication 52, will be appropriately identified so that the employee handling the mail is aware that the mailbag contains one or more hazardous material packages.
5.	Personal protective equipment will be made available to employees who are exposed to spills and breakage of hazardous materials.
Section 9. Field Federal Safety and Health Councils
In those cities where Field Federal Safety and Health Councils exist, one representative of the Union who is on the Local Safety and Health Committee in an independent postal installation in that city and who serves as a member of such Councils, will be permitted to attend the meetings. Such employee will be excused from regularly assigned duties without loss of pay. Employer authorized payment as outlined above will be granted at the applicable straight time rate, provided the time spent in such meetings is a part of the employee’s regular work day.
(The preceding Article, Article 14, shall apply to City Carrier Assistant Employees.)

Article 15.2 Informal Step A
ARTICLE 15
GRIEVANCE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
Section 1.	Definition
A grievance is defined as a dispute, difference, disagreement or complaint between the parties related to wages, hours, and conditions of employment. A grievance shall include, but is not limited to, the complaint of an employee or of the Union which involves the interpretation, application of, or compliance with the provisions of this Agreement or any local Memorandum of Understanding not in conflict with this Agreement.
Section 2.	Grievance Procedure—Steps
Informal Step A
(a)	Any employee who feels aggrieved must discuss the grievance with the employee’s immediate supervisor within fourteen (14) days of the date on which the employee or the Union first learned or may reasonably have been expected to have learned of its cause. This constitutes the Informal Step A filing date. The employee, if he or she so desires, may be accompanied and represented by the employee’s steward or a Union representative. During the meeting the parties are encouraged to jointly review all relevant documents to facilitate resolution of the dispute. The Union also may initiate a grievance at Informal Step A within 14 days of the date the Union first became aware of (or reasonably should have become aware of) the facts giving rise to the grievance. In such case the participation of an individual grievant is not required. An Informal Step A Union grievance may involve a complaint affecting more than one employee in the office.
(b)	In any such discussion the supervisor shall have authority to resolve the grievance. The steward or other Union representative likewise shall have authority to resolve the grievance in whole or in part. The local parties are not prohibited from using the Joint Step A Grievance Form to memorialize a resolution reached at an Informal Step A Meeting. No resolution reached as a result of such discussion shall be a precedent for any purpose.
67
Article 15.2 Informa) Step A
(c)	If no resolution is reached as a result of such discussion, the Union shall be entitled to file a written appeal to Formal Step A of the grievance procedure within seven (7) days of the date of the discussion. Such appeal shall be made by completing the Informal Step A portion of the Joint Step A Grievance Form. At the request of the Union, the supervisor shall print his/her name on the Joint Step A Grievance Form and initial, confirming the date of the discussion.
Formal Step A
(a)	The Joint Step A Grievance Form appealing a grievance to Formal Step A shall be filed with the installation head or designee. In any associate post office of twenty (20) or less employees, the Employer shall designate an official outside of the installation as the Formal Step A official, and shall so notify the Union Formal Step A representative.
(b)	Any grievance initiated at Formal Step A, pursuant to Article 2 or 14 of this Agreement, must be filed by submitting a Joint Step A Grievance Form directly with the installation head within 14 days of the date on which the Union or the employee first learned or may reasonably have been expected to have learned of its cause.
(c)	The installation head or designee will meet with the steward or a Union representative as expeditiously as possible, but no later than seven (7) days following receipt of the Joint Step A Grievance Form unless the parties agree upon a later date. In all grievances at Formal Step A, the grievant shall be represented for all purposes by a steward or a Union representative who shall have authority to resolve the grievance as a result of discussions or compromise in this Step. The installation head or designee also shall have authority to resolve the grievance in whole or in part.
(d)	At the meeting the Union representative shall make a full and detailed statement of facts relied upon, contractual provisions involved, and remedy sought. The Union representative may also furnish written statements from witnesses or other individuals. The Employer representative shall also make a full and detailed statement of facts and contractual provisions
68
Article 15.2 Step B
relied upon. The parties’ representatives shall cooperate fully in the effort to develop all necessary facts, including the exchange of copies of all relevant papers or documents in accordance with Articles 17 and 31. The parties’ representatives may mutually agree to jointly interview witnesses where desirable to assure full development of all facts and contentions. In addition, in cases involving discharge either party shall have the right to present no more than two witnesses. Such right shall not preclude the parties from jointly agreeing to interview additional witnesses as provided above.
(e)	Any resolution of a grievance in Formal Step A shall be in writing or shall be noted on the Joint Step A Grievance Form, but shall not be a precedent for any purpose, unless the parties specifically so agree or develop an agreement to dispose of future similar or related problems. If the grievance is resolved, a copy of the resolution will be sent to the steward and supervisor who initially were unable to resolve the grievance.
(f)	The Formal Step A decision is to be made and the Joint Step A Grievance Form completed the day of the meeting, unless the time frame is mutually extended. The Union may appeal an impasse to Step B within seven (7) days of the date of the decision.
(g)	Additions and corrections to the Formal Step A record may be submitted by the Union with the Step B appeal letter within the time frame for initiating the Step B appeal with a copy to the management Formal Step A official. Any such statement must be included in the file as part of the grievance record in the case.
Step B:
(a)	Any appeal from an unresolved case in Formal Step A shall be in writing to the Step B team at the appropriate Step B office, with a copy to the Formal Step A representatives, and will include a copy of the Joint Step A Grievance Form, and shall specify the reasons for the appeal.
(b)	The Step B team will review the appeal and issue a joint report of the decision and any supporting findings within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the appeal at Step B unless the parties mutually agree to extend the fourteen (14) day period. The
69
Article 15.2 Step B
Step B team will give priority consideration to discussion and decision of removal cases. It is the responsibility of the Step B team to ensure that the facts and contentions of grievances are fully developed and considered, and resolve grievances jointly. The Step B team may 1) resolve the grievance 2) declare an impasse 3) hold the grievance pending resolution of a representative case or national interpretive case or 4) remand the grievance with specific instructions. In any case where the Step B team mutually concludes that relevant facts or contentions were not developed adequately in Formal Step A, they have authority to return the grievance to the Formal Step A level for full development of all facts and further consideration at that level. If the grievance is remanded, the parties’ representatives at Formal Step A shall meet within seven (7) days after the grievance is returned to Formal Step A. Thereafter, the time limits and procedures applicable to Formal Step A grievances shall apply.
(c)	The written Step B joint report shall state the reasons in detail and shall include a statement of any additional facts and contentions not previously set forth in the record of the grievance as appealed from Formal Step A. The Step B team will attach a list of all documents included in the file.
(d)	The Union’s National Business Agent (NBA) or designee may appeal an impasse directly to arbitration at the Grievance/Arbitration Processing Center within fourteen (14) days after the receipt of the Step B impasse in accordance with the procedure hereinafter set forth.
(e)	If either party’s representative at Step B or the NBA or Employer’s Area representative thereafter maintains that the grievance involves an interpretive issue under the National Agreement, or some supplement thereto which may be of general application, the issue will be discussed with the appropriate National Union/Management Representatives at the Headquarters Level. If either party’s National Representative determines the issue to be interpretive, a written notice will be sent to the other party specifying in detail the facts giving rise to the dispute, the precise interpretive issues to be decided and the initiating party’s contention. The grievance(s) shall be held at the Step B level pending discussion at the national level or the outcome of a National Arbitration award.
70
Article 15.3.B
Interpretive Step:
In any interpretive dispute properly initiated at this Step by the appropriate National Union/Management Representative, the parties shall meet at the National level promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days after initiating such dispute in an effort to define the precise issues involved, develop all necessary facts and reach agreement. The Union representative shall have authority to resolve the dispute in whole or in part. The Employer’s representative shall have authority to resolve the dispute in whole or in part. The parties’ national representatives may, by mutual agreement, return any dispute to Step B where (a) the parties agree that no national interpretive issue is fairly presented or (b) it appears that all relevant facts have not been developed adequately. In such event, the parties shall meet at Step B within fifteen (15) days after the dispute is returned to Step B. Thereafter the procedures and time limits applicable to Step B grievances shall apply. Should the parties at the National level fail to reach agreement, then within fifteen (15) days of such meeting each party shall provide the other with a statement in writing of its understanding of the issues involved, and the facts giving rise to the interpretive dispute. In the event the parties have failed to reach agreement within sixty (60) days of the initiation of the dispute, the Union then may appeal it to national arbitration within thirty (30) days thereafter. Any local grievances filed on the specific interpretive issue shall be held in abeyance at the appropriate level pending resolution of the national interpretive dispute.
Section 3.	Grievance Procedure—General
A.	The parties expect that good faith observance, by their respective representatives, of the principles and procedures set forth above will result in resolution of substantially all grievances initiated hereunder at the lowest possible step and recognize their obligation to achieve that end. At each step of the process the parties are required to jointly review the Joint Contract Administration Manual (JCAM).
B.	The failure of the employee or the Union in Informal Step A, or the Union thereafter to meet the prescribed time
71
Article 15.3.B
limits of the Steps of this procedure, including arbitration, shall be considered as a waiver of the grievance. However, if the Employer fails to raise the issue of timeliness at Formal Step A, or at the step at which the employee or Union failed to meet the prescribed time limits, whichever is later, such objection to the processing of the grievance is waived.
C.	Failure by the Employer to schedule a meeting or render a decision in any of the Steps of this procedure within the time herein provided (including mutually agreed to extension periods) shall be deemed to move the grievance to the next Step of the grievance-arbitration procedure.
D.	Where the NBA believes that grievances involve the same, or substantially similar issues or facts, one such grievance to be selected by the NBA or designee shall be designated the “representative” grievance. The Area Manager, Labor Relations or designee will determine which, if any, of those grievances will be held for the designated representative case. If the Step B team needs to identify a representative grievance for similar disputes in its jurisdiction, it must forward a copy of the relevant case files to the appropriate NBA. The Step B team will place those grievances on hold only until such time as the NBA selects a representative case and the Area Manager, Labor Relations or designee determines which, if any, of those grievances are to be held pending resolution of the representative case. Where the NBA determines a representative case will not be selected, the Step B team will process the held grievances within fourteen (14) days of the NBA’s decision. If not resolved at Step B, the “representative” grievance may be appealed to arbitration, or the issue may be referred to the parties’ national representatives at the Headquarters level in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, Step B (e). A representative case appealed to arbitration will be placed ahead of other contractual appeals on the appropriate arbitration list.
E.	Following resolution on the merits of the “representative” grievance, the parties involved in that grievance shall meet at Step B to apply the resolution to the other pending grievances.
F.	It is agreed that in the event of a dispute between the
72
Article 15.4.A.3
Union and the Employer as to the interpretation of this Agreement, such dispute may be initiated at the national level by the President of the Union. Such a dispute shall be initiated in writing and must specify in detail the facts giving rise to the dispute, the precise interpretive issues to be decided and the contention of the Union. Thereafter the parties shall meet at the interpretive step within thirty (30) days in an effort to define the precise issues involved, develop all necessary facts, and reach agreement. Should they fail to agree, then, within fifteen (15) days of such meeting, each party shall provide the other with a statement in writing of its understanding of the issues involved, and the facts giving rise to such issues. In the event the parties have failed to reach agreement within sixty (60) days of the initiation of the dispute at the interpretive step, the Union then may appeal it to arbitration, within thirty (30) days thereafter. Any local grievances filed on the specific interpretive issue shall be held in abeyance at the appropriate level pending resolution of the national interpretive dispute.
Section 4.	Arbitration
A.	General Provisions
1.	A request for arbitration shall be submitted within the specified time limit for appeal.
2.	No grievance may be arbitrated at the National level except when timely notice of appeal is given the Employer in writing by the National President of the Union. No grievance may be appealed to Regular or Expedited arbitration except when timely notice of appeal is given in writing to the appropriate management official at the Grievance/Arbitration Processing Center by the certified representative of the Union. Such representative shall be certified to appeal grievances by the National President of the Union to the Employer at the National level.
3.	All grievances appealed to arbitration will be placed on the appropriate pending arbitration list in the order in which appealed. The Employer, in consultation with the Union, will be responsible for maintaining appropriate dockets of grievances, as appealed,
73
Article 15.4.A.3
and for administrative functions necessary to assure efficient scheduling and hearing of cases by arbitrators at all levels.
4.	In order to avoid loss of available hearing time, except in National level cases, back-up cases should be scheduled to be heard in the event of late settlement or withdrawal of grievances before hearing. The designated advocates will discuss the scheduled cases at least thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled hearing date, if possible. In the event that either party withdraws a case less than five (5) days prior to the scheduled arbitration date, and the parties are unable to agree on scheduling another case on that date, the party withdrawing the case shall pay the full costs of the arbitrator for that date. In the event that the parties settle a case or either party withdraws a case five (5) or more days prior to the scheduled arbitration date, the back-up case on the appropriate arbitration list shall be scheduled. If the parties settle a case less than five (5) days prior to the scheduled arbitration date and are unable to agree to schedule another case, the parties shall share the costs of the arbitrator for that date. This paragraph shall not apply to National level arbitration cases.
5.	Arbitration hearings normally will be held during working hours where practical. Employees whose attendance as witnesses is required at hearings during their regular working hours shall be on Employer time when appearing at the hearing, provided the time spent as a witness is part of the employee’s regular working hours.
6.	All decisions of an arbitrator will be final and binding. All decisions of arbitrators shall be limited to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, and in no event may the terms and provisions of this Agreement be altered, amended, or modified by an arbitrator. Unless otherwise provided in this Article, all costs, fees, and expenses charged by an arbitrator will be shared equally by the parties.
74
Article 1S.4.B.3
7.	All arbitrators on the Regular Panels and the Expedited Panels and on the National Panel shall serve for the term of this Agreement and shall continue to serve for six (6) months after the conclusion of the collective bargaining process for a successor Agreement, unless the parties otherwise mutually agree.
8.	Arbitrators on the National Panel and on the Regular and Expedited Panels shall be selected by the method agreed upon by the parties at the National Level.
9.	In any arbitration proceeding in which a Union feels that its interests may be affected, it shall be entitled to intervene and participate in such arbitration proceeding, but it shall be required to share the cost of such arbitration equally with any or all other Union parties to such proceeding. Any dispute as to arbitrability may be submitted to the arbitrator and be determined by such arbitrator. The arbitrator’s determination shall be final and binding.
B.	Arbitration - Regular
1.	At the Grievance/Arbitration Processing Center three (3) separate lists of cases to be heard in arbitration shall be maintained: (a) one for all removal cases and cases involving suspensions for more than 14 days, (b) one for all cases referred to Expedited Arbitration, and (c) one for all other cases appealed to Regular Arbitration. Separate panels will be established for scheduling (a) removal cases and cases involving suspensions for more than 14 days, (b) for all cases referred to Expedited Arbitration, and (c) for all other cases appealed to Regular Arbitration.
2.	Cases will be scheduled for arbitration in the order in which appealed, unless the Union and Employer otherwise agree.
3.	Only discipline cases involving suspensions of 14 days or less and those other disputes as may be mutually determined by the parties shall be referred to Expedited Arbitration in accordance with Section C hereof.
75
Article 15.4.B.4
4.	Cases referred to arbitration, which involve removals or suspensions for more than 14 days, shall be scheduled for hearing at the earliest possible date in the order in which appealed.
5.	If either party concludes that a case referred to Regular Arbitration involves an interpretive issue under the National Agreement or some supplement thereto which may be of general application, that party’s representative shall request input from their appropriate National Representatives at the Headquarters level. If either party’s representative at the Headquarters level determines the case is interpretive, a notice will be sent to the other party. The case will be held pending the outcome of the National interpretive dispute. If both parties’ representatives determine the case does not involve an interpretive issue, the case, if already scheduled for arbitration, will be heard before the same arbitrator who was originally scheduled to hear the case. Further, if the hearing had convened, the case will continue at the same stage of arbitration.
6.	The arbitrators on each Regular Panel shall be scheduled to hear cases on a rotating system basis, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
7.	Normally, there will be no transcripts of arbitration hearings or filing of post-hearing briefs in cases heard in Regular Arbitration, except either party at the National level may request a transcript, and either party at the hearing may request to file a post-hearing brief. However, each party may file a written statement setting forth its understanding of the facts and issues and its argument at the beginning of the hearing and also shall be given an adequate opportunity to present argument at the conclusion of the hearing.
8.	The arbitrator in any given case should render an award therein within thirty (30) days of the close of the record in the case.
76
Article 15.4.C.3.f
C.	Arbitration - Expedited
1.	The parties agree to continue the utilization of an expedited arbitration system for disciplinary cases of 14 days suspension or less which do not involve interpretation of the Agreement and for such other cases as the parties may mutually determine.
2.	If either party concludes that the issues involved are of such complexity or significance as to warrant reference to the Regular Arbitration Panel, that party shall notify the other party of such reference at least seven (7) days prior to the scheduled time for the expedited arbitration.
3.	The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the following:
a.	the hearing shall be informal;
b.	no briefs shall be filed or transcripts made;
c.	there shall be no formal rules of evidence;
d.	the hearing shall normally be completed within one day;
e.	if the arbitrator or the parties mutually conclude at the hearing that the issues involved are of such complexity or significance as to warrant reference to the Regular Arbitration Panel, the case shall be referred to that panel; and
f.	the arbitrator may issue a bench decision at the hearing but in any event shall render a decision within forty-eight (48) hours after conclusion of the hearing. Such decision shall be based on the record before the arbitrator and may include a brief written explanation of the basis for such conclusion. These decisions will not be cited as a precedent. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding. An arbitrator who issues a bench decision shall furnish a written copy of the award to the parties within forty-eight (48) hours of the close of the hearing.
77
Article 15.4.C.4
4.	No decision by a member of the Expedited Panel in such a case shall be regarded as a precedent or be cited in any future proceeding, but otherwise will be a final and binding decision.
D.	National Level Arbitration
1.	Only cases involving interpretive issues under this Agreement or supplements thereto of general application will be arbitrated at the National level.
2.	A docket of cases appealed to arbitration at the National level shall be maintained. The arbitrators on the National Panel shall be scheduled to hear cases on a rotating system basis, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Cases on the docket will be scheduled for arbitration in the order in which appealed, unless the Union and Employer otherwise agree.
Section 5.	Administration
The parties recognize their continuing joint responsibility for efficient functioning of the grievance procedure and effective use of arbitration. Commencing April 1, 1979, and quarterly thereafter, the Employer will furnish to the President of the Union a copy of a quarterly report containing the following information covering operation of the arbitration procedure at the National level, and for each Area separately:
(a)	number of cases appealed to arbitration;
(b)	number of cases scheduled for hearing;
(c)	number of cases heard;

[see Memos, pages 197-206]
ARTICLE 16
DISCIPLINE PROCEDURE
Section 1.	Principles
In the administration of this Article, a basic principle shall be that discipline should be corrective in nature, rather than punitive. No employee may be disciplined or discharged except for just cause such as, but not limited to, insubordination, pilferage, intoxication (drugs or alcohol), incompetence, failure to perform work as requested, violation of the terms of this Agreement, or failure to observe safety rules and regulations. Any such discipline or discharge shall be subject to the grievance-arbitration procedure provided for in this Agreement, which could result in reinstatement and restitution, including back pay.
Section 2.	Discussion
For minor offenses by an employee, management has a responsibility to discuss such matters with the employee. Discussions of this type shall be held in private between the employee and the supervisor. Such discussions are not considered discipline and are not grievable. Following such discussions, there is no prohibition against the supervisor and/or the employee making a personal notation of the date and subject matter for their own personal record(s). However, no notation or other information pertaining to such discussion shall be included in the employee’s personnel folder. While such discussions may not be cited as an element of prior adverse record in any subsequent disciplinary action against an employee, they may be, where relevant and timely, relied upon to establish that employees have been made aware of their obligations and responsibilities.
79
Article 16.3
Section 3.	Letter of Warning
A letter of warning is a disciplinary notice in writing, identified as an official disciplinary letter of warning, which shall include an explanation of a deficiency or misconduct to be corrected.
Section 4.	Suspensions of 14 Days or Less
In the case of discipline involving suspensions of fourteen (14) days or less, the employee against whom disciplinary action is sought to be initiated shall be served with a written notice of the charges against the employee and shall be further informed that he/she will be suspended. A suspended employee will remain on duty during the term of the suspension with no loss of pay. These disciplinary actions shall, however, be considered to be of the same degree of seriousness and satisfy the same corrective steps in the pattern of progressive discipline as the time-off suspensions. Such suspensions are equivalent to time-off suspensions and may be cited as elements of past discipline in subsequent discipline in accordance with Article 16.10.
Section 5.	Suspensions of More Than 14 Days or Discharge
In the case of suspensions of more than fourteen (14) days, or of discharge, any employee shall, unless otherwise provided herein, be entitled to an advance written notice of the charges against him/her and shall remain either on the job or on the clock at the option of the Employer for a period of thirty (30) days. Thereafter, the employee shall remain on the rolls (nonpay status) until disposition of the case has been had either by settlement with the Union or through exhaustion of the grievancearbitration procedure. A preference eligible who chooses to appeal a suspension of more than fourteen (14) days or his/her discharge to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) rather than through the grievance-arbitration procedure shall remain on the rolls (non-pay status) until disposition of the case has been had either by settlement or through exhaustion of his/her MSPB appeal. When there is reasonable cause to believe an employee is guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be imposed, the Employer is not required to give the employee the
80
Article 16.7
full thirty (30) days advance written notice in a discharge action, but shall give such lesser number of days advance written notice as under the circumstances is reasonable and can be justified. The employee is immediately removed from a pay status at the end of the notice period.
Section 6.	Indefinite Suspension - Crime Situation
A.	The Employer may indefinitely suspend an employee in those cases where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe an employee is guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be imposed. In such cases, the Employer is not required to give the employee the full thirty (30) days advance notice of indefinite suspension, but shall give such lesser number of days of advance written notice as under the circumstances is reasonable and can be justified. The employee is immediately removed from a pay status at the end of the notice period.
B.	The just cause of an indefinite suspension is grievable. The arbitrator shall have the authority to reinstate and make the employee whole for the entire period of the indefinite suspension.
C.	If after further investigation or after resolution of the criminal charges against the employee, the Employer determines to return the employee to a pay status, the employee shall be entitled to back pay for the period that the indefinite suspension exceeded seventy (70) days, if the employee was otherwise available for duty, and without prejudice to any grievance filed under B above.
D.	The Employer may take action to discharge an employee during the period of an indefinite suspension whether or not the criminal charges have been resolved, and whether or not such charges have been resolved in favor of the employee. Such action must be for just cause, and is subject to the requirements of Section 5 of this Article.
Section 7.	Emergency Procedure
An employee may be immediately placed on an off-duty status (without pay) by the Employer, but remain on the rolls where the allegation involves intoxication (use of drugs or alcohol),
81
Article 16.7
pilferage, or failure to observe safety rules and regulations, or in cases where retaining the employee on duty may result in damage to U.S. Postal Service property, loss of mail or funds, or where the employee may be injurious to self or others. The employee shall remain on the rolls (non-pay status) until disposition of the case has been had. If it is proposed to suspend such an employee for more than thirty (30) days or discharge the employee, the emergency action taken under this Section may be made the subject of a separate grievance.
Section 8.	Review of Discipline
In no case may a supervisor impose suspension or discharge upon an employee unless the proposed disciplinary action by the supervisor has first been reviewed and concurred in by the installation head or designee.
In post offices of twenty (20) or less employees, or where there is no higher level supervisor than the supervisor who proposes to initiate suspension or discharge, the proposed disciplinary action shall first be reviewed and concurred in by a higher authority outside such installation or post office before any proposed disciplinary action is taken.
Section 9.	Veterans’ Preference
A preference eligible is not hereunder deprived of whatever rights of appeal are applicable under the Veterans’ Preference Act. If the employee appeals under the Veterans’ Preference Act, however, the time limits for appeal to arbitration and the normal contractual arbitration scheduling procedures are not to be delayed as a consequence of that appeal; if there is an MSPB appeal pending as of the date the arbitration is scheduled by the parties, the grievant waives access to the grievance-arbitration procedure beyond Step B.
Section 10.	Employee Discipline Records
The records of a disciplinary action against an employee shall not be considered in any subsequent disciplinary action if there has been no disciplinary action initiated against the employee for a period of two years.
Upon the employee’s written request, any disciplinary notice
82
Article 17.2.A
or decision letter will be removed from the employee’s official personnel folder after two years if there has been no disciplinary action initiated against the employee in that two-year period.
(Additional discipline procedure provisions regarding City Carrier Assistant Employees are found in Appendix B.)

Payment, when applicable, shall be in accordance with Section 4.
C.	To provide steward service to installations with twenty or less craft employees where the Union has not certified a steward, a Union representative certified to the Employer in writing and compensated by the Union may perform the duties of a steward.
D.	At the option of the Union, representatives not on the Employer’s payroll shall be entitled to perform the functions of a steward or chief steward, provided such representatives are certified in writing to the Employer at the area level and providing such representatives act in lieu of stewards designated under the provisions of 2.A or 2.B above.
E.	A steward may be designated to represent more than one craft, or to act as a steward in a craft other than his/her own, whenever the Union or Unions involved so agree, and notify the Employer in writing. Any steward designations across craft lines must be in accordance with the formula set forth in Section 2.A above.
Section 3.	Rights of Stewards
When it is necessary for a steward to leave his/her work area to investigate and adjust grievances or to investigate a specific problem to determine whether to file a grievance, the steward shall request permission from the immediate supervisor and such request shall not be unreasonably denied.
In the event the duties require the steward leave the work area and enter another area within the installation or post office, the steward must also receive permission from the supervisor from the other area he/she wishes to enter and such request shall not be unreasonably denied.
84
Article 17.4
The steward, chief steward or other Union representative properly certified in accordance with Section 2 above may request and shall obtain access through the appropriate supervisor to review the documents, files and other records necessary for processing a grievance or determining if a grievance exists and shall have the right to interview the aggrieved employee(s), supervisors and witnesses during working hours. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.
While serving as a steward or chief steward, an employee may not be involuntarily transferred to another tour, to another station or branch of the particular post office or to another independent post office or installation unless there is no job for which the employee is qualified on such tour, or in such station or branch, or post office.
If an employee requests a steward or Union representative to be present during the course of an interrogation by the Inspection Service, such request will be granted. All polygraph tests will continue to be on a voluntary basis.
Section 4.	Payment of Stewards
The Employer will authorize payment only under the following conditions:
Grievances—Informal and Formal Step A: The aggrieved and one Union steward (only as permitted under the formula in Section 2.A) for time actually spent in grievance handling, including investigation and meetings with the Employer. The Employer will also compensate a steward for the time reasonably necessary to write a grievance. In addition, the Employer will compensate any witnesses for the time required to attend a Formal Step A meeting.
Meetings called by the Employer for information exchange and other conditions designated by the Employer concerning contract application.
Employer authorized payment as outlined above will be granted at the applicable straight time rate, providing the time spent is a part of the employee’s or steward’s (only as provided for under the formula in Section 2.A) regular work day.
85
Article 17.4
The Postal Service will compensate the Union’s primary Step B representatives at their appropriate rate of pay on a no loss, no gain basis. Activated back up Step B representatives will be compensated on the same basis for time actually spent as Step B representatives.
Section 5.	Labor-Management Committee Meetings
A.	The Union through its designated agents shall be entitled at the national, area, and local levels, and at such other intermediate levels as may be appropriate, to participate in regularly scheduled Joint Labor-Management Committee meetings for the purpose of discussing, exploring, and considering with management matters of mutual concern; provided neither party shall attempt to change, add to or vary the terms of this Collective Bargaining Agreement.
B.	All other national level committees established pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall function as subcommittees of the national level Labor-Management Committee.
C.	Meetings at the national and area (except as to the Christmas operation) levels will not be compensated by the Employer.

Section 6.	Union Participation in New Employee Orientation
During the course of any employment orientation program for new employees, a representative of the Union representing the craft to which the new employees are assigned shall be provided ample opportunity to address such new employees, provided that this provision does not preclude the Employer from addressing employees concerning the same subject.
Health benefit enrollment information and forms will not be provided during orientation until such time as a representative of the Union has had an opportunity to address such new employees.
86
Article 17.7.B
Section 7.	Checkoff
A.	In conformity with Section 2 of the Act, 39 U.S.C. 1205, without cost to the Union, the Employer shall deduct and remit to the Union the regular and periodic Union dues from the pay of employees who are members of the Union, provided that the Employer has received a written assignment which shall be irrevocable for a period of not more than one year, from each employee on whose account such deductions are to be made. The Employer agrees to remit to the Union all deductions to which it is entitled fourteen (14) days after the end of the pay period for which such deductions are made. Deductions shall be in such amounts as are designated to the Employer in writing by the Union.

The term “unassigned regular” is used in those instances where a full-time letter carrier does not hold a duty assignment.
Positions currently designated in the Letter Carrier Craft:
City Carrier (includes the duty assignment of Official Mail Messenger Service in the Washington, D.C. Post Office)
116
Article 41.1.A.2
Special Carrier
Carrier Technician
Positions that may in the future be designated in the Letter Carrier Craft.
Changes in the foregoing position titles shall not affect the application of this provision.
When a position is under consideration for reversion, the decision to revert or not to revert the position shall be made not later than 30 days after it becomes vacant. If the decision is made not to revert, the assignment must be posted within 30 days of the date it becomes vacant. The Employer shall provide written notice to the Union, at the local level, of the assignments that are being considered for reversion and of the results of such consideration.
2.	Letter carriers temporarily detailed to a supervisory position (204b) may not bid on vacant Letter Carrier Craft duty assignments while so detailed. However, nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude such temporarily detailed employees from voluntarily terminating a 204b detail and returning to their craft position. Upon return to the craft position, such employees may exercise their right to bid on vacant letter carrier craft duty assignments.
The duty assignment of a full-time carrier detailed to a supervisory position, including a supervisory training program in excess of four months shall be declared vacant and shall be posted for bid in accordance with this Article. Upon return to the craft the carrier will become an unassigned regular. A letter carrier temporarily detailed to a supervisory position will not be returned to the craft solely to circumvent the provisions of Section l.A.2.
Form 1723, Assignment Order, shall be used in detailing letter carriers to temporary supervisor positions (204b). The Employer will provide the Union at the local level with a copy of Form(s) 1723 showing
117
Article 41.1.A.2
the beginning and ending of all such details.
3.	The existing local procedures for scheduling fixed or rotating non-work days and the existing local method of posting and of installation-wide or sectional bidding shall remain in effect unless changes are negotiated locally.
4.	No assignment shall be posted because of a change in starting time or in non-scheduled days (except as provided in Section LA.5 below). No overtime payment will be made for a permanent change in starting time.
5.	Whether or not a letter carrier route will be posted when there is a change of more than one (1) hour in starting time shall be negotiated locally.
6.	When a fixed schedule non-work day is permanently changed, the new non-work day shall be posted.
7.	Unassigned full-time carriers and full-time flexible carriers may bid on duty assignments posted for bids by employees in the craft. If the employee does not bid, assignment of the employee may be made to any vacant duty assignment for which there was no senior bidder in the same craft and installation. In the event there is more than one vacancy due to the lack of bids, these vacancies may be filled by assigning the unassigned full-time carriers and full-time flexible carriers, who may exercise their preference by use of their seniority. In the event that there are more unassigned full-time carriers and full-time flexible carriers than vacancies, these vacancies may be filled by assigning the unassigned employees by juniority.
B.	Method of Posting
1.	The notice inviting bids for Letter Carrier Craft assignments, and to such other assignments to which a letter carrier is entitled to bid, shall be posted on all official bulletin boards at the installation where the vacancy exists, including stations and branches, as to assure that it comes to the attention of employees eli
118
Article 4l.l.B.4.h
gible to submit bids. Copies of the notice shall be given to the local Union. When an absent employee has so requested in writing, stating a mailing address, a copy of any notice inviting bids from the craft employees shall be mailed to the employee by the installation head.
2.	Posting and bidding for duty assignments and/or permanent changes in fixed non-work days shall be installation-wide, unless local agreements or established past practice provide for sectional bidding or other local method currently in use.
3.	The notice shall remain posted for 10 days, unless a different length for the posting period is established by local negotiations.
4.	Information on notices shall be shown as below and shall be specifically stated:
(a)	The duty assignment by position title and number (e.g., Key or Standard).
(b)	Grade.
(c)	Hours of duty (beginning and ending), including, in the case of a Carrier Technician assignment, the hours of duty for each of the component routes.

(f)	Invitation to employees to submit bids.
(g)	Physical requirement unusual to the assignment.
(h)	If a city carrier route is involved, the carrier route number shall be designated. If a Carrier Technician assignment is involved, the route number of the Carrier Technician assignment and the route numbers of the component routes shall be designated.

(i)	Date of last inspection and date of last adjustment.
[see Memos, page 222]
C.	Successful Bidder
1.	The senior bidder meeting the qualification standards established for that position shall be designated the “successful bidder.”

123
Article 41.2.E
E.	Change in Which Seniority is Modified
When mutual exchanges are made between letter carriers from one installation to another, the carriers will retain their seniority or shall take the seniority of the other exchangee, whichever is the lesser.
F.	Return From Any Position for Which Selection Was Based on Best Qualified

Further, it is agreed that when changes of a substantive nature are made they will only be made in accordance with the contractual obligations already binding upon the parties under Article 34, “Work and/or Time Standards.”
N.	Letter Carriers may cross lawns while making deliveries if customers do not object and there are no particular hazards to the carrier.
O.	The following provision without modification shall be made a part of a local agreement when requested by the local branch of the NALC during the period of local implementation; provided, however, that the local branch may on a onetime basis during the life of this Agreement elect to delete the provision from its local agreement:
“When a letter carrier route or full-time duty assignment,
126
Article 4 U.S
other than the letter carrier route(s) or full-time duty assignments) of the junior employee(s), is abolished at a delivery unit as a result of, but not limited to, route adjustments, highway, housing projects, all routes and full-time duty assignments at that unit held by letter carriers who are junior to the carrier(s) whose route(s) or full-time duty assignments) was abolished shall be posted for bid in accordance with the posting procedures in this Article.”
That provision may, at the local NALC Branch’s request during local implementation, be made applicable (including the right to delete it) to selected delivery units within an installation. For purposes of applying that provision, a delivery unit shall be a postal station, branch or ZIP code area. Any letter carrier in a higher level craft position who loses his/her duty assignment due solely to the implementation of that provision shall be entitled to the protected salary rate provisions (Article 9, Section 6) of this Agreement.

Q.	The Employer agrees to continue efforts to improve the comfort and temperature level in postal vehicles.
R.

These routes are generally located in resort or vacation areas. The following steps will be taken in regard to the service of those routes during the abnormal period or periods:
(a)	The duration of the seasonal periods shall be determined by management after discussion with the local Union.
(b)	During those periods, auxiliary assistance if requested shall be provided to the maximum extent possible.

Appendix B
APPENDIX B
Appendix B is the reprinting of Section I of the 2013 Das Award, the creation of a new non-career employee category.
I. NON-CAREER COMPLEMENT
The parties shall establish a new job classification called City Carrier Assistant (CCA).
1.	GENERAL PRINCIPLES
a.	The CCA work force is comprised of noncareer, city letter carrier bargaining unit employees.
b.	CCA employees shall be hired for terms of 360 calendar days and will have a break in service of 5 days between appointments.
c.	The provisions for determining the number of CCA employees that may be employed are found in Article 7.1 C.
d.	The Postal Service shall provide a report every other pay period with information needed to monitor compliance with the above provision.
e.	The hourly rate for CCA employees shall be established in accordance with Table 2, Step BB. Transitional Employees (TEs) employed as of the date of this Agreement who become CCAs shall be paid at Step AA of Table 2. The parties may mutually agree to increase the CCA pay rates should they determine it necessary for the recruitment or retention of CCAs. Adjustments to salary shall be in accordance with Article 9.7.
f.	When hired, a CCA's relative standing in an installation is determined by his/her original CCA appointment date to the installation, using Article 41.2.B.6.(a) where applicable, and adding the time served as a city letter carrier transitional employee for appointments made after September 29, 2007 in any installation.
g.	When the Postal Service hires new city letter carrier career employees, CCA employees within the installation will be converted to full-time regular career status to fill such vacancies based on their relative standing. A CCA who does
134
Appendix B
not accept the career opportunity will not lose his/her relative standing for future career opportunities.
h.	CCA employees may be separated at any time during their term of appointment for lack of work. Separations for lack of work shall be by inverse relative standing in the installation. Such separations are not grievable except where the separations are pretextual. CCAs separated for lack of work will be given preference for reappointment ahead of other CCAs with less relative standing in the installation if the need for hiring arises within 18 months of their separation.
i.	CCA employees are separated for 5 days between appointments. When operational circumstances indicate that reappointment for a CCA(s) is not needed and the installation employs a CCA(s) with lower relative standing, the CCA(s) will be reappointed and the CCA(s) with the lower standing in the installation will be separated instead. Such separation of a CCA(s) with the lowest relative standing is not grievable except where the separation is pretextual. These CCAs separated for lack of work during or upon completion of their term of appointment will be given a preference for reappointment ahead of other CCAs with less relative standing in the installation provided the need for hiring arises within 18 months of separation.
j.	All current transitional employees will be given the opportunity to be employed as CCAs, consistent with their test results and legal requirements. These employment opportunities and the phasing out of the transitional employee category will occur within 90 days of the effective date of this Agreement.
k.	As Part-time Flexible (PTF) employees are converted to full-time in accordance with existing contractual processes, the PTF classification shall be phased out. There shall be no new hiring of PTF employees.
1.	CCA is the only noncareer category in the NALC bargaining unit.
m.	Opting provisions applicable to CCA employees (Article 41.2.B.4) are applicable beginning 90 days after the effective date of this Agreement.
135

Section 1. Definition and Use
* * * * *
B.	Transitional Work Force (Note: The transitional work force will be phased out within 90 days of the effective date of this Agreement.)
*****
C.	City Carrier Assistant Employees
The city carrier assistant work force shall be comprised of noncareer, bargaining unit employees, as follows:
1.	City carrier assistants may perform the full range of letter carrier duties. The number of city carrier assistants who may be employed in any reporting period shall not exceed 15% of the total number of full-time career city carriers in that District.
2.	In order to meet the fundamental changes in the business environment, including, but not limited to flexible windows which may be necessary to develop and provide new products and services, the Employer has the right to hire up to 8,000 CCAs in addition to those authorized in paragraph 1, above. The number of such city carrier assistants who may be employed in any reporting period shall not exceed 8% of the total number of full-time career city carriers in that District. CCAs hired under this Section will be so designated on their PS Form 50.
136
Appendix B

A.	Article 6 - No Layoffs or Reduction in Force
Prior to laying off career city letter carriers in an installation, management will, to the extent possible, offer the impacted employee the opportunity to work any letter carrier assignments being performed by CCA employees, or if necessary, separate CCA employees. There will be no out-of-schedule pay provided to the impacted employees.
B.	Article 10 - Leave
GENERAL
1.	Purpose. Annual leave is provided to CCA employees for rest, recreation, emergency purposes, and illness or injury.
a.	Accrual of Annual Leave. CCA employees earn annual leave based on the number of hours in which they are in a pay status in each pay period.
Rate of Accrual	Hours in Pay Status	Hours of Annual Leave Earned Per Pay Period
1 hour for each unit of 20 hours in pay status in each pay period	20	1
	40	2
	60	3
	80	4 (max.)
b.	Biweekly Crediting. Annual leave accrues and is credited in whole hours at the end of each biweekly pay period.
c.	Payment For Accumulated Annual Leave. A separating CCA employee may receive a lump-sum payment for accumulated annual leave subject to the following condition:
141
Appendix B
A CCA employee whose separation is effective before the last Friday of a pay period does not receive credit or terminal leave payment for the leave that would have accrued during that pay period.
AUTHORIZING ANNUAL LEAVE
1.	General. Except for emergencies, annual leave for CCA employees must be requested on Form 3971 and approved in advance by the appropriate supervisor.
2.	Emergencies and Illness or Injury. An exception to the advance approval requirement is made for emergencies and illness or injury; however, in these situations, the CCA employee must notify appropriate postal authorities as soon as possible as to the emergency or illness/injury and the expected duration of the absence. As soon as possible after return to duty, CCA employees must submit Form 3971 and explain the reason for the emergency or illness/injury to their supervisor. Supervisors approve or disapprove the leave request. When the request is disapproved, the absence may be recorded as AWOL at the discretion of the supervisor as outlined in Item 2, Approval/ Disapproval, under Form 3971 below.
UNSCHEDULED ABSENCE
1.	Definition. Unscheduled absences are any absences from work that are not requested and approved in advance.
2.	CCA Employee Responsibilities. CCA employees are expected to maintain their assigned schedule and must make every effort to avoid unscheduled absences. In addition, CCA employees must provide acceptable evidence for absences when required.
FORM 3971, REQUEST FOR, OR NOTIFICATION OF, ABSENCE
1.	Purpose. Application for annual leave is made in writing, in duplicate, on Form 3971, Request for, or Notification of, Absence.
2.	Approval/Disapproval. The supervisor is responsible for approving or disapproving application for annual leave by signing Form 3971, a copy of which is given to the CCA employee. If a supervisor does not approve an application for leave, the disapproved block on Form 3971 is checked and the 142
Appendix B
reasons given in writing in the space provided. When a request is disapproved, the reasons for disapproval must be noted. AWOL determinations must be similarly noted.
C.	Article 12 - Reassignment
In order to minimize the impact on employees in the regular work force, the Employer agrees to offer the impacted employee the opportunity to work any letter carrier duty assignments performed by CCA employees, or to separate, to the extent possible, CCA employees working in the city carrier craft and installation prior to excessing any regular city letter carrier out of the installation.
D.	Article 15 - Grievance Procedure
CCA employees will have access to the grievance procedure for those provisions that apply to CCA employees.
E.	Article 16 - Discipline Procedure
CCAs may be separated for lack of work at any time before the end of their term. Separations for lack of work shall be by inverse relative standing in the installation. Such separation of the CCA(s) with the lowest relative standing is not grievable except where it is alleged that the separation is pretextual. CCAs separated for lack of work before the end of their term will be given preference for reappointment ahead of other CCAs with less relative standing in the installation, provided the need for hiring arises within 18 months of their separation.
CCAs may be disciplined or removed within the term of their appointment for just cause and any such discipline or removal will be subject to the grievance arbitration procedure, provided that within the immediately preceding six months, the employee has completed ninety (90) work days, or has been employed for 120 calendar days (whichever comes first) of their initial appointment. A CCA who has previously satisfied the 90/120 day requirement either as a CCA or transitional employee (with an appointment made after September 29, 2007), will have access to the grievance procedure without regard to his/her length of service as a CCA. Further, while in any such grievance the concept of progressive discipline will not apply, discipline should be corrective in nature.
143
Appendix B
In the case of removal for cause within the term of an appointment, a CCA shall be entitled to advance written notice of the charges against him/her in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the National Agreement.
F.	Article 21 - Health Insurance
After an initial appointment for a 360-day term and upon reappointment to another 360-day term, any eligible noncareer CCA employee who wants to pay health premiums to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program on a pre-tax basis will be required to make an election to do so in accordance with applicable procedures. A previous appointment as a transitional employee will count toward qualifying for participation in FEHB, in accordance with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations. The total cost of health insurance is the responsibility of the noncareer CCA employee except as provided below.
Beginning in Plan Year 2014, the Postal Service will make a bi-weekly contribution to the total premium for any CCA employee who wishes to participate in the USPS Noncareer Health Care Plan (USPS Plan) equal to the greater of (a) SI 25, or (b) the minimum required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and applicable regulations, for self-only. The CCA employee is fully responsible for the cost of premiums for any health insurance plan beyond a self-only plan. Any CCA employee wishing to make their health care contribution on a pre-tax basis will be required to make an election to do so in accordance with applicable procedures. All CCA employees will be eligible for the USPS Plan within a reasonable period from the date of hire and entry into a pay status, consistent with the requirements established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
If for any reason the USPS Plan is not available to a CCA, or if a CCA elects more than self-only coverage, the Postal Service will make a bi-weekly contribution for any eligible CCA who selects an NALC Consumer Driven Health Plan equal to the greater of (a) $125, or (b) the minimum required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and applicable regulations, for self-only.

Re: City Carrier Assistants - Opting
With the establishment of the city carrier assistant position, the following changes concerning opting will be incorporated in to the Joint Contract Administration Manual.
JCAM Page 41-10
Eligibility for opting. Full-time reserve letter carriers, full-time flexible schedule letter carriers, unassigned full-time carriers, part-time flexible carriers, and city carrier assistants may all opt for hold-down assignments.
JCAM Page 41-13
Removal From Hold-Down. There are exceptions to the rule against involuntarily removing employees from their holddowns. Part-time flexible and city carrier assistant employees may be "bumped" from their hold-downs to provide sufficient work for full-time employees. Full-time employees are guaranteed forty hours of work per service week. Thus they may be assigned work on routes held down by part-time or city carrier assistant employees if there is not sufficient work available for them on a particular day. (H1N-5D-C 6601, September 11, 1985, M-00097)
JCAM Page 41-14
In such situations, the part-time flexible or city carrier assistant employee's opt is not terminated. Rather, the employee is temporarily "bumped" on a day-to-day basis. Bumping is still a last resort, as reflected in a Step 4 settlement. (H1N-5D-C 7441, October 25, 1983, M-00293), which provides that:
A PTF or city carrier assistant, temporarily assigned to a route under Article 41, Section 2.B. shall work the duty assignment unless there is no other eight-hour assignment available to which a full-time carrier could be assigned. A regular carrier
148
Appendix B
may be required to work parts or "relays" of routes to make up a full-time assignment. Additionally, the route of the "holddown" to which the PTF or city carrier assistant opted may be pivoted if there is insufficient work available to provide a full-time carrier with eight hours of work.
Another exception occurs if the Local Memorandum allows the regular carrier on a route to "bump" the Carrier Technician to another route when the regular carrier is called in on a nonscheduled day to work on his/her own route. In such cases, the Carrier Technician is allowed to displace an employee who has opted on an assignment on the technician's string if none of the other routes on the string are available. In such cases a part-time flexible or city carrier assistant employee’s opt is not terminated. Rather, he/she is temporarily "bumped" on a day-to-day basis. (See Step 4, N8-N-0176, January 9, 1980, M-00154.)
PTF Pay Status and Opting. Although a part-time flexible or city carrier assistant employee who obtains a hold-down must be allowed to work an assignment for the duration of the vacancy, he or she does not assume the pay status of the full-time regular carrier being replaced. A part-time flexible or city carrier assistant carrier who assumes the duties of a full-time regular by opting is still paid as a part-time flexible or city carrier assistant as appropriate during the hold-down. While they must be allowed to work the assignment for the duration of the vacancy, PTFs and city carrier assistants are not guaranteed eight hours daily or forty hours weekly work by virtue of the hold-down alone.
Nor do PTFs or city carrier assistants receive holiday pay for holidays which fall within the hold-down period by virtue of the hold-down. Rather, part-time flexible employees continue to be paid for holidays as PTFs per Article 11.7. City carrier assistants are not covered by Article 11.7.
JCAM Page 41-15
Remedies and Opting. Where the record is clear that a PTF or city carrier assistant was the senior available employee exercising a preference on a qualifying vacancy, but was denied the opt in violation of Article 41.2.B.4, an appropriate
149
Appendix B
remedy would be a “make whole" remedy in which the employee would be compensated for the difference between the number of hours actually worked and the number of hours he/she would have worked had the opt been properly awarded.
In those circumstances in which a PTF or city carrier assistant worked forty hours per week during the opting period (or forty-eight hours in the case of a six-day opt), an instructional "cease and desist" resolution would be appropriate. This would also be an appropriate remedy in those circumstances in which a reserve letter carrier or an unassigned letter carrier was denied an opt - in violation of Article 41.2.B.3.
These changes will be implemented with the establishment of the city carrier assistant positions and be enforced without regard to the actual publishing of these changes in a revised JCAM incorporating these changes.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS, AFL-CIO
Re: Deaf and Hard of Hearing
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING
MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY
Management has an obligation to reasonably accommodate Deaf and Hard of Hearing employees and applicants who request assistance in communicating with or understanding others in work related situations, such as:
a.	During investigatory interviews which may lead to discipline, discussions with a supervisor on job performance or conduct, or presentation of a grievance.
b.	During some aspects of training including formal classroom instruction.
c.	During portions of EAP programs and EEO counselings.
d.	In critical elements of the selection process such as during testing and interviews.
e.	During employee orientations, safety talks, CFC and savings bond drive kickoff meetings.
f.	During the filing or meetings concerning an employee’s OWCP claim.
Reasonable accommodation must be approached on a highly individualized, case by case basis. The individual’s input must be considered prior to making a decision regarding accommodation.
152
IMPLEMENTATION
This obligation is met by selecting an appropriate resource from the variety of resources available. In selecting a resource, the following, among others, should be considered, as appropriate:
— The ability of the deaf or hard of hearing employee to understand various methods of communication and the ability of others to understand the deaf or hard of hearing employee.
— The importance of the situation as it relates to work requirements, job rights, and benefits.
— The availability and cost of the alternative resources under consideration.
— Whether the situation requires confidentiality.
Available resources which should be considered include:
a.	Installation heads are authorized to pay for certified interpreters. Every effort will be made to provide certified interpreters when deemed necessary by an application of the principles set forth herein.
b.	In some states, the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) provides interpreters at no charge. When a decision is made that an interpreter is the appropriate accommodation and a DVR interpreter is not available, other methods of securing an interpreter should be used.
c.	Volunteer interpreters or individuals skilled in signing may be obtained from the work force or from the community. The skill level of such persons should be considered.
d.	In some situations, written communications may be appropriate. The deaf or hard of hearing employee’s ability to understand written communications should be considered.
e.	Supervisors, training specialists, EAP, and EEO counselors may be trained in sign language.
f.	Deaf or hard of hearing applicants should normally be
153
scheduled for a specific examination time when an interpreter will be available.
g.	State or Federal relay services may provide a way for a deaf or hard of hearing employee to conduct postal business by telephone with other employees and customers.
Management will provide the following assistance for deaf and/or hard of hearing employees:
a.	All films or videotapes designed for the training or instruction of regular work force employees developed on or after October 1, 1987, shall be opened or closed captioned. To the extent practicable, existing films or videotapes developed nationally that will continue to be used by deaf or hard of hearing employees with some frequency, will be opened or closed captioned.
b.	Special telecommunications devices for the deaf will be installed in all postal installations employing deaf employees in the regular work force. Special telecommunications devices or telephone volume control devices will be installed for hard of hearing employees whenever a hard of hearing employee requests and needs such a reasonable accommodation in order to communicate by phone. These devices will be available to deaf and/or hard of hearing employees for official business and in the case of personal emergencies. As appropriate, Management will provide training to staff on the use of these special telecommunications devices.
c.	A visual alarm will be installed on all moving powered industrial equipment in all postal installations employing deaf employees in the regular work force or in any installation where such a reasonable accommodation is requested and necessary for a hard of hearing employee.
d.	Visual fire alarm will be installed in all new postal installations (installations for which the U.S. Postal Service, as of June 12, 1991, had not awarded a con
154
tract for the design of the building) where the Postal Service installs audible fire alarms. The parties will discuss and seek to agree at the local level about the installation in such other facilities as may be appropriate.
JOINT LABOR-MANAGEMENT MEETINGS
Discussion of problem areas with regard to the use of certified sign interpreters, enhancement of job opportunities for the deaf and hard of hearing, type of special telecommunications devices or volume control devices to be installed, installation of visual alarms or other systems such as tactile devices at other than new postal installations, and the availability of new technologies which may help deaf and hard of hearing employees perform a variety of tasks are appropriate matters for consideration at Joint Labor-Management meetings. Discussion of such matters at Labor-Management meetings is not a prerequisite to the filing or processing of a grievance.

This letter memorandum sets forth our mutual intent regarding the attached Memorandum of Understanding relating to maximization.
1.	This Memorandum of Understanding is in settlement of the arbitration pending in case No. N8-NA-141, and
157
satisfies the obligations of the parties pursuant to the Arbitrator’s decision in N8-NA-0141 and the Memorandum of Understanding relating to maximization dated September 15, 1978.
2.	The initial 6 month measuring period to be evaluated pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding shall be August 1, 1980, through January 31, 1981. Conversions based upon this initial period shall be made no sooner than April 1, 1981, and are expected to be concluded by May 1, 1981. This conversion process shall not interfere with or delay conversions which would otherwise be implemented pursuant to the existing National Agreement. Henceforth, the 6 month measuring periods will be monitored on a continuing basis, and conversions required shall be implemented promptly.
3.	Conversions required pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding shall be in addition to (but not duplicative of) conversions that may be required pursuant to existing provisions of the National Memorandum of Understanding. The criteria established by this Memorandum of Understanding are supplementary to, not in limitation or diminishment of, existing criteria in the National Agreement.
4.	Subject to operational requirements, the intent of the parties is to avoid unnecessary disruptions in existing patterns of reporting times, non-scheduled days and reporting locations for those PTFs converted pursuant to these criteria, to the extent the duties of the position converted are consistent with those performed by the PTF during the measuring period.
5.	Employees converted to full-time positions pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding may bid on assignments posted for bids by employees in the craft, and shall be full-time regular city letter carriers under the National Agreement.
6.	In those installations where conversions have been made under this Memorandum of Understanding, and
158
there are subsequent reversions or excessing, any reductions in full-time letter carrier positions shall be from among those position(s) converted pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding until they are exhausted.
7.	The parties will establish a national level committee to review and resolve any problems relating to the initial period of implementation, in accordance with their mutually expressed intentions. Accordingly, grievances filed at the local level relating to the initial period of implementation shall be stayed without prejudice to either party, and the time limits deemed extended by mutual consent, in order to permit review by the national committee. Upon such review, questions of fact may be referred to the normal grievance machinery.
8.	The parties recognize their continuing obligation to discuss other respects in which maximization may be implemented in accordance with the National Agreement.

2.	Biweekly Crediting. Annual leave accrues and is credited in whole hours at the end of each biweekly pay period.
3.	Payment For Accumulated Annual Leave. A separating transitional employee may receive a lump-sum payment for accumulated annual leave subject to the following condition:
a. A transitional employee whose separation is effective before the last Friday of a pay period does not receive credit or terminal leave payment for the leave that would have accrued during that pay period.
11. AUTHORIZING ANNUAL LEAVE
A.	General. Except for emergencies, annual leave for transitional employees must be requested on Form 3971 and approved in advance by the appropriate supervisor.
B.	Emergencies and Illness or Injury. An exception to the advance approval requirement is made for emergencies and
160
illness or injury; however, in these situations, the transitional employee must notify appropriate postal authorities as soon as possible as to the emergency or illness/injury and the expected duration of the absence. As soon as possible after return to duty, transitional employees must submit Form 3971 and explain the reason for the emergency or illness/injury to their supervisor. Supervisors approve or disapprove the leave request. When the request is disapproved, the absence may be recorded as AWOL at the discretion of the supervisor as outlined in Section IV.B below.
III.UNSCHEDULED ABSENCE
A.	Definition. Unscheduled absences are any absences from work that are not requested and approved in advance.
B.	Transitional Employee Responsibilities. Transitional employees are expected to maintain their assigned schedule and must make every effort to avoid unscheduled absences. In addition, transitional employees must provide acceptable evidence for absences when required.
IV. FORM 3971, REQUEST FOR, OR NOTIFICATION OF, ABSENCE
A.	Purpose. Application for annual leave is made in writing, in duplicate, on Form 3971, Request for, or Notification of, Absence.
B.	Approval/Disapproval. The supervisor is responsible for approving or disapproving application for annual leave by signing Form 3971, a copy of which is given to the transitional employee. If a supervisor does not approve an application for leave, the disapproved block on Form 3971 is checked and the reasons given in writing in the space provided. When a request is disapproved, the reasons for disapproval must be noted. AWOL determinations must be similarly noted.
ARTICLE 12
Reassignment of Career Employees Outside of a Section, Craft, or Installation.
a.	Prior to reassigning career employees outside of a section,
161
the craft, or installation, management will offer impacted career employees, on a seniority basis, the opportunity to work any existing letter carrier craft transitional assignments within the installation.
b.	There will be no out-of-schedule pay provided to the impacted employees for these temporary assignments.
TE Hire versus Excessing
A full time letter carrier may not be excessed and the resulting vacancy filled by a TE, except where management can demonstrate that, as a result of legitimate operational changes, there is insufficient work to continue to support a full-time position. For example, management may not abolish a full-time route position and excess the full-time letter carrier and hire or assign one or more TEs to perform the work of the abolished position, unless management can demonstrate that the work cannot be performed on a full-time basis in compliance with the requirements of the National Agreement.
ARTICLE 16
Transitional employees may be separated at any time upon completion of their assignment or for lack of work. Such separation is not grievable except where the separation is pretextual. Transitional employees may otherwise be removed for just cause and any such removal will be subject to the grievancearbitration procedure, provided the employee has completed ninety (90) work days, or has been employed for 120 calendar days, whichever comes first. Further, in any such grievance, the concept of progressive discipline will not apply. The issue will be whether the employee is guilty of the charge against him or her. Where the employee is found guilty, the arbitrator shall not have the authority to modify the discharge. In the case of removal for cause, a transitional employee shall be entitled to advance written notice of the charges against him/her in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the National Agreement.
ARTICLE 21
After an initial appointment for a 360-day term and upon reappointment to another 360-day term, any eligible noncareer
162
transitional employee who wants to pay health premiums to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program on a pre-tax basis will be required to make an election to do so in accordance with applicable procedures. The total cost of health insurance is the responsibility of the noncareer transitional employee.

Re: TRANSITIONAL EMPLOYEES/PART-TIME FLEXIBLE CONVERSIONS
1.	All part-time flexibles (PTFs) currently on the rolls will be offered an opportunity to convert to full-time regular status by November 20, 1994. The conversion opportunity may be contingent on the PTF’s agreement to move to an available full-time assignment during this period. However, it is the intent of the parties that any such requirement to change offices will not be utilized by management as a device to discourage conversions and that inconvenience and disruption to PTFs will be minimized.
PTFs will be converted to available full-time assignments in their current installation. If insufficient fulltime assignments are available to accommodate all PTFs in an installation, the remaining PTFs will be offered the opportunity to transfer to available full-time assignments within the commuting area, and the local union will be provided a list of all such assignments. The local union representative will be responsible for ascertaining the preferences, by use of seniority, of the PTFs who decide to accept a conversion opportunity in another installation and for communicating that preference to management. If PTFs from different installations seek
163
the same assignment in another installation, craft seniority will determine which PTF gets that conversion opportunity.
If the foregoing process does not result in the offer of a conversion to all PTFs in an installation, the Postal Service will identify other conversion opportunities, including assignments outside the commuting area, during the conversion period. Any decision by a PTF to transfer to another office under this agreement will be considered voluntary.
2.	In lieu of the DSSA analysis provided in the January 16, 1992, NALC Transitional Employee (TE) arbitration award, the parties will use the impact formula contained in the September 21, 1992, Hempstead Memorandum of Understanding to determine the number of TE hours allowed in a delivery unit due to automation impact. All such TEs will be separated in a delivery unit when Delivery Point Sequencing (DPS) is on-line and operational.
3.	The parties further agree that in offices (automation impacted or non-impacted) where the number of PTF conversions exceeds the number of TEs allowed under the above impact formula, additional TEs may be hired to replace such PTF attrition. All such TEs will be separated from the rolls by November 20, 1994.
4.	All pending national grievances seeking conversion of PTFs will be resolved by offering the affected PTFs the opportunity to convert to full-time regular assignments on a priority basis pursuant to this agreement. This agreement is without prejudice to the positions of either party with respect to any interpretive issue.
5.	The parties at the local level will meet to review the current TE complement and pending TE or PTF grievances as follows:
•	The meeting will occur after the joint training and during the local meeting on Hempstead issues;
•	The parties will attempt to resolve any pending grievances, including appropriate remedies for
164
violations, if any. The Postal Service’s liability, if any, will be limited to any TE hours in excess of that allowed by paragraphs 2 and 3 above which occurred prior to the date of this agreement;
•	If TE hours in a delivery unit exceed that allowed by paragraphs 2 and 3 above, management must, no later than 3/1/93, either: (1) relocate TEs to another delivery unit to stay within the allowable limits; or (2) reduce work hours per TE, so as to stay within the allowable limits; or (3) remove excess TEs from the rolls.
6.	The parties herein express the desirability of affording future career employment opportunities to TEs. Consistent with that view, the parties agree to jointly explore the feasibility of such career opportunities, consistent with applicable law.

Re: Transitional Employee Employment Opportunities
In the interest of enhancing career employment opportunities for NALC transitional employees (TE), the Postal Service and the NALC agree to the following:
1.	NALC TEs who have completed 180 days of employment as a TE and are still on the TE rolls may take the entrance examination for a career city letter carrier position. Only one such opportunity will be provided each eligible TE pursuant to this memorandum.
2.	Eligible TEs who wish to take the examination must submit their request to their personnel office. The examination will be administered to eligible TEs who have submitted a request on
165
a periodic basis, but no less than once each quarter.
3.	The TEs’ examination results will be scored, and passing scores will be merged with the appropriate existing city letter carrier register. Thereafter, normal competitive selection procedures will apply in making career city letter carrier appointments.
4.	Eligible TEs who already have a passing test score on the city letter carrier register may take the examination again pursuant to this memorandum. At the request of the TE, the score will be placed on the register in accordance with the current competitive selection procedure.
5.	This memorandum will expire on May 20, 2016.

Re: Transitional Employees (Flat Sequencing System)
Upon ratification of the Agreement, the Employer shall have authority to hire up to 8,000 transitional employees (TEs). The Employer may maintain this level of transitional employment for the duration of all phases of Flat Sequencing System (FSS) implementation. TEs hired under this Memorandum will be so designated on their PS Form 50.
In any district, the number of these TEs shall not exceed 8% of the authorized city carrier complement for that district. The parties understand that due to uncertainties with the implementation of FSS, there may be circumstances that require some modification to the above-referenced cap. It is agreed that any exception to this cap can only be made by the Vice President, Labor Relations and the President, National Association of Letter Carriers. Previously established prerequisites and criteria for the hiring and utilization of transitional employees,
166
such as those found in Article 7.1.C.1 and Appendix B of the 2001-2006 National Agreement, are not applicable.

Re: FSS Implementation
The United States Postal Service and National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO mutually recognize that the delivery point sequencing of flat mail will change the delivery environment, ultimately producing better service for postal customers. The Postal Service experienced significant benefits in 1993 by automating the processing and sequencing of letter mail, as the parties worked together to implement that technology. In the interest of working jointly on this technology the parties agree to the following:
1.	Once FSS is fully implemented in a delivery unit, management will determine the methods to estimate impact in a delivery unit and make route adjustments accordingly.
2.	Sixty days after implementing route adjustments for FSS, the local parties will review the adjustments to ensure that routes are as near 8 hours as possible. This sixty day period will not count toward the special route inspection process (Section 271, Handbook M-39; Section 918, Handbook M-41). If either party determines that the route(s) is not properly adjusted, then the route(s) will be adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Handbook M-39 or, if applicable, a locally
167
agreed upon adjustment formula.
The terms of this Memorandum are effective immediately and continue through all phases of Flats Sequencing System (FSS) implementation.

Re: FSS Work Methods
The Flat Sequencing System (FSS) provides the means to present flats to letter carrier routes in Delivery Point Sequence (DPS) order. Recognizing that a substantial investment has been made in the FSS and in order for the Postal Service to remain efficient and competitive, it is necessary to explore alternative methods of handling DPS flat mail by city letter carriers. Understanding that the parties’ respective interests are best served through a cooperative effort, the United States Postal Service (USPS) and National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) agree to jointly examine methods and procedures related to handling DPS flats.
Effective with the signing of this Memorandum, a Joint Task Force comprised of four members from the NALC and four from the Postal Service will be established to explore alternative work methods necessary for handling mail in an FSS environment. The Task Force will attempt to reach agreement on necessary studies and potential work method changes, as well as implementation and operating procedures. The Task Force will submit a final report outlining findings and recommendations to the NALC President and the Postal Service Vice President, Labor Relations no later than February 18, 2008.
In the event the Task Force is unable to reach agreement on any or all issues involved with handling mail in an FSS environment, the Postal Service may implement FSS work meth
168
ods by providing the union with written notification. The parties agree that city letter carriers on park and loop or foot deliveries will not be required to carry more than three bundles. If the union believes that any management initiated work method is not fair, reasonable, or equitable the union may, within twenty-one days of notice, initiate a national-level dispute. Such dispute will be scheduled for arbitration on a priority basis; beginning no later than March 25, 2008, with a final award rendered no later than July 15, 2008. The scope of the national-level dispute is limited to whether the disputed work method(s) is fair, reasonable, or equitable.
The parties agree that the above is the sole and exclusive process for establishing methods for handling mail in an FSS environment by city letter carriers and that no other procedural requirements (e.g., Article 34, Article 19) are necessary or relevant. This agreement is without prejudice or precedent and may only be cited by either party to enforce its terms.

Re: Delivery and Collection of Competitive Products
The parties are aware that the Postal Service is discussing arrangements with suppliers of retail products to have the Postal Service collect and deliver such products both within and outside of normal business hours and days.
The parties recognize the value to the Postal Sendee, its customers and the public of utilizing a cost-effective, uniformed
171
city letter carrier work force for the collection and delivery of such products.
Accordingly, the Board awards the following:
The collection and delivery of such products which are to be delivered in city delivery territory, whether during or outside of normal business days and hours, shall be assigned to the city letter carrier craft. The Postal Service will schedule available city letter carrier craft employees in order to comply with the previous sentence. However, the parties recognize that occasionally circumstances may arise where there are no city letter carrier craft employees available. In such circumstances, the Postal Service may assign other employees to deliver such products, but only if such assignment is necessary to meet delivery commitments to our customers.
The parties will monitor whether the city carrier assistant employees authorized by Article 7, Section 1 .C of the National Agreement are sufficient to permit the Postal Service to meet the fundamental changes in the business environment, including, but not limited to flexible windows which may be necessary to develop and provide new products and services. Additional CCAs may be jointly authorized based on such review.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND JOINT BARGAINING COMMITTEE (American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, and National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO)
Re: Article 8
Recognizing that excessive use of overtime is inconsistent with the best interests of postal employees and the Postal Service, it is the intent of the parties in adopting changes to Article 8 to limit overtime, to avoid excessive mandato
172
ry overtime, and to protect the interests of employees who do not wish to work overtime, while recognizing that bona fide operational requirements do exist that necessitate the use of overtime from time to time. The parties have agreed to certain additional restrictions on overtime work, while agreeing to continue the use of overtime desired lists to protect the interests of those employees who do not want to work overtime, and the interests of those who seek to work limited overtime. The parties agree this memorandum does not give rise to any contractual commitment beyond the provisions of Article 8, but is intended to set forth the underlying principles which brought the parties to agreement.
The new provisions of Article 8 contain different restrictions than the old language. However, the new language is not intended to change existing practices relating to use of employees not on the overtime desired list when there are insufficient employees on the list available to meet the overtime needs. For example, if there are five available employees on the overtime desired list and five not on it, and if 10 work-hours are needed to get the mail out within the next hour, all ten employees may be required to work overtime. But if there are 2 hours within which to get the mail out, then only the five on the overtime desired list may be required to work.
The parties agree that Article 8, Section 5.G.I., does not permit the Employer to require employees on the overtime desired list to work overtime on more than 4 of the employee’s 5 scheduled days in a service week, over 8 hours on a nonscheduled day, or over 6 days in a service week.
Normally, employees on the overtime desired list who don’t want to work more than 10 hours a day or 56 hours a week shall not be required to do so as long as employees who do want to work more than 10 hours a day or 56 hours a week are available to do the needed work without exceeding the 12-hour and 60-hour limitations.
In the Letter Carrier Craft, where management determines
173
that overtime or auxiliary assistance is needed on an employee’s route on one of the employee’s regularly scheduled days and the employee is not on the overtime desired list, the employer will seek to utilize auxiliary assistance, when available, rather than requiring the employee to work mandatory overtime.
In the event these principles are contravened, the appropriate correction shall not obligate the Employer to any monetary obligation, but instead will be reflected in a correction to the opportunities available within the list. In order to achieve the objectives of this memorandum, the method of implementation of these principles shall be to provide, during the 2-week period prior to the start of each calendar quarter, an opportunity for employees placing their name on the list to indicate their availability for the duration of the quarter to work in excess of 10 hours in a day. During the quarter the Employer may require employees on the overtime desired list to work these extra hours if there is an insufficient number of employees available who have indicated such availability at the beginning of the quarter.
The penalty overtime provisions of Article 8.4 are not intended to encourage or result in the use of any overtime in excess of the restrictions contained in Article 8.5.F.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE
AND THE
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS, AFL-CIO
This Memorandum of Understanding represents the parties consensus on clarification of interpretation and issues pending national arbitration regarding letter carrier overtime as set forth herein. In many places in the country there has been continued misunderstanding of the provisions of Article 8 of the National Agreement; particularly as it relates to the proper assignment of overtime to letter carriers. It appears as if some
174
representatives of both labor and management do not understand what types of overtime scheduling situations would constitute contract violations and which situations would not. This Memorandum is designed to eliminate these misunderstandings.
1.	If a carrier is not on the Overtime Desired List (ODL) or has not signed up for Work Assignment overtime, management must not assign overtime to that carrier without first fulfilling the obligation outlined in the “letter carrier paragraph” of the Article 8 Memorandum. The Article 8 Memorandum provides that “. . . where management determines that overtime or auxiliary assistance is needed on an employee’s route on one of the employee’s regularly scheduled days and the employee is not on the overtime desired list, the employer will seek to utilize auxiliary assistance, when available, rather than requiring the employee to work mandatory overtime.” Such assistance includes utilizing someone from the ODL when someone from the ODL is available.
2.	The determination of whether management must use a carrier from the ODL to provide auxiliary assistance under the letter carrier paragraph must be made on the basis of the rule of reason. For example, it is reasonable to require a letter carrier on the ODL to travel for five minutes in order to provide one hour of auxiliary assistance. Therefore, in such a case, management must use the letter carrier on the ODL to provide auxiliary assistance. However, it would not be reasonable to require a letter carrier on the ODL to travel 20 minutes to provide one hour of auxiliary assistance. Accordingly, in that case, management is not required to use the letter carrier on the ODL to provide auxiliary assistance under the letter carrier paragraph.
3.	It is agreed that the letter carrier paragraph does not require management to use a letter carrier on the ODL to provide auxiliary assistance if that letter carrier would be in penalty overtime status.
175
4.	It is further agreed that the agreement dated July 12, 1976, signed by Assistant Postmaster General James C. Gildea and NALC President James H. Rademacher, is not in effect. In cases where management violates the letter carrier paragraph by failing to utilize an available letter carrier on the ODL to provide auxiliary assistance, the letter carrier on the ODL will receive as a remedy compensation for the lost work opportunity at the overtime rate.
5.	There is normally no monetary remedy for a carrier improperly required to work overtime on his own route. However, on a one-time, nonprecedential basis, the Postal Service will pay $7 for each hour of overtime worked to each carrier who has a timely grievance pending at Step 2 or 3 as of the date of this agreement. In order to recover, the grievant must establish that he/she was not on the ODL or work assignment list and was required to work overtime in violation of the principles set forth above.

Re: Work Assignment Overtime
A.	The Postal Service will provide the opportunity, on a quarterly basis, for full-time letter carriers to indicate a desire for available overtime on their work assignment on their regularly scheduled days.
B.	All full-time letter carriers are eligible to indicate their desire for “work assignment” overtime and by doing so are to work the overtime as specified on their regularly scheduled days.
T-6 or utility letter carriers would be considered available
176
for overtime on any of the routes in their string.
Reserve Letter Carriers and unassigned regulars desiring “work assignment” overtime would be eligible for overtime on the assignment on which they are working on a given day.
C.	An annotation on the overtime desired list (ODL) may be used to identify employees desiring “work assignment” overtime.
D.	The ODL provided for in Article 8, Section 5, would continue to function.
E.	“Work assignment” overtime will not be considered in the application of Article 8, Section 5.C.2.b.
F.	Once management determines that overtime is necessary for full-time letter carriers, if the carrier has signed up for “work assignment” overtime, the carrier is to work the overtime as assigned by management.
G.	Full-time carriers signing up for “work assignment” overtime are to be considered available for up to 12 hours per day on regularly scheduled days. However, the parties recognize that it is normally in their best interests not to require employees to work beyond 10 hours per day, and managers should not require “work assignment” volunteers to work beyond 10 hours unless there is no equally prompt and efficient way in which to have the work performed.
H.	Penalty pay would be due for work in excess of 10 hours per day on 4 of 5 regularly scheduled days.
Penalty pay would be due for overtime work on more than 4 of the employee’s 5 scheduled days.
1.	Management could schedule employees from the ODL to avoid paying penalty pay to the carrier on his/her own work assignment.
J.	With respect to overtime work opportunities for employees on the fifth regularly scheduled day, the parties recognize a dispute exists concerning scheduling obligations which would involve hours in excess of the limita
177
tions in Article 8, Section 5.F, i.e., the fifth day in this case.
This issue is one of those we identified to be placed expeditiously before an arbitrator.
K.	Implementation of such a scheduling approach should occur July 1, 1985.
L.	Grievances presently within the system which deal with the issue of “overtime on a carrier’s own assignment” should be released from their current “on hold” status, and processed within the system with a concerted effort by the parties toward settlement.

Re: Leave Sharing
The Postal Service will continue a Leave Sharing Program during the term of the 2011 Agreement under which career postal employees will be able to donate annual leave from their earned annual leave account to another career postal employee, within the same geographic area serviced by a postal district. In addition, career postal employees may donate annual leave to other family members that are career postal employees without restriction as to geograph
179
ic location. Family members shall include son or daughter, parent, and spouse as defined in ELM Section 515.2. Single donations must be of 8 or more whole hours and may not exceed half of the amount of annual leave earned each year based on the leave earnings category of the donor at the time of donation. Sick leave, unearned annual leave, and annual leave hours subject to forfeiture (leave in excess of the maximum carryover which the employee would not be permitted to use before the end of the leave year), may not be donated, and employees may not donate leave to their immediate supervisors. To be eligible to receive donated leave, a career employee (a) must be incapacitated for available postal duties due to serious personal health conditions or pregnancy and (b) must be known or expected to miss at least 40 more hours from work than his or her own annual leave and/or sick leave balance(s), as applicable, will cover, and (c) must have his or her absence approved pursuant to standard attendance policies. Donated leave may be used to cover the 40 hours of LWOP required to be eligible for leave sharing.
For purposes other than pay and legally required payroll deductions, employees using donated leave will be subject to regulations applicable to employees in LWOP status and will not earn any type of leave while using donated leave. Donated leave may be carried over from one leave year to the next without limitation.
Donated leave not actually used remains in the recipient’s account (i.e., is not restored to donors). Such residual donated leave at any time may be applied against negative leave balances caused by a medical exigency. At separation, any remaining donated leave balance will be paid in a lump sum.

The parties agree that, during the term of the 2011 National Agreement, sick leave may be used by an employee to give care or otherwise attend to a family member with an illness, injury or other condition which, if an employee had such condition, would justify the use of sick leave by that employee. Family members shall include son or daughter, parent, and spouse as defined in ELM Section 515.2. Up to 80 hours of sick leave may be used for dependent care in any leave year. Approval of sick leave for dependent care will be subject to normal procedures for leave approval.

Re: Return to Duty
The parties reaffirm their understanding concerning the review of medical certificates submitted by employees who return to duty following extended absences due to illness.
We mutually agree to the following:
1.	To avoid undue delay in returning an employee to duty, the on-duty medical officer, contract physician, or nurse should review and make a decision based upon the presented medical information the same day it is submitted.
181
Normally, the employee will be returned to work on his/her next workday provided adequate medical documentation is submitted within sufficient time for review.
2.	The reasonableness of the Service in delaying an employee’s return beyond his/her next workday shall be a proper subject for the grievance procedure on a case-by-case basis.

Re: Clarification of Regulations for National Day of Observance
The parties agree that the following procedures will apply to affected employees if the Postmaster General or designee determines that the Postal Service will participate in a National Day of Observation (e.g., National Day of Mourning), subsequent to the declaration of a National Day of Observance having been made by Executive Order of the President of the United States.
184
1.	Full-time employees whose basic work week includes the National Day of Observance as a scheduled work day but who are not directed to report for work, will be granted administrative leave for that day.
2.	Full-time employees whose basic work week includes the National Day of Observance as a scheduled work day, and who perform service, will be granted a day of administrative leave at a future date, not to exceed eight hours.
3.	Full-time employees whose basic work week includes the National Day of Observance as a non-scheduled day and are not directed to report for work, will be granted a day of administrative leave at a future date.
4.	If the National Day of Observance is a full-time employee’s non-scheduled day and the employee is scheduled to work, the employee will receive overtime pay, plus up to eight hours of future administrative leave for the number of hours worked.
5.	The same provisions apply to part-time regular employees as apply to full-time employees. The total hours of administrative leave should only equal the scheduled hours for the National Day of Observance, which may be less than eight hours. However, part-time regular employees whose basic work week includes the National Day of Observance as a nonscheduled work day and who are not directed to report for work on the National Day of Observance will be granted a day of administrative leave at a future date equal to the average number of daily paid hours in their schedule for the service week previous to the service week in which the National Day of Observance occurs, which may be less than eight hours.
6.	Part-time flexible employees should be scheduled based on operational needs. Part-time flexible employees who work will be granted a day of administrative leave at a later date. The day of administrative leave will be based on the number of hours actually worked on the National Day of Observance, not to exceed eight hours. Part-time flexible employees who are not directed to work on the National Day of Observance will be granted administrative leave at a future date equal to the average number of daily paid hours during the service week previous to the service week in which the National Day of Observance occurs, not to exceed eight hours.
185
7.	Transitional employees will only receive pay for actual work hours performed on the National Day of Observance. They will not receive administrative leave.
8.	If an employee is on leave or Continuation of Pay on the National Day of Observance, the employee will be granted a day of administrative leave at a future date, not to exceed eight hours.
9.	An employee on OWCP, AWOL, suspension or pending removal on the National Day of Observance will not be granted administrative leave. If the employee on AWOL, suspension or pending removal is returned to duty and made whole for the period of AWOL, suspension or removal, the employee may be eligible for administrative leave for the National Day of Observance if the period of suspension or removal for which the employee is considered to have been made whole includes the National Day of Observance. Such determination will be made by counting back consecutive days from the last day of the suspension or removal to determine if the employee had been made whole for the National Day of Observance.
10.	Where provisions in this Memorandum of Agreement provide for a day of administrative leave to be taken at a future date, such leave must be granted and used within six months of the National Day of Observance or by the end of the Fiscal Year, whichever is later. However, administrative leave will not be granted to employees who are on extended leave for the entire period between the Day of Observance and six months from that date, or between the Day of Observance and the end of the Fiscal Year, whichever is later.
11.	Administrative leave taken at a future date must be taken at one time.
12.	Administrative leave to be taken at a future date may, at the employee’s option, be substituted for previously scheduled but not used annual leave.
13.	Administrative leave to be taken at a future date should be applied for by using the same procedures which govern the request and approval of annual leave consistent with Local Memoranda of Understanding.

2.	Appropriate provisions of the applicable handbooks and manuals shall be amended to carry out these changes consistent with the principles expressed in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 below. The handbooks and manuals, including Part 516 of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual, shall be amended pursuant to Article 19, except that the sixty (60) day notice of such changes shall be waived.
3.	A part-time flexible employee will be eligible for court leave if the employee would otherwise have been in a work status or annual leave status. If there is a question concerning the status, the part-time flexible employee will be eligible if the employee was in work status or annual leave status on any day during the pay period immediately preceding the period of court leave.
4.	If eligibility is established under paragraph 3, the specific amount of court leave for an eligible part-time flexible employee shall be determined on a daily basis as set forth below:
a.	If previously scheduled, the number of straight-time hours the Employer scheduled the part-time flexible employee to work;
b.	If not previously scheduled, the number of hours the part-time flexible employee worked on the same service day during the service week immediately preceding the period of court leave;
c.	If not previously scheduled and if no work was performed
187
on the same day in the service week immediately preceding the period of court leave, the guarantee as provided in Article 8, Section 8, of the National Agreement, provided the part-time flexible would otherwise have been requested or scheduled to work on the day for which court leave is requested.
5.	The amount of court leave for part-time flexible employees shall not exceed 8 hours in a service day or 40 hours in a service week.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND
THE JOINT BARGAINING COMMITTEE (American Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO)
Re: Transfers
The parties agree that the following procedures will be followed when career Postal Employees request reassignment from Postal installations in one geographical area of the country to Postal installations in another geographical area. Local reassignments (reassignments within the same MSC, Division, or to adjacent MSCs or Divisions) are covered by the provisions of Section 2 of this memorandum.
Section 1. Reassignments (Transfers) to other geographical areas.
A.	Installation heads may continue to fill authorized vacancies first through promotion, internal reassignment and change to lower level, transfer from other agencies, reinstatements, etc., consistent with existing regulations and applicable provisions of the National Agreement.
B.	Installation heads will afford full consideration to all reassignment requests from employees in other geographical areas within the Postal Service. The requests will be considered in the order received consistent with the vacancies being filled and type of positions requested. Such requests from qualified employees, consistent
188
with the provisions of this memorandum, will not be unreasonably denied. Local economic and unemployment conditions, as well as EEO factors, are valid concerns. When hiring from entrance registers is justified based on these local conditions, an attempt should be made to fill vacancies from both sources. Except in the most unusual of circumstances, if there are sufficient qualified applicants for reassignment at least one out of every four vacancies will be filled by granting requests for reassignment in all offices of 100 or more man-years if sufficient requests from qualified applicants have been received. In offices of less than 100 man-years a cumulative ratio of 1 out of 6 for the duration of the National Agreement will apply.
C.	MSCs will maintain a record of the requests for reassignment received in the offices within their area of responsibility. This record may be reviewed by the Union on an annual basis upon request. Additionally, on a semiannual basis local Unions may request information necessary to determine if a 1 out of 4 ratio is being met between reassignments and hires from the entrance registers in all offices of 100 or more man-years.
D. Managers will give full consideration to the work, attendance, and safety records of all employees who are considered for reassignment. An employee must have an acceptable work, attendance, and safety record and meet the minimum qualifications for all positions to which they request reassignment. Both the gaining and losing installation head must be fair in their evaluations. Evaluations must be valid and to the point, with unsatisfactory work records accurately documented. An employee must have at least one-year of service in their present installation prior to requesting reassignment to another installation. Employees reassigned to installations under the provisions of this memorandum must remain in the new installation for a period of one year, unless released by the installation head earlier, before being eligible to be considered for reassignment again, except in the case of an employee who requests to return to the installation where he/she previously worked.
189
Employees serving under craft lock-in periods per the provisions of the National Agreement must satisfy those lock-ins prior to being reassigned to other installations.
E.	Installation heads considering employees for reassignment will contact the installation head of the losing installation and arrange for mutually agreeable reassignment and reporting dates. A minimum of thirty days notice to the losing office will be afforded. Except in the event of unusual circumstances at the losing installations, reasonable time will be provided to allow the installation time to fill vacancies, however, this time should not exceed ninety days.
F.	Reassignment granted to a position in the same grade will be at the same grade and step. Step increase anniversaries will be maintained. Where voluntary reassignments are to a position at a lower level, employees will be assigned to the step in the lower grade consistent with Part 420 of the Employee and Labor Relations Manual.
G.	Employees reassigned under these provisions will be reassigned consistent with the provisions of the appropriate craft article contained in the National Agreement. Employees will not be reassigned to full-time regular positions to the detriment of career part-time flexible employees who are available for conversion at the gaining installation. Seniority for employees transferred per this memorandum will be established consistent with the provisions of the National Agreement.
H.	Relocation expenses will not be paid by the Postal Service incident to voluntary reassignment. Such expenses, as well as any resulting interview expenses, must be bome by employees.
1.	Under no circumstances will employees be requested or required to resign, and then be reinstated in order to circumvent these pay provisions, or to provide for an additional probationary period.
Section 2. Local Reassignments (Transfers)
A.	For local reassignment(s), managers will give full consid
190
eration to the work, attendance, and safety records of all employees who are considered for reassignment. An employee must have an acceptable work, attendance, and safety record and meet the minimum qualifications for all positions to which he/she requests reassignment. Both the gaining and losing installation head must be fair in their evaluations. Evaluations must be valid and to the point, with unsatisfactory work records accurately documented. An employee must have at least eighteen months of service in his/her present installation prior to requesting reassignment to another installation. Employees reassigned to installations under the provisions of this paragraph must remain in the new installation for a period of eighteen months (unless released by the installation head earlier) before being eligible to be considered for reassignment again, except in the case of an employee who requests to return to the installation where he/she previously worked. Employees serving under craft lock-in periods per the provisions of the National Agreement must satisfy those lock-ins prior to being reassigned to other installations. Local transfers are included in the 1 out of 4 ratio.
B.	The provisions of Section 1, paragraphs A, C, E, F, G, H and I are applicable to local reassignments.
C.	In those instances where an employee can substantially increase the number of hours (8 hours or more per week) by transferring to another installation and the employee meets the other criteria the lock-in period will be 12 months.

Re: Involuntary Reassignment Without Regard to Level
The following modification to Article 12 of the National Agreement will apply as it relates to the involuntary reassignment of city letter carriers who are excessed into a city letter carrier duty assignment in a different installation:
A.	City letter carriers will be involuntarily reassigned by juniority and status (full-time, part-time regular, or part-time flexible) without regard to pay grade. City letter carriers who are involuntarily reassigned to an assignment in a lower pay grade will be provided Saved Grade pursuant to Employee and Labor Relations Manual, Section 421.53.
B.	The involuntarily reassigned or senior in lieu of volunteer city letter carrier will be placed into a withheld city letter carrier residual vacancy in the gaining installation at the same, lower, or higher pay level.
C.	Upon being involuntarily reassigned, an impacted city letter carrier will receive retreat rights, by seniority, to a vacant position in the same pay grade as that formerly held in the original installation. Retreat rights are terminated when an offer to retreat is made, regardless of whether the excessed city letter carrier accepts or rejects the offer. However, if an opportunity to retreat to a different pay grade in the original installation occurs first, it will be offered to impacted employees by seniority without regard to pay grade. An offer to retreat to a different pay grade will be made only once to each excessed city
192
letter carrier per excessing event. Failure to accept an offer to a different pay grade does not exhaust a city letter carrier's retreat rights to his/her original pay grade.
D.	Saved Grade provided under this agreement will be discontinued for city letter carriers who fail to accept a retreat opportunity back to a Grade Q-2 vacancy in his/her original installation.
E.	Withheld residual duty assignments that would be part of an Article 41.3.0 posting if the positions were occupied, will be made available for selection during the 41.3.0 bidding process, unless such withheld residual assignment(s) has already been selected by or assigned to an employee subject to involuntary or a senior in lieu of a junior reassignment pursuant to Article 12.

Re: Involuntary Reassignment-Preference Eligible
The following procedure will apply for the involuntary reassignment of Grade Q-2 veteran preference eligible city letter carriers who are excess to the needs of an installation and reassigned into duty assignments in the letter carrier craft:
A.	Identify the number of preference eligible Grade Q-2 city letter carriers who are identified as excess to the needs of an installation.
B.	Identify the available withheld Grade Q-2 duty assignments within the withholding radius of the losing installation.
C.	Offer and assign available residual withheld duty assignments to city letter carriers identified as excess, without regard to level of assignments or non-preference/preference eligible status of the employee(s) pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding Re: Involuntary Reassignment Without Regard
193
to Level.
D.	If a preference eligible Grade Q-2 city letter carrier declines to select an available Grade Q-2 duty assignment that remains unselected, he/she will be assigned to that position. If there is more than one available Grade Q-2 assignment, the employee will be assigned to the position closest to his/her original installation.
E.	An impacted preference eligible city letter carrier may elect reassignment to an available withheld Grade Q-l duty assignment. In such case the employee will receive Saved Grade pursuant to Employee and Labor Relations Manual, Section 421.53. To make a selection to a lower level duty assignment, the preference eligible city letter carrier must expressly waive his/her rights to appeal such reassignment through the grievance arbitration process, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
F.	When reassignment of an excess Grade Q-2 preference eligible employee through the above provisions is not possible, the most junior non-veteran preference eligible Grade Q-2 city letter carrier in an installation within the withholding radius that has an available residual Grade Q-l duty assignment will be reassigned to the residual Grade Q-l vacancy. Such reassigned city letter carrier will receive Saved Grade pursuant to Employee and Labor Relations Manual, Section 421.53. The veteran preference eligible city letter carrier will then be assigned to the resulting vacant Q-2 assignment in that installation.
G.	If reassignment cannot be accomplished through items A-F of this memorandum, the affected preference eligible city letter carrier will be assigned to the closest available withheld residual Grade Q-2 (or equivalent) vacancy from the losing installation.
H.	When a non-veteran preference Q-2 city letter carrier is reassigned pursuant to item F of this agreement the National Business Agent will be notified prior to such reassignment.

Therefore, it is hereby agreed that representatives of the parties will meet at the national level for the purpose of developing an agenda to ensure the effectiveness of the Headquarters Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee.
The Committee may establish Joint Safety and Accident Control Teams whose aim is to reduce accidents and injuries and promote improved safety performance. The Joint Safety and Accident Control Teams will consider establishing where appropriate, local accident prevention guidelines and procedures for:
1)	reporting and abating hazardous conditions and practices,
2)	expediting resolution of local safety and health issues, and
3)	promoting safety awareness and investigating safety and health complaints.
The Joint Safety and Accident Control Teams will develop periodic progress reports to the Headquarters Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee and will make recommendations regarding the program structure where necessary. The Headquarters Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee will monitor the efforts of the local programs with the aim of expanding the Joint Safety and Accident Control Teams if the program is deemed successful by the parties.

To that end, the parties agree to further test district safety committees in each area during the term of the 2011 National Agreement.
Under the test program, district safety committees will be phased in incrementally and will consist of two members from each party; with management members selected by the District Manager or designee and union members selected by the National Business Agent or designee. District safety committees will meet quarterly and are responsible for assisting in implementing district-wide safety initiatives, facilitating communication between area and local safety committees, and assisting local committees as determined by the District Manager and NBA. Area Safety Committees are responsible for assisting and monitoring district committees within their jurisdiction during the test period.
The USPS/NALC National Safety Committee will create guidelines for district committees. The National Safety Committee will also establish a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of district safety committees during the test period, and will provide quarterly evaluation reports and recommendations to the NALC President and the Postal Service Vice President, Labor Relations.

Re: Article 15 - Dispute Resolution Process
The NALC National Business Agents, Area Managers, Labor Relations and District Managers are responsible for ensuring that the Dispute Resolution Process is effective in all ways, including the timeliness of decision-making. All parties are expected to monitor the functioning of the new process and, generally, to assume a proactive role regarding the labor/man-agement relationship. In the event the National Business Agent and District Manager or Area Manager, Labor Relations are unable to resolve any differences, the issue will be referred to the national parties for resolution, an event which is expected to be an infrequent occurrence. To facilitate this oversight responsibility, Step B Teams should copy both their respective National Business Agent and Area Manager, Labor Relations on all decisions.
Additionally, in any district where there are more cases pending arbitration than can be arbitrated in a timely manner using the existing arbitration scheduling process, the appropriate Area Manager, Labor Relations and National Business Agent are responsible for ensuring an ongoing review of the backlogged cases in an effort to settle cases, select representative cases, reduce the backlog, and provide direction to the local parties.
The primary role of the Step B Dispute Resolution Team is to decide the grievance presented to them and to communicate the basis for the decision to the parties at Step A, using a format agreed upon at the national level. Additionally, with the joint concurrence of the District Manager and National Business Agent, the Teams may be called upon to provide training and other assistance to the local parties. The national parties encourage the use of the Step B Dispute Resolution Teams to provide contract training throughout the district, especially when grievance activity suggests a lack of understanding of contract application or local responsibilities to address disputes in a timely
198
manner. As noted above, however, the primary role of the Step B Dispute Resolution Team is to process and resolve disputes. No other secondary activities should be undertaken if the timely processing of grievances is negatively impacted.
The Step B Dispute Resolution Team (and back-up team) will be made up of one management representative and one union representative. Although the Postal Service and the NALC will each determine their own method of selection for Step B representatives, it is anticipated that the National Business Agents and District Managers will discuss their separate recommendations for appointment to the Step B Dispute Resolution Teams prior to submitting recommendations.
Back-up Step B representatives will be designated for each Step B Dispute Resolution Team to provide coverage for vacations or other lengthy absences or, when warranted by the workload, to ensure timely grievance processing. Back-up teams also may be effectively utilized to provide training or such other assistance as may be agreed upon by the District Manager and National Business Agent.
The Step B Dispute Resolution Team is responsible to track and monitor its Step B workload. When the Step B Dispute Resolution Team believes its current workload exceeds its ability to render Step B decisions in a timely manner (within fourteen days of receipt of the Step B appeal), the Step B Dispute Resolution Team will contact the Area Manager, Labor Relations and the National Business Agent jointly.
The National Business Agent and the Area Manager, Labor Relations will determine jointly whether there is a need to activate back-up Step B representatives to address a backlog. If back-up activation is necessary the Area Manager, Labor Relations and the National Business Agent will determine the most efficient and effective way to ensure timely Step B processing. They will either:
1.	Activate the back-up Step B Dispute Resolution Team without undue delay, normally within 48 hours, subject to availability. The back-up team will remain activated until the backlog is eliminated. For this purpose, “availability” means certified, employed by the Postal Service
199
and fit for duty consistent with the provisions of this MOU.
2.	Send Step B appeals to another primary Step B Dispute Resolution Team under the jurisdiction of the Area Manager, Labor Relations and the National Business Agent if they determine that this Step B Dispute Resolution Team can handle the workload without causing the team’s regular work to become untimely. If the National Business Agent and the Area Manager, Labor Relations do not agree that another primary Step B Dispute Resolution Team under their jurisdiction can handle the additional work without becoming untimely, the back-up team will be activated as provided above.
In the event the National Business Agent and the Area Manager, Labor Relations determine neither the back-up team nor another primary Step B Dispute Resolution Team under their jurisdiction is available for this additional work based on the above, the Area Manager, Labor Relations and the National Business Agent will activate another back-up Step B Dispute Resolution Team under their jurisdiction until the backlog is cleared.
If the National Business Agent and the Area Manager, Labor Relations are unable to identify a primary or backup Step B Dispute Resolution Team for this work, they will promptly contact and fully inform their respective parties at the headquarters level.
In the interest of providing stability and developing expertise, the parties expect that Step B representatives will serve for no less than 2 to 3 years, absent special circumstances such as retirement, promotion, relocation, decertification, etc.
Replacement or removal of any Step B representative from Step B duties prior to fulfillment of this expectation will be discussed in advance by the parties at the headquarters level.
Step B representatives will undergo a joint comprehensive training and certification program. Training and certification of Step B representatives (including back-up Step B representatives) is required before Step B representatives may assume their duties.
The national parties are jointly responsible for both the content
200
and the delivery of the training and will meet at least once each calendar year to discuss training needs and schedule training sessions, if needed. The NALC and the Postal Service reserve the right to certify their respective nominees to serve as Step B representatives.
Step B Dispute Resolution Teams are responsible for issuing decisions that are fair and consistent with the contract and the Joint Contract Administration Manual (JCAM), and written in a manner that is both educational and informative. The national parties encourage the Step B Dispute Resolution Teams to jointly respond to questions concerning the proper interpretation or application of their decisions.
Step B teams are not responsible for building the grievance file. It is the responsibility of the parties at Step A to exchange documentary evidence and place copies in the file. If, however, a file lacking proper documentation is received, the grievance should be remanded to the local level, or the Step B Dispute Resolution Team should jointly call the local parties with a request for the submission of specific information within a specific timeframe, whichever is more effective. The primary responsibility of the Step B team is making timely decisions on the merits of disputes.
Step B representatives will not be involved in arbitrations or other hearings involving letter carriers except as jointly approved by the Area Manager, Labor Relations and National Business Agent.
Step B representatives may not be subjected to instruction or coercion while carrying out their duties.
Unless alternate arrangements are agreed upon by the District Manager and National Business Agent, the Step B Dispute Resolution Teams will work at the District office. If the District Manager and the National Business Agent agree to use an alternate location, any additional expenses will be shared equally by the local parties. The Step B Dispute Resolution Teams should be provided suitable office space, clerical support as typically provided in that office, a telephone, and computers with CD-ROM, and such other support as may be needed to perform their assignments.
201
Concerns about the performance of a Step B representative may be forwarded to the national level by either the Area Manager, Labor Relations or the National Business Agent. When this occurs, the Vice President, Labor Relations, and the National President, NALC, or their designees, will review relevant evidence and determine jointly whether the subject of the complaint should be decertified from Step B responsibilities. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the issue of decertification, the matter will be submitted to mediation. If a Step B representative’s original duty assignment becomes a holddown assignment, the NALC will not seek the conversion of a PTF employee to full time as a consequence of a PTF serving in that assignment and meeting the maximization criteria of Article 7.3.C or the Memorandum on Maximization.
Removal actions, subject to the thirty (30) day notification period in Article 16.5 of the National Agreement, will be deferred until after the Step B decision has been rendered, or fourteen (14) days after the appeal is received at Step B, whichever comes first, except for those removals involving allegations of crime, violence, or intoxication or cases where retaining the employee on duty may result in damage to postal property, loss of mails, or funds, or where the employee may be injurious to self or others, pursuant to Article 16.6 and 16.7.
The national parties will update the current JCAM at least once each calendar year during the life of the National Agreement.

Re: Article 15 - Intervention Process
The parties mutually agree that the continued nationwide success of the Dispute Resolution Process (DRP) is dependent on the successful operation of the process in each district. In keep
202
ing with our mutual oversight responsibility, we agree to establish a Task Force on Process Intervention for the purpose of assisting the local parties when the need arises.
The national parties recognize that when the DRP in a district is not meeting expectations of timely responses, appropriate resolution rates, educational and contractually compliant grievance decisions, there may be a need for some form of intervention from the offices of the NBA and area Labor Relations. To provide joint guidelines for such activity, the Task Force on Process Intervention will formulate the various triggering criteria indicating a need for intervention, and evaluate and recommend various options of process intervention for use based on circumstances.
The Task Force will be comprised of three members from the NALC and three from the Postal Service. The national parties will convene to discuss Process Intervention within sixty (60) days of the signing of the 2001 National Agreement. The Task Force will report to the NALC President and LISPS Vice President, Labor Relations, or designees. A final report will be issued not later than one year from the date this memorandum is signed.

Re: Article 19
1.	When the Postal Service provides the Union with proposed changes in handbooks, manuals, or published regulations pursuant to Article 19 of the National Agreement, the Postal Service will furnish a final draft copy of the revisions and a document that identifies the changes being made from the existing handbook, manual, or published regulation. When the handbook, manual, or published regulation is available in electronic form, the Postal Service will provide, in addition to a hard copy, an electronic version of the final draft copy
207
clearly indicating the changes and another unmarked final draft copy of the changed provision with the changes incorporated.
2.	The document that identifies the changes will indicate language that has been added, deleted, or moved, and the new location of language moved. Normally, the changes will be identified by striking through deleted language, underlining new language, and placing brackets around language that is moved, with the new location indicated. If another method of identifying the changes is used, the method will be clearly explained, and must include a means to identify which language is added, deleted, and moved, as well as the new location of any language moved.
3.	When notified of a change(s) to handbooks, manuals, and published regulations, pursuant to Article 19 of the National Agreement, the Union will be notified of the purpose and anticipated impact of the change(s) on city letter carrier bargaining unit employees.
4.	At the request of the Union, the parties will meet to discuss the change(s). If the Union requests a meeting on the change(s), the Union will provide the Postal Service with notice identifying the specific change(s) the Union wants to discuss.
5.	Within sixty (60) days of the Union’s receipt of the notice of proposed change(s), the Union will notify the Postal Service in writing of any change(s) it believes is directly related to wages, hours, or working conditions and not fair, reasonable or equitable and/or in conflict with the National Agreement. The Union may request a meeting on the change(s) at issue.
6.	The Postal Service will provide the Union with a written response addressing each issue raised by the Union, pursuant to paragraph 5, within thirty (30) days of receipt, provided the Union identifies the issue(s) within sixty (60) days of the Union’s receipt of the notice of proposed change(s).
208
7.	If the Union, after receipt of the Postal Service’s written response, believes the proposed change(s) violates the National Agreement, it may submit the issue to arbitration within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice of proposed change or thirty (30) days after the Union receives the Postal Service’s written response, whichever is later. If the Postal Service fails to provide a response to the Union pursuant to paragraph 6, the Union may submit the issue(s) to arbitration provided it does so within thirty (30) days after the Postal Service’s response was due. The Union’s appeal shall specify the change(s) it believes is not fair, reasonable or equitable and/or in conflict with the National Agreement, and shall state the basis for the appeal.
8.	If modifications are made to the final draft copy as a result of meetings with employee organizations, the Postal Service will provide NALC with a revised final draft copy clearly indicating only the change(s) which is different from the final draft copy.
9.	When the changes discussed in paragraph 8 are incorporated into the final version of a handbook, manual, publication, or published regulation, and there is not an additional change(s) which would require notice under Article 19, the Union will be provided a courtesy copy. In such case, a new Article 19 notice period is not necessary.
10.	Lastly, in any case in which the Postal Service has affirmatively represented that there is no change(s) that directly relates to wages, hours, or working conditions pursuant to Article 19 of the National Agreement, time limits for an Article 19 appeal will not be used by the Postal Service as a procedural argument if the Union determines afterwards that there has been a change to wages, hours, or working conditions.
Nothing contained in this memorandum modifies the Postal Service’s right to publish a change(s) in a handbook, manual
209
or published regulation, sixty (60) days after notification to the Union.

Re: Resolution of Health Benefits Issues
Health benefits issues shall be resolved in accordance with the following principles and obligations:
1.	Preserving high-quality health benefits and controlling their costs have been a special focus in this round of bargaining. The parties agree that it is critical to restrain the cost of health care, especially retiree health care, both in the 2011 round of collective bargaining and through legislative action in order to preserve the long term viability of the United States Postal Service.
2.	Although health care issues are complex, with many moving parts - including accounting rules, the pre-funding mandate, the preservation of choice, retiree coverage, and Medicare integration - there is much common ground in their respective positions and goals.
3.	The Postal Service and the Union shall explore the establishment of a plan providing health benefits to employees in the city letter carrier bargaining unit and letter carrier retirees (the Plan) in accordance with this MOU.
4.	The parties will consider the benefit/cost structure for the Plan and all issues regarding governance of the Plan, including procedures for establishing future changes in benefits and costs. Such consideration will be governed by the following objectives: improving the health of covered participants; preserving health benefits for employ
210
ees and retirees together with changes in Plan design, Plan option, and coverage level structure; achieving efficiencies to reduce the costs of the Plan; and structuring the Plan to reduce the Postal Service's long-term liability for retiree health benefits.
5.	The parties will establish a Health Benefits Task Force consisting of three representatives of the Union, three representatives of the Employer, and such expert consultants as the parties jointly wish to retain. The Task Force will explore all issues pertaining to the establishment of a new Plan, including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:
a.	whether the new Plan will be inside or outside the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHB);
b.	the number and content of Plan options;
c.	the number of tiers comprising the coverage level structure;
d.	integration of retiree benefits with Medicare Part A and B, coordination of the Plan benefits with Medicare, including a possible carve-out provision;
e.	the inclusion of an Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) for prescription drug benefits;
f.	the allocation of employer, employee, and retiree contributions to the Plan;
g.	alternatives for coverage of non-career employees consistent with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA); and
h.	an appropriate joint governance structure for the Plan.
6.	Upon reaching agreement, the parties will jointly support the enactment of legislation which may be necessary to permit the establishment of the Plan.
7.	Absent an alternative agreement on premium contributions by employees and the Postal Service pursuant to this MOU,
211
the bi-weekly employer contribution for self only and self and family plans for current employees will be adjusted to an amount equal to the percentages reflected below of the weighted average bi-weekly premiums under the FEHB as determined by the Office of Personnel Management. The adjustments begin on the effective date determined by the Office of Personnel Management:
	Weighted average	Not to exceed for any individual plan
January 2014	78%	81.25%
January 2015	77%	80.25%
January 2016	76%	79.25%
8.	The employer contributions for plans for new career employees will be an amount equal to 77% of the weighted average bi-weekly premiums under FEHB as determined by the Office of Personnel Management. The adjustment for new career employees begins on the effective date determined by the Office of Personnel Management in January 2013 and continues through plan year 2015. Thereafter, the employer contribution for new career employees will be adjusted to 76% effective in January 2016.

Re: Centralized Uniform Program
The parties agree to the joint development, establishment, and phase-in through the National Joint Labor-Management Uniform Control Committee (Uniform Committee) of a centralized sys
212
tem of purchasing and distributing uniforms and work clothes. By allowing the U.S. Postal Service to procure the items directly from the manufacturer(s), uniform items can be acquired at a reduced cost, in comparison to the current system. As a result of such volume purchasing, the parties anticipate that employees can be supplied with more uniform items with the U.S. Postal Service realizing monetary savings in the Uniform Program.
1.	Under this system, the U.S. Postal Service will enter into contract(s) with uniform manufacturers) for authorized uniform items which would provide for a controlled price on uniform items. The contract(s) will also address matters such as the quality of items and the method of distribution to the employees and other requirements as agreed upon by the Uniform Committee.
2.	Under the new program, the annual dollar allowance will be replaced by an allowance of points to be spent by employees on authorized uniform items. The parties agree to meet for the purpose of negotiating the specific elements of the uniform and work clothes allowance, including, but not limited to, the points assigned to each authorized item, the allowance of total points or number of items available for eligible employees in the distribution of such items.
3.	Until phased in, the employees will acquire uniforms under the current system. It is further understood that the current system remains in effect until such time as the parties agree upon the matters enumerated above and the new system, meeting the requirements set by the Uniform Committee, is operational. During the phase-in period, the Uniform Committee will monitor the progress of the program to ensure the success of the new system and address matters of concern that may arise. Issues not resolved by this Memorandum will be discussed and resolved by the parties through the Uniform Committee.
4.	It is understood by the parties that any increase in the existing uniform allowance in Article 26 of this Agreement will be credited toward the authorized uniform items to be negotiated as set forth in paragraph 2.

Re: Reinstatement of Driving Privileges
It is hereby agreed by the United States Postal Service and the National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, that:
1.	The safety and health of employees is of significant concern to the parties. Accordingly, the parties further agree that the following is not intended to provide driving privileges to an employee when such privilege would place the safety of the public or the employee at risk.
2.	The mere fact that an employee was involved in a vehicle accident is not sufficient to warrant automatic suspension or revocation of driving privileges or the automatic application of discipline.
3.	When an employee’s driving privilege is temporarily suspended as a result of a vehicle accident, a full review of the accident will be made as soon as possible, but not later than fourteen (14) days, and the employee’s driving privileges must either be reinstated, suspended for a specified period of time not to exceed sixty (60) days, or revoked as warranted. If the decision is to suspend or revoke the employee’s driving privileges, the employee will be provided, in writing, the reason(s) for such action.
4.	If an employee requests that revoked or suspended driving privileges be reinstated, Management will review the request and make a decision as soon as possible but not later than 45 days from the date of the employee’s request. If the decision is to deny the request, the employee will be provided with a written decision stating the reasons for the decision.
The Management review must give careful consideration to:
—	the nature, severity and recency of the incident(s) which led to the revocation or suspension;
—	any driver’s training or retraining courses completed
214
from private schools, state sponsored courses, or Postal Service training programs, especially when directly relevant to the incident(s) that led to the revocation;
—	successful participation in an EAP program, when relevant to the reasons for revocation;
—	the employee’s state driving record consistent with the criteria for initial certification of driving privileges as stated in the applicable Handbook. The Employer may waive these criteria if warranted in light of the other factors listed above.
5. This Memorandum of Understanding is not intended to define the conditions or circumstances for which an employee’s driving privileges may be suspended or revoked.

2.	In the event that any issue(s) remain in dispute at the end of the thirty (30) day local implementation period, each party shall identify such issue(s) in writing. Initialed copies of this written statement and copies of all proposals and counter-proposals pertinent to the issue(s) in dispute will be furnished by the appropriate local party to the appropriate management official at the Labor Relations Service Center with copies to the Postmaster and the Union’s Regional Representative within fifteen (15) days of the expiration of the local implementation period. Inclusion of
215
any matter in the written statement does not necessarily reflect the agreement of either of the parties that such matter is properly subject to local implementation.
3.	The Representative of the Employer and the Union’s Regional Representative shall attempt to resolve the matters in dispute within seventy-five (75) days after the expiration of the local implementation period. The Representatives of both the Union and the Employer will have full authority to resolve all issues still in dispute.
4.	If the parties identified above are unable to reach agreement by the end of the seventy-five (75) day period provided for above, the issue(s) may be appealed to final and binding arbitration by the National Union President or the Vice President, Labor Relations within twenty-one (21) days of the end of the seventy-five (75) day period.
5.	Where there is no agreement and the matter is not referred to the Labor Relations Service Center or to arbitration, the provision(s), if any, of the former Local Memorandum of Understanding (LMOU) shall apply.
6.	LMOU items existing prior to the 2006 local implementation period may not be challenged as inconsistent or in conflict, unless already subject to a pending arbitration appeal. The parties may challenge an LMOU item added or modified during a National Agreement’s local implementation period as inconsistent or in conflict only during the period of local implementation of the successor National Agreement.
7.	The national parties will establish an impasse arbitration panel in each area for challenges to LMOU items as inconsistent or in conflict with the National Agreement or an unreasonable burden. A sufficient number of arbitrators will be selected so that all such appeals will be scheduled and heard within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal to arbitration. In those areas where the impasse backlog will not allow the parties to meet these time limits, it is understood that steps will be taken to process them as expeditiously as possible. Impasse appeals addressing whether an item is inconsistent or in conflict will be scheduled prior to unreasonable burden cases.

The Committee shall have reasonable access to all relevant data maintained by the Postal Service, and may seek and obtain data and information from other relevant sources.
The parties agree that if the National Rural Letter Carriers’ Association seeks to participate in the work of the Committee, it will be permitted to do so.
The Committee shall complete its study within six months of ratification of the 2006 National Agreement, unless the parties mutually agree to extend this deadline. Pending final resolution of the work of the Committee, all grievances pertaining to subcontracting which are pending at the national level shall be held in abeyance.
If the work of the Committee does not result in a mutually agreeable approach to subcontracting, the Union may submit any of its pending national level grievances pertaining to subcontracting to rights arbitration in accordance with the existing provisions of the National Agreement.
In addition, beginning with the ratification of the 2006 National Agreement, there will be a six-month moratorium on any new subcontracting of delivery in offices in which city letter carriers are currently employed. This moratorium does not include any in-growth or new growth on current rural routes.

— City delivery work at the 3,071 city delivery offices (offices with only city delivery), including new growth and in-growth within those offices
— Any existing city delivery in offices other than those referenced above

Re: Subcontracting MOU Issues
The parties recognize that, in light of continuing changes in technology and the competetive environment in which the Postal Service operates, the Employer cannot commit itself to the maintenance of the MOU on subcontracting on an indefinite basis, and reciprocally, the Union may seek additional restrictions on subcontracting. Accordingly, while the parties’ practice has been to keep in place the terms and conditions of the expired contract until a successor agreement is reached voluntarily or by interest arbitration, the Postal Service reserves its rights with regard to not continuing the MOU upon expiration of the National Agreement. Likewise, the NALC reserves its rights with regard to such issue. Further, in the event that the parties do not achieve an agreement for modification or extension of the next collective bargaining agreement, and the continuation of the MOU on subcontracting is an issue to be resolved in interest arbitration, there shall be no presumption that those restrictions are to be carried forward based upon the fact that the provisions of the MOU on subcontracting have been in effect.
The subcontracting modifications provided in the MOU on subcontracting are without prejudice to the positions of the parties with respect to any interpretive issue. Accordingly, the MOU shall not be admissible in any future rights arbitration, except to enforce its terms.

Therefore, where the regular carrier has requested a special mail count and inspection, and the criteria set forth in Part 271g of the Methods Handbook, M-39, have been met, such inspection must be completed within four weeks of the request, and shall not be delayed. If the results of the inspection indicate that the route is to be adjusted, such adjustment must be placed in effect within 52 calendar days of the completion of the mail count in accordance with Section 211.3 of the M-39 Methods Handbook. Exceptions may be granted by a Division General Manager only when warranted by valid operational circumstances, substantiated by a detailed written statement, which shall be submitted to the local union within seven days of the grant of the exception. The union shall then have the right to appeal the granting of the exception directly to Step 3 of the grievance procedure within 14 days.

Re: Multiple Days of Inspection
The following will apply when conducting a six-day route count and inspection pursuant to Chapter 2 of Handbook M-39:
Management will, if it determines it necessary when scheduling an inspection to inspect on more than one day, inspect on no more than three days during the week of count and inspection. If management elects to inspect on two or three days during the week of count and inspection, management will be responsible for completion of the 1838-C one of the days. The letter carrier will count the mail and complete the 1838-C on the other days of inspection. When management elects to inspect on two or three days, the PS Form 3999 closest to the selected street time on the PS Form 1840 will be used to transfer territory.

Re: City Delivery Task Force
In the interest of increasing operational efficiency and improving relationships on the workroom floor, both parties recognize the need to adapt in order to accommodate advances in technology and changes and in the types and volumes of mail. With the mutual understanding that the parties' respective interests are best served through a cooperative
226
effort, a Task Force will be established for the purpose of jointly seeking methods to improve the work environment, and examine and develop improved methods and procedures related to the city delivery function. At a minimum, the Task Force will:
•	Jointly develop methods for eliminating or reducing conflicts between management and city letter carriers. Emphasis will be placed on disagreements over the amount of time an individual city letter carrier needs to complete his/her daily assignment.
•	Jointly explore the modification of current case configurations and work methods to identify more efficient techniques for handling residual and sequenced mail volumes.
•	Jointly examine current casing standards and times for associated line items.
•	Explore various combinations of office and street functions and other alternatives for structuring city carrier routes and for capturing undertime associated with variable daily workloads.
The Task Force is established the effective date of the 2011 National Agreement, and will consist of four members appointed by the NALC and four members appointed by the Postal Service. The Task Force is authorized to jointly test techniques directed to improving work relationships between city letter carriers and supervisors as well as alternate methods and procedures related to city delivery functions. These initiatives may be tested separately or in concert with each other, as jointly determined by the Task Force. The Task Force's guiding principles should be to improve the work climate and daily relationships on the workroom floor, and to increase operational efficiency in city delivery.
The Task Force shall convene within 15 days of the effective date of this Agreement and will function for the term of the 2011 National Agreement. Testing will commence no later than 45 days from the initial meeting. The Task Force will provide reports and recommendations no less frequently than
227

Re: Use of Privately Owned Vehicles
The parties agree that the following represents the policy of the U.S. Postal Service and the American Postal Workers Union concerning the furnishing of privately owned vehicles (POV) by employees of the crafts represented by the APWU:
No craft employee represented by the APWU may be coerced into furnishing a vehicle or carrying passengers without the employee’s consent. The use of a personal vehicle is the decision of the employee and it is not the intent of the parties to discourage such use of personal vehicles when transportation is needed from one postal facility to another or in the completion of the employee’s assignment. When an employee begins his/her work day at one postal unit and is provided transportation to another unit to complete his/her tour of duty, that employee will be provided transportation back to the unit where his/her tour began if transportation is needed. If the employee ends tour at the new location the return trip will not be on the clock but transportation will be provided promptly by management upon request.

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE
UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS, AFL-CIO
Re: Segmentation
The United States Postal Service and the National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, in joint discussion and consultation, have agreed on a set of principles governing the implementation of the segmentation concept as provided in the M-39 Handbook (see attachment).
These principles will ensure the efficiencies and effective implementation of the segmentation concept and ensure the fair and appropriate utilization of letter carriers in the performance of the work involved in segmentation.
Statement of Principles:
1.	Segmentation of mail can efficiently be processed on automated or mechanized equipment. Such processing will be done by the craft designated to operate that equipment.
2.	A manual, tertiary or delivery preparation operation is the manual sortation or preparation of mail that occurs after an incoming secondary operation and does not require memorization of distribution scheme items. A manual tertiary or delivery operation will be done by city delivery letter carriers provided the mail is for city delivery routes or post office box sections served by these routes and provided there is space available at the delivery unit. If space is not available, and sortation is done at a General Mail Facility, a mail processing center, or any other postal installation or facility within the installation, letter carriers will perform the manual tertiary sortation at such facilities. An incoming secondary operation normally requires memorization of distribution scheme items and is one which results in mail being sorted to carrier routes, firms, box section, nixies, postage dues, and other separations necessary for the efficient processing of mail.
229
3.	Routers can be used to perform the manual tertiary sor-tation of mail segmentation whenever that is operationally feasible. Tertiary sortation duties may also be combined with other forms of letter carriers’ work to create full-time assignments.
4.	Even though no arbitrary limitation is placed on the number of pieces in a segmentation, a limitation will, in effect, be imposed by whatever number of pieces is operationally effective and efficient for each operation in an installation.
Standard manual distribution cases that are used in delivery units should be fully utilized for sorting mail to carrier routes, box sections, postage dues, etc. Segmentations should contain sufficient volumes that can be sorted and pulled down efficiently. For example, a single delivery point or ZIP + 4 segment (blockface, apartment building, etc.) that averages two or three pieces a day should not normally take up space on the incoming, manual secondary case. Exceptions could be holdouts such as nixies, postage dues, etc., that require special treatment regardless of volume.
Segmentations are not necessarily static; therefore, manual secondary cases should be reviewed periodically to ensure that all cells are properly utilized in the most effective and efficient manner possible, consistent with operational or service needs.
5.	Each installation will determine the type of equipment to be used in a tertiary sortation. Performance on that equipment will be done in accordance with the principle of a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay which will normally be reflected in the general performance expectations for that equipment.
6.	The parties understand that the tertiary sortation referenced here is the result of the implementation of the segmentation concept, which is presently described in the changes to the M-39 Handbook as presented to the National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, on August 15, 1985. Any tertiary sortation established prior to June 16, 1983, will remain in effect unless changed by the installation. Changes made after June
230
16, 1983, but prior to implementation of this understanding, which are in conflict with this document, will be changed to conform.
7.	The Employee Involvement process will be utilized to develop recommendations for use by the installations affected by this Agreement.
The National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, and the United States Postal Service acknowledge that this Settlement Agreement is not an admission of fault or liability on the part of either party to this Agreement. The United States Postal Service and the National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, also acknowledge that this Agreement sets forth all the terms for settling pending grievance H4N-NA-C 35. The parties agree to meet as soon as practicable to resolve all other outstanding grievances involving segmentation in a manner consistent with this Agreement. The United States Postal Service and the National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO, agree that the terms of the settlement contained in this document may not be added to or subtracted from, in any way. This Settlement Agreement is without prejudice to the positions of either party with respect to the interpretation or application of the National Agreement in any future proceeding between the parties. The effective date of this agreement is March 9, 1987.

MEMORANDUM FOR POSTMASTERS, CITY DELIVERY OFFICES
LOCAL PRESIDENTS, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS, AFL-CIO
SUBJECT: Joint Agreements
The NALC and USPS recognize that our continued existence as a viable organization is heavily dependent upon our ability to meet our customers’ needs while empowering employees to levels not previously envisioned.
As many of you are aware, we have strived at the National level to obtain an agreement on the implementation of automation of letter mail on carrier routes. We agreed then, and we agree now, on three basic principles:
— Provide the best service to postal customers (mailers and recipients).
— Minimize impact on letter carrier craft employees.
— Create an opportunity for increased efficiency.
Our mutual hope is that the following agreements will provide a basis for trust and cooperativeness, and that they will form a basis on which to satisfy our customers’ needs. While each agreement may not accomplish all that each party may desire, collectively they will form the basis for a positive working relationship of mutual trust and respect, and the foundation for continued empowerment of all employees.
Case Configuration/Letter-Sized Mail
This agreement provides for a standard definition of lettersized mail and provides guidelines for conducting route
232
inspections when letter mail is cased into four- and five-shelf case configurations that have been established as a result of a joint agreement.
Transitional Employees - Issue Resolutions
Provides information on the transitional employee and highlights areas of apparent disparity of interpretation where mutual understanding has now been reached. Further, this agreement provides that a joint booklet on the transitional employee will follow.
X-Route Alternative
An optional alternative joint process is provided for preparing installations for the future automated letter mail environment. This agreement has many unique features and should be reviewed in detail before deciding its applicability.
Delivery Point Barcoding Work Methods
This agreement recognizes the substantial contributions that city letter carriers can make in the development of new work methods. It provides a five-step process that ensures a review of alternative methods and continued upgrading of work methods as the process evolves.
Route Adjustments - The Future
The parties have fashioned an agreement that provides clear guidance on procedures to be followed when preparing future route adjustments for letter mail automation in delivery units not selecting the X-route alternative.
Hempstead Resolution - The Past
We are remanding all pending grievances on route adjustments to the local parties for resolution. The parties will be guided by the principles of the above-cited agreements and must take into consideration the following factors.
— Was there a current event; that is, were the routes out of adjustment?
— How far in advance was the future event that was used to adjust the route? The parties have made no determination as to the appropriate time period.
233
— What was the projected timing of the upcoming event?
— What was the basis for determining the effect of the future event?
— How certain is that future event?
As you review each case, you will find that either:
— Management preplanned properly and the current structure is within the purview of this agreement; therefore, the current structure is valid;
or
— Management preplanned inappropriately or time frames have changed, negating the validity of the adjustment.
It is your obligation to make these joint determinations and to decide what remedy to apply and how to fix the problem if one is discovered. The parties should consider the impact of any decision on our employees who serve our customers and the impact on the customers which they serve. If the parties cannot resolve these cases, they may be appealed to regional arbitration.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS, AFL-CIO RESOLUTION OF ISSUES LEFT OPEN BY M1TTENTHAL AWARD OF JULY 10,1992
Current Events and Adjustments
A current event is defined as a route or routes which are shown to be out of adjustment by a recent route inspection and evaluation. All current adjustments to existing routes will place the route on as near an 8-hour daily basis as possible, in accordance with Handbook M-39.
234
Adjustments Near Term - Automation
When routes require a current adjustment and Delivery Point Sequencing will commence within 6 months, management will adjust the routes using non-territorial, non-scheme change adjustments by the use of router assistance, segmentation or permanent handoffs as outlined in the M-39 Handbook Section 243.21b. The 6-month period runs from the first day after the week of route inspection.
Future Events and Adjustments - Automation
Management may utilize the results of a recent route inspection and evaluation to estimate and plan route adjustments, including realignment of assignments, that will be required by a future event which is to take place within 18 months. Management must provide documentation to the local union to support the deployment if they intend to plan the adjustments for a future event. The planned adjustments for future events will not be implemented until automation is on line and operative. Management may implement the planned adjustments if the actual percentage of Delivery Point Sequence (DPS) mail received at the unit is within plus or minus 5 percentage points of the targeted (in Step 1) level. Should the actual percentage of DPS mail be outside these limits, then management must recalculate the estimated impact on carrier routes, based on the actual percentage of DPS mail being received at the unit. The results of the recent route inspection and evaluation will be used to determine a new impact and construct a new plan or management may wait for the plan levels to be received. The 18-month period runs from the first day after the week of route inspection. For purposes of this agreement, a future event is defined as mail being received at a delivery unit in DPS order.
Within 60 days of implementing the planned adjustments for future automated events, the parties will revisit those adjustments to ensure that routes are as near to 8 hours daily, as possible. Both the planned adjustments and subsequent minor adjustments that may be necessary to ensure compliance will be based on the most recent route inspection data for the route. However, if the future event occurs after the 18-month
235
time limit expires, a new mail count, route inspection and evaluation must occur, unless the local parties agree otherwise.
Methodology
Where the future event is the introduction of Delivery Point Bar Coding (DPBC) for existing equipment or equipment that will cause a certain percentage of letter mail to be received by the unit in DPS, the following methodology will be used to estimate the impact of the event on city delivery routes:
Step 1. Determine the percentage of letter-sized mail targeted to be received in DPS order on the date when the adjustments will be implemented.
Step 2. Multiply percentage determined in Step 1 by the average letter-sized mail received during the week of count and inspection (from PS Form 1840, Column 1) to determine the number of letters for each route, targeted to be received in DPS order.
Step 3. Divide letters targeted to be received in DPS order (as determined in Step 2) by 18.
Step 4. Divide letters targeted to be received in DPS order (as determined in Step 2) by 70.
Step 5. Add results of Steps 3 and 4 to determine estimated impact.
Step 6. For routes where the carrier was under standard time during the week of count and inspection, multiply results of Step 5 by percentage of standard office time used during the week of inspection. The result is the estimated impact.
EXAMPLE 1:
80 Percent Target for Letter Mail Carrier at/over* Standard Time Allowance
2,700 Letters
80 Percent Automated
236
2,160 divided by 18 = 120 minutes
2,160 divided by 70 = 31 minutes
151 minutes = estimated impact
Note: If actual performance is over standard time allowance, the standard casing allowance of 18 pieces per minute is used.
EXAMPLE 2:
80 Percent Target for Letter Mail Carrier used 85 Percent
of Standard Time Allowance
2,700 Letters
80 Percent Automated
2,160 divided by 18 = 120 minutes
2,160 divided by 70 = 31 minutes
151 minutes = estimated impact
(Step 6) 151 x 85 Percent = 128 minutes = estimated impact.
It is mutually agreed that as the parties develop experience in estimating the impact of future events, adjustments to the above described methodology may be jointly adopted at the national level.
Pending Grievances
All pending grievances which involve the adjustment of routes for future events will be remanded to the local parties for resolution.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE AND THE
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF LETTER CARRIERS, AFL-CIO
X-Route Alternative
The parties have reached agreement on an alternative Route Adjustment strategy—X-Route. The decision to use the X-
237
Route Concept is made on an installation wide basis, even though inspections and planning for individual units/zones may not occur at the same time. In units with more than one delivery unit/zone the planning process is repeated as each delivery unit/zone is inspected, assignments are evaluated and adjustments are planned.
X-Route Process
The X-Route process is an alternative approach to route adjustment in preparation for automation, particularly delivery point sequencing. An X-Route is, in effect, a letter carrier craft assignment held pending reversion. The workload will be divided among remaining routes when agreed upon percent-age(s) of letter mail is being received at a unit/zone in delivery point sequence order. The process allows changes to be planned in advance and permits carriers to know what their assignments are expected to be in the automated environment. The X-Route process and time period are considered completed when the unit/zone has achieved the final targeted level of Delivery Point Sequence letter mail and the X-Route work has been distributed.
Pre-Agreement Phase
If there is interest in attempting to utilize the X-Route alternative, local management will meet with the local union to review the provisions of this agreement. This includes a review of the attached Memorandum of Understanding on case configuration, the Work Methods Memorandum, guidance on the Hempstead case resolution and current base count and inspection data. If current route inspection data is not available, plans should be made to conduct route inspections in accordance with Article 41.3.S of the National Agreement to provide a basis to implement the remainder of this agreement.
If the parties are considering pursuing this alternative, they must be committed to mutual resolution of the outcome. Management will share the following information with the union:
The expected accounting period(s) and year that increases in bar-coded mail generated by the Automation Programs will
238
impact the delivery unit/zone, such as customer prebarcoding, MLOCR, DBCS, and RBCS.
The projected impact on the delivery unit/zone of automated sort schemes, and the basis for the estimate.
Agreement Phase
It must be understood, once the decision to use the X-Route process has been finalized, that decision can only be changed through joint agreement between the local union and management.
Since the planning and adjustment(s) in a delivery unit/zone using the X-Route alternative are a joint endeavor, the parties at the local level must first agree to a joint resolution process, should there be a barrier to fiill implementation of the parties agreement to use the X-Route alternative.
The parties will then meet to review route examinations for the unit/zone. This exercise is intended to result in agreed upon evaluations.
If the parties fail to reach agreement regarding the use of the X-Route alternative, management may proceed to implement strategies in concert with handbooks and manuals, the Hempstead Resolution, and the National Agreement to accomplish route adjustments. However, the provisions of this agreement are specific to application of the X-Route concept only and are not applicable to any other route adjustment method.
In working out the X-Route adjustment process for the delivery unit/zone, it is recognized and agreed that:
Management must develop the final targeted Delivery Point Sequencing percentage (from a low of 70% to a high of 85%) of delivery point sequencing letter mail for the X-Route period. That percentage is then used to estimate the impact on the unit/zone using the projection methodology outlined in the Hempstead resolution. The parties will jointly determine the number and identity of the routes that will be designated as X-Routes using the above estimates of the impact on the delivery unit. While the X-Route concept may not be applicable to all routes within an installation because of limiting circumstances
239
(i.e., geographic considerations), such circumstances will not be a barrier to implementing the concept. This determination as to the non-applicability to certain routes will be made jointly.
The parties must jointly determine what realignment of routes (in-office or street territory) will be necessary to assure that X-Routes are strategically placed to facilitate the transfer of workload as delivery point sequencing evolves. The decision as to when to realign the routes should be based upon the current need for realignment in order to place the routes on as near an eight-hour-basis as possible based upon the current evaluation from a recent inspection. The parties could decide to defer the proposed realignment of routes until Delivery Point Sequencing was implemented if no significant scheme changes were required to keep routes near eight hours, or they could decide to make the necessary scheme changes for the realignment of routes now if significant scheme changes were going to be needed to adjust routes to eight hours as currently evaluated. In no instance will the parties effect adjustment now based on the future event, except as provided under interim adjustments (below). The regular carrier on any route whose street territory is changed as a result of this adjustment and realignment may elect, on a one-time basis, to vacate his/her route and become an unassigned regular. Such action will not trigger the provisions of Article 41.3.0. All positions vacated in this manner will be posted and filled in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article 41.1.
Where exceptional circumstances require further adjustments, they must be jointly agreed to by the parties. The objective is to provide a smooth transition to the Delivery Point Sequencing environment. Such an outcome requires no change in day-to-day administration of curtailment procedures, auxiliary assistance or overtime.
The parties agree that adjustment strategies for Delivery Point Sequencing will vary based on individual offices, deployment schedules and types of deliveries. For instance, offices that will be impacted by RBCS destinating keying prior to Delivery Point Barcoding and offices further along in the deployment schedule may be at final targeted barcoding levels
240
when Delivery Point sequencing commences and therefore require only one adjustment.
Some offices may initiate DPBC and Delivery Point Sequencing prior to full barcoding levels and require an interim adjustment strategy. Adjustment strategy decisions will be made jointly based on deployment schedules and current automation.
Once the Postal Service has implemented delivery point sequencing and can demonstrate that the routes in a delivery unit/zone are receiving volumes at the targeted percentage, the local parties will implement the preplanned adjustments. Where an interim adjustment strategy will be necessary as described above due to the gradual increasing of DPBC levels, the local parties will meet and make interim adjustments by removing work from the X-Routes and assigning that work to the regular routes which will remain after full implementation of delivery point sequencing.
After the completion of each interim adjustment, the parties will jointly determine the amount of hours remaining on the X-Routes and will jointly decide how to efficiently combine assignments to provide the maximum number of full-time assignments. If this cannot be accomplished in an efficient manner, the parties may jointly decide to either form auxiliary assignments or split the remaining hours from these assignments to the regular routes that will remain once the final delivery point sequencing adjustments have been made. Where this latter option is agreed upon, it is understood that routes will be built up (not to exceed 8:20). If less than 100% of the routes will be built up, the following priority should be observed if efficiency can be maintained:
(1)	By seniority, routes whose regular carrier are on the Work Assignment List.
(2)	By seniority, routes whose regular carrier are on the Overtime Desired List.
(3)	By inverse seniority, carriers not on any Overtime Desired List.
Incumbents of, and bidders for, routes that are projected to
241
continue after full implementation of automation will know, in advance, what portions of the X-Route a delivery route will receive after full delivery point sequencing is on-line. X-Routes will be posted for bid when vacant, as long as they remain full-time assignments. When an X-Route becomes vacant and is posted for bid, the bid notice will include the anticipated date of elimination.
When an X-Route is abolished, the full-time carrier assigned to that route will become an unassigned regular. He/she may, within 30 days, review the list of residual vacancies within his/her bidding area and use his/her seniority to exercise a preference for that assignment. This may be accomplished by a bid posting limited to unassigned full-time carriers displaced by abolishment of X-Routes or by other means agreed to locally between the parties. (The provisions of Article 41.3.0, where they have been incorporated in the local memorandum, will not be triggered by this process.)
The use of transitional employees in a unit where route adjustments are achieved under the X-Route concept will be in accordance with the relevant National Interest Arbitration Award and any subsequent agreement(s) between the United States Postal Service and the National Association of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO.
Date: September 17, 1992.

Re: City Letter Carrier DPS Work Methods
This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) represents the parties’ final agreement regarding the October 8, 1998, Joint Work Methods Study to determine the more efficient work
242
method for city delivery routes in delivery units where Delivery Point Sequence (DPS) has been, or will be, implemented. This MOU is based on the results of a joint study conducted by the parties pursuant to Chapter 5 of Building Our Future By Working Together to determine the relative efficiency of the composite bundle and vertical flat casing work methods in a DPS environment. Further, any interim or local agreements for handling the fourth bundle on park and loop and foot routes will continue until conversion to the DPS vertical flat casing work method. In accordance with paragraph 3 of the October 8, 1998, Joint Work Methods Study Agreement the following are the parties’ joint instructions to the field:
1.	There continue to be two approved DPS work methods: the composite bundle work method and the vertical flat casing work method. Any other work methods must be approved by Postal Service Headquarters prior to testing or implementation.
2.	The parties have analyzed the results of the joint study and have determined that the vertical flat casing work method is the more efficient work method at all sampled percentage levels of DPS. Management may convert those routes that have vertical flat cases and are currently using the composite bundle work method to the vertical flat casing DPS work method.
3.	On curbline routes and business routes where DPS is planned, but not implemented, management will determine the most efficient DPS work method. All other routes not yet converted to DPS which have vertical flat cases will use the vertical flat casing DPS work method.
4.	On those routes where DPS is not currently planned but where DPS is implemented in the future, management will determine the DPS work method.
5.	City letter carriers on a park and loop or foot route will not be required to carry more than three bundles.

The Postal Service has provided the Union with a list of the 3,071 city delivery offices referenced above. However, the parties have not had the opportunity to mutually verify the list's accuracy. Accordingly, the parties agree that they will work together to verify the list's accuracy and will make adjustments to the list, if necessary. The parties recognize that this review could result in offices being added to or subtracted from the list. The parties will undertake this review and prepare a final list as soon as practicable after ratification of the tentative agreement.
September 11,2007
After further review by the parties pursuant to the preceding Letter of Intent, Re: MOU Re: Subcontracting - List of 3,071 City Delivery Offices, the following list identifies approximately 3,580 ‘city delivery offices’ covered by the Memorandum of Understanding, Re: Subcontracting. The list is intended to represent all city delivery offices (delivery units that have city delivery routes, but do not have rural routes) as of September 11, 2007. The parties agree to discuss and make adjustments to this list, if necessary, consistent with that intent.
