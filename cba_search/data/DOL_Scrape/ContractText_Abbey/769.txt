2005 SCREEN ACTORS GUILD TELEVISION AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made by and between SCREEN ACTORS GUILD, INC., a California non-profit corporation, hereinafter called the “Union" or “SAG,” and the ALLIANCE OF MOTION PICTURE & TELEVISION PRODUCERS, hereinafter also referred to as the “AMPTP" or “Alliance,” acting on behalf of Producers who have authorized said Alliance to act on their behalf, a list of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1, all of which constitute a multiemployer bargaining unit, each hereinafter called “Producer” and collectively referred to as “Producers.”
1. GENERAL
This Agreement, to be known as the “2005 Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement,” sets forth minimum wage scales and working conditions for all performers employed in television motion pictures. As used herein, the term “performer" includes performers, singers, stunt performers, airplane pilots, stunt coordinators, professional puppeteers, body doubles and dancers covered under Schedule J of the 2005 Producer-Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement, but excludes background actors. This Agreement also sets forth minimum wage scales and working conditions for background actors employed on television motion pictures in the Hawaii, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New Y ork, San Diego and San Francisco zones, as defined in Schedule X, Part I and Schedule X, Part II and in a Sacramento zone, to be established by the parties as provided in Schedule X, Part I of the Producer-Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement, to the extent of the numerical limits set forth therein. As used herein, the term “television motion pictures” means entertainment motion pictures produced primarily for exhibition over free television, whether made on or by film, tape or otherwise, and whether produced by means of motion picture cameras, electronic cameras or devices, or any combination of the foregoing, or any other means, methods or devices now used or which may hereafter be adopted. Pending execution of a single Producer-Screen Actors Guild/American Federation of Television and Radio Artists contract covering motion pictures produced for initial exhibition on pay television or for the videodisc/videocassette market, it is understood that the term “television motion pictures” also includes motion pictures produced for initial exhibition on pay television or for the videodisc/videocassette market. Such motion pictures are governed by the provisions of Section 78 of this Agreement.
Except as otherwise herein expressly provided, all terms and conditions of the Producer-Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement of 2005, as amended, supplemented or codified (hereinafter
referred to as the “Producer-Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement”), shall apply to this Agreement. Reference in this Agreement to “Schedules” relates to the Schedules of said Producer-Screen Actors Guild Codified Basic Agreement.

(c)	Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (a) and (b) above, the following shall apply to “major role” performers, as defined below, employed in an episode of a one-half hour or one-hour network prime time television series or a one-half hour or one-hour television series produced for broadcast in prime time on FBC, UPN or the WB Television Network.
Except for a performer employed under the day performer exception referred to in the following paragraph, a performer employed under a freelance contract to perform a “major role,” as defmed below, in an episode of a television series shall be paid no less than an amount equal to the daily minimum rate increased by seven and one-half percent (7.5%) multiplied by the number of days for which the performer is entitled to compensation pursuant to this Agreement.
Except for a performer employed for no more than one (1) day, excluding up to two (2) travel-only day(s), under a day performer contract, the minimum guarantee for a “major role" performer employed on a one-hour episodic series shall be eight (8) days of employment on such episode and for a performer employed on a one-half (‘/a) hour episodic series shall be a minimum of five (5) days of employment on such episode?
A “major role” performer is one who, as a part of his or her contractual arrangements for that employment, negotiates credit at the front of the show or negotiates credit on a separate card, or its equivalent in a crawl, at the back of the show or who negotiates credit in any of the following forms: “Guest Star;" “Special Guest Star; ” “Starring;" or “Special Appearance By. ”
In agreeing to the definition of “major role performer” set forth above, the parties attempted to cover only the class of performers who traditionally received “top of the show” rates in the past. The parties did not intend to either expand or diminish the class of “major role performers.” The parties agree to monitor performers’ credits to ensure that this provision is applied consistent with their intention.
The parties also acknowledge that their agreement on this provision was originally negotiated in the context of the existing practice on network prime time shows (at that time, “network prime time” covered prime time on ABC, CBS and NBC only), and has now been extended to prime time series on FBC, UPN and The WB Television Network and was intended to apply in those contexts. As to other programs, such as programs produced for syndication (other than UPN

and The WB Television Network prime time series) or pay television, the parties recognize that no uniform rate has heretofore been established as a ceiling on performers’ compensation. However, if during the term of this Agreement, the Union believes that such a ceiling has been established as a matter of industry-wide practice on those other programs, it shall have the right to refer the matter to the Cooperative Committee for resolution. Likewise, if during the term of the Agreement, a Producer believes that a program produced for network prime time or for UPN or The WB Television Network in prime time is not appropriate because it is not of the type currently produced for network prime time television, it shall have the right to refer the matter to the Cooperative Committee for resolution.

(c)	Except as herein provided, the provisions of Schedule E or F (excluding Section 2(b) of Schedule E), depending upon the performer’s weekly salary, shall govern term contract employment.
(d)	All options attached to term contracts shall be for consecutive periods, except that the Producer may be allowed to take one hiatus period not to exceed thirteen (13) weeks at any time subsequent to the expiration of the original term, and not more than one (1) such period during each fifty-two (52) week period. During such hiatus period, the performer shall be free to engage in any other work, subject to any agreement as to exclusivity permitted under Section 23 hereof. Hie following examples will show the operation of the hiatus period:
(1)	If the performer’s contract is for a term of twenty-six (26) weeks with an option for an additional term of twenty-six (26) weeks and the layoff provisions of the first twenty-six (26) week term were not used, the Producer, by written notice to the performer, may elect to declare a hiatus of not more than thirteen (13) weeks before exercising its option for the second twenty-six (26) week term. If the hiatus is declared, the layoff provision may not be used in the remaining thirteen (13) week period of employment of said second twenty-six (26) week term.
-32-
(2)	If the performer’s contract is for a term of twenty-six (26) weeks with an option for an additional term of twenty-six (26) weeks, the Producer, by written notice to the performer, may elect to declare a hiatus of not more than thirteen (13) weeks during either the first thirteen (13) weeks or the last thirteen (13) weeks of such additional twenty-six (26) week term. However, the hiatus may not be declared if the layoff provisions of the contract were used in the first twenty-six (26) week term or in the first thirteen (13) weeks of the additional twenty-six (26) week term. In the event no layoff took place in the first twenty-six (26) week term and the hiatus is declared for the first thirteen (13) weeks of the additional twenty-six (26) week term, the layoff provisions may not be used for the second thirteen (13) weeks of the additional twenty-six (26) week term. During the remaining thirteen (13) weeks of such term, the performer shall be guaranteed employment at not less than the minimum rate fixed herein for employment of performers under a twenty-six (26) week term contract. However, after declaring such hiatus, the Producer, if it elects to exercise the next option at the minimum rate provided for a twenty-six (26) week term contract, must either guarantee twenty (20) weeks’ employment with no hiatus period or may elect to take a hiatus within such twenty-six (26) week term, in which event the minimum rates for employment under a thirteen (13) week term contract will apply and Producer must refrain from using the layoff provisions in the thirteen (13) week employment period.
(3)	In the event layoffs have been used and thereafter Producer desires to use the hiatus provisions, he may do so by compensating performer for the layoff periods which have been previously used. Under no circumstances may two (2) hiatus periods be consecutive. It is the purpose of this provision to guarantee to the performer that as long as his term contract remains in effect and options are exercised thereunder, he will be employed for not less than forty (40) weeks out of fifty-two (52) weeks during each fifty-two (52) week period if layoff provisions are used, or thirty-nine (39) weeks out of fifty-two (52) if the hiatus provision is used, it being the intent of the parties to make the layoff provisions and the hiatus provisions mutually exclusive.

-43 -
facilities because of war or other calamity such as tire, earthquake, hurricane, or similar acts of God, or because of the breakdown of broadcasting facilities due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the Producer, or because the program time is pre-empted by a Presidential broadcast, a news emergency, or the telecast of a special news event, the interrupted program may be rebroadcast in its entirety on the network or station on which the broadcast was interrupted within a thirty (30) day period following the interrupted broadcast without the Producer incurring any additional payment to any performerfs) in the program.

(7)	As used herein, the term “Distributor’s Foreign Gross” shall mean, with respect to any television motion picture, the absolute gross income realized by the distributor of such picture from the foreign telecasting thereof and including, in the case of a “foreign territorial sale” by any such distributor, the income realized from such sale by such distributor but not the income realized by the “purchaser” or “licensee.” The phrase “absolute gross income” shall not include:
a) Sums realized or held by the way of deposits or security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable.
“Such sums as are non-returnable” are to be included in the “Distributor’s Foreign Gross” when such television motion picture is “available” and “identifiable” and the amount of the non-returnable sum is “ascertainable.”
Such television motion picture is “available” when the first of the following occurs:
-46-
(i)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(ii)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
Such television motion picture is “identifiable" when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given television motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
The amount of the non-returnable sum is “ascertainable" if:
(i)	the non-returnable sum is for one television motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(ii)	the total amount of the non-returnable sum is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such sum among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets.
As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable sum is to be included in “Distributor’s Foreign Gross" for that quarter. The Producer shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of “Distributor’s Foreign Gross," which includes the non-returnable sum, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If such television motion picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the non-returnable sum is ascertainable, but the Producer does not provide the Guild with the information required by this Agreement and applicable law, then the non-returnable sum shall be deemed includable in “Distributor’s Foreign Gross” no later than six (6) months after the Producer receives it.
A non-returnable sum received by a Producer’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the payment is directed by the Producer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as a non-returnable sum received by the Producer.
-47-
b) Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in ■. the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of the picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the (. distributor, but there shall not be excluded from Distributor’s Foreign Gross any net income, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax ( payable by the distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business.
V c) Frozen foreign currency until the distributor shall ' have either the right to use such foreign currency in or to transmit such ( foreign currency from the country or territory where it is frozen. In the event such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall ( be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the	,
prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or , transmit accrues.	;
Distributor’s Foreign Gross realized in foreign ( currency in any reporting period required hereunder shall be deemed to be converted to United States dollars at the prevailing free market rate of ( exchange at the close of such reporting period.
If any transaction involving any picture subject to a foreign telecast payment under this Agreement shall also include motion pictures, broadcast time, broadcast facilities or material	(
(including commercial or advertising material) which are not subject to such payment, there shall be a reasonable allocation between the	(
television motion pictures which are subject to a foreign telecast payment and such other pictures, time, facilities or material, and only the z sums properly allocable to pictures which are subject to a foreign	,
telecast payment shall be included in Distributor’s Foreign Gross.
(
(8)	The above formula for foreign telecasting is a minimum ■: formula and nothing herein shall preclude any performer from	(
bargaining for better terms with respect to such foreign telecasting.

(e)	All payments of additional compensation for reruns, theatrical exhibition or foreign telecasts shall be made promptly by check, payable to the order of the performer entitled thereto, and if not initially paid to the performer, shall be delivered to Screen Actors Guild for forwarding to such performer and compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the performer.

If there is a dispute over the amount due the performer, and Producer pays the undisputed amount on time, or if there is a bona fide dispute as to the Producer's liability therefor, there will be no late payment charge during the pendency of the dispute.
The Producer shall keep or have access to (i) complete records showing all cities in the United States and Canada in which all television motion pictures subject to this Agreement have been telecast and the number of telecasts in each such city, the television stations on which telecast, and the dates thereof, and (ii) complete records showing Distributor’s Foreign Gross for such pictures to the extent that such records are pertinent to the computation of payments for foreign telecasting. Producer shall also keep or have access to such records as are necessary for the computation of additional compensation for reruns and foreign telecasts for so long as such rerun or foreign telecast payments may be due or payable. Screen Actors Guild shall have the right, at all reasonable times, to inspect such records.

(f)	If a performer’s individual employment contract contains a provision giving such performer a percentage or other participation in the receipts, revenues or profits of the television motion picture, such payment shall be credited against the minimum additional compensation for reruns and foreign telecasts provided herein, but the performer, in any event, shall be entitled to be paid not less than such minimum additional compensation for reruns and foreign telecasts, and any payment on account thereof shall likewise be credited against such participation. However, unless such rerun and foreign telecasting payments have been exceeded by profit participation payments, rerun payments shall be due and payable as provided in subsection (b)(4 >b) of this Section 18 and foreign telecasting payments shall be due and payable as provided in subsection (c) of this Section 18 and any such payments shall likewise be credited against such participation.

No IACF contributions shall be due in connection with such payments.
The term “upon release,” as used in the first paragraph of this Section 18.1, means that the television motion picture product is available, which is when it first may be exhibited in basic cable pursuant to the terms of a license or distribution agreement.

Under this rateable distribution formula, any series performer whose performance is used in the episode shall be assigned three (3) units; any weekly freelance performer whose performance is used in the episode shall be assigned two (2) units; and any other performer (including a day performer, three-day performer or a performer employed under Exhibit A) whose performance is used in the episode will be assigned one (1) unit.
An Implementation Committee shall be established for the purpose of addressing problems arising in connection with the implementation of the new rateable distribution formula. In addition, the parties shall recommend that the Trustees of the Industry Advancement and Cooperative Fund develop a method for reimbursing Producers for payment of certain claims arising out of inadvertent omissions from final cast lists and other cast list adjustments occasioned by the change in the rateable distribution formula for television motion pictures.
19.	ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION FOR THEATRICAL RIGHTS______________________________________________
(a)	The rights granted to the Producer in a television motion picture shall be limited (except as provided in Sections 20 and 20.1) to the right to exhibit such motion picture over free television anywhere.

(3)	In any event, the initial payment for theatrical exhibition in either of such geographical areas shall be one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the total applicable minimum: the extra fifty percent (50%) shall constitute a prepayment against the payment due for theatrical exhibition in the other area. Upon the later theatrical exhibition in such other area, the balance of such payment required under subparagraph (2) above shall be paid to the performer.
(4)	Total applicable minimum is the total minimum salary for the type of contract under which the performer was employed for the period of the performer’s employment in the television motion picture.
(5)	As an alternative to the provisions of subparagraph (c)(1), (2), (3) and (4) above, fora limited theatrical release of a long-form television motion picture, the Producer shall pay fifty percent (50%) of “total applicable minimum,” as that term is defined in subparagraph (4) above, to each performer appearing in the motion picture for release in each of the areas described below:

SAG will in good faith consider adjustments in these zones on a case-by-case basis.
These special residual provisions for long-form television motion pictures shall automatically terminate on June 30, 2008.

20.	SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS EXHIBITION OF TELEVISION MOTION PICTURES, THE PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY OF WHICH COMMENCED AFTER JULY 20.1952 BUT PRIOR TO JULY 21.1980____________________
Television motion pictures produced under a prior Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement, the principal photography of which commenced after July 20,1952 but prior to July 21, 1980, which are released by Producer for exhibition in “Supplemental Markets,” as that term is defined below, anywhere in the world, shall be governed by the provisions relating to additional compensation payable to performers for exhibition of television motion pictures in Supplemental Markets of the applicable Television Agreement under which such pictures were produced. However, for purposes of such provisions of such Agreements, the term “Supplemental Markets” shall be defined as hereinafter provided and the term “Distributor’s gross receipts” shall be defined as hereinafter provided.
(a)	Definition of Supplemental Markets
The term “Supplemental Markets,” as used in this Section 20, and for purposes of Section 20.1, means only: The exhibition of television motion pictures by means of cassettes (to the limited extent provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (a), or Pay Television, as those terms are hereafter defined in this paragraph (a), and the exhibition of television motion pictures on any commercial carrier such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses (referred to herein as “in-flight”).
The rights granted to the Producer in a television motion picture shall include the right to exhibit such motion picture in Supplemental Markets. This right shall exist not only with respect to television motion pictures produced during the term of this Agreement, but also with respect to all television motion pictures produced by the Producer under prior collective bargaining agreements between Producers and the Union from and after July 21, 1952, subject to any restrictions provided in any performer’s individual employment contract.
(1)	Cassettes:
For the purpose of this Section 20, and for purposes of Section 20.1, a cassette is any audio-visual device, including, without limitation, cassette, cartridge, phonogram or other similar audio-visual device now known or hereafter devised, containing a television motion picture (recorded on film, disc, tapes or other material) and designed for replay through a television receiver or comparable device. The sale or rental of cassettes for replay through a television receiver or comparable
-58-
device in the home or in closed-circuit use, such as in hotel rooms, constitutes “Supplemental Markets.”
(2)	Pay Television:
The term “pay television,” as used in this Section 20, and for purposes of Section 20.1, shall mean exhibition on a television screen in the home by means of a telecast, cable, closed-circuit, satellite to home or CATV where substantially all systems to which the program is licensed meet the following tests:
a)	a separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a major charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel;
and/or
b)	the subscriber pays for the motion picture or motion pictures selected (except that a motion picture or motion pictures selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television);
and/or
c)	the subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a major charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those types of services and systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television services or systems.
The term “pay television,” as used in this Section 20, and for purposes of Section 20.1, shall also include the exhibition of television motion pictures through a television receiver or comparable device by means of telecast, cable, closed circuit, satellite or CATV for which the viewing audience (whether by the individual viewer or by the hotel, motel, hospital or other accommodation where the viewer is) pays to receive the program by making a separate payment for such specific program. Exhibition in theatres or comparable places by such means is theatrical exhibition and shall not be considered pay television.
The term “Supplemental Markets” does not include the exhibition of a television motion picture by cassette or otherwise over a television broadcast station or in theatrical exhibition. Subject to Section 18.1, the exhibition of motion pictures made for free television
- 59-
exhibition on “basic cable” is considered free television exhibition, as distinguished from “Supplemental Markets” exhibition.
(b)	Definition of Distributor’s Gross Receipts
(1)	For purposes of calculating Supplemental Market fees due from the distribution of television motion pictures to “pay television,” as defined above, the term “Distributor's gross receipts” shall mean the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor (who may be the Producer or a distributor licensed by the Producer) from licensing the right to exhibit such picture on “pay television,” as defined above; provided, however, that in the case of any such picture which is produced outside of the United States, if such picture is subject to this Agreement and if such production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a “foreign production deal”) pursuant to which a foreign producer or distributor provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of such picture or furnishes any other consideration for such production and a foreign distributor acquires one or more foreign territories for the distribution of such picture in Supplemental Markets, then no monies from any such distribution in any such foreign territory shall be included in “Distributor’s gross receipts” except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Producer or to the distributor of such picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
If the distributor of such picture does not distribute such picture directly in Supplemental Markets, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute such picture, then the “Distributor’s gross receipts” shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit such picture in Supplemental Markets. In case of an outright sale of the Supplemental Markets distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the “Distributor’s gross receipts.” If any such outright sale shall include Supplemental Markets exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the “Distributor’s gross receipts.” In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the current market value of Supplemental Markets exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
If the Union shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided; and in the event the
-60-
Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, he shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be allocated. If the outright sale includes Supplemental Markets distribution rights to more than one (1) motion picture, Producer shall likewise allocate to each such picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the Supplemental Market rights; and if the Union contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as provided herein. If the Arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, the Arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each such picture. Nothing with respect to the price received on the outright sale of only Supplemental Markets distribution rights in a single such picture shall be subject to arbitration except that, in the event of a dispute, there may be arbitrated the question of whether the price reported by the Producer to the Guild as having been received by the Producer on such outright sale is less than the amount actually received by the Producer on such outright sale.
(2)	For purposes of calculating Supplemental Markets fees due from the distribution of television motion pictures on “cassettes,” as defined above, the term “Distributor’s gross receipts” is defined as follows:
a)	If the Producer is the Distributor or the Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the “Distributor’s gross receipts” derived from the distribution of such picture by “cassettes” shall be twenty percent (20%) of the worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if the Distributor is also the retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made as between the Distributor as distributor and the Distributor as retailer, and twenty percent (20%) of the former only shall be deemed to be “Distributor's gross receipts.” The reasonableness of such allocation shall be subject to arbitration, and in such arbitration, generally prevailing trade practices in the cassette industry with respect to dealings between non-related companies shall be relevant evidence.
b)	If the Distributor is not the Producer and is not owned by or affiliated with the Producer, the “Distributor’s gross receipts” shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the fees received by the Producer from licensing the right to distribute such picture by cassette.
c)	In case of an outright sale of the Supplemental
Markets distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the “Distributor’s gross receipts.” If any such outright sale shall include
-61 -
Supplemental Markets exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Producer shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the “Distributor’s gross receipts.” In reaching this determination, Producer may consider the current market value of Supplemental Markets exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
(3)	The “Distributor's gross receipts,” as that term is used in subsections (b)(1) and (2) above, shall not include:
a)	Sums realized or held by way of deposit as security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable;
b)	Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes returned (and, in this connection, the Producer shall have the right to set up a reasonable reserve for returns);
c)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the Producer or such other distributor; but there shall not be excluded from “Distributor’s gross receipts” any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Producer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business;

If such currency may be utilized or transmitted as aforesaid, it shall be deemed to have been converted to United States dollars at the rate of exchange at which such currency was actually transmitted to the United States as aforesaid or, if not actually transmitted, then at the prevailing free market rate of exchange at the time such right to use or to transmit occurs. Frozen foreign currency shall be deemed to be unblocked on the basis of “first in. first out” unless otherwise allocated by local foreign fiscal authorities.

(4)	Allocation of Gross Receipts
If any agreement for distribution in Supplemental Markets includes more than one (1) television motion picture, or includes both Supplemental Markets rights and other rights, the Producer shall make a reasonable allocation for the purpose of determining payments hereunder. If the Guild contends that such allocation is not reasonable, then such claim shall be submitted to arbitration under Section 50 of this Agreement.
(5)	A “non-returnable advance” is to be included in “Distributor’s gross receipts” when a television motion picture subject to the Supplemental Markets provisions of this or any prior Television Agreement is “available” and “identifiable” and the amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable.”
a)	Such television motion picture is “available” when the first of the following occurs:
(1)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
(2)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
b)	Such television motion picture is “identifiable” when the Producer first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
c)	The amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable” if:
(1)	the advance is for one television motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(2)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Producer shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets.
As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in “Distributor’s gross receipts” for that quarter. The Producer
shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of “Distributor’s gross receipts,” which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
d)	If such television motion picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Producer does not provide the Guild with the information required by this Agreement and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in “Distributor's gross receipts” no later than six (6) months after the Producer receives it.
e)	An advance received by a Producer’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Producer or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Producer.
(6)	The provisions of this Section shall not apply with respect to any performer in connection with use in Supplemental Markets if no part of the performer’s performance is used in the film as released in Supplemental Markets.

An inadvertent failure on the part of any such Distributor to comply with any of the reporting provisions of this subsection (a) shall in no event constitute a default by the Producer or such Distributor or a breach of this Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice in writing thereof from the Screen Actors Guild.
In the event of the expiration or termination of any distribution agreement, the obligation of Producer to obtain and deliver to SAG such Television Distributor's Assumption Agreement shall apply as well to any subsequent distribution agreement entered into by Producer, and

Producer shall obtain and deliver an executed Television Distributor's ' Assumption Agreement within ten (10) days after the execution of each such subsequent distribution agreement.	(
With respect to any such motion picture produced hereunder, SAG, prior to the commencement of principal photography of such motion picture, may require such financial assurances from Producer as it deems	t
advisable to insure performance of Producer’s obligations to pay the	\
Residuals, including, without limitation, the execution of security agreements, guarantees or other protective agreements, subject.	(
however, to the following:
If SAG shall require financial assurances from the Producer in the form of a security agreement for a security interest in the Picture, so long as the Residuals are timely paid with respect to all territories, media and term acquired by the Distributor in accordance with Sections 18, 18.1, 19 and/or 20.1 of the Television	\

such security agreement which would in any way interfere with the / rights of the Distributor to distribute the Picture and receive all revenues from such distribution, provided that such Distributor has executed and delivered a Television Distributor’s Assumption Agreement to SAG and is in compliance with the terms thereof.
If any “Qualified Residual Payor” assumes in perpetuity under the Television Distributor’s Assumption Agreement the	i
obligation to pay the Residuals for all territories and media with respect to the Picture or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to SAG all of such obligations thereunder, SAG will release and	I
cause to be discharged of record all such security interests, liens, charges or encumbrances entered into by or obtained from such Producer and will not require further financial assurances from | such Producer; provided, however, the Producer’s primary liability ( as a Producer shall not be released thereby.
If any “Qualified Residual Payor” acquires rights to distribute the Picture in specific territories and media (but not all territories and media) in perpetuity, and has assumed responsibility for the ( payment of Residuals for such territories and media so acquired pursuant to the Television Distributor's Assumption Agreement or ( guarantees in a written form satisfactory to SAG all of such	i
obligations thereunder, then if the Producer has granted or thereafter grants a security interest in favor of SAG in the Picture and related collateral as defined in the SAG Security Agreement, SAG: (i) agrees to modify the definition of the collateral in die t SAG Security Agreement to exclude those territories and media acquired by such Qualified Residual Payor, and (ii) acknowledges ,
-72-
Qualified Residual Payor's continuing rights of full, unlimited but non-exclusive access to and use of any and all physical items and elements relating to the Picture.
If any “Qualified Residual Payor” acquires rights to distribute the Picture in specific territories and media for a limited period of time, and has assumed responsibility for the payment of Residuals for such term and in such territories and media pursuant to the Television Distributor’s Assumption Agreement or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to SAG all of such obligations thereunder, then any security agreement or security interest obtained by SAG from the Producer in connection with the Picture shall remain in effect, but SAG agrees: (i) to modify the definition of the collateral in the SAG Security Agreement to exclude those territories and media for the term of the rights acquired by the Qualified Residual Payor, including renewals and extensions; and (ii) acknowledges the Qualified Residual Payor’s continuing rights of frill, unlimited but non-exclusive access to and use of any and all physical items and elements relating to the Picture.
In addition to those distributors who have been deemed “Qualified Residual Payors” by SAG due to their past bargaining relationship and/or Residuals payment history, the term “Qualified Residual Payor” shall mean a Distributor who satisfies the requirements set forth in Paragraphs A. and B. below:
A.	Distributor has the financial history, liquidity, net earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, assets, and net worth to establish its present and future ability to pay Residuals arising from the exploitation of the SAG Pictures being distributed.
B.	The Distributor has been in business for five (5) or more years and has a history of prompt and proper payment of Residuals pursuant to SAG contracts in five (5) consecutive years immediately prior to seeking Qualified Residual Payor status.
A Qualified Residual Payor shall have the right to elect, with respect to each SAG Picture for which it has distribution rights, whether or not to assume Residuals obligations or guarantee the payment of Residuals in accordance with the Qualified Residual Payor’s Letter of Agreement, for the territories and media for which it has distribution rights. However, the Qualified Residual Payor shall be entitled to the rights of a Qualified Residual Payor hereunder only when it elects to so assume such obligations or so guarantee the payment of Residuals.
In the event of a dispute as to qualifications of an applicant for Qualified Residual Payor status, Producer shall provide such financial
-73-
assurances as SAG may deem appropriate, which may include, but are not limited to, a security interest in the Picture and related collateral, in which case Distributor shall acknowledge same. Said security interest shall remain effective unless and until it is established by agreement or in an arbitration, pursuant to the arbitration provisions contained in the Television Agreement, that the applicant Distributor meets the aforementioned requirements for qualification. Such applicant shall have the burden of proof that it satisfies the aforementioned requirements for qualification in any arbitration and shall, upon SAG's request, furnish to SAG all relevant financial or corporate information relating thereto as SAG may reasonably require.
Any information submitted to SAG in order to determine whether a distributor is entitled to status as a Qualified Residual Payor shall, at the Distributor’s discretion, be subject to reasonable confidentiality arrangements.
In the event that a Qualified Residual Payor, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, generally fails to report and/or pay Residuals when they are due or generally fails to pay obligations to creditors when they become due or in the event a petition is filed under the Bankruptcy Code by or against a Qualified Residual Payor, SAG shall have the right to terminate the Distributor's Qualified Residual Payor status. The Distributor shall have the right to invoke the arbitration procedures described above to challenge such termination. Pending the resolution of such challenge, the Qualified Residual Payor's status shall be considered terminated. SAG agrees that it will not terminate a Qualified Residual Payor’s status when there is a bona fide dispute as to whether Residuals are due, or a bona fide dispute as to the amount of Residuals due to SAG, if the Distributor has otherwise timely reported and paid Residuals. In addition to the above, if a SAG audit conducted pursuant to the Television Agreement or other financial information discloses that the Qualified Residual Payor no longer meets the aforementioned standards for qualification, SAG may initiate an arbitration pursuant to the Television Agreement to terminate the Qualified Residual Payor’s status.

BUYER’S REPRESENTATIVE OR GENERAL COUNSEL 
The Producer agrees to deliver to SAG an executed copy of the above referred to Television Buyer’s Assumption Agreement within ( thirty (30) days after the sale, assignment or transfer of such motion picture, with the name and address of the purchaser or assignee, and a / complete cast list for such television motion picture, including social security numbers and rerun salary information. Failure to comply with , this requirement shall be deemed a substantial breach of this Agreement. An inadvertent failure on the part of the Producer to comply with any of the provisions of this paragraph shall in no event constitute a default by ( the Producer or a breach of this Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Screen Actors Guild.
-80-
Any inadvertent failure on the part of the Buyer to comply with any of the reporting provisions of this subsection (b) shall in no event constitute a default by the Producer or such Buyer or a breach of this Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice in writing thereof from the Screen Actors Guild.
Upon delivery of such Television Buyer’s Assumption Agreement and other documents from Buyer required under this Assumption Agreement and on condition that SAG approves in writing the financial responsibility of the purchaser, assignee or transferee, Producer shall not be further liable for the keeping of any such records, or for the payment of Residuals in accordance with said applicable Section, it being agreed that the purchaser, assignee or transferee shall solely be liable therefor.
SAG agrees that it will not unreasonably withhold its approval of the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee or transferee, it being further agreed that if SAG, within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of written notice of any such sale, assignment or transfer, has not advised the Producer that it disapproves the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee, SAG will be deemed to have approved the financial responsibility thereof. If any such purchaser, assignee or transferee is a Qualified Residual Payor, then the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be deemed automatically approved. In the event SAG advises the Producer within such twenty-one (21) day period that it disapproves the financial responsibility of any such purchaser, assignee or transferee and Producer disputes such disapproval, the Producer shall have the right, at its election, to cause to be immediately submitted to arbitration, pursuant to the provisions of Section 50 hereof, the issue of whether SAG has unreasonably withheld the approval of the financial responsibility of such purchaser, assignee or transferee for payments due hereunder.
To the extent that Producer has granted a security interest in favor of SAG in the Picture and related collateral as defined in any SAG Security Agreement, Buyer’s rights in the Picture acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement shall be subject to the following:
So long as the Buyer timely pays Residuals for the Picture with respect to all territories and media in which Buyer has distribution rights in accordance with Sections 18, 18.1, 19 and/or 20.1 of the Television Agreement, as applicable, SAG shall not exercise any rights under such security agreement which would in any way interfere with the rights of the Buyer to distribute the Picture and receive all revenues from such distribution, provided that such Buyer has executed and delivered a Television Buyer's Assumption Agreement to SAG and is in compliance with the terms thereof.
-81 -
If any “Qualified Residual Payor” assumes in perpetuity under the Television Buyer’s Assumption Agreement the obligation to pay the Residuals for all territories and media with respect to the Picture or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to SAG all of such obligations thereunder, SAG will release and cause to be discharged of record all such security interests, liens, charges or encumbrances entered into or obtained from such Producer and will not require further financial assurances from such Producer.
If any “Qualified Residual Payor” acquires rights to distribute the Picture in specific territories and media (but not all territories and media) in perpetuity, and has assumed responsibility for the payment of Residuals for such territories and media so acquired pursuant to the Television Buyer’s Assumption Agreement or guarantees in a written form satisfactory to SAG all of such obligations thereunder, then if the Producer has granted a security interest in favor of SAG in the Picture and related collateral as defined in the SAG Security Agreement, SAG: (i) agrees to modify the definition of the collateral in the SAG Security Agreement to exclude those territories and media acquired by such Qualified Residual Payor; and (ii) acknowledges Qualified Residual Payor’s continuing rights of full, unlimited but nonexclusive access to and use of any and all physical items and elements relating to the Picture.
In addition to those buyers who have been deemed “Qualified” by SAG due to their past bargaining relationship and/or Residuals payment history, the term “Qualified Residual Payor” shall mean a Buyer who satisfies the requirements set forth in Paragraphs A. and B. below:
A.	Buyer has the financial history, liquidity, net earnings before interest, taxes and amortization, assets, and net worth to establish its present and future ability to pay all Residuals arising from the exploitation of the SAG Pictures being distributed.
B.	The Buyer has been in business for five (5) or more years and has a history of prompt and proper payment of Residuals pursuant to SAG contracts in five (5) consecutive years immediately prior to seeking Qualified Buyer status.
A Qualified Residual Payor shall have the right to elect, with respect to each SAG Picture for which it has distribution rights, whether or not to assume Residuals obligations or guarantee the payment of Residuals in accordance with the Qualified Residual Payor’s Letter of Agreement, for the territories and media for which it has distribution rights. However, the Qualified Residual Payor shall be entitled to the
-82-
rights of a Qualified Residual Payor hereunder only when it elects to so assume such obligations or so guarantee the payment of Residuals.
In the event of a dispute as to qualifications of an applicant for Qualified Residual Payor status, Producer shall provide such financial assurances as SAG may deem appropriate, which may include, but are not limited to, a security interest in the Picture and related collateral, in which case Buyer shall acknowledge same. Said security interest shall remain effective unless and until it is established by agreement or in an arbitration, pursuant to the arbitration provisions contained in the Television Agreement, that the applicant Buyer meets the aforementioned requirements for qualification. Such applicant shall have the burden of proof that it satisfies the aforementioned requirements for qualification in any arbitration, and shall, upon SAG's request, furnish to SAG all relevant financial or corporate information relating thereto as SAG may reasonably require.
Any information submitted to SAG in order to determine whether a Buyer is entitled to status as a Qualified Residual Payor shall, at the Buyer’s discretion, be subject to reasonable confidentiality arrangements.
In the event a Qualified Residual Payor, after notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure, generally fails to report and/or pay Residuals when they are due or generally fails to pay obligations to creditors when they become due or in the event a petition is filed under the Bankruptcy Code by or against a Qualified Residual Payor, SAG shall have the right to terminate the buyer’s Qualified Residual Payor status. The Qualified Residual Payor shall have the right to invoke the arbitration procedures described above to challenge such termination. Pending the resolution of such challenge, the Qualified Residual Payor’s status shall be considered terminated. SAG agrees that it will not terminate a Qualified Residual Payor’s status when there is a bona fide dispute over whether Residuals are due to SAG, or a bona fide dispute as to the amount of Residuals due to SAG, if the Distributor has otherwise timely reported and paid Residuals. In addition to the above, if a SAG audit conducted pursuant to the Television Agreement or other financial information discloses that the Qualified Residual Payor no longer meets the aforementioned standards for qualification, SAG may initiate an arbitration pursuant to the Television Agreement to terminate the Qualified Residual Payor’s status.
(c)	If Producer dissolves and if a Distributor assumes all of the obligations of the Producer for the payment of Residuals, and the financial responsibility of the Distributor is approved by SAG in its discretion, then Producer shall thereupon be released of any obligation with respect to any payments due hereunder.
-83-
(d)	No television network, station, sponsor or advertising agency shall be required to execute any Television Distributor’s Assumption Agreement or Television Buyer’s Assumption Agreement or shall be bound by the automatic provisions of subsections (a) and/or (b) above, unless it is the distributor of such television motion picture or the buyer of the Producer’s television rights in such motion picture, as the case may be.
(e)	Producer, or any distributor making payment on behalf of Producer, subject to the terms of this Agreement with respect to compensation for reruns of television programs, shall furnish to the Union the following supporting information with respect to each payment, as applicable:
(1)	The name of the series and identification of the episode;
(2)	The run and whether it is network or syndicated;
(3)	The amount of grosses (other than domestic broadcast of television product) and the level of percentage being paid;

(5)	A list of all deductions such as federal income tax, Social Security, state income tax, state disability insurance, municipal taxes (where applicable), and deductions to charities and credit unions; and
(6)	A copy of Producer’s quarterly pension and health reports.
The foregoing information may be furnished in more than one document, such as the check stub itself and a separate list of other information. In addition, information which does not change (such as a cast list), once reported, need not be repeated with subsequent rerun payments.

Such an option may not extend past twelve (12) months from the date of completion of principal photography of such pilot. In the event no pilot is made, such option may not extend past twelve (12) months from the date of such option agreement. When no pilot is made, payment of the required salary as consideration for the option shall be paid no later than seven (7) days after test or the execution of the option agreement, whichever is earlier. If such option is exercised, the performer must commence to receive compensation not later than the expiration of such twelve (12) months.

(1)	If, during the option period, but after the first six (6)
months thereof, the Producer obtains a bona fide commitment for the production of the series and actually commences the principal photography of such series pursuant to such commitment but does not exercise the option on such performer within the option period, then the Producer shall pay such performer a sum equal to the aggregate minimum compensation which is applicable to the form of hiring specified in the performer’s contract for the first thirteen (13) week production period of the program.
(2)	During the option period, but after the first six (6)
months thereof, the performer shall be free to accept commitments for any other employment and if, after the expiration of the first six (6) months of the option period, the Producer exercises its option, the rights of the Producer to the performer’s services in the program shall be subject to all bona fide binding commitments entered into by the performer after the expiration of the first six (6) months of the option
-97-
period and prior to the exercise of the option by the Producer. In such case, no payment of a nature mentioned in (1) above shall be payable by the Producer.
(3)	During the option period, but after the expiration of the first six (6) months thereof, the performer shall have the right to accept any other employment on condition that on each occasion during the option period, but after the first six (6) months thereof, that the performer desires to accept a conflicting engagement, before the performer accepts a commitment for such employment, the performer will notify the Producer thereof and will afford the Producer the opportunity to preempt such other employment by exercising its option within a specified time after such notice from the performer. The specified time referred to in the preceding sentence shall not exceed seven (7) consecutive days if the proposed conflicting engagement is for a period not exceeding four (4) weeks or not to exceed fourteen (14) consecutive days if the proposed conflicting engagement is for a period of more than four (4) weeks. Such right of preemption will continue during the option period until either Producer exercises its option or the option lapses. In such case, no payment of a nature mentioned in (1) above shall be payable by the Producer.
“Conflicting engagement,” as used above, shall be an engagement which, if accepted and fulfilled, would extend beyond thirty (30) days from the date of performer’s notice to the Producer.
The limitations imposed by this subparagraph (a) shall not be applicable to options obtained by Producers upon die services of performers who received $8,500 or more with respect to the pilot program, or for the option, and whose contracts call for weekly or per episode payments of at least $8,500 if the option is exercised.

-98-
b)	Such performer’s contract gives him the right, after any six (6) month period he has been held under option within the contract year without employment under such contract, to freely accept other commitments subject only to a right of preemption on the part of the Producer. Such preemption shall be governed by the provisions of (a)(3) above.
(2)	With respect to any such series performer who is employed in a series of one and one-half hour programs, Producer shall not have the right to exercise an option for an additional contract year unless such performer, if employed under a series contract form of hiring guaranteeing at least thirteen (13) episodes, shall have been employed or paid during the then-current contract year for a minimum of sixteen (16) episodes; and if employed under a series contract form of hiring guaranteeing fewer than thirteen (13) episodes, such performer shall have been employed or paid during the then current contract year for a minimum of nine (9) episodes.
(3)	With reference to the form of hiring referred to in Section 13 of this Agreement, a Producer may not exercise an option for a subsequent contract year on a series performer who receives less than $8,500 per episode or per week, unless such performer shall have been employed or paid during the then-current contract year for a minimum of six (6) episodes or unless the performer’s contract gives him the rights set forth in subsection (b)( 1 )b) of this Section.

The demand for arbitration shall be filed not later than one (1) year after the date of filing of the grievance. A demand for
- 135-
arbitration may be filed prior to initiation or conclusion of the conciliation proceeding if it reasonably appears that the conciliation proceedings will not be concluded in sufficient time to permit the arbitration proceeding to be commenced in time.
The demand for arbitration shall be served upon the other party by first class mail addressed to the representative of the Union or the Producer designated to receive such service at such party’s last-known address or by personal service within or without the state where the proceeding is to be held.

In those instances in which the employer association fails to select on behalf of the Producer or in which the Producer who is not a member of an employer association fails to participate in the selection process, the Union may unilaterally select the arbitrator from the panel. The Producer shall unilaterally select the arbitrator from the panel if the Union fails to participate in the selection process.
The arbitration hearing will be commenced within sixty (60) days of the date that the arbitrator is selected. The arbitration award will be issued within thirty (30) days of the date of submission.

- 137 -
hereunder; and no judgment or order in any other action or proceeding shall affect, be used or be admissible in any arbitration hereunder, but it is expressly agreed that an arbitration award made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 50 shall not be affected by any court action or proceeding, but nothing herein shall preclude any court of competent jurisdiction from confirming, setting aside or modifying any arbitration award hereunder, in any proceeding brought for any such purpose, in accordance with applicable law.

(a)	Policy
(1)	The parties hereto reaffirm their commitment to: a) a policy of non-discrimination and fair employment in connection with the engagement and treatment of performers on the basis of sex, race, color, creed, national origin, age, marital status, disability or sexual orientation, in accordance with applicable state and federal law; and b) to continue the active promotion of diversity, as set forth herein, in all categories of employment covered by this Agreement.
(2)	In accordance with the foregoing policy, the Union reaffirms its policy of non-discrimination with respect to admission to membership and rights of membership.
(3)	Producer shall cast performers in accordance with the policy set forth in Section 59(a)(1) above in all types of roles, having due regard for the requirements of, and suitability for, the role so that, for example, the American scene shall be portrayed realistically.
(4)	Consistent with the foregoing, every effort shall be made to include minorities, women, performers with disabilities (defined as those covered under the employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act) and performers aged 40 or over who are protected under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act in the casting of each motion picture, thereby creating fair and equal employment opportunity and eliminating stereotyping in casting.
When a role being cast depicts a person with a specific disability, the Producer agrees to include that fact in the casting specifications so as to enhance the opportunity for performers with similar disabilities to audition for the role.
(5)	When applicable, and with due regard to the safety of the individuals, cast and crew, women and minorities shall be considered for doubling roles and for descript and non-descript stunts on a functional, non-discriminatory basis. In furtherance of this policy, Producer shall furnish a copy of the following policy statement to each stunt coordinator engaged by Producer:
a)	Stunt coordinators shall endeavor to cast performers with physical disabilities for descript and non-descript stunts for which they are qualified and with due regard to safety, in roles portraying their particular disability, such as wheel chair stunts or stunts involving the use of other adaptive devices, e.g., crutches, prostheses, etc. The Union’s skills and talent bank is among the resources that can be utilized in ascertaining the availability of such performers.
b)	When the stunt performer doubles for a role which is identifiable as female and/or Black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific or Native American and the race and/or sex of the double are also so identifiable, stunt coordinators shall endeavor to cast qualified persons of the same sex and/or race involved. When the stuntperson is not identifiable, stunt coordinators shall endeavor to increase the employment of qualified women and minorities for such stunts. To achieve the objectives set forth in this paragraph, stunt coordinators should endeavor to identify and recruit qualified minority and female stuntpersons and qualified stuntpersons with disabilities prior to the commencement of production.
(6)	In furtherance of the policies expressed in this Section:
a)	There will be no pre-employment inquiries as to the performer's marital status, sexual orientation, age (except such lawful inquiries as may relate to the age of a minor), creed, disability (except such lawful inquiries as may relate to the ability of the performer to fulfill the requirements of the engagement, subject to the limitations imposed on such inquiries by the Americans with Disabilities Act), national origin nor ancestry of the performer, except when the same is a bona fide occupational qualification for a role.
b)	Representation by an agent or other performer’s representative shall not be required as a condition for an audition.
c)	Producer shall include the following statement in script breakdowns circulated by Producer to agents:
“Submissions for non-descript roles will be accepted for all performers, regardless of age, sex, ethnicity or disability.”
Producer will make good faith efforts to insure that outside casting services, breakdown services and agents with whom it does business include the same statement in breakdowns circulated by them. It is understood that inclusion of such statement on a breakdown is intended to encourage the implementation of the policies expressed in this Section throughout the community, but it is recognized that Producer may have legitimate casting objectives, dictated by such
- 148-
matters as the script, historic or geographic setting, creative concepts, etc., which may limit the appropriateness of certain submissions for particular roles and/or productions.
In order to encourage the implementation of the policies expressed in this Section, the AMPTP has agreed to meet with representatives of the Screen Actors Guild to discuss the casting of performers when members of classes protected by applicable federal and state anti-discrimination laws are substantially under-represented.
d)	The Producer agrees that each performer’s INS I-9 form will be maintained in the maimer required under the Immigration Reform and Control Act. The Producer further agrees that it will use the information contained in any performer's INS 1-9 form solely for the purpose of verifying his/her eligibility to work in the United States.
e)	The practice known as “painting down” is presumptively improper; the Producers will continue their dialogue with SAG and the stunt community on this issue.
(7)	It is understood that the provisions of this Agreement dealing with dressing rooms, transportation, lodging and access to the casting process apply to performers with disabilities so that, with respect to facilities under the control of the Producer, including but not limited to studios and location sets, reasonable accommodation under all the circumstances will be made when applying such provisions to performers with disabilities, in accordance with and to the extent required by the employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
(8)	In accordance with the employment provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Producer agrees to provide reasonable accommodations for hearing-impaired and/or visually-impaired performers during interviews, auditions and any engagement.
(b)	Data
(1)	Within twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar quarter, Producer will submit to the Union a report of the sex, ethnicity and age of performers (other than stunt performers and stunt coordinators) employed by Producer under this Agreement on each television motion picture and each episode of each television series produced by Producer on which principal photography was completed during such quarter. The report will be submitted on the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, it being understood that a report produced by Producer’s data processing system which furnishes the same information as required in this form shall be acceptable. A separate quarterly report
-149-
shall be submitted to the Union for stunt performers and stunt coordinators, containing data on the sex, ethnicity and age of stunt performers and stunt coordinators, stunt performer and stunt coordinator totals and whether, for the stunt performer, the stunt is descript, non-descript or unknown. The report will be submitted on the form attached hereto as Exhibit E-l. it being understood that a report produced by Producer's data processing system which furnishes the same information as required in this form shall be acceptable. The parties will cooperate in devising a method for compiling employment data as to performers with disabilities, which may include data from the Union's skills and talent bank and SAG pension and health records. When a method for compiling employment data with respect to performers with disabilities has been agreed upon, Producer shall report such employment data in one of the reporting forms provided above.
(2)	In the event the Producer fails to submit a report within the time specified in paragraph (1) above, the Union may send a written notice of delinquency to the Producer requesting submission of the report within ten (10) working days of receipt of the notice.
If there is a substantial breach of the foregoing reporting requirements with respect to any individual quarterly report, liquidated damages in the amount of $600 shall be payable to the Union; in the event there is a dispute.as to whether or not a substantial breach has occurred, the matter may be referred to arbitration. With respect to the data furnished on age and ethnicity and any data furnished on performers with disabilities, it is recognized that, while Producers shall be obligated to make reasonable efforts to ascertain such information, subject to any legal restriction applicable thereto, there may be individual circumstances in which Producer will be unable to secure the data or vouch for its accuracy. It is understood that as to employment data on performers with disabilities, such liquidated damages shall apply only to the extent that the parties have devised a method for compiling employment data for performers with disabilities.
(3)	The data which is furnished by Producer in accordance with this Section shall be for the purpose of facilitating the meeting which the Union may request pursuant to subsection (c) below, and is in no way intended to abridge the Producer’s creative rights in the production of films.

If particular scripts or script breakdowns are relevant to the subject matter of the requested meeting, the Union may request the Producer to furnish such scripts and/or breakdowns to a designated Union official for review prior to the meeting. When the Producer utilizes market research data to support its contention that in a particular production the American scene has been portrayed realistically, the Union may request to review such data at the meeting.
(2)	If the Union has information which is the basis for a genuine concern that the policies expressed in this Section are being violated, and the matter is of such a nature that the procedures outlined in subparagraph (1) above are not adequate to handle the immediacy of the situation, the Union may request the type of meeting specified in subparagraph (1) above on three (3) working days notice.

Consistent with subparagraph (b)(3) above, nothing in this subsection (c) will require a Producer to furnish scripts or breakdowns prior to the completion of casting for any particular production.
(4)	If the Producer has an official with responsibilities for matters involving equal opportunity, the Union’s request for a meeting shall be referred to such person, who shall then be responsible for arranging the meeting with the appropriate Producer representatives. If the Producer has no such person on staff, the Producer will designate such a person for the purpose of arranging the requested meeting and the Union will be notified in writing of the person so designated.

Re: Television Screen Credits
Dear Ken:
During the 1986 negotiations between the Producers represented by the Alliance of Notion Picture t Television Producers and the Screen Actors Guild, the Screen Actors Guild contended that the credits on the cast of characters card at the end of certain television shows are not "in a readily readable color, size and speed” as required by Section 25(a)(1) of the Television Agreement. To address this problem, the parties agreed that meetings, comprising representatives of the Screen Actors Guild, the AMPTP, the studio and the Executive Producer of the television program involved, shall be convened upon the request of the Screen Actors Guild. The purpose of such meetings is to discuss, devise, develop and implement means by which the parties may conciliate such disputes. However, the foregoing shall not affect any other rights or remedies any party may have under the Agreement.
Sincerely,
ACCEPTED AHO AGREED:

Re: Waiver re Domestic Free Television Residuals for One-Hour Dramatic Series
Dear Nick:
A.	Revenues Contracted For: The Screen Actors Guild hereby grants a limited waiver from the provisions of Section 18(bX2) of the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement, and the comparable provisions of all prior Television Agreements, to all Producers signatory hereto with regard to residuals payable pursuant thereto (“fixed residual payments") for episodes of one-hour network prime time dramatic series, which series have not been exhibited in syndication prior to July I, 2005 (except those series which have been released in syndication prior to that date under the terms of Sideietter B of the 1989,1992, 1995,1998 or 2001 SAG Television Agreements are eligible to be paid under Sideletter B of those Agreements).
The Guild also hereby grants a limited waiver from the provisions of Section 18(bX2) of the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement, and the comparable provisions of all prior Television Agreements, to all Producers signatory hereto with regard to fixed residuals payments for episodes of the following one-hour series which have not been exhibited in syndication prior to July 1, 2005 (except those series which have been released in syndication prior to that date under the terms of Sideletter B of the 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998 or 2001 SAG Television Agreements are eligible to be paid under Sideletter B of those Agreements): (I) one-hour dramatic series made for “late night” network broadcast which are rerun in syndication, and (ii) one-hour dramatic series made for network prime time which are rerun on “late night” network television, provided that all performers employed on any such episodes covered under this subparagraph (ii) which were produced after June 30. 2005 must have been employed under residual terms and conditions not less favorable than those provided under this Agreement. For this purpose, “late night” is defined as the hours between 11:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (10:00 p.m. in the Central and Mountain time zones) and 6:00 a.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (5:00 a.m. in the Central and Mountain time zones).

Residuals for episodes of such series shall be computed by multiplying the fixed residual amount otherwise due by a ratio, the numerator of which is the revenue contracted for by the distributor, as may be adjusted below, and the denominator of which is six hundred fifty thousand dollars ($650,000.00). As subsequent payments are made for any episode, appropriate payments or credits shall be made to bring earlier residual payments into conformity with any increase or decrease in the multiplier. In no event, however, shall any payment made pursuant to this limited waiver exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the fixed residual payment otherwise due. Similarly, any such payment shall not be Less than fifty percent (50%) of the fixed residual payment otherwise due, except in the case of series licensed only in markets representing fewer than one-third of all United States television households.
B.	Combination Sales: If a series qualifying hereunder is sold in combination with any other series or other program, the Producer shall allocate to each episode of the series qualifying hereunder a fair and reasonable portion of the revenues contracted for and shall include such amount in the numerator referred to above. The Producer shall notify the Guild when a series qualifying hereunder is sold in combination with another series or program and in such notice identify the other series or program involved. If the Guild contends that the amounts so allocated were not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration and the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated.
C.	Barter Syndication: If any series qualifying hereunder is syndicated with advertising time withheld by the distributor (r,e., barter syndication), the fair market value of the amount allocated to the “barter'’ portion of the deal shall be included in the numerator referred to above. The Producer shall notify the Guild when a series qualifying hereunder is syndicated in any barter arrangement. If the Guild contends that the amount so allocated does not represent the fair market value of the “barter,” such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration and the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine die fair market value to be so allocated.
D.	Reporting:
1.	The Producer shall make the foregoing payments within the time period set forth in Section 18(bX5) and in the manner required by Section 18(e). Simultaneously with each payment due hereunder, the Producer shall submit to the Guild a statement showing the per-episode market-by-market1 revenue amounts, detailed to reflect the cash and barter
1 The Guild agrees to maintain such information on a strictly confidential basts. The regular practice required by this Agreement is for the Producer to send the Guild the market-by-maricet information in the statement; however, it is recognized that in certain limited instances, the Producer may have business reasons, unrelated to compliance with this Basic Agreement, for believing that the inclusion in the written statements of specific market revenues contracted for. or some of them (as distinguished from the total revenues contracted for), may not be appropriate. In such instances, the Producer will advise the Guild that such figures are being omitted from its

components of the revenue, used to compute the multiplier for die episode. In calculating the numerator of such multiplier, the revenue contracted for by the distributor shall be adjusted by the Producer to take into account uncollected revenues, to the extent that such are evidenced by bankruptcy, contract restructuring (including amendments and cancellations), reorganizations or accounts that are more than 270 days delinquent. In its statement to the Guild, the Producer shall notify the Guild of any such adjustments and the basis therefor.
2.	If the Producer exchides any amounts not collected with respect to
contracts with any party whose debts have been discharged or whose contracts have been modified in a bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding, the Producer shall notify the Guild of the exclusion and, upon request, shall promptly provide the Guild with copies of court documents, including those which substantiate the discharge, reorganization or contract modification.
3.	Upon collection of any revenues previously treated as “uncollected” under Section D. above, the Producer shall add such collected revenues back into the numerator of the multiplier. Any increased amounts shall be due with the next payment otherwise required hereunder, but in no event later than four (4) months from recovery or collection of such revenues by the Producer. In its statement to the Guild, the Producer shall notify the Guild of the amount of such a collection and the basis therefor.
4.	In any dispute over a decrease in the numerator alleged to have been made under this Section D., the burden of proof shall be on the Producer to establish that such decrease comports with the terms and conditions hereof.
5.	The Producer affirms its obligations under Section 18(e)(2) and (3). Upon written request of the Guild, the Producer shall promptly send to the Guild copies of those parts of the contracts showing the financial terms relevant to the determination of the accuracy of the payments to be made hereunder? The Producer shall also, upon request of the Guild, provide the Guild promptly with access to any and all documents or records of the Producer reasonably necessary to confirm compliance with the foregoing terms and conditions and, thereafter, upon written request of the Guild, the Producer shall provide the Guild with copies of such documents and records. If the Producer in good faith contends that any of such documents or records are proprietary and/or confidential, the Guild shall in good faith seek to address appropriate
statement and the reasons therefor. In such cases, Producer will meet promptly to provide such figures in a confidential setting, limited to appropriate executives of the Guild and the Producer.
1 The Guild agrees to maintain such information mt a strictly confidential basis. It is recognized that in certain limited instances, the Producer may have business reasons, unrelated to compliance with this Basic Agreement, for believing that sending copies of financial terms of certain contracts to the Guild may not be appropriate. In such instances, the Producer may confer with the Guild to explain its concerns. The Guild shall in good faith consider the Producer’s concerns and, if it concurs with the Producer, it shall so indicate in writing and the Producer shall not be required to send such items.

Re: Waiver re Domestic Free Television Residuals for Long-Form Television Motion Pictures
Dear Nick:
A.	Revenues Contracted For The Screen Actors Guild hereby grants a limited waiver from the provisions of Section 18(bX2) of the 2005 Screen Actors Guild Television Agreement, and the comparable provisions of all prior Television Agreements, to all Producers signatory hereto with regard to residuals payable pursuant thereto (“fixed residual payments’’) for long-form (90 minutes or longer) television motion pictures which have not been exhibited in syndication prior to July 1.2005 (except those long-form television motion pictures which have been released in syndication prior to that date under the terms of Sideletter B-l of the 1992, 1995, 1998 or 2001 SAG Television Agreement are eligible to be paid under Sideletter B-l of that Agreement). The limited waiver shall apply to: (I) dramatic long-form television motion pictures made for network prime time which are rerun in syndication, (ii) dramatic long-form television pictures made for “late night" network broadcast which are rerun in syndication, and (iii) dramatic long-form television motion pictures made for network prime time which are rerun on “late night" network television, provided that all performers employed on any such television motion picture covered under this subparagraph (iii) which were produced after June 30, 2005 must have been employed under residual terms and conditions not less favorable than those provided under this Agreement. For this purpose, “late night" is defined as the hours between 11;00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (10:00 p.m. in the Central and Mountain time zones) and 6:00 a.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (5:00 a.m. in the Central and Mountain time zones).
Residuals for such television motion pictures shall be computed by multiplying the fixed residual amount otherwise due by a ratio, the numerator of which is the revenue contracted for by the distributor, as adjusted below, and the denominator of which is six hundred

fifty thousand dollars ($650,000.00). As subsequent payments are made for any episode, appropriate payments or credits shall be made to bring earlier residual payments into conformity with any increase or decrease in the multiplier. In no event, however, shall any payment made pursuant to this limited waiver exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the fixed residual payment otherwise due, nor shall any such payment be less than six percent (6%) of the fee received by the Producer from licensing the television motion picture in syndication or for “late night" network broadcasts.
B.	Combination Sales: If a television motion picture qualifying hereunder is sold in combination with any series or other motion picture, the Producer shall allocate to each long-form television motion picture qualifying hereunder a fair and reasonable portion of the revenues contracted for and shall include such amount in the numerator referred to above. If the Guild contends that the amounts so allocated were not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration and the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated.
C.	Barter Syndication: If any television motion picture qualifying hereunder is syndicated with advertising time withheld by the distributor (/.£., barter syndication), the fair market value of the amount allocated to the "barter" portion of the deal shall be included in the numerator referred to above. If the Guild contends that the amount so allocated does not represent the fair market value of the “barter," such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration and the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the fair market value to be so allocated.
D.	Reporting: The Producer shall make the foregoing payments within the time period set forth in Section 18(b)(5) and in the manner required by Section 18(e). Simultaneously with each payment due hereunder, the Producer shall submit to the Guild a statement showing the per-program revenue amounts, detailed to reflect the cash and barter components of the revenue, used to compute the multiplier for the program. In calculating the numerator of such multiplier, the revenue contracted for by the distributor shall be adjusted to take into account uncollected revenues, to the extent that such are evidenced by bankruptcy, contract restructuring (including amendments and cancellations), reorganizations or accounts that are more than 270 days delinquent. In any dispute over a decrease in the numerator alleged to have been made under this Section D., the burden of proof shall be on the Producer to establish that such decrease comports with the terms and conditions hereof.
The Producer affirms that, in addition to its obligations under Section 18(e)(2) and (3), it shall, upon request, provide the Guild with prompt access to any and all documents or records of the Producer reasonably necessary to confirm compliance with the foregoing terms and conditions.
Upon written request of the Guild, the Producer shall promptly send to the Guild copies of those parts of the contracts showing the financial terms relevant to the determination of

Re: Sideletter to Section 18(b)(2)c) - Experiment In Syndication of Half-Hour
Series In Markets Representing 50% or Fewer of U.S. Television Households
Dear Peter:
} Reference is made to the provisions of Section 18(bX2)c) of the 2005 SAG Television Agreement. During the 2005 negotiations, the Producers expressed a concern that if a series could only be syndicated in markets representing 50% or fewer of the U.S. television households, residuals payable pursuant to Section 18(bX2)c) would render such syndication fiscally untenable. The Producers asserted that the payment of any residuals in such circumstances would benefit both the Producer and the individual performers since no payments ) are presently made.
While die Guild expressed concern that an accommodation might be subject to abuse or
/ otherwise reduce overall syndication residuals, the parties agreed to an experiment for the term of this Agreement, to be reviewed by June 30,2008 to determine its effectiveness and whether or
. not it should be extended. In such regard, the Producers agree to provide the Guild with license fee information at the time of the first payment hereunder together with a detail of markets covered by the license agreement. If the series is later syndicated in additional markets, the Producer shall provide the Guild with a detail of the additional markets at the time of the
' payment immediately following such later syndication.
When a half-hour series is syndicated in markets representing in the aggregate fifty percent
)	(50%) or fewer of U.S. television households, residuals for such series shall be payable at twenty
percent (20%) of the “total applicable minimum salary" pursuant to Section 18(b)( 4)b) for each such run, but shall not constitute a “run" for purposes of Section 18(bX2)c).
If the series is further syndicated and the aggregate of the markets in which the series is syndicated exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the U.S. television households, the payments required pursuant to Section 18(bX2)c) shall be due on any subsequent runs.

EXHIBIT TO SIDELETTER B-2
The following chart provides examples of the cumulative residual payments due for a half-hour series that is initially sold to syndication markets representing 50% or fewer of U.S. television households. The examples assume one network exhibition prior to the fust run in syndication.
When a half-hour series is syndicated in markets representing in the aggregate 50% or fewer of U.S. television households, residuals for such series are payable at 20% of the total applicable minimum salary for each such run. If the series is further syndicated and the aggregate of the markets in which the series is syndicated exceeds 50% of U.S. television households, the payments required under the full syndication formula are due on any subsequent runs.
This chart is designed to provide examples as to how the new formula will work when a scries initially sold to syndication in markets representing 50% or fewer of U.S. television households is subsequently sold to markets that exceed the 50% threshold.
In Example 1, six runs of a half-hour series (with one prior ran on a network) are sold in syndication to markets representing less than 50% of U.S. television households. After three runs in syndication in those markets, the series is subsequently sold to additional markets, the aggregate of which then exceeds 50% of U.S. television households. For the first three runs, the Producer pays 60% of the total applicable minimum salary (20% of total applicable minimum for each run) to each performer. The next run in syndication is payable under the full syndication formula as if the first three runs in syndication had not taken place. Accordingly, the fourth run is paid as if it were the second run in syndication (remember one run already occurred on the network) at 40% of the total applicable minimum salary; the fifth run is paid at 30% of the total applicable minimum salary; and the sixth run is paid at 25% of the total applicable minimum salary.
In Example 2, six runs of a half-hour series (with one prior run on a network) are sold in syndication to markets representing less than 50% of U.S. television households. After four runs in syndication in those markets, the series is subsequently sold to additional markets, the aggregate of which then exceeds 50% of U.S. television households. For the first four runs, the Producer pays 80% of the total applicable minimum salary (20% of total applicable minimum for each run) to each performer. The next run in syndication is payable under the full syndication formula as if the first four runs in syndication had not taken place. Accordingly, the fifth run is paid as if it were the second run in syndication (remember one run already occurred on the network) at 40% of the total applicable minimum salary and the sixth run is paid at 30% of the total applicable minimum salary.
In Example 3, six runs of a half-hour series (with one prior run on a network) are sold in syndication to markets representing less than 50% of U.S. television households. After five runs in syndication in those markets, the series is subsequently sold to additional markets, the aggregate of which then exceeds 50% of U.S. television households. For the first five runs, the Producer pays 100% of the total applicable minimum salary (20% of total applicable minimum for each run) to each performer. The next run in syndication is payable under the full

)	Re: “Major Role Performers” in Episodic Series
Dear Peter:
This will confirm the understandings reached in connection with our agreement for a provision governing minimum guarantees for “major role performers" employed on episodic series:
(1)	Under the terms of our agreement, the definition of a “major role performer" is linked to specified forms of credit {i.e., “Guest Star," “Special Guest Star,” “Starring” or
' “Special Appearance By”) negotiated by the performer. The original definition proposed by the Screen Actors Guild included performers who received the above-referenced credits “or
.	variations thereof." The parties have agreed to delete the “or variations thereof’ language in
-	light of their mutual understanding that the new provision was intended to cover only that class
of performers which was traditionally receiving “top of the show" rates in the past. Since the
\ aforementioned credit designations best described that class, the parties agreed that the “or variations thereof language was not necessary.
Consistent with the foregoing, the parties reaffirm their intent neither to expand nor diminish the class of “major role performers.” To that end, it is agreed that new forms of credit will not be devised as a means of diminishing the number of performers who would
J otherwise be classified as “major role performers.”

(2)	The salary rales for a “major role” performer, other than one employed under the
day performer exception, are as follows:
Program	7/1/05-9/30/05	10/1/05-6/30/06	7/1/06-6/30/07	7/1/07-6/30/08
One-Half Hour	$3,736	$3,849	$3,961	$4,080
One Hour	5,977	6,158	6,338	6,527
(3)	The new salary guarantee for "major role performers" is a minimum term only insofar as initial compensation and compensation for network prime time reruns are concerned. For all other purposes (e.g., overtime or residuals for exhibition in syndication), minimum compensation for such performers shall be calculated on the same basis as for other weekly schedule performers employed under the same schedule.
(4)	It is permissible for agency commission fees to be deducted from the new salary guarantee for major role performers. However, this does not preclude the performer’s agent and the Producer from negotiating agency commission fees which are in addition to the new salary guarantee.
(5)	The parties agree to study casting practices with regard to “major role performers” and the possibility of identifying major role performers by Occupation Code when reported to the Plans.

The parties reserve al! of their respective legal positions with respect to such other exhibitions.
With respect to theatrical and television motion pictures, the Producer has agreed to a separate payment for this use on the Internet because Internet exhibition is at this time outside the primary market. The Producer reserves the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that this use constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical or television motion pictures, and that, therefore, no additional payment pursuant hereto should be made with respect to the exhibition of theatrical or television motion pictures (including those covered by this Agreement) on the Internet. The Guild reserves the right in future negotiations to contend to the contrary, and further to assert that regardless of whether other exhibitions are or have become part of the primary market, payment provisions for performers employed on motion pictures so exhibited should be improved.

Re: Obvious Physical Disabilities
Dear Peter:
In accordance with the agreement reached in 2001, the parties met to discuss how the Casting Data Reporting form (included in this Agreement as Exhibit E) can be revised to provide for reporting information on performers with obvious physical disabilities. The parties were unable to reach agreement, in part because of legal concerns expressed by the Producers. The parties agreed to discuss the subject further on a Company-by-Company basis, with the understanding that the Screen Actors Guild shall have the right to invite the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists to participate in such meetings.
During the 2005 negotiations, the parties agreed to seek a written opinion from the General Counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and from those agencies responsible for administering disability discrimination laws in major production centers with regard to the legality of compiling employment data on performers with obvious physical impairments. The parties agreed to meet within ninety (90) days following ratification of the 2005 Agreement to formulate a letter to be sent to those agencies; in connection therewith, the parties shall review the list of obvious physical impairments which are proposed to be compiled as pan of the reporting.
Each Producer agrees that if and when, through the processes outlined in this sideletter, the parties or any individual Producer agree upon a form and method of reporting such information, the parties or the individual Producer, as applicable, will promptly implement the agreed-upon procedures.
Sincerely.

Re: “Supersized" Episodes	('
Dear Peter
( This Sideletter applies to any episode of a one-half hour or one-hour dramatic series covered under the SAG Television Agreement, Exhibit A of the AFTRA Network Code or the WB/UPN j Supplement to the AFTRA Network Code and produced for broadcast in prime time on ABC, 1 CBS, NBC, FBC, The WB or UPN, the running time of which extends beyond the regular length i of a typical episode of the series, but which does not consume a standard one-half hour, one (1) hour, or longer time period (e.g., a forty-three (43) minute episode of a series which is ordinarily ( one-half hour in length). These episodes shall be referred to as “supersized episodes.” The parties agree that an episode which exceeds the length of a typical episode by up to three (3) minutes shall not be considered a “supersized episode” and no additional payment shall be due therefor.
The minimum compensation rates for performers and background actors shall not be adjusted. (
The compensation amounts above which contributions to the SAG-Producers Pension and Health ! Plans or the AFTRA Health and Retirement Funds are not required (i.e.. the caps) shall be t adjusted as fallows: in connection with a supersized episode of a series which is ordinarily one-	1
half hour in length, the cap shall be adjusted to the figure midway between the one-half hour and	■
one (1) hour caps, and in connection with a supersized episode of a series which is ordinarily one \ (1) hour in length, die cap shall be adjusted to a figure midway between the one (1) hour and one and one-half (1-1/2) hour caps.	/
If an episode of a series which is ordinarily one-half hour in length is rerun in network prime 1 time at the supersized length, the network prime time rerun ceiling shall be adjusted to die figure z midway between the one-half hour and one (1) hour ceilings. If an episode of a series which is v ordinarily one (1) hour in length is rerun in network prime time at the supersized length, the network prime time rerun ceiling shall be adjusted to the one and one-half hour ceiling, except	s
that if the length exceeds ninety (90) minutes, the ceiling shall be adjusted to the two (2) hour	k
ceiling.

[f an episode of a series produced for The WB or UPN is “supersized,” residuals for reuse of the program shall be based upon the program fee for the length of the program as it is rerun. Performers shall be notified of this provision at the time of employment.
If the episode is rerun in network prime time after being edited to run as a one-half hour or one {1) hour episode, as applicable, it is agreed that the network prime time rerun ceiling for such rerun shall be the ceiling applicable to the length of a non-“supersized” episode of the series.
in the event two (2) versions of an episode are delivered as part of a syndicated package, each version will be considered a distinct television motion picture for purposes of determining the run number.
If a supersized episode is sold to a foreign subdistributor (or a foreign distributor affiliated with Employer) and there is a distinct valuation of that episode (i.e., it is sold separately or for an additional fee), the foreign residual (including the “base” and all residuals payments) shall be determined by the episode's delivered length and the Employer shall report to the Guild that a supersized version was delivered or sold in a foreign territory. In all other cases, the residual shall be based on the typical episode time. This provision shall not imply any obligation to license such extended episode separately or tor an additional fee.
