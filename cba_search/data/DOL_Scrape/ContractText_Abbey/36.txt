MEMORANDUM OF UNDERST ANTING
Accruals and Charges - Sick Leave and Personal Leave.
Teachers shall continue to accrue and utilize sick ami. personal leave on the basis of a “day” being defined as seven (7) hours. (This definition of a “day” as seven (7) hours is solely for the purpose of handling leave accruals and usage.) Teac hers shall continue to accrue 10.5 hours of sick leave per month (excluding July and August) and 21 hours of personal leave per year. This will eliminate the need to adjust previous balances and future accruals. Time off should be scheduled in minimum increments of fifteen (15) minutes.
For a full day’s absence, the charge is seven (7) hour;:., regardless of whether the actual hours are less than normal (as in a late opening or early closing due to weather or a scheduled early dismissal day) or more than normal (as on a day when a fiftyminute faculty meeting is scheduled).
a.	If weather or other circumstances necessitate an early closing before 240 minutes of actual student instruction, this is not an early dismissal day, and no charge is made to an absent employee’: leave balances.
b.	If a prior arrangement has been made to work the normal day and return to work for an evening activity (such as Open House on Thursday coupled with an early dismissal day the following day (Arti cle 6, Section Two (b)), the absent employee is charged one day. The employee’s absence for the eveni ng activity is dealt with by requiring the employee to work the normal full day schedule the following day., or treating the absence at the evening activity as a partial day absence on the following day.
83
Partial Day Absences.
For other than full day absences, the formula for calculating the appropriate charge to leave balances is as follows:
#	hours the teacher is absent (excluding 20 minute lunch) 	X 7 hours
#	of work hours on that particular day (excluding 20 minute lunch)
When a teacher works part of a day and is absent for the rest of that day, apply the above formula to determine the appropriate charge to sick or personal leave. This will ensure that the prorata charge that is made equals the payment that is received. The following examples cover the most common situations.
EXAMPLES:
Late Opening - Partial Absence
Example: Due to snowstorm, school is delayed one hour. A teacher works but has to leave 1 hour early for a medical appointment that can’t be scheduled after work.
1 hour
___________________X 7 hours -
6 hours 10 minutes
1 hour
X 7 hours =1.1351 hours
6.1667 hours
= 1 hour 8 minutes charged to SP
Normal Day - Partial Absence
Example: Same scenario as above, but without delayed opening.
# hours the teacher is absent (excluding 20 minute lunch) 84
______________________________________X 7 hours # of work hours on that particular day (excluding 20 minute lunch)
1	hour 	X 7 hours = 7 hours 10 minutes
1	hour
_____________________________________X 7 hours = .9767 hours
7.1667 hours
- 59 minutes charged to SP
Early Dismissal Day - Partial Absence
Example: There is a pre-scheduled early dismissal d ay with faculty and students scheduled to be released after 4 1/2 hours. An instructor gets a call that the pipes have burst at t ome and the basement flooding; the instructor asks to leave and charge the time to personal leave; the instructor leave after havi ag worked 45 minutes.
# hours the teacher is absent (excluding 20 min ute lunch) _____________________________________X 7 h< iurs # of work hours on that particular day (excluding 20 minute lunch)
3 hours 45 minutes _____________________________________X 7 hours = 4 hours 30 minutes
3.75 hours _____________________________________X 7 hours = .5.8334 hours
4.5 hours
= 5 hours 50 minutes charged to PL
85
Normal Day - Partial Absence
Example: Same scenario as above except on a normal 7-1/2 hour day.
#	hours the teacher is absent (excluding 20 minute lunch) ,X 7 hours
#	of work hours on that particular day (excluding 20 minute lunch)
6	hours 25 minutes
______________________________________X 7 hours =
7	hours 10 minutes
6.4167 hours
______________________________________X 7 hours =
6.2674 hours
7.1667 hours
= 6 hours 16 minutes charged to PL
Normal Day Plus 50 Minute Meeting - Partial Absence
Example: On a normal 7-1/2 hour day, the Principal schedules a fifty-minute meeting. An instructor’s car breaks down and he is 1 hour and 15 minutes late for work.
#	hours the teacher is absent
(excluding 20 minute lunch)
______________________________________X 7 hours
#	of work hours on that particular day (excluding 20 minute lunch)
86
1 hour 15 minutes ____________________________________X 7 hours =
8	hours
1.25 hours _____________________________________X 7 hours =
1.0938 hours
8 hours
= 1 hour 6 minutes charged to PL
If an early dismissal day is scheduled for students, but the instructors are scheduled to stay for a meeting or professional development, it is a full day for instructors.
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SCOPE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION
Pay Plan Anomalies.
Employees on the master list of individuals who were negatively impacted by the payplan anomalies caused by the implementation of the 1992 OJE settlement shall receive a $1000 prei nium payment on or about December 1 of each year, beginning in 1996, provided the employee is still employed by the employer in the bargaining unit as of September 1, 1996.

APPENDIX A
SALARY PLACEMENT ON CHANGE IN STATUS
I.	When an employee has received his/her professional certificate which would entitle him/her to move to a higher sal ar- group, step placement pursuant to said movement shall be calculated by adding the amount of the average annual increment of the higher salary group to die employee’s current annual salary and placing him/her on that step in the higher salary group which is at least equal to that amount. The new salary rate will remain in effect through the end of the school year; there will be no decrease in the summer (pro-rata) pay to reflect the school days worked at the lower rate.
The effective date of the increase shall be the start of the pay period on or after the date the professional certificate is effect ive provided the employee immediately provides a copy of the professional certificate to the School Principal. If the employee delays in providing a copy of the professional certificate to the School Principal, the effective date of the increase shall be the start of the pay period following delivery of the certificate to the Principal.
2.	An instructor who is promoted to Department Head shall be placed on that step in the higher salary group which is: n increase of at least the amount of the average annual increment (if the higher salary group.
3.	When an employee transfers to a classification in a lower salary group in lieu of layoff, step placement shall be by the round-down method, i.e. the employee is placed at that step in the lower salary group which is closest to but not more than the annual salary he/she was receiving immediately prior to the effective date of the transfer.
4.	When an employee moves, voluntarily or involuntarily for disciplinary reasons, to a classification in a lower salar, group, he/she shall be placed on that step in the lower salary group which is arrived at by subtracting the average annual increment of the hi gher salary group from the employee’s annual salary immediately jrior to the effective date of the transfer and placing him/her on the step closest to but not more than the resulting figure. Examples: 1) An employee
101
with a professional certificate in his/her teaching area applies for and is granted a transfer to a different teaching area where he/she has a provisional certificate. 2) A department head applies for and is granted a transfer to an instructor position. 3) An employee is involuntarily transferred to a different teaching area or demoted from department head to instructor for disciplinary reasons.
5.	When an instructor is administratively transferred to another school and is required to teach a different subject or when an instructor is reassigned in the same school and a change in subject is involved and such administrative transfer or reassignment is unrelated to a reduction in force, transfer in lieu of layoff or discipline, no salary reduction shall occur if the instructor had a professional certificate in the former subject area and an initial or provisional certificate in the new subject area.
6.	Attainment of a professional certificate shall not entitle an initial educator to be slotted as a professional educator unless the professional certificate is in the area in which such employee is currently teaching.
7.	For purposes of lateral or administrative transfer, no differentiation will be made based solely on whether an applicant has an initial, provisional or a professional certificate.
8.	Salary paid during the summer shall be at the bi-weekly rate in effect at that time; there will be no decrease in the summer (pro-rata) pay to reflect the days worked at a lower rate, during the same school year.
