Section 6.	Continuous Improvement Pay System
Continuous Improvement Pay Plans (CIPP) reward teams of employees for helping achieve continuous improvement of the operations to which they are assigned. Continuous improvement requires a cooperative effort from all employees, and provides employees the opportunity to both increase their earnings by sharing in these improvements and maintain a consistent weekly pay level
A Outline of the Continuous Improvement Pay System
(1)	A Continuous Improvement Pay Plan provides incentive compensation tc a team of employees for achieving continuous improvement on a weeKly basis above the Base performance metric! s)
(2)	Weekly Plan Performance is a team s calculated weekly earnings level expressed as a percent It is determined by increasing (or decreasing) the 115% weekly pay level for the team for the week by 67% of the percentage change in weekly results achieved, compared to each Base performance metnc(s) When multiple metrics (e g qual'ty. productivity schedule performance etc ) are used, eacn metric wll be assigned a percentage weighting factor with the sum of the weighting factors equaling 100%. A Weekly Plan Performance >s calculated for eacn metric as described above and then multiplied by its respective metric weighting factor These individual metric calculations are then added together to arrive at the total Weekly Plan Performance
114
ARTICLE XVIIL Section 6.
(3)	Pay for an employee's attends no hours while participating in a CIPP application (mp : hours) within a given week is computed by lultiplying the employee's wage rate(s) times the iV ?kly Pay Level for the week. Weekly Pay Level :r each CIPP application will be determined as follow
a The maximum Weekly Pay Lev for a CIPP application is 115%. Weekly ht .rs earned in excess of 115% will be allocate' to the CIPP application’s Reserve Fund.
b When Weekly Plan Performanc for a CIPP application is between 100% and 1 ?%. the hours required to build-up earnings to :ne maximum Weekly Pay Level for the plan s car cipants will be provided equally from the CIPI application’s Reserve Fund Hours and the C or pany, if hours are available in the Reserve Fund.
c. When a CIPP applications Veekly Plan Performance provides an earnings I /el that is less than 100% of an employee’s input I ?urs times their base rate(s), the Company wi orovide buildup hours to a weekly pay level of 00% of their wage rate(s) for a plan participant s >nput hours in the plan. Weekly earnings will be :uilt-up further to the maximum Weekly Pay Lew according to Section 6.A.3(b)
(4)	An Average Semester Plan Perform nee for each CIPP application, weighted by the pl< ' participants weekly input hours, will be calculated ar each Base metric at the end of 26 consecutive c -i end ar weeks (Plan Semester) from the start of the Ian and each 26 consecutive calendar week period, tl treafter.
a.	When the Average Semester Flai Performance for a metric is less than or equal to ' 5% its Base performance metric will not be oh nged for the next semester.
115
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6
b.	When the Average Semester Plan Performance for a metric exceeds the maximum Weekly Pay Level of 115%, its Base performance metric will be adjusted by .33 of the percent of total team improvement in the output divided by input ratio as compared to the base for the next semester; however, in no case will the base adjustment exceed 2% in any plan semester. For example:
Output hours in a semester: 9300
Input hours in a semester;	10000
Current base	.900
OutpuVInput = 9300/10000 = .930
Base adjustment =
(output/input - Base , x .33
__	Base	___i
Base adjustment =
P .930 - .900 x .33
L_ -900 _J
Base adjustment = .0110
New Base = [base adjustment + 1 ] x old base
New Base = [1.0110] x .900
New Base = .910
In return for this adjustment, the Company will distribute a Base Adjustment Allowance of additional paid hours to the plan participants. Overtime premiums required by statute will be paid with the Base Adjustment Allowance.
116
ARTICLE XVIII. Section 6.
c If a Base Adjustment Allowance . earned for a metric as provided tn 4(b) above i: ..ring a current semester and there was a Base adjustment, as provided in 4(b) above, for tha metric, each employee's Base Adjustment Aik f;ance will be determined by multiplying the er oloyee's input hours for the semester times the percentage the Base was adjusted for the next ser ^ster (factored by the Base metric's weighted I :>urs} times a multiplier based upon the followin criteria: For those teams with a base adjustmer less than 2%, the employee input hours for the s mester will be multiplied by the base adjustment less than 2%) times 1.5. For those teams with a base adjustment equal to 2%, the emplo ere input hours for the semester will be multiplie by the base adjustment (2%) times 2. (For xample. if an employee had 1000 input hours ft: the semester and there was a 2% adjustment o the case, and the base is weighted by 100% bt -,ause there is only one metric, the Base Adjustr ent Allowance would be calculated as follows: 00 (the input hours) x 2% (the same percentage the base was adjusted) x 2 (the additional premium for continuous improvement) = 40 hour
d.	Remaining Reserve Funds Hours (accumulated weekly Reserve Fund Hours less ours used for build-up) will be distributed I the plan's participants at the end of the Plan I emester. The Reserve Fund Hours and the Ba e Adjustment Allowance, if earned, will be dis sbuted to the plan s participants based on a atio of each participant's plan input hours to the otal plan input hours during the semester.
e.	In the event the number of plan wc kweeks within a semester is less than (24) workv, isks. the base and performance metric(s) will be £ rjusted on the basis of .33 of the total team impn cement in the
117
ARTICLE XVIII, Section 6.
output/input ratio when compared to the base (not to exceed 2%) times the number of plan workweeks divided by twenty-four (24).
Example:
A CIPP plan has sixteen plan workweeks for the semester and .33 of the Total Team Improvement in output/input as compared to the base was 1.10%.
Base Adjustment = 1.10% x 16/24 - .73%
(5)	Each Base performance metric will be established using historical data, when available, or through comparative data and/or appropriate engineering techniques, such that weekly results equal to the Base performance metric will yield a Weekly Plan Performance of 115%.
(6)	Employees’ time for the following situations should be excluded when establishing the Base performance metric and not be included as plan input hours when they occur.
a.	Paid Lunch Hours
b.	Authorized Union Business
c.	Classroom Training
d.	Catastrophic downtime
e.	Special projects/assign meats outside of plan operation
f.	Medical surveillance physicals and tests directed by the Company (not individual First-Aid T reatment)

B. Maintenance of OPP Applications
(1)	In addition to Base adjustments desa >ed n Section 6.A.4(b). adjustments to Base perforrr ance metricjs) and/or output standards will be made I r the following conditions:
a The Company invests greater tha $50,000, or $5000 per plan participant, whichev r is less, in a CIPP application area.
i.	When an investment resul : in improved performance the adjustmer s will account for only 80% of tt ? calculated improvement to allow ernp )yees time to adjust to the change
ii.	When an investment results in deteriorating performance tl adjustments will account for the full effect of the deterioration.
b.	Both parties agree that a change it necessary to assure the on-going competitive ess of the operation.
c.	Work is moved into the plan from a other area or out of the plan to another area,
d.	Direct Labor is added to or dele ed frcm the operations

e.	Introduction of new or revised products
When new or revised products are introduced into a plan, output standards for the new and revised products will be established based on the design and methods of manufacture for the new or revised product. At this time, the Company may update the output standards of all products produced by the plan participants. In this case, the ratio of output hours produced to the plan participants’ input hours (Base performance metric) will be adjusted to produce the same Weekly Plan Performance for this metric that was achieved prior to the change in the output standards.
(2) Output Standards in CIPP applications will be established using procedures such as torn estudy, standard data, plant data, video analysis, laboratory analysis, predetermined data systems, part family analysis or any combination thereof.

During negotiations, the parties discussed the question of "superseniority" or "preferential seniority" for Union officers in the light o* recent NLRB decisions which make s ch coverage improper for certain Union positions.
It is the intent of the parties to abide by the I LRB rulings.

Over the years, Deere & Company and the UAW lave made a sincere effort to resolve issues through the necoti tion process and the grievance procedure. In those instr ices where, unfortunately, strikes have occurred, Deere & Cor pany has, in the interest of our long term relationship, elected t refrain from continuing production operations by hiring new f nployees as permanent replacements for striking workers. Dur 'g those few instances in which a strike has occurred, the UA ' recognizes that Deere must continue to protect equipment, acilities and, most importantly, fulfill its commitments to custor esrs by using salary employees as are available to cent! je critically necessary operations in an orderly manner

1.	Planned Activities
In general, the time employees spend on pre-determined, planned activities (excluding those identified in Article XVIII., Sec 6.A.(6),) that are of significantly greater magnitude than those incurred or allowed for in the plan’s Base productivity ratio, shoula be considered as non-plan hours and paid at the following appropriate Contractual rate,

If. hov/ever. the employee is hired ah 1 October 1997and is Pay Level 7, the employee nouid be paid the wage rate of their regular ass/gnme 1 or the wage rate of the temporary assignment, whicl - ver is higher for this non-plan time.
If however, it would be beneficial to have ie employees minimize the duration and impact of the . rrtivity, a pre-cetermined number of output hours m v be added ( 'seeded ’) to the plans' reported output hou' ; and the time considered as plan input hours. The 'lS€;e< :td” hours will be calculated to provide 115% plan perforr ance for new plans (no semester-to-date plan perforr ance history available). Current plans will be "seeded" t semester-to-

During the production start-up, employees will be producing product at a reduced rate while learning their jobs, trying out tooling, etc To encourage employees to achieve the specific production requirements during the start-up, employees time will be considered as plan Input Hours and Output Hours will be "seeded" to the plan to provide plan participants with the opportunity to achieve and exceed the Weekly Pay Level of 115% The maximum input hours allowed to produce a given schedule during this start-up period must be determined ahead of time Since Input Hours may vary during start-uo weeks 'seed' hours will be calculated after actual Input Hours worked during the week are determined. If actual Input Hours exceed the pre-determined maximum Input Hours, 'seed ' hours will be based on the pre-determined maximum Input Hours The seeded" hours will be calculated to provide 115% plan performance for new plans (no semester-to-date plan performance history available) Current plans will be "seeded" to semester-to-date performance, but in no case will such seeding be less than 115%.
