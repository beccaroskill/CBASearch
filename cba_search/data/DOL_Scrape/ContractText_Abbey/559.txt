2.1	The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining agency for all of its employees, (including Lottery Clerks) except Store Managers, in its retail food stores within a radius of twenty-five (25) miles of Washington, D.C. and Prince George's, Charles, St. Mary's, Calvert and Montgomery Counties, and in Anne Arundel County south of South River from Chesapeake Bay to State Highway #450, south of State Highway #450 from South River to Prince George's County in Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia.
2.2	The Employer further agrees that if the Employer should establish a new food store, or stores, within the territories described in Article II, paragraph 2.1, this Agreement shall apply to such new store or stores. In the event the Employer engages in Department or Discount type stores or food stores outside the Company's present service area of Northern Virginia (Arlington, Fairfax, Prince William and Loudoun Counties) and the Maryland locations referred to in Paragraph 2.1, the Employer and the Union shall negotiate as to the terms for wages, hours and working conditions for the employees working in such stores.
2.3	All meat, fish or poultry, fresh, chilled, frozen, cooked or smoked, historically or customarily offered for sale by the Employer in its retail meat departments in the area covered under Article II, Paragraph 2.1, shall be within the jurisdiction of the United Food & Commercial Workers, Local 400, and all employees engaged in these services shall be members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. Items referred to, processed off the premises, will continue to be handled by said members.

may continue to be transferred, assigned to other work, or laid off in accordance with the seniority provisions of this Agreement, provided the layoff is for reasons other than the introduction of new products and/or new methods.
It is not the Union's intention to impede progress in our Industry with respect to any new method of cutting and packaging meat, delicatessen and seafood products, and the necessity for change to accommodate a changing society.
The Union reiterates, therefore, its intention with respect to the "products clause" as follows: the Company may introduce new methods and new products (i.e., make exceptions) provided it does the following:
a.	Union must be notified in advance.
b.	The Employer will list all new products or new methods in a letter of notification.
c.	The Employer will give written assurance that no member's job will be eliminated, in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 2, Section 2.3.

When a part time employee is scheduled and/or works forty (40) hours a week for more than six (6) consecutive weeks and the work is not temporary (i.e., vacation and/or absence coverage), a full time position will be deemed to have been created. Such a full time position within the store and department where the work was performed will be filled in accordance with the following procedures:

The schedule shall contain the employees' full names and shall have the scheduled hours of each employee totaled at the end of the column. The schedule for the night crew and those scheduled off on Saturday must be posted prior to the end of those employees' scheduled shift on Friday of the week preceding the week for which the schedule is effective.
The schedule for all full time employees showing the starting and finishing time and regular days off shall not be altered after it is posted, except by mutual agreement. Each full time employee shall regularly receive the same day off each week except for weeks when business conditions may require a change in their regular day off.

The Employer will not intentionally prepare a schedule to avoid the requirement of a second rest period.

Except as modified by the provisions of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, the seniority provisions of the following article shall be applied in the same manner as the seniority articles in the respective parties' collective bargaining agreements prior to the execution of this collective bargaining agreement.

A seniority list for all full time employees and a separate list for all part time employees shall be set up by the Employer and shall be furnished to the Union upon request. Seniority shall prevail in the following instances in the manner as listed hereafter: A. Store, B. Geographical Area, C. Bargaining Unit.
12.2	The Employer recognizes the principle of seniority as being one in which the movement of an employee from one job to another or from one location to another through promotion, demotion, layoff, recall after layoff, or permanent transfer, shall be governed by the length of service of the employee and the employees ability to perform the work.
12.3	In all layoffs the ordinary rules of seniority shall prevail with due consideration given to the job classification, fitness for the work involved, ability to perform the work involved, and the practicability of applying the rules of seniority in the particular case. Employees laid off for periods of less than one (1) year shall have preference to reinstatement in the reverse order. The service record of such reinstated employee shall not be interrupted.

to part time may exercise their right to a complete layoff without prejudice to their right to recall.
12.4	A full time employee shall have seniority over a part time employee, to the extent that a full time employee who is involuntarily laid off in order of seniority may claim existing part time schedules calling for the least reduction of hours provided due consideration is given to job classification and to fitness to perform the work involved. Part time employees shall have seniority over other part time employees under the same conditions. However, if the available opening for a part time employee who is recalled is outside of the geographical area, the employee may refuse the opening without prejudice to future recall within the same geographical area.
Before a Journeyman Meat Cutter can be reduced to part time or laid off within the geographical area, all Apprentices must be laid off within the geographical area. Where the application of this provision creates a hardship or operational problem, the Union agrees to discuss and resolve the problem.
12.5	When a full time employee is involuntarily reduced to part time he shall continue to accrue seniority as though he was still full time. When a full time employee voluntarily reduces himself in writing, his part time seniority is dated from the original date of hire. Full time employees reduced from full time to part time through no fault of their own will retain full time health and welfare and pension coverage for a period of six (6) months. The Employer will continue the full time health and welfare and pension contribution for said period of time.
12.6	Seniority and the employee's ability to perform the work shall be given consideration in regard to promotions within the bargaining unit. If the employee fails to qualify within a reasonable time for the upgraded position, he or she will be afforded the opportunity to return to his or her former classification without loss of seniority. The Employer will notify the Union of all promotions to department head classification.
12.7	Part time employees desiring full time work and lower classified food employees desiring to be upgraded in classification shall be given preference for such work in accordance with the following procedure:
Employees who desire upgrading as described above shall notify the Employers' Personnel Department in writing with a copy to the Union, during the periods March 1, to March 21, and September 1, to September 21, each year. Such letters shall remain valid for eighteen (18) months.
The first consideration for any such vacancies shall be given to employees with a current request in order of the employee's seniority with ability to do the work to be considered. However, full time night crew employees will be given priority consideration for available full time day vacancies within the food clerk classification.

January 6, 2009
When the file of request letters has been exhausted, all employees regardless of the length of service will be considered for available openings on a store-by-store basis before seeking outside applicants.
Only requests for permanent classification change shall be valid and failure to be available thereafter for such work for a period of twenty-six (26) weeks after obtaining such status, except for reasons beyond the employee's control, shall be barred from future requests for a period of six (6) months.
Failure to accept an offer of such work in any of the Employer's stores within a geographic area shall result in removal of the employee's request for the balance of that six (6) month period, but it shall not bar the employee from future requests. Except any employee who declines a full time night crew position will not be removed from the list for the balance of the active bid.
Part time employees who are promoted to full time will receive credit for time worked on the basis of forty (40) hours being equivalent to one (1) week and the employee's full time seniority date will be adjusted accordingly. The Employer and the Union agree to exchange a list of part time employees requesting full time jobs during the months of April and October of each year.

a. Upon receipt of notice from either party, the representative of the Employer and the representative of the Union shall, within three (3) days, commence discussion in an attempt to reach a settlement of the controversy.
20.2	If the matter is not amicably settled under section 20.1 above, then either party may, on giving five (5) days notice to the other party:
a.	Submit the matter to the American Arbitration Association for a list of fifteen (15) arbitrators and the parties shall select there from one (1) arbitrator as follows: Each of the parties shall strike one (1) name from the list until a last name remains, each of the parties drawing lots to determine who shall be entitled to the first strike.
b.	The arbitrator shall not have the authority to decide questions involving the jurisdiction of any Local or of the International or which may in any way affect or change the Union Security Clause, nor shall the arbitrator have the authority to effect a change in, modify, or amend any of the provisions of this Agreement or to make decisions or provisions covering wages or working conditions to be incorporated either in a new Agreement or any subsequent annual Agreement, except as hereinafter provided.
c.	In the event that one (1) party should fail to make their selection of arbitrators within two (2) weeks after receipt of notification by the other party that their choices have been submitted, then the first choice of the selecting party shall be binding on the non-selecting party.
d.	In the further event, should one (1) party fail to participate in the scheduled arbitration proceeding, the other party may proceed unilaterally and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon all parties.

20.5	During the consideration of such difference or misunderstanding, neither party shall use any coercive or retaliatory measures to compel the other party to accede to its demands.

The applications of this provision will comply with the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 as amended. Because the schedule of progressive wage rates provided for by the appropriate wage scale hereof depends upon actual experience on the job, a person reemployed pursuant to this Article shall, for purposes of the appropriate wage scale, be credited only with months of actual payroll service.

Nothing herein contained shall compel any employee to walk through a picket line, provided the picket line has the sanction of its own Union and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.
ARTICLE 24
Invalidation
Should any Article, Section or portion hereof, of this Agreement be held unlawful and unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision of the court shall apply only to the specific Article, Section, or portion thereof directly specified in the decision, provided, however, that upon such a decision the parties agree immediately to negotiate a substitute for the invalidated Article, Section, or portion thereof.
ARTICLE 25 Successorship
This Agreement shall be binding upon all signatories hereto, and their successors and assigns, whether such status is created by sale, lease, assignment or any other type of transfer or transaction. In consideration of the Union's execution of this Agreement, the Employer promises that its operations covered by this Agreement or any part thereof shall not be sold, conveyed or otherwise transferred or assigned to any successor without first securing the agreement of the successor to assume the Employer's obligation under this Agreement to offer employment to all of the Employer's current employees. Provided, however, that the economic provisions of this Agreement may be reopened if upon mutual agreement of the successor employer and the Union the signatory employer's operation is sold, conveyed, transferred, or assigned to a successor employer who is engaged in a substantially different retail food operation. The foregoing shall be applicable only in separate transactions where the Employer sells or transfers more than ten percent (10%) of the facilities covered under this Agreement, but shall not apply to any facility which is sold or transferred and remains closed for thirty (30) days or more.
