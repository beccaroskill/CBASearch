Section 10, Separability
Should any part hereof or any provision herein contained be rendered or declared invalid by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted legislation or by a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidation of such part or portion of this Agreement shall not invalidate the remaining portions hereof, and they shall remain in full force and effect.
Section 11,	Security Regulations
The Union recognizes that the Company has certain obligations in its contracts with the Government pertaining to security, and ■ agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to place the Company in violation of its security agreements with the Government.	.
Therefore, in the event that the U. S. Air Force, U. S. Navy or other Government Agency duly concerned with Lockheed Martin Corporation security regulations advises the Company in writing that any employee in the Union bargaining unit is restricted from work on or access to classified information and material, the Union will not contest such action as the Company may take pursuant to such advice to comply with its security obligations to the Government.
In the event such Government Agency, following the taking of such action, advises the Company in writing that such employee is no longer restricted for work on or access to classified information and material, the Company shall, promptly after receipt of such written advice from such Government Agency, reinstate with seniority and subject to the provisions of Article IV such an employee, if the employee promptly applies for such reinstatement, to the same job classification and rate of pay such employee held at the time such action was taken, and will join such employee and/or the Union, at such employee's request, in an application to such Government Agency for restoration by the Government of lost pay.

ARTICLE UI GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE AND ARBITRATION
Section 1,	Oral Complaints
Oral complaints arising out of employment or grievances shall be discussed within the department by the cooperation of the Senior Steward, the Department Head or such Department Head's authorized representative and the Personnel Representative acting as an advisor. In order to accomplish this cooperative action, the Department Head shall discuss with the Senior Steward an employee’s oral complaint or grievance.
Section 2,	Definition of Terms and General Conditions
The term "grievance" as it is used throughout this Agreement, except for the term "Union grievance" in Section 4 of this Article, shall mean a written claim by an employee that the Company has violated a specific provision of this Agreement by action, or failure to take action, which, at the time such written claim is filed, denies to such employee a right given to such employee under such specific provision of this Agreement. Such written claim should state the specific provision of this Agreement claimed to have been so violated. The grievance shall be on a form to be mutually agreed upon by the Union and the Company which shall be dated and signed by the employee and shall set forth a complete statement of the grievance, the facts on which it is based, the time of their occurrence and the remedy or correction desired.
An employee grievance arising out of the application of job descriptions is defined as a written claim by an employee that a job classification, other than such employee’s assigned job classification, is more appropriate for the work such employee performs in accomplishing regularly assigned duties. If the grievance involves a job classification matter, the employee is required to submit a written statement of the specific duties on which the complaint or grievance is based, and without such written statement the grievance is considered unsuitable for

processing to Step 2. Failure to provide such written statement will result in the grievance being returned to the grievant until such information is provided.
"Working days'1 as used in this Article III shall mean Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, except where one of those days is one of the holidays referred to in Article VI, Section 3, subsection A, and shall not include Saturday, Sunday or such holiday even if worked.
The Company shall not confer with an employee with respect to the grievance filed by such employee unless the employee's Senior Steward has been notified and given an opportunity to be present. Failure of the Union to proceed within any time limit set forth in the procedure hereinafter stated shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.
Failure of the Company to act within the time limit set forth in any step shall entitle the Union to proceed to the next step. The Company and the Union may mutually agree to extend the time limits in a particular case where legitimate circumstances for doing so exist.
If a retroactive adjustment is involved in an employee's grievance based upon a change in such employee's job classification, such retroactivity shall not exceed nine working days prior to the date the employee's written grievance was presented to the Department Head, unless extended by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union.
Section 3,	Method of Handling Grievances
An employee may first present a grievance to such employee's Department Head, either in person or through such employee's Union Steward. However, if the employee so desires, such employee may deliver the grievance to the Union Steward and proceed in accordance with Step 1 of the grievance procedure.

Step 1. The employee's Senior Steward shall deliver such grievance to the Department Head, Unless such grievance, signed by the employee, has been delivered to the Department Head within 23 working days after the occurrence upon which the grievance is founded, the grievance shall be deemed to be waived.
If the grievance is based upon action which occurred at a time when the employee was in a different department than such employee is in at the time tile grievance is filed, and does not also involve action in such employee's present department, such grievance shall be transferred by the Personnel Representative to the Department Head of the employee's former department where such action occurred for further processing under this Section by such Department Head and the Senior Steward for such department. It is recognized that in order to adequately consider this type of case it will sometimes be necessary that the grieving employee be called in by the Department Head and the Senior Steward. The Company will cooperate in this matter in permitting the' grieving employee to attend necessary meetings in the former department.
The Department Head and the Senior Steward shall meet at a mutually convenient time and shall use their best efforts to settle the grievance. The Senior Steward may, when desired, ask one of the Group Stewards to be present at this meeting. Within five working days after receipt of the written grievance, the Department Head, after discussion with the Senior Steward, shall deliver the answer to the Senior Steward. Any settlement reached shall not create a precedent for either party. If a settlement has not been reached and the

B.	The parties shall by mutual agreement select an arbitrator. If the Company and the Union fail to agree upon an arbitrator, one shall be selected from the Master Working List as hereinafter described. Each party will submit the names of five arbitrators who shall be registered with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The parties shall also request from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service an additional list of ten arbitrators from the Southern California area. The combined lists of 20 arbitrators will constitute the Master Working List of arbitrators. When the parties desire to select an arbitrator, seven names shall be drawn at random from the Master Working List of arbitrators. From the list of seven arbitrators, the parties shall alternately strike one name until only one name remains (the right to strike the first name having been determined by lot) and that person shall be the arbitrator.
If for any reason an arbitrator becomes permanently unavailable, the party who submitted the arbitrator’s name will submit another name, or if the arbitrator was submitted by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the parties will request an alternate name from the Service.
During the month of October 2002, and each October thereafter, either party may request to repeat the above selection procedure. The new panel will be effective on November 1st of that year or upon receipt of the list from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, whichever is later.
C.	The parties shall execute a submission agreement. If the parties fail to agree upon a joint submission, each party shall submit a separate submission and the arbitrator shall determine the issue or issues to be heard, provided that said issue or issues are arbitrable in accordance with this

There shall be no stoppage of work on account of any controversy that may be made the subject of arbitration, and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the Company, the Union and the employee.
E,	The arbitrator shall be paid by the parties hereto. The compensation and expenses of the arbitrator and the arbitration shall be divided equally provided, however, that each party shall bear the expense in respect to its own witnesses and that the cost of any report or transcript shall be divided equally only if furnished by mutual consent.

An employee who is considered eligible for recall may by written notice to Hourly Placement, submitted seven days in advance of any notice of recall, suspend his or her right of recall. During the period of suspension of recall rights, the employee shall not be obligated to accept rehire and the Company shall not be obligated to notify the employee of available openings. Employees may reinstate their recall rights by written notice to the Company canceling the prior notice of suspension at any time after the expiration of one month from the date the notice of suspension is received in Hourly Placement.
The Company shall have not more than five working days in which to correct, without liability, any recall of a downgraded employee out of seniority order, provided such employee is recalled on or before the expiration of the sixth working day.

It is the responsibility of the employee to file a written request indicating the desired classification, plant, department, shift and other information requested on the form if such employee wishes to be considered for promotion or transfer outside his or her own department. The Company shall consider the employee's written request upon the basis which the employee has indicated. The written request referred to in this Section and Section 10 (Transfers) shall be prepared by the employee on a form provided by the Company. When filed with the Company, the employee shall be given a signed receipt setting forth the date the request was received by the appropriate Human Resources department and showing the job classification requested. Such request shall remain active until the employee is placed in the classification or department requested, until withdrawn by the employee, or until the employee refuses to accept the requested promotion or lateral placement, but in no event for more than 12 months unless renewed in writing by the employee.
(See Supplement "F", Letters 2002-11 and 2002-15.)
An employee who has not acquired seniority rights, pursuant to the provisions of Article IV, Section 2 of this Agreement, shall not be permitted to file Placement Requests for promotions.

Acceptance of a promotion shall automatically cancel any Placement Requests for that classification and any lower-rated classifications. An employee who has been promoted shall not be permitted to file a written Placement Request for a further promotion during the first four months following his or her promotion. Refusal by an employee to accept a promotion for which such employee has filed a written Placement Request under this Article IV, Section 8 shall automatically cancel such request.

Such employee may be required to submit evidence of such service as a witness to the Company in order to qualify for such payment.

12	her last previously held position or assignment and such
13	return shall not be considered a downgrade for purposes of

13	JOINT STATEMENT OF POLICY FOR APPLICATION
14	OF JOB DESCRIPTIONS
15
16	The following basic principles governed the preparation of these 17 descriptions; these same principles are to govern their use: '
18
19	1. The title selected for a classification is that which most
20	clearly identifies the type of work performed.
21
22	2. The Occupational Summary (where included) is a brief
23	description of the classification as a whole; the purpose of
24	which is to set it forth in separation from other
25	classifications.
26	.
27	3. The job description sets forth typical distinguishing and
28	related requirements. The distinguishing requirements
29	illustrate a level of difficulty of work and are not intended to 30	list or describe all work operations or tasks done within the
31	classification. These requirements may not fit all specific
32	individual work	assignments, as the description when written
33	was stated so as	to be broad enough	to include all variations
34	of work in the	classification as it	existed throughout the
35	Company.

5.	The descriptions were prepared on the basis:
a.	That as a part of promotional procedure a worker occasionally performs some of the work of higher-rated jobs under close guidance and instructions in order to qualify for advancement;
b.	That a worker performs the work of lower-rated jobs when required;
c.	That the normal duties of any worker may include assistance to other workers on work operations; and
d.	That normal job relationships between workers include giving guidance and instruction to each other, as long as such guidance and instruction is not extended to conflict with the duties of a Lead.
6.	The job description is written to define and illustrate the job standard to be established and as such shall be interpreted and applied in its entirety as a composite picture of the job requirements. This means that (where included) the occupational summary, work performed, typical materials, tools and equipment used, and knowledge and ability required, all must be considered in arriving at the proper classifications.
In order to secure or hold the classification, the employee must be assigned regularly and consistently to that work which distinguishes the classification from other classifications.
An employee's classification shall be determined in the light of the highest requirements for knowledge, ability and skill necessary to perform his or her regular assigned duties. In making this determination, duties that are performed infrequently or rarely shall not be considered or made the basis of granting the higher classification. This would not be applicable, however, to intermittent duties of a higher level to which the employee is specifically assigned in an area where the prevailing day-to-day routine may fall in

lower-level requirements. If the employee on such assignment is expected to possess and apply the knowledge, skill and ability necessary for performance of the higher-level work, such employee is entitled to the higher classification even though the majority of such employee’s work time may be spent on the lower-level work, In such case the employee is assigned to bring to the job the higher skills which such employee is expected to use as requirements demand.
To cite examples:
a.	An employee in a jig, where Structures Assemblers are working, is assigned the responsibility and is retained in the group for the specific purpose of working off difficult M.C.N.'s and difficult reworks. The employee's other daily activities are no different from that of the remaining employees on the assembly. The employee has had only three difficult rework jobs in three weeks and four difficult M.C.N.'s in the last month. This employee is properly classified as an Assembler - Installer, Senior due to such employee's assigned responsibility of performing, as requirements demanded, difficult structures work on the assembly.
b.	At a production rate of one ship every two weeks, assume that the ship's hydraulic system requires two days for checkout, Assignment to this work would require classification as a Systems Checkout Mechanic.
7.	The job descriptions herein referred to are of a composite nature and do not thereby require an individual employee to perform all of the work therein mentioned, except where the job description indicates otherwise.
8.	The job descriptions are not intended for, and should not be confused with operation sheets, work instructions or work assignment sheets, etc.

Dear Mr. Holt:
APPLICATION OF JOB DESCRIPTIONS OF HYDRAULIC AND CONTROLS INSTALLER AND ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS INSTALLER
The application by the Company of the above job descriptions has been discussed by the parties on several occasions. The Company has made a thorough investigation into all phases of these jobs and the many and varied work sequences encountered on the different models being manufactured by the Company.
It is the intent of the Company, as expressed during negotiations, to apply these job descriptions in the following manner:
1.	Structures work performed will be incidental to the particular phase of installation work covered by the classification of the individual employees.
2.	The employee will be expected to satisfactorily perform any function of the Assembler - Installer classification in such employee's functional line. In addition, the employee will be expected to satisfactorily perform Assembler -Installer work in other than his or her particular functional line when such work is incidental to and performed in conjunction with his or her regular and normal functional job assignment.
As discussed with the Union on previous occasions, the adoption of the two items above could result in the temporary layoff of employees in these classifications due to any number of causes, including revisions in the workload.
132
2002-1
1	It is the opinion of the Company that the above condition should
2	satisfactorily resolve this problem.

COMPUTATION OF OVERTIME PAYMENT IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS
The purpose of this letter is to set forth the understanding between the Company and the Union with respect to the manner of computing overtime pay for employees in the set of circumstances uescnucu ncretn.
It is understood and agreed that in the event an employee works eight or more consecutive hours (or six and one-half or more if on the graveyard shift), the consecutive hours worked which are in excess of eight or six and one-half, as the case may be, will be paid for at the rate of time and one-half even though such hours worked began in one workday and ended in the following workday, as workday is defined in the Agreement. An exception to this, however, will be made with respect to any hours worked during the seventh day of an employee’s workweek or consecutive
142
2002-7

Dear Mr. Holt:
DISTRIBUTION AND MAINTENANCE OF
OVERTIME RECORDS
This letter confirms the understanding reached by the Company and Union members of the Joint Overtime Committee regarding the maintenance of overtime records.
1.	"Affected groups" shall be by employee classification, by shift, and by department, except when a different affected group may be established because of operating requirements by agreement with the Senior Steward, Department Manager, Business Representative and Labor Relations Representa- five. The Union or Company will not unreasonably refuse to change the affected group within a shift in a department.
Employees who have been on loan for ten or more working days will be considered as members of the “affected group” for purposes of equitable distribution of overtime, and will be given equal opportunity for overtime in accordance with Article VII, Section 4 of the Agreement. An employee loaned for less than ten

working days may only be offered overtime when any of the following conditions exist:
a.	All of the affected employees of the home department/ shift are requested to work overtime.
b.	The borrowed employee possesses special skills necessary to perform the overtime assignment, and none of the affected employees of the department is qualified to perform the work.
c.	Continuity of work operations requires the borrowed employee to follow through on overtime on work started during regular working hours. When this condition exists to the point that operational requirements would be adversely affected, the employee on temporary loan may be assigned to the overtime work.
Additions to an affected group shall be given a starting total of the average hours of the group as of the first day of the week they join the affected group. Additions shall include employees returning from field duty of over 30 days, transfers, new hires, shift changes, promotions or other reclassifications.
2.	Overtime hours for an affected group will be "zeroed out" only by agreement with the Senior Steward, Department Manager, Business Representative and Labor Relations Representative.
Reduction of hours in an affected group may be made by using a common factor.
Example: All employees in an affected group have more than 100 accumulated hours; thereby, all may be reduced by 100 resulting in no relative changes in the status of the group.
3.	Overtime records shall be maintained on either Form #6832 or #6832A, or on a form or a system that provides the same

information as is shown on the referenced forms and which accurately reflects each employee’s overtime status.
4.	An employee returning from an absence of more than one week (vacation, union business or jury duty excluded) shall be given the average number of hours worked by his or her group during the employee's absence, except as noted below;
Exceptions:
(1)	Employees assigned to field duty for less than 30 calendar days who remain on the roster of their regular department shall be charged with the actual overtime hours worked on such field duty assignments or double the average number of overtime hours worked by the group during their absence, whichever is the lesser.
(2)	Overtime hours worked by an employee on loan will become a permanent part of the employee’s overtime record.
5.	Employees will be charged twice the number of hours worked on the seventh day or on a holiday.
6.	Subject to operating requirements, overtime may be refused without the employee being charged for refusal if the overtime is on the sixth or seventh workday immediately preceding such employee's vacation, or if the employee has been released for Union business and the Company properly notified in advance.
7.	Employees asked after the lunch break on Friday to work weekend overtime will not be charged for refusal.
8.	Employees will not be offered overtime on the sixth or seventh day of the workweek immediately preceding and/or following vacation unless they request in writing to be considered three working days or more prior to the overtime day.
9.	Employees may request in writing that they do not wish to be considered for overtime. Such request will continue until such time as a written request is received to again be considered. At the time the employee again wants to be
146
2002-8
1	considered for overtime in the same affected group, the
2	employee will receive the average of his or her affected
3	group or his or her previous overtime hours, whichever is 4 higher.
5
6	10. The Company will give notice to the Senior Steward and the
7	employees by Thursday for scheduled weekend overtime
8	• and as early as possible on in-week overtime. It must be 9 recognized that there may be some exceptions because of 10 last-minute emergencies or schedule changes.
11
12	11. Overtime will be posted on a daily basis where practical, but
13	in no event more than three working days from the date the
14	overtime is performed, unless the Senior Steward and the
15	Department Manager agree otherwise. Following the 16 posting of weekend overtime, a copy of the current overtime 17 record will be provided to the Senior Steward.
18
19	12. When it is contemplated that an employee will be loaned to
20	another department for three or more consecutive working 21 days, copies of the loan paperwork will be given both to the 22 Senior Steward of the employee’s regular department and of 23 the department to which loaned.
24
25	13. Swing and graveyard shifts will be given overtime
26	assignments in relative proportion to the day shift work 27 force, operational require-ments permitting.
28
29	14.	Employees who agree to work overtime will be charged
30	triple the number of hours for which they did not report or
31	did	not	work.
32
33	15. Employees will not be charged for in-week overtime missed

15	SHIFT TRANSFERS
16
17	This letter confirms the understanding reached by the Company 18 and the Union during Contract negotiations regarding shift 19 transfers.
20
21	1. In the event it becomes necessary to transfer an employee
22	from one shift to another to fill a vacancy for which no 23	requests are on file, as provided for in Article IV, Section
24	11 of this Agreement, the following conditions and method
25	of selection will apply:
26
27	a. The Company shall first offer the available opening to
28	those qualified employees within the same
29	classification in the department in which the opening
30	exists, in order of seniority,
31	i b. If an insufficient number of employees accept the
32	transfer as provided in paragraph "a" above, the
33	Company may then transfer the required number of
34	qualified employees in inverse order of seniority from
35	the classification and from within the department where
36	the vacancy exists, and such employees shall be
37	required to accept such transfer.
38
39	2. It is recognized that exceptions to the basic rule set forth in
40	item 1 above may occur where specific skills are needed on
41	a particular shift. This requirement may result in an

3.	Employees transferred to another shift for a temporary period shall be returned to their former shift upon completion of their assignment. The Company will discuss with the employees involved and the appropriate Union Steward the reasons for such temporary assignment.
4.	Consistent with the need for maintaining skills on swing and graveyard shifts, available openings on day shift will be filled by transfer of swing or graveyard shift personnel who request such transfers.
5.	Transfer requests wherein an employee has been involuntarily placed on a shift, or in cases of personal hardship, will be given special consideration. Requested transfers will be made at the earliest practicable date.

14	VOLUNTARY DOWNGRADES
15
16	This will	confirm the understanding reached between the

18	concerning	the intent and application of Article IV, Section 9,
19	subsection	F (Priority in Filling Available Openings) of the
20	collective bargaining Agreement.
21
22	It was mutually agreed by the parties that voluntary downgrades, 23 under this clause of the Agreement, to avoid layoff would not be
24	considered legitimate. However, downgrades into available 25 openings may be permitted under certain conditions as follows: 26
27	1.	All downgrades are to be on a voluntary basis.
28	2.	Such voluntary downgrades may be permitted	only	for
29	legitimate reasons. Legitimate reasons may include	such
30	circumstances as:
31	.
32	a. An employee wishing to get into a different line of 33	progression or into a different job family in order to be
34	in a better position for promotional possibilities.
35
36	b. In order to better utilize special training or knowledge 37	which an employee possesses and which is not being
38	properly utilized in the classification the employee is in
39	at that time.

c.	An employee who, for reasons of substantial personal hardship or bona fide reasons of serious personal inconvenience, desires to transfer to a different shift and is unable to do so in a lateral or higher classification.
d.	An employee who has become unable to successfully perform work which is regular and normal for the classification to which the employee is assigned but which such employee is unable to do.
Employees who find themselves in circumstances similar to those described above may, if they so desire, file Placement Requests for downgrades. These requests for downgrade will be accepted and processed by the Company on the same basis as employees requesting lateral transfers and promotions.
It is recognized by the Company and the Union that circumstances set forth in this letter of confirmation are typical and normal of the situations wherein an employee could be allowed to request downgrades in the application of Article IV, Section 9. However, they are not all-inclusive and situations could occur other than those described herein. In such event, the parties may by mutual agreement allow employees to downgrade on a voluntary basis.

20
21 Operationally-required lateral transfers from one department to 22 another in the same plant area may be made without reference to 23 the priority set forth in Article TV, Section 10 of the Agreement. 24 Such lateral transfer will not change the employee's shift or 25 classification. Furthermore, during the first 90 days after an 26 operationally-required transfer, the employee will be considered 27 to be assigned to the department from which last transferred, in 28 addition to the current department, for purposes of promotional 29 consideration to Lead and to higher rated jobs.
30
31 ‘ The operational requirements upon which such transfers are 32 made will be limited to the introduction or phase out of a model, 33 program or project, or at times when an increase or decrease in a 34 production schedule is being made, or if the employee agrees, at 35 which time preference will be given to the most-senior qualified 36 employee by classification and shift and who has a valid 37 Placement Request on file. When operationally-required 38 transfers are required, the number, classification and seniority 39 range having been determined by the Company, a committee 40 consisting of the affected Branch Head, a representative from 41 Labor Relations, the President of District Lodge 725 and a Union

representative of their choice will meet at least 14 days prior to any such transfers. Employees to be transferred will be chosen by mutual agreement from among those within the selected seniority range. Any selections not mutually agreed upon within five working days following such meeting will be made in inverse seniority order within the selected seniority range.
If the number of employees to be transferred is ten or less, the seniority range shall consist of double the number of employees to be transferred. Where the number to be transferred is 11 or more, the seniority range shall consist of an additional ten employees or one and one-half times the number to be transferred, whichever is greater.
Any claim that an operationally-required transfer was not based on the conditions specified above may be taken up as a grievance.

32	request for voluntary layoff will be subject to the same
33	appeal process as provided for in Article VI, Section 4 of
34	the Company-Union Agreement, except that the employee

An employee who has been notified that he or she is surplus or subject to layoff through operation of Article IV of the Company-Union Agreement may elect voluntary layoff so long as the surplus condition exists.
For purposes of the Basic Benefit Plan and Hourly Employees' Savings Plan Plus, the Company will treat the voluntary layoff the same as the General Layoff referenced in the current collective bargaining Agreement between the parties.
The recall rights of an employee who elects voluntary layoff will automatically be suspended for a period of six months (such six months to be part of the five-year recall period referenced in Article IV, Section 4 of the Company-Union Agreement). Therefore, employee recall rights may be reactivated through the procedure established by contract.
NOTE: Determination of eligibility for Unemployment Insurance Benefits (UIB) is determined by the State of California. While the Company .will furnish accurate information to the State as required by law and regulation, it will not contest the application for UIB of an employee who elects voluntary layoff. Generally speaking, voluntary separation from employment would make a person ineligible for UIB.

19
20	I. In the event there is a conflict in vacation scheduling which
21	cannot be settled by a mutually satisfactory agreement
22	between supervision and the employees involved,
23	preference will be given on the basis of seniority.
24
25	When a vacation has been approved and signed by the
26	Department Head, all reasonable efforts will be made not to
27	change it.
28
29	A vacation	schedule committee	will be established. This
30	committee	will be composed	of the Labor Relations
31	Manager and a Labor Relations Representative for the 32	Company,	and the Business	Representative and the
33	appropriate	Senior Steward for the Union. The committee
34	will meet at the request of either party for the purpose of 35 settling disputes in vacation scheduling.
36
37	2. The Company agrees to allow the Union to select a
38	representative from among those people on temporary
39	foreign tour assignment for purposes of advice to employees 40 on problems relating to job assignments.

2	Department personnel prior to vending out work wherever 3 practicable. In addition, the Graphic Arts Department will 4 review future subcontracting work with the Senior Steward 5 on a periodic basis when circumstances reasonably permit 6 prior to sending work out. Consideration will be given to 7 recalling laid off or downgraded employees where the work 8 is of sufficient duration, except in bona fide emergencies. 9
10	4. It is not the intent of the Company to normally transfer an
11	employee from one shift to another in-week. However,
12	employees required to transfer from swing shift to day shift,
13	in-week, will be granted two hours time off with pay at the 14 end of their last shift prior to such transfer.
15
16	5. It is the intent of the Company to normally use its 17 employees on field duty assignment and to review joint 18 ventures to ensure that bargaining unit employees perform 19	bargaining unit work where feasible.
20
21	6. One year or later, following the issuance of a written
22	criticism, an employee may request in writing of his or her
23	Department Manager to have it removed. If the employee,
24	during the. intervening period of time, has demonstrated
25	sufficient improvement and the ability to maintain an
26	acceptable and satisfactory record, the Department Manager
27	will remove the written criticism. The decision of the
28	Department Manager will not be subject to the grievance
29	procedure.
30
31	If improvement of employee performance or conduct is
32	observed, this may be noted by issuance of a memorandum
33	or Award of Achievement; the original given to the

Upon receipt of such request, the cognizant Department Manager will issue an ANVO outlining the duties performed and duration of such assignment.

13	(ARTICLE IV, SECTION 5)
14
15	This will confirm the understanding between the Company and 16 Union regarding the above subject.
17
18	In an arbitration opinion on the above provision, the arbitrator 19 noted that the parties did not intend that an employee be retained 20 out of seniority for an indefinite period, automatically and 21 without exception. He suggests that some investigation and/or 22 examination is appropriate to determine whether employees 23 should, in fact, be retained out of seniority. Advance guidelines 24 to determine the conditions under which an employee will be 25 retained on the payroll at the expense of a more-senior employee 26 must therefore be established. First, it must be recognized that 27 the thrust of the provision's intent is to preference the "physically 28 handicapped" which shall hereinafter be referred to as physically 29 impaired employee undergoing active treatment. It must also be 30 recognized that there is no intent to provide automatic permanent 31 employment to any employee nor to preference an employee not 32 physically impaired. The arbitrator tells us in his opinion and 33 award that a physically impaired employee whose case has not 34 been settled by the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board will 35 be retained out of seniority until such time as the employee is no 36 longer physically impaired, or the compensation case has been 37 settled, whichever occurs first. It must therefore be our 38 interpretation that physically impaired employees cannot 39 perform the regular duties of their classification or they would 40 not be physically impaired.

For the purpose of applying the arbitrator's award, the term "physically impaired" shall mean that the employee is receiving active treatment for an injury or illness incurred in the course of his or her employment with the Company, and determined by the Workers’ Compensation Insurance Appeal Board or the Company to be occupational, and cannot as a result of such injury perform the normal duties of his or her classification. Further, such treatment shall be administered by that physician to whom the insurance carrier and/or the Company refers the employee or as authorized by the Division of Industrial Accidents. Active treatment does not include periodic observation.

15	NEW TECHNOLOGY
16
17	1. The Union and the Company agree that employee job
18	security may be affected from the Company's introduction
19	and utilization of new machinery and equipment such as
20	automated machines and robots. It is further agreed that the
21	utilization of the safest and most efficient machines,
22	processes, methods and materials is to the mutual benefit of
23	the Union, the Company and employees.
24
25	2. The term "new technology" shall be defined as the
26	installation or introduction of automated ■ manufacturing 27	machines, robots and computer-aided manufacturing systems
28	that cause the direct elimination of work which has been
29	performed manually by an hourly-represented employee.
30
31	3. Technological advances ' such as those referred to in
32	paragraph 2 (new	technology) above necessitate changes	that
33	could affect jobs	and the employees assigned thereto.	In
34	recognition of the	Union's expressed concerns, the Company
35	will establish a	committee which will deal with	the
36	introduction of new machinery and equipment with the goal 37 of assuring that the employees, whose jobs are directly 38	eliminated by the introduction of new machinery and
39	equipment, will be offered retraining in the event that
40	equivalent job opportunities are not available. Normally, this 41 training will be accomplished on the employee's own time

and is intended to provide equal or better job opportunities than would have existed had the new machinery or equipment installation not occurred. Such training will only be for a job for which the Company foresees a requirement.
4.	The committee will be made up of the Vice President of Human Resources, Director of Quality Assurance and will be chaired by the Vice President of Operations. Quarterly meetings will be held with the Union Senior Negotiating Committee to acquaint them with substantive developments in this area, including timely advice to the Union regarding Company plans to introduce new technology as defined in paragraph 2 above.	,
5.	Any new job classifications created as the result of technological changes will be reviewed in advance with the Union.

15	DUAL MACHINE TOOL OPERATION
16
17	This letter will confirm the understanding reached by the Labor 18 Relations Committee on April 6, 1978 regarding assignment and 19 payment of employees who operate more than one machine tool 20 concurrently.
21
22	A. Scope of Agreement
23
24	(1) It is understood that the scope of this agreement extends
25	to assignments on specialized machine tools in four
26	categories, i.e., tape controlled (except Skin Mills),
27	console operated, computer controlled, and semi-
28	automatic machine tools (except Rivet Headers and Saw
29	Sharpeners). The agreement does not include
30	conventional machine tools, and employees will not be
31	assigned to operate more than one conventional machine
32	tool concurrently.
33
34	(2) No employee will be required to operate concurrently
35	more than two specialized machine tools as described
36	above.

B.	Dual Machine Assignment Criteria
The decision to have an employee operate more than one machine will be reviewed by area supervision, Safety Engineering, and the member of the Workers Safety Committee in the department where such assignment is contemplated. An employee assigned to operate more than one machine tool concurrently may discuss questions regarding safety with such employee’s immediate supervisor. The supervisor will review the operation and determine if corrective action is required. Further review will be made by the affected department manager if the employee so requests.
The Company will evaluate dual machine assignment against the following criteria:
•	Daily safety check of the machines by
the operator
•	Primary and secondary guarding
•	Geographic relationship of machines
with normal route condition
•	Proofed operational programs which
includes program setups
•	Compatibility of jobs to be worked
•	Capability of employees to operate more
than	one	machine.
C.	Payment for Dual Machine Operation
When an employee is assigned to operate more than one machine tool concurrently, such employee will be paid a bonus of two dollars ($2,00) per hour for a minimum of four hours for any one day. When the actual time worked on two machines exceeds four hours per day, such employee will be paid the bonus for eight hours or actual time worked, whichever is greater.
Time worked for this purpose includes setup of the job and machine as well as operation.

And so forth with $.01 for 0.3 point change in the Average Index, for the appropriate date set forth in subsection C above.
E.	The amount of any COLA in effect at the time shall be included for all hours worked after the effective date of the adjustment and in computing overtime payments, vacation and sick leave payments, pay for unused sick and injury leave, military leave, holiday, jury duty, jury examination and witness payments, and for no other purpose.
F.	In the event that the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), United States Department of Labor, discontinues publication of the Price Index described in subsection B above, the Company and the Union shall enter into immediate negotiations to determine the appropriate index to be used. The purpose of these negotiations shall be to ensure that the payments to be made under this Article will be as intended by the parties and shall be no less than that which would have occurred had the Price Index been continued unchanged in its present form. In the event the parties are unable to agree within 60 days of the discontinuance of the Price Index, this dispute shall be submitted to final and binding arbitration as provided for in the Agreement. The COLA, if any, shall be retroactive to the appropriate effective date.

H.	No adjustment, retroactive or otherwise, shall be made due to any revision which may later be made in the published figures for the Price Index for any month or months specified in subsection C.
