LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
PREAMBLE
This Agreement is made and entered into by and between the State of Alaska, hereinafter referred to as the "Employer," and Public Employees Local #71, AFL-CIO, hereinafter referred to as the "Union."
The Union shall be the only collective bargaining representative recognized by the Employer under the terms of this Agreement.
WITNESSETH, that
WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the parties to set forth herein the entire Agreement covering hours of work, rates of pay, and conditions of employment between the parties; and
WHEREAS, the Employer and the Union jointly agree to perform faithfully the obligations imposed by this Agreement;
NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, it is hereby agreed as follows:
ARTICLE 1	- PURPOSE
It is the objective of the parties that the obligation of the Employer for the successful conduct of its business and the fulfillment of its responsibilities to the employees covered by this Agreement be carried on without interference arising from differences between the parties.
The Union, representing the employees of the Employer, and the Employer desire to establish and maintain, through harmonious cooperation, a standard of conditions and procedures to provide for orderly collective bargaining relations, prompt and equitable disposition of grievances, and fair wages, hours, and working conditions for the employees covered by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 2	- RECOGNITION
The Employer recognizes, during the term of this Agreement, the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining representative for all employees working in the classifications in the Labor, Trades and Crafts Unit and as the representative of all such employees in interpreting this Agreement and adjusting disputes.
ARTICLE 3	- UNION ACTIVITIES
The Employer agrees that it shall not in any manner, directly or indirectly, attempt to interfere between any of its employees and the Union; it will not in any manner restrain or attempt to restrain any employee from belonging to the Union or from taking an active part in Union affairs; and it will not discriminate against any employee because of the Union membership or lawful
6
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
Union activity.
ARTICLE 4	- EMPLOYMENT REFERRAL PROCEDURES
4.01 - REFERRAL SERVICES
The Union agrees to maintain preferential referral procedures for the purpose of soliciting qualified workers in order to fill all Employer referral requests. Except for promotions, demotions, transfers and emergency appointments, the Employer agrees to use such referral services and will call upon the Union to furnish all qualified workers required. The Employer further agrees to notify the employee and the Union of all promotions, demotions, transfers and emergency appointments.
4.02 - NONPERMANENT TO PERMANENT
The Employer may elect to appoint a nonpermanent employee into a permanent position if the position to be filled is at the entry level at that duty station; provided, however, that any qualified permanent part-time employees in that duty station are offered first rights of refusal to the position. The Employer shall notify the Union of such appointments in accordance with Section 6.
4.03 - REFERRAL COMMITTEE
The Union shall create a preferential referral committee within thirty (30) days of the signing of this contract, composed of not more than three (3) individuals appointed by the Union, to supervise and control the operation of the job referral system herein.
4.04 - APPLICATION FORMS/NONDISCRMINIATION
The Union agrees to accept and review applications, on forms provided by the Employer, from all those wishing to apply for possible openings with the State. Selection of applicants for referral to jobs shall be nondiscriminatory and shall not be based on nor affected by race, creed, color, age, sex, national origin or political affiliation or activity. The Union agrees that it will not discriminate against non-Union workers in referring applicants to the Employer, and the Employer agrees that it will not discriminate against Union workers in selecting job applicants referred by the Union.
4.05 - PREFERENTIAL CATEGORIES
A.	The parties recognize the primary importance to employ residents of Alaska. Both the Union and the Employer shall give first preference to qualified residents of Alaska. Also, preference shall be given to qualified residents in the immediate area of the job call.
B.	It is understood the Employer will have need for employees with special skills and abilities. The Union agrees to refer persons possessing such skills and abilities and to honor all such bona fide requests.
C.	The parties recognize the need to hire the handicapped. A handicapped individual is one so specified under regulations issued by the Vocational Rehabilitation Division of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
D.	Pursuant to the parties mutual recognition of the principles of Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action, the parties agree that selective certification by referral will be made to satisfy the State’s affirmative action objectives. When a specific request is made for a referral to fill a position with an applicant in a protected category, the Union will make every effort to honor such request, providing such underutilization has been specified and approved by the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity. In such cases, the Union will have
7
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
seventy-two (72) hours, rather than forty-eight (48) hours, to make the referral.
E.	The criteria expressed in the subsections above may be used as justification for an appointment from other than the top qualified and available candidates; provided, however, the individual is registered with the Union.
4.06 - REJECTION OF APPLICANTS
The Employer retains the right to reject any job applicant, but the applicant and the Union shall be entitled to the reason for such rejection.
4.07 - REFERRAL TIME FRAME REQUIREMENTS
In the event the Union is unable to supply the Employer with two (2) qualified workers within forty-eight (48) hours (Saturdays, Sundays and holidays excluded) when called upon by the Employer, the Employer may procure workers from other sources; provided, however, that in such instances the Employer shall promptly furnish the Union with the names of such workers, their classification and date of hiring. In any emergency resulting from an act of God or natural disaster, the Employer may temporarily procure workers from any source.
4.08 - UNION MEMBERSHIP - NEW EMPLOYEES
It is further agreed that all workers employed by the Employer who are not already members shall become members of the Union or make the uniformly required payments on or before the thirty-first (31st) calendar day following the beginning of employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, and all employees shall maintain membership in the Union as a condition of employment during the life of this Agreement. Membership means to tender the initiation fees and the periodic dues or fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership in the Union. All requests by the Union for dismissal of any employee for failure to comply with this provision shall be in writing.
The Union shall defend, indemnify, and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, grievances, or other liability (including attorney’s fees incurred by the Employer) that arise out of or by reason of actions taken by the Employer pursuant to this section, except those actions caused by the Employer’s negligence.
4.09 - UNION STEWARD - NEW EMPLOYEE NOTICE
Within a five (5) day period after reporting to work, each new employee within the bargaining unit shall be informed as to the identity of the Union steward, chief job steward, or a Union representative by the supervisor in the activity to which such employee will be regularly assigned. Each employee transferred from a section or shift shall likewise be informed.
4.10 - O.S.C.O. EXEMPTION FROM UNION REFERRAL
It is agreed between the parties that the Occupational Safety Compliance Officers under the Agreement shall be required to meet minimum qualifications established by the State as well as being required to pass any examinations to be considered for employment. The recruitment and selection procedures for Occupational Safety Compliance Officers shall be determined by the Employer.
ARTICLE 5	- UNION RESPONSIBILITY
5.01 - NONDISCRIMINATION
The Union assumes all obligations and responsibility for the continued membership of its members and the Union shall retain the right to discipline its members. No worker shall be discriminated against for the upholding of Union principles, and any employee who works under
8
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
the instructions of the Union, provided such instructions are in compliance with the Agreement, or who serves on a committee, shall not lose their position or be discriminated against for this reason.
5.02 - BINDING EFFECT OF AGREEMENT
The Union agrees that this Agreement is binding on each and every member of this bargaining unit and that its members, individually or collectively, accept full responsibility for carrying out all the provisions of this Agreement.
5.03 - HARMONIOUS RELATIONSHIP
It is the responsibility of the Employer to manage the work force. It is the responsibility of the parties to promote such practices as will improve the quality of service provided and the working conditions of the members. The Union agrees that it will actively dissuade excessive absenteeism, sexual harassment, and other practices which may hamper the Employer's operation and that the Union will support the Employer's efforts to eliminate waste and inefficiency, to improve the quality of work, and to promote harmonious relations between the Employer and employees.
5.04 - EMPLOYER RULES AND REGULATIONS
The Union agrees to make every effort to see that the members working under this Agreement obey all reasonable rules, instructions, and regulations prescribed by the Employer.
ARTICLE 6	- RECOGNITION OF RIGHTS AND FUNCTIONS OF MANAGEMENT
6.01 - MANAGEMENT'S AUTHORITY
Except as provided in this Agreement, nothing herein limits the Employer in the exercise of the rights of ownership and management. Accordingly, the Employer has, among others, the right to: select its supervisory personnel (supervisors as defined by the Alaska State Labor Relations Agency); to hire new employees; to discipline, suspend, or discharge employees for just cause; to decide and determine and designate all occupational classifications it has to offer its employees, to assign duties and responsibilities to employees, to make such rules and regulations as the Employer considers necessary or advisable for the orderly and efficient conduct of its operations and to require employees to observe such rules and regulations; provided, however, the exercising of the aforementioned rights is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
6.02 - AUTHORITY RETENTION
All of the functions, rights, powers, and authority of the Employer not specifically abridged, delegated, or modified by this Agreement are recognized by the Union as being retained by the Employer.
6.03 - EXEMPTION TO WORK STOPPAGE
The Union recognizes that the continuity of certain work is imperative to the public service mission of the Employer, and if a work stoppage should occur, management and all other personnel not covered by this Agreement, including guards, firefighters, and other protectors of public safety and health, shall be permitted to perform their respective functions without interference by the Union or its members.
ARTICLE 7	- PROTECTION OF RIGHTS
9
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
7.01 - PICKET LINES
It shall be a violation of this Agreement and it shall be cause for disciplinary action in the event an employee refuses to go through or work behind any primary picket line unless such line is sanctioned by Public Employees Local #71, AFL-CIO, and the participating International Union (Laborers International Union of North America). The Employer specifically retains all of its rights under AS 23.40.200.
7.02 - STRUCK GOODS
It shall not be a violation of this Agreement and it shall not be cause for discharge or disciplinary action if any employee refuses to perform any service which the Employer undertakes to perform as an ally of any Employer or person whose employees are on strike, and which service, but for such strike, would be performed by the employees of the Employer or person on strike. Nor shall the exercise of any rights permitted by law be a violation of this Agreement, unless such exercise is precluded by this Agreement.
7.03 - LOST OR DAMAGED PROPERTY
Employees shall not be responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged property except in case of proven negligence or deliberate act. This shall include the use of credit cards for any purpose or any other method of giving credit. The Employer shall provide an adequate checking system to protect the Employer and employee.
7.04 - CONTRACTING OUT
The following shall govern contracting and subcontracting, involving the performance of work of classifications covered by this Agreement, which would directly result in the layoff of permanent or probationary employees covered by this Agreement.
A.	Prior to the contracting or subcontracting of any work covered by this Agreement which would result in the layoff of permanent or probationary employees, the Employer agrees to conduct a cost efficiency study. Unless the study shows that the work can be performed by the contractor or subcontractor with less cost to the Employer, no permanent/probationary employee shall be laid off and replaced by contracted or subcontracted work.
The Employer shall require the contractor or subcontractor to pay the hourly wage rates established in the Agreement for all such work, plus an additional two dollars and fifty-five cents ($2.55) for each compensable hour worked as "in lieu of" benefits. It is agreed that the abovementioned "in lieu of" amount will be reduced only by the amount of actual cost of benefits paid by the contractor or subcontractor. To insure compliance with this section, the Employer will require the contractor or subcontractor to furnish a certification of wages and/or any certified cost of benefits paid upon written request. Such certified information shall be furnished to the Union upon reasonable written showing of suspected noncompliance. In addition, the Employer shall furnish to the Union, a copy of each new or renewal contract. If the contractor or subcontractor is found to be out of compliance, the Employer agrees to take all reasonable steps to enforce the requirements of this section, including without limitation, terminating the contract or subcontract if compliance cannot be otherwise obtained.
All work performed on motor vehicles which is typically associated with work done by private service stations (e.g. tires, lights, fan belts, wipers, etc.) shall be free from the requirements of this section. Other vehicle repair and overhaul service work shall be performed in State facilities except in extreme emergencies. All State-owned vehicles shall contain a maintenance/repair instruction packet outlining the foregoing language.
B.	Nothing in this Agreement will invalidate nor supersede AS 35.15.010 or AS 19.10.170.
10
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
7.05 - OVERLOADS
In the event an employee is arrested with an overload, the Employer shall pay all fines upon conviction, and the employee shall be paid for the time spent in service of the Employer, provided the employee has not loaded the cargo contrary to the instructions of the supervisor.
7.06 - REVOCATION OF LICENSES
In the event an employee suffers a revocation of his/her license because of violations of any federal, state, or city law by the Employer, the Employer shall provide suitable and continued employment for such employee, at not less than the employee's hourly rate of pay at the time of revocation of the employee's license, for the entire period of revocation of the license. The employee shall be reinstated to the seniority the employee held prior to revocation of the employee's license, after the employee's license is restored.
7.07 - NO STRIKE/LOCKOUT
The parties agree that there will be no strikes or lockouts during the life of this Agreement.
7.08 - LICENSES
Each employee shall be responsible for obtaining and retaining all mandatory licenses and certifications necessary to perform the duties of his/her position. If a new licensing or certification provision is imposed by statute or regulation on current employees, the State shall pay for the initial license/certification fee provided the employee obtains the license or certification prior to the deadline established by statute or regulation. All future renewals shall be the sole responsibility of the employee.
Employees who were grandfathered under the 1992/94 agreement and had licenses or certifications paid for by the employer, shall continue to have those licenses or certifications paid for so long as they remain in their current position or a position which requires the license or certification.
The parties recognize that there are certain licenses/certifications which are required for the convenience of the employer. In such cases, the employer shall pay for necessary training and license/certification fees.
ARTICLE 8 - SEPARATION FROM STATE SERVICE/DISCIPLINE
8.01 - DISCIPLINE
The Employer retains the right to discipline or suspend an employee for just cause but agrees that the Union steward or a paid Union representative shall be notified in writing concurrent with written notice to the employee. The Employer further agrees that the Union steward or representative shall be present, if requested by the employee, during all stages of conduct of hearings determining such matters.
The following provision shall apply only to employees in positions that require the employee to possess a commercial drivers license (CDL) and who are subject to testing for drugs and alcohol under the provisions of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations.
1	Employees who test positive for illegal drugs as defined in the Code of Federal Regulations shall be suspended for a minimum of ninety (90) days without pay as discipline. More severe discipline is subject to the just cause standard.
2.	Employees who test positive a second time for illegal drugs will be considered for immediate dismissal, subject to the just cause standard.
11
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
3.	The Union reserves the right to challenge the validity of the urinalysis and reporting under the provisions of Article 9.
8.02 - DISCHARGE
The Employer retains the right to discharge a permanent employee for just cause such as incompetence, unsatisfactory performance of duties, and unexcused absenteeism. The Employer further agrees that the Union steward and the Union office in the employee’s district shall be notified immediately by copy of the written notice to the employee giving the reason(s) for such discharge. The Employer further agrees that with the exception of intoxication, dishonesty, gross disobedience, aggressive physical assault, or abandonment of duties, all permanent employees shall be given two (2) weeks notice or two (2) weeks pay prior to discharge. Employees other than permanent employees discharged or terminated under the provisions of this section shall have appeal rights through Step Three of the grievance procedure.
8.03 - RESIGNATION
All permanent employees shall give the Employer two (2) weeks notice in writing, except in emergencies, before leaving their employment. The subsequent referral of an employee not meeting this requirement may be refused by the Employer for a ninety (90) day period commencing on the last working day of the employment period for which the required two (2) weeks notice was not received.
8.04 - TERMINATION/LAYOFF SLIPS
It shall be mandatory that the Employer furnish each employee a termination or layoff slip showing the actual reason for termination or layoff. Employees in year-round service will receive two (2) weeks notice prior to layoff or two (2) weeks pay in lieu thereof. The Employer will make every effort to provide employees in seasonal service with two (2) weeks notice prior to layoff.
ARTICLE 9 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
9.01 - GRIEVANCES
A grievance shall be defined as any controversy or dispute arising between the Union or an employee of the bargaining unit and the Employer. Having a desire to create and maintain labor relations harmony, the parties agree that they will promptly attempt to adjust all complaints, disputes, controversies, or other grievances arising between them involving questions of interpretation or application of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or other controversy or dispute having occasion to arise between the parties. If differences or disputes of any kind arise between the Union or the employee covered herein and the Employer, the Union or the aggrieved employee, as the case may be, shall use the following procedure as the sole means of settling said difference, dispute, or controversy.
Disciplinary Grievances: Any grievance resulting from a dismissal, demotion for cause, or suspension in excess of thirty (30) days shall be entered into the procedure at Step Two and must be brought to the attention of the Employer through the Union within ten (10) working days of the effective date of the action or the date the employee is made aware of the action, whichever is later, to receive the assistance of the Union and the use of this grievance procedure.
Step One: Except for disciplinary grievances described above, any dispute must be brought to the attention of the Employer through the Union, consistent with the procedures set forth in this Article, within thirty (30) working days of the effective date of the disputed action or the date the
12
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
employee is made aware of the action, whichever is later, to receive the attention of the Union and the use of this grievance procedure. The employee may report in writing to the Steward or designated representative of the Union any grievance that arises between the employee and the Employer. The written grievance will be filed with the employee's first line supervisor outside of the Labor, Trades and Crafts bargaining unit by the designated representative for investigation and resolution. The supervisor, with whom the grievance is filed, will provide an answer in writing, any corrective action taken and whether the grievance is denied or granted in total or in part within ten (10) working days.
Step Two: Failing to agree at Step One, the grievance shall be referred in writing to the designated Human Resources Senior Management Consultant of the Management Services Group for the department or agency in which the grievant(s) is (are) employed within ten (10) working days after receipt of a response. The designated Human Resources Senior Management Consultant for that department or agency shall answer the Union representative within fifteen (15) working days in writing.
Step Three: If the grievance cannot be settled as outlined in Step Two, the grievance may be submitted by the Union for settlement to the Commissioner of the Department of Administration within ten (10) working days after completion of Step Two. If the grievance has not been settled in writing within twenty (20) working days after receipt by the Commissioner, either party may proceed to Step Four of this Article if the nature of the grievance falls within the scope of Step Four. Date of receipt shall constitute date of answer. In the event the matter is settled by written agreement between the Union representative and the Commissioner of the Department of Administration, such written agreement shall have the same force and effect as a decision or award of the arbitrator and shall be final and binding on each of the parties and they will abide thereby.

Classification disputes are not subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of Article 9 except as provided in Sections B and D below.
B.	Bargaining Unit Placement and New Classifications. It is recognized as all new positions (PCNs) and classifications created by the Employer should be placed in the appropriate bargaining unit.
Subsequent to the effective date of this Agreement, the Union Business Manager shall be notified of all new classifications created within ten (10) days of such action and such notifications shall include the class specifications and wage grade assignment. If the Union disagrees with the wage grade assignment of a new job class, it must notify the Director of Personnel in writing of its objections within thirty (30) days. The notice must include an analysis and rationale of the disagreement and detailed information regarding the duties, responsibilities and wage rates of comparable classifications in the public or private sector in Alaska or the Pacific Northwest. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the union's objections, the parties shall meet and confer. If disputes regarding the wage grade assignments of job classes are not resolved within thirty (30) working days, the union may request arbitration. The arbitrator shall be selected from the panel provided in Article 9. The arbitrator shall have no authority to establish a new wage grade; the arbitrator's authority shall be limited to a determination of the proper wage grade assignment for specific job classes. The arbitrator's award shall be consistent with merit system principles as articulated at AS 39.25.010.
Both parties recognize that the Labor Relations Agency shall retain its usual authority to make determinations of unit classification assignments. No filled position (PCN) shall be changed to a bargaining unit outside this bargaining unit without written notification to Local 71 of such action concurrent with the notification to the department. If the Union does not notify the Employer within ten (10) working days from the receipt of notification of its intent to challenge, the Employer will be free to take the proposed action. If the Employer changes a vacant position (PCN) to a bargaining unit outside this bargaining unit, Local 71 shall be notified concurrently with such action.
C.	Reallocation of a Position. An employee occupying a position that is assigned to a lower wage group or reallocated to a classification at a lower wage group will be placed at the most advanced step providing a lesser wage rate, but the salary will remain frozen at the former rate until earned step advancements or adjustments to the wage schedule cause the rate to exceed the frozen rate. The frozen rate may be paid for the duration of this Agreement after which it will revert to the rate for the assigned step.
D.	Classification Reviews.
1.	When the Union believes a position is improperly classified, the Union shall submit an updated position description and information regarding the duties and responsibilities of the position to the departmental Division of Personnel Classifications Manager with a copy to the Director of the Division of Personnel. Within thirty (30) days of receipt the department shall submit its written analysis and recommendation to the Director with a copy to the Union. If the department fails to respond within thirty (30) days, the Union may advance the request to the Director within five working days of the due date. If the Union does not agree with the department's recommendation, it must notify the Director of its specific disagreement within twenty (20) working days of the date the recommendation was received.
2.	Within thirty (30) days from receipt of the department's recommendation or thirty (30) days from the date the request was advanced by the Union, the Director shall review the position description in conjunction with existing class specifications, and issue a decision. If the Union
20
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
does not agree with the Director's decision, it must request arbitration within ten (10) working days of the date the decision was due or received, whichever is earlier. Absent a notice of objection from the Union, any change in job class allocation shall be effective the pay period following the Director's decision.
The arbitrator shall be selected from the panel provided in Article 9. The parties shall make every effort to schedule arbitration within sixty (60) days of the arbitrator's selection. The arbitrator has no authority to establish a new wage group or a new job class. The arbitrator's authority shall be limited to a determination of the proper job class allocation. The arbitrator's award shall be consistent with the merit system principles at AS 39.25.010. Any change in job class allocation shall be effective the pay period following receipt of the arbitrator's award.
3.	No more than one (1) request may be submitted for a position in any twelve (12) month period unless substantial changes in duties have occurred.
4.	The time frames contained herein may be altered by mutual agreement of the parties.
13.04 - SERVICE BONUS
Two service bonus steps, labeled Step C and Step D, shall be added to the wage scale provided in Section 13.02. An employee with seven (7) years of continuous probationary/permanent service with the Employer who has been at Step B of his or her current wage group for at least two (2) years shall be paid at Step C commencing on the first (1st) day of the pay period following the fulfillment of the service requirement.
An employee with nine (9) years of continuous probationary/permanent service with the Employer who has been at Step C of his or her current wage group for at least two (2) years shall be paid at Step D commencing on the first day of the pay period following the fulfillment of the service requirement.
The movement from Step B to C, from Step C to D, and from Step D to E shall be extended one (1) month for each twenty-three (23) working days of leave without pay in a leave year.
A percentage based service bonus system is adopted. The percentages shall be three percent (3%) above Step B for Step C; three percent (3%) above Step C for Step D and beginning July 1, 2002, a new Step E three percent (3%) above Step D for employees who have been employed by the State of Alaska for 15 or more years and have been in Step D for at least two (2) years.

The Employer shall grant personal leave if satisfied that the employee is absent for medical reasons.

Health insurance contributions will be made on behalf of qualified employees during the twelve (12) week period of family leave (including periods of personal, sick or donated leave, or periods of leave without pay).

The twelve (12) month period for utilizing leave entitlements shall commence with the first day leave is taken under the FMLA.

Should circumstances cause the Employer to refuse the employee the opportunity to use the full thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hours, any unused portion of the thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hours mandatory leave shall be deducted from the employee's leave balance at the end of the leave year and paid at the employee's regular hourly rate. Part-time employees shall have the mandatory leave requirement prorated based upon the number of hours the employee is regularly scheduled to work.

The employee's leave balance will be reduced by the number of hours of personal leave for which payment is made. In no case may an employee's leave balance be reduced to less than seventy-five (75) hours through cash-in.
Withdrawals under this section shall not eliminate the employee's obligation to use personal leave as provided in Section 19.03, nor shall the hours withdrawn take the place of leave which an employee is required to use.

C.	The Employer will convert the donated leave hours to dollars at the regular (annualized) hourly rate of the donor. The dollars will then be converted to hours of leave at the regular (annualized) hourly rate of the recipient, and the resulting number of hours will be added to the recipient's Donated Leave Account for use in accordance with the requirements of this Article. The total amount of leave credited to the recipient's Donated Leave Account shall not exceed three hundred (300) hours during the life of the agreement.
D.	Once the Employer has completed the above process, the State will not be obligated for further processing or liabilities resulting therefrom. Once the donation has been transferred to the recipient's account, the donation cannot be withdrawn, modified or otherwise returned to the donor's account.
E.	Donations of leave under this section will not reduce the mandatory leave usage requirements established in Section 19.03.

Not more than ninety (90) days after the signing of this Agreement, a safety committee composed of equal representation from the Employer and the Union or designated employee representatives shall be created by the Employer to inspect all tools and equipment, review safety programs and training, and enforce safety practices and regulations. The Employer representatives of the safety committee will be selected by management and the Union representatives will be selected by the Union. However, if the Union's selection of an employee would cause a hardship on the employee or the Employer because of the employee's work assignments, travel, or other legitimate concerns, the Employer may request the Union to make a different selection for the safety committee. The safety committee shall have the specific authority to deny the department concerned the right to operate equipment until the safety committee has approved equipment and conditions as being safe.

It is recognized that circumstances associated with fire suppression activities under the control of the Department of Natural Resources precludes management from maintaining camp
41
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement

A.	When an employee is assigned to fire duty on a fire line, or in related duties at or near the fire line, camp requirements need not be met nor is per diem payable except that per diem will be payable, consistent with Article 15, for each day after twenty-three (23) consecutive days of initial assignment to fire suppression activities, or twenty-three (23) consecutive days for each reassignment to the fire suppression activities.
B.	When an employee is assigned to supply or support activity related to a fire, but they are retained in a city, town, or village distant from the fire, per diem will be paid per Article 15 if commercial facilities are present in the community and the employee can procure such facilities for the employee's use, and the department has not provided for those commercial facilities.
If such facilities are not available or cannot be procured, the Department of Natural Resources will provide other facilities to include sleeping and lavatory needs, a light source, heat where needed, and a means of heating or preparing the food provided by the department.
Facilities provided by the Department of Natural Resources will be equal to facilities provided to all other employees similarly assigned and per diem is not payable.
Should it become necessary for support personnel to travel to or near the fire line, the provisions of subsection A herein shall apply for the duration of that stay.
ARTICLE 22 - SENIORITY

Employees who are on leave without pay for under thirty (30) consecutive days shall maintain their same seniority date. Employees on leave without pay for over thirty (30) consecutive days shall have their seniority date adjusted according to the days over thirty (30) in leave without pay status, except as specifically provided in other sections of this Agreement.
The Employer shall also notify the Union, in writing, of all layoffs and recalls and their effective dates concurrent with the notice to the affected employees. The Employer will also furnish every six (6) months, by duty station, lists of all employees by seniority date including their classification. Such seniority lists shall be forwarded to the Business Manager no later than March 1 and September 1 of each year.
22.01 - DUTY STATION SENIORITY
Duty Station seniority shall be established for the purposes of ranking employees for promotion or layoff and recall from layoff. Duty stations shall be determined by location. These locations will be categorized by department, by divisions within that department. For purposes of this section, location shall mean the city, town, village or job site.
It has further been understood that if an employee is temporarily reassigned from their permanent duty station for a period not to exceed one (1) year, or as mutually agreed by the parties, the employee's seniority at their permanent duty station will not be affected.
Duty station seniority shall not in any way affect the employee's overall seniority with the
42
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
Employer for purposes of vacation, holiday and/or other fringe benefits.
A.	It is agreed that this subsection covers only design and construction employees within this bargaining unit employed in the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, and the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Parks, who are assigned to work on-site at preconstruction or construction projects. Accordingly, Article 15 and Article 22 of this Agreement are modified to meet the working conditions of employees so employed. Those sections or subsections of the Collective Bargaining Agreement not modified herein will remain in full force and effect.
Each employee will be assigned by the Employer upon hire to a permanent duty station which will be an area of fifty (50) road miles from a focal point in a city, town, or village which has a population large enough to reasonably expect local hires for jobs within that duty station. Once assigned to a duty station, that duty station shall be the designated, permanent duty station of the employee unless and until the employee elects to fill a position in another duty station in accordance with Article 4 or Article 22.03. There shall be only one (1) permanent duty station for each employee.
The Employer will designate duty stations and determine the focal point of each duty station. That designated duty station shall be used to compute duty station seniority. However, if a dispute arises regarding the focal point, both parties agree to meet and confer on the issue.
For the purposes of determining compensation, the focal point for each duty station will be considered point zero and the project office will be considered as the job assignment for determining miles from the focal point.
When an employee is assigned to work at a project with the project office between the focal point and twenty-five (25) road miles from the focal point, the employee will not be entitled to per diem, meal allowances, travel pay or any other compensation in lieu thereof.
When an employee is assigned to work at a project with the project office between twenty-five (25) road miles and fifty (50) road miles from the focal point, the employee will be entitled to ten dollars ($10.00) for each day worked at the project.
When an employee is assigned to work at a project with the project office beyond fifty (50) road miles from the focal point of their designated, permanent duty station, the employee will be entitled to meal allowances in accordance with Article 15.03. When the employee is required to stay overnight for an assignment beyond fifty (50) road miles from the focal point of their designated, permanent duty station, the employee shall be entitled to lodging and meal allowances in accordance with Articles 15.02 and 15.03.
Each employee shall be entitled to report to the project office each workday and shall be entitled to travel time or work time, as appropriate, for the time required to transport themselves to the work site. In the event that the employee and their supervisor mutually agree that the employee will report directly to the work site, the employee shall be entitled to travel time or work time, as appropriate, for actual time spent traveling , but no more than that which it takes to travel from the project office to the work site.
22.02 - PROMOTION
For the purposes of this section, promotion means the movement from a permanent position in any classification to a permanent position in any classification at a higher range. It is recognized by the parties that promotions usually occur within an occupational series consisting of one (1) or more classifications. However, it is also recognized that promotions from one (1) occupational series to another occupational series shall be allowed providing the promotional
43
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
candidate is qualified and competent for the position to be filled and the employee satisfies the other conditions of this section.
A. When an opening occurs, promotions shall be initiated by posting of a job announcement at the duty station where the opening occurs. Such job announcements shall be posted in a location or locations where all eligible candidates could reasonably be expected to be aware of the opening. Such job announcements will be posted for four (4) working days and will be retained by the Employer for six (6) months.
B.	Promotions shall be made from among the two (2) employees signing the job announcement with the highest duty station seniority, provided each employee is qualified and competent for the higher classification and is qualified and competent to perform the duties of the position to be filled. If the Employer determines that either of the two most senior employees signing the job announcement is not qualified or competent for the higher level position, the Employer may consider other employees, in order of their seniority, until two qualified and competent employees are under consideration for the position. If an employee other than one of the two most senior is selected for promotion, the Union and Employer shall attempt to reach mutual agreement. Failing to reach mutual agreement shall not bar the Employer from promoting, nor bar the Union from grieving the action.
C.	When Sections A and B above have been complied with but no employee at the duty station is found qualified and competent for the promotional vacancy, the Employer may promote an employee from another duty station. When an employee is promoted as a result of a transfer from one (1) duty station to another duty station, the duty station seniority of the employee will not be a determining factor, but such a promotional transfer will be determined by whether or not the candidate is qualified and competent for the position to be filled.
22.03 - TRANSFERS
A.	An employee will not be compelled to accept a transfer from one (1) duty station to another duty station or from the employee's classification to another classification at the same wage group. When an employee accepts a transfer from one (1) duty station to another duty station, the employee's duty station seniority at the duty station the employee left will be terminated and the employee will begin accruing duty station seniority at the employee's new duty station effective on the date of the transfer.
B.	When an employee accepts a transfer from one (1) classification to another classification of the same wage group at the same duty station, the employee's duty station seniority shall be retained for purposes of ranking for promotion.
22.04 - LAYOFF
A.	Layoffs, including reduction in force, shall be made in reverse order of duty station seniority from among those in the classification in which the layoff occurs.
B.	An employee may exercise bumping rights to a lower classification in the employee's class series at the employee's duty station, provided the employee is qualified to perform the tasks of the lower classification and is not the least senior in the lower classification, and will assume the wage level of the lower classification to which the employee is moved.
C.	When an employee is promoted, voluntarily demoted in lieu of layoff or transferred outside of the employee's occupational series at the employee's duty station, the employee retains seniority in the classification the employee left for two (2) years. If the employee does not return to the classification the employee left within two (2) years, the employee loses all
44
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
accumulated seniority in as classification.
22.05 - RECALL
A.	Recalls shall be made in order of duty station seniority from among those employees laid-off in the classification in which the recall occurs.
B.	Employees who exercise their bumping rights in accordance with Section 22.04.B of this Article shall retain their recall rights to the classification from which they were laid off, for a period of two (2) years.
C.	Employees who voluntarily demote or transfer outside their classification series to another classification at the same duty station shall retain recall rights to the classification they vacated for a period of two (2) years.

ARTICLE 27 - STATE-OWNED/CONTROLLED HOUSING
The parties agree that the following is the rental schedule for Bargaining Unit Members living in State-owned or State-controlled housing.
27.01 - FACTORS TO BE USED IN DETERMINING RENT
The following factors are to be used in the rental formula for assessing rental charges for State housing units:
Rental Base - The typical rent for an unfurnished unit in Anchorage with a particular number of bedrooms.
Facility Condition - The index of facility condition in terms of "Good," "Fair," or "Poor."
Adjusted Rent - The figure derived from application of the facility condition index to the rental base. The adjusted rent figure will be used for the calculation of the amenities lacking and the imposition-on-privacy deductions.
47
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
Required-to-Live - A deduction of twenty-five (25) percent allowed for protection of property or for the convenience of the State where applicable.
Imposition-on-Privacy - A deduction of ten (10) percent of the adjusted rent allowed for the use of a portion of the facility for State business if applicable.
Amenities Lacking - Percentage of the adjusted rent to be deducted due to lack of fire and/or police protection.
Geographic Differential - The coefficient used to adjust an Anchorage-based rent to a level appropriate for a specific location outside of Anchorage. See Section 27.09 for list of coefficients by election district.
Travel Allowance - Deduction allowed for locations involving unusual transportation costs.
27.02 - RENTAL FORMULA
The rental formula is as follows:
[[[((RB x CI) - (AL + IP)) GDF] - TA] RTL] + UC = FCR
Or Calculated FCR is:
RB
xCI
Subtotal 1
Subtotal 1
-(Subtotal 1 x AL) + (Subtotal 1 x IP)
Subtotal 2
Subtotal 2 xGDF
Subtotal 3
Subtotal 3 -TA
Subtotal 4
Subtotal 4 xRTL
Subtotal 5
Subtotal 5 +UC
FCR
GDF is the geographical differential factor for a particular location.
CI is the facility condition index:
1.0 = Good
0.8 = Fair
48
LTC 2004-2006 Master Agreement
0.6 = Poor
RB is the typical rental base for an unfurnished unit in Anchorage with a particular number of bedrooms.
RTL is the reduction for required-to-live; when used in the formula the RTL equals three-quarters (.75).
AL is the deduction for amenities lacking.
IP is the deduction for imposition-on-privacy.
TA is the allowance for excessive travel.
UC is the utility charge for all units except bunkhouses.
FCR is the formula calculated rent.
AND:
Amount of rent to be paid will be the lesser of the following:
1.	twenty-five percent (25%) of employee's gross income (standby and overtime compensation excluded) as an employee of the State of Alaska, or
2.	"FCR" resulting from exercise of formula.

In no case will the total deductions reduce the rental base more than fifty percent (50%).
27.	06 - IMPOSITION ON PRIVACY
In cases where the head of a department requests the use of a portion of the facility for the purpose of accommodating official visitors, for use as office space, or for the general convenience of the public, a deduction of ten percent (10%) of the adjusted rent is allowable. Only one (1) deduction is allowed per agency per location. In no case will the total deductions reduce the rental base more than fifty percent (50%).
27.	07 - AMENITIES LACKING
A deduction from the adjusted rent equal to two percent (2%) shall be allowed for lack of fire and/or police protection up to a maximum of four percent (4%) for the unit in question. In no case will the total deductions reduce the rental base more than fifty percent (50%).
27.	08 - TRAVEL ALLOWANCE
In some cases the State supplies quarters to its employees in locations where minimal community services are available only at some distance from the location of the quarters. In this situation the Department of Administration will grant a deduction from the chart listed below, to offset the direct economic effects of the unusual transportation costs incurred. The nearest established community as defined in this section is to be used as the base community for calculating the deduction. A community must be deficient in more than one (1) of the listed services if a town farther away is to be selected as the base for calculating the distance deduction.
Distance in miles, one (1) way for surface travel or air travel if surface travel not available	Maximum Monthly Deduction

For purposes of calculating a deduction under this section, an established community is a population center offering the minimal community services listed below on a year round basis, or alternatively, approximately the same seasonal basis as the occupancy of the State rental quarters under consideration. Conformity with this definition, without regard to population size or other criteria, is the sole basis for identification of an established community.

ARTICLE 9 - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
9.01 - GRIEVANCES
A grievance shall be defined as any controversy or dispute arising between the Union or an employee of the bargaining unit and the Employer. Having a desire to create and maintain labor relations harmony, the parties agree that they will promptly attempt to adjust all complaints, disputes, controversies, or other grievances arising between them involving questions of interpretation or application of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, or other controversy or dispute having occasion to arise between the parties. If differences or disputes of any kind arise between the Union or the employee covered herein and the Employer, the Union or the aggrieved employee, as the case may be, shall use the following procedure as the sole means of settling said difference, dispute, or controversy.
Disciplinary Grievances: Any grievance resulting from a dismissal, demotion for cause, or suspension in excess of thirty (30) days shall be entered into the procedure at Step Two and must be brought to the attention of the Employer through the Union within ten (10) working days of the effective date of the action or the date the employee is made aware of the action, whichever is later, to receive the assistance of the Union and the use of this grievance procedure.
Step One: Except for disciplinary grievances described above, any dispute must be brought to the attention of the Employer through the Union, consistent with the procedures set forth in this Article, within thirty (30) working days of the effective date of the disputed action or the date the employee is made aware of the action, whichever is later, to receive the attention of the Union and the use of this grievance procedure. The employee may report in writing to the Steward or designated representative of the Union any grievance that arises between the employee and the Employer. The written grievance will be filed with the employee's first line supervisor outside of the Labor, Trades and Crafts bargaining unit by the designated representative for investigation and resolution. The supervisor, with whom the grievance is filed, will provide an answer in writing, any corrective action taken and whether the grievance is denied or granted in total or in part within ten (10) working days.
Step Two: Failing to agree at Step One, the grievance shall be referred in writing to the designated Human Resources Senior Management Consultant of the Management Services Group for the department or agency in which the grievant(s) is (are) employed within ten (10) working days after receipt of a response. The designated Human Resources Senior Management Consultant Manager of for that department or agency shall answer the Union representative within fifteen (15) working days in writing.
Step Three: If the grievance cannot be settled as outlined in Step Two, the grievance may be submitted by the Union for settlement to the Commissioner of the Department of Administration within ten (10) working days after completion of Step Two. If the grievance has not been settled in writing within twenty (20) working days after receipt by the Commissioner, either party may proceed to Step Four of this Article if the nature of the grievance falls within the scope of Step Four. Date of receipt shall constitute date of answer. In the event the matter is settled by written agreement between the Union representative and the Commissioner of the Department of Administration, such written agreement shall have the same force and effect as a decision or award of the arbitrator and shall be final and binding on each of the parties and they will abide thereby. Should either party fail or refuse to abide by the written agreement, the prevailing party shall be free to take whatever action it deems necessary and such action will not be considered in
violation of this Agreement.
Step Four: Arbitration. Any grievance which involves the application or interpretation of the terms of this Agreement or is an appeal from demotion or dismissal of a permanent employee, or an appeal from dismissal of a probationary employee holding permanent status in another classification, which is not settled at Step Three may be submitted to arbitration for settlement. If either party desires to demand arbitration, the request must be received in writing within twenty (20) days of the receipt of the completed Step Three grievance. The parties will meet within ten (10) days to strike names.
9.02 - BOARD OF ARBITRATION
Within 30 days of the signing of this Agreement the Employer and the Union will jointly request from the United States Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (USFMCS) the names of 30 qualified arbitrators. Each party may add up to 3 names of arbitrators to the list provided from the USFMCS. From the list of 36 arbitrators the employer and the Union shall alternately strike from the list one name at a time until 11 names remain on the list. This list of eleven arbitrators shall be used by the parties to select individual arbitrators for arbitration. Either party may, at any time, request a new list of arbitrators during the life of this Agreement.
In the event that arbitration becomes necessary, the arbitrator will be selected by the Union and the Employer by alternately striking names from the list one name at a time until only one name remains on the list. The name of the arbitrator remaining on the list shall be accepted by the parties and arbitration shall commence within 60 calendar days, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by both parties.
During the process of the above procedure, there shall be no strike or lockout which is in any manner related to this grievance. The parties agree that the decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the parties and that they will abide thereby. The authority of the arbitrator shall be limited to questions directly involving the interpretation or application of specific provisions of this Agreement and no other matter shall be subject to arbitration hereunder. The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from, or change any of the terms of this Agreement, to change an existing wage rate, or to establish a new wage rate. Should either party fail or refuse to abide by the arbitrator's decision, the prevailing party shall be free to take whatever action it deems necessary, and such action will not be considered in violation of the Agreement.
The arbitrator shall render a decision within 30 days following the final day of the arbitration hearing unless mutually agreed to by both parties. Expenses incident to the services of the arbitrator shall be borne by the losing party. If, in the opinion of the arbitrator, neither party can be considered the losing party, then such expenses shall be apportioned as in the arbitrator's judgment is equitable.
9.03 - GRIEVANCE - MEDIATION
Nothing in this article shall preclude the parties from mutually agreeing to submit any grievance(s) not resolved at Step Three to mediation. The mediation agreement shall provide that:
1.	Within 30 days of the signing of this Agreement the Employer and the Union will jointly request from the United States Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (USFMCS) the
names of 21 qualified mediators. From the list of 21 mediators the employer and the Union
shall alternately strike from the list one name at a time until 11 names remain. This list of mediators shall be used by the parties to select individual mediators. This
does not prohibit the parties from compiling a mutually acceptable list without the assistance of the USFMCS. A member of the arbitration panel may also serve on the mediation panel; however, if mediation does not resolve the dispute(s), the mediator shall not be selected to hear and decide the matter at Step Four.
2.	Neither party shall have more than three persons, including the grievant, present at the mediation.
3.	The taking of oaths and the examination of witnesses shall not be permitted nor shall any written or electronic record of the proceeding be made. There shall be no formal evidentiary rules and the mediator shall decide any questions of procedure or of the admissibility of facts or arguments. Documents and other evidence submitted to the mediator shall be returned to the presenting party at the conclusion of the mediation meetings.
4.	Comments, opinions, admissions and settlement offers of the parties or of the mediator shall be confidential and shall not be admissible or in any manner referred to in any future arbitration, hearing or other matter.
5.	If the grievance(s) remain unresolved at the conclusion of the mediation meeting, the mediator will provide an oral statement to each party regarding how he/she would rule in the case based upon the evidence and argument presented.
