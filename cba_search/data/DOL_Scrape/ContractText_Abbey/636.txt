MEMBERS' RIGHTS
The Court held that an employer's denial of an employee's request that the union steward be present at an investigatory interview, which the employee reasonably believed might result in disciplinary action, constituted a violation of the National Labor Relations Act. This means that an employee has a right to have the union steward present when the employee is being interviewed on a matter which might result in disciplinary action. In the absence of the steward, employees may request any member of the bargaining unit to be present at any investigatory meeting.
The stewards should, therefore, not fear to insist to the employer that they honor the employee's request for representation in such cases. Each steward should advise each member/employee working in the store(s) to request union representation during any employer investigatory interview which could lead to disciplinary action.

Hours credited are those hours actually worked.
Section 3. A regular employee's seniority shall be broken if he quits, if he is discharged for cause, if he fails to report for work for three (3) consecutive work days without notifying the Employer, or if an employee is laid off continuously for twelve (12) months or his length of service, whichever is less.

Lateral bids will not be allowed.
An employee who transfers to a higher classification shall receive the next higher rate from their existing rate in the new classification.

Full-time and part-time employees in each department will be scheduled by job assignment grouping (e.g. cash office, guest services facilitator, service coordinator, guest convenience, paperwork processor, central salvage, order writer, etc.). In the event the work schedule is not believed to be in conformance with an employee's seniority and the other provisions of this Article, the employee shall have until Saturday, 3:00 p.m. to bring the matter to the department manager's attention so that adjustments can be made if needed.

(i)	The employees referenced in Article VIII, Section 2, paragraph (f) will be scheduled according to the requirements of the job assignment but will not be scheduled more total hours than their seniority will allow.
Section 3.	The Employer reserves the right to create new or expand and/or reduce the structure of departments for scheduling purposes as business conditions warrant.
Section 4.	If additional hours which are not on the posted schedules become necessary, these additional hours will be offered in line of seniority within the department and classification first to available full-time employees who are scheduled less than forty (40) hours then to available part-time employees up to forty (40) hours per week subject to the Employer's ability to contact those employees. To be eligible for such additional hours part-time employees must indicate, in writing, their availability for additional hours on a daily basis and submit their written availability for additional hours to the immediate supervisor by 3:00 p.m. on Saturday. It is understood that such additional hours must consist of at least the minimum call-in guarantee to be offered to off-duty employees.

It is understood that employees must be qualified to do the work to be offered any such additional hours.
Section 5.

Section 8.	Employees who are scheduled and report to work shall be guaranteed a minimum of three (3) hours work or pay in lieu thereof. This clause shall not apply when the Employer schedules employees
17
for meetings, but employees will be paid for the time spent in meetings. The Employer may assign any work available.
Section 9.	Overtime. Overtime work will be offered in line of seniority in the department by classification and required in inverse order of seniority in the department by classification to those available at work when such work is required. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Employer's right to require overtime work. Overtime shall not be paid more than once for the same hour of work.
Section 10. All employees are to receive one and one-half (1 1/2) times the regular hourly rate for all hours actually worked over forty (40) hours in any one week or over eight (8) consecutive hours in any one shift but not both.

(a) Holidays - For work performed on a holiday as defined in this Agreement, permanent employees will receive one and one-half (1-1/2) times their basic hourly rate for hours actually worked on the holiday.
Section 12, These provisions shall not apply in circumstances beyond the control of the Employer, such as fire, flood, civil disturbance, power and equipment failure, or acts of God. If an employee is notified not to report before he leaves home, the Employer shall not be required to pay call-in pay. Same applies if the Employer attempts to notify an employee by last phone number or address on Employer records and it is incorrect due to change not recorded by employee.
Section 13, Employees shall perform any work which a manager may direct with the understanding that when an employee is assigned a job with a lesser rate, he will be entitled to his regular rate of pay unless he has been assigned to a lower rated job and desires to retain such job rather than accept layoff. If un employee is assigned to a higher rated job for a period of fifteen (15) minutes or more, he will receive the next higher rate from his existing rate in that higher classification for the time worked in that higher classification that day.

Article X - Employee Benefits
10.1	HEALTH-BENEFIT COVERAGE
A.	The Employer shall make available health coverage to eligible employees, pursuant to such insurance plans and self-insured plans presently in effect or pursuant to any plan the Employer may adopt in the future.
Prior to April 1, 2001, the health coverage plans available and the weekly contribution rates required for such coverage are the plans and the contribution rates in effect prior to this Agreement as defined in the 1996 to 2000 Agreement.
Effective April 1, 2001, the health coverage available to employees will include at least the following health plans:
1.	A Comprehensive Medical Plan including a Preferred Provider Network and Prescription Drug coverage with benefit coverage levels at least equal to those described in this Section 10.1,
2.	A Dental/Optical Plan with benefit coverage levels at least equal to those described in this Section 10.1.
In addition to a Comprehensive Medical Plan, the Employer may make available to employees various other medical plan alternatives such as HMDs, as selected by the Employer, for the purpose of providing a choice of medical plans. The Union will be notified of the alternative medical plans selected by the Employer. Upon request, the Union will be permitted to review the coverage provided by each of the alternative medical plans prior to making participation in such plans available to the employees. The Employer will not offer to employees an alternative medical plan that has not been approved by the Union.
Employees electing coverage under the Comprehensive Medical Plan will have prescription drug coverage as described in subsection 10.IM 3. Employees electing coverage under an alternative medical plan will have prescription drug coverage as provided by the alternative medical plan pursuant to the Employer's coverage contract with that plan; or, at the Employer's discretion, prescription drug coverage will be provided by the Employer as described in subsection 10.IM 3, rather than by the alternative medical plan.
Each employee who participates in health coverage is entitled to receive a Summary Plan Description of the plan(s) elected.
B.	The health benefit plans are provided at the Employer's expense to eligible employees who choose to participate. However, eligible employees who choose to participate must finance a portion of the Employer's expense through pre-tax contributions.

Also, the employee may only begin participation if the employee or the employee and selected eligible dependents are properly enrolled by notifying the Employer on the appropriate form thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date of coverage. This form must be accurately completed including all authorizing signatures in order for the enrollment to be valid and the coverage to be effective.
Additionally, participation will only begin on the planned effective date if the employee is on active status, or has been placed on an approved leave of absence as listed below:
Disability Leave

If coverage is elected for dependents, the employee and dependents must be enrolled in the same plan(s). A part-time employee who is eligible to participate in health coverage may elect coverage for himself only.
E.	The dependents of a full-time employee who are eligible for coverage are the employee's spouse and children. For the purpose of health coverage, eligible dependent children are the employee's unmarried children until the end of the year in which they turn 19 years of age. Additional definition and coverage rules applicable to dependent coverage are contained in and controlled by the Summary Plan Description and Plan Document of the plan elected.
F.	Effective on the date of ratification, regular part-time and full-time employees will become eligible to participate in health coverage as defined in subsections 10.1F I, 2, 3 and 4.

Employees electing coverage from an alternative medical plan will not be covered under the Comprehensive Medical Plan except as provided by subsection 10. IM3, for Prescription Drug coverage.
G.	Each employee eligible for health coverage will have an opportunity each Plan Year (the annual Open Enrollment period in Eebntary) to make an election as to which available health plan and cmployee/dependent coverage category will apply during the next Plan Year (April I through March 31). A new employee can make this election al least thirty (30) days prior to becoming eligible to participate in health coverage, and the election shall apply until the end of the Plan Year (March 31).
The enrollment period for coverage under each of the health plans offered hy the Employer is for one Plan Year beginning on April I and ending on March 31. Coverage will be effective on the first day of the Plan Year (April I) following the Open Enrollment Period.
H,	An employee can revoke an election and make a new election for the remaining portion of the Plan Year only if both the revocation and the new election are on account of and consistent with a change in the family status (e.g., marriage, divorce, death of spouse or child, birth or adoption of a child, loss of other coverage, etc.) and the new election is made within thirty (30) days of the family status change.
I.	Health coverage will terminate as follows:
1.	If an employee fails to make the required pre-tax contributions for health benefits, coverage will terminate as of the last day of the calendar month for which all required pre-tax contributions were made.
2.	If the employee retires and is eligible for a normal or early retirement benefit, health coverage will terminate on the last day of the calendar month prior to the month in which the employee's retirement benefits could begin.
If the employee terminates because of his death, and if he had dependent health coverage, such dependent coverage will terminate on the last day of the calendar month following the month in which the employee died.
If the employee's employment is terminated on any other basis, health coverage will terminate on the last day the employee works prior to such termination of employment. This date will not be extended by any paid days off.
3.	The following rules apply to an employee on an approved leave of absence or layoff who was a participant in a health plan as of the date of the leave or layoff:
25
a.	The Employer contribution to health coverage which is not financed by employee pre-tax contributions shall continue to be made until the end of the month following the month in which the approved leave or layoff begins, provided the employee contributions are made on a timely basis.
b.	If the employee is on an approved leave which qualifies us covered under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Employer contribution described in (a) will continue as required by this Act. The leaves that may qualify as covered under this Act, provided the employee is eligible and entitled to the benefits provided by the Act, are the following:
Disability Leave
Personal Maternity Leave
Family Care Leave
c.	When continuation of Employer contributions for health coverage are no longer required under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the employee may elect coverage at his expense pursuant to the applicable requirements as defined by the 1985 Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA).
d.	If the employee's weekly pre-tax contributions are not made because of an absence of wages during a layoff or leave, the employee may purchase coverage in the plan on an after lax basis.

After the period in which (he Employer contributions arc made as described in (a) and (b), the employee contribution will be the total cost of coverage for the plans elected, as defined under COBRA. This coverage may continue for the duration of the period required by COBRA, provided the employee remains eligible for such coverage as defined by the COBRA law,
J.	An employee on an approved leave of absence or layolT, who has continued his health coverage by paying the full monthly cost in advance or whose coverage has slopped, will be eligible for reinstatement of Employer contributions toward such coverage as of the first day of the calendar month following the day the employee returns to work, so long as the employee is otherwise eligible for such benefits. The employee's pre-tax contributions shall resume as of the first day of the calendar month following the day the employee returns to work.
Pursuant to the FMLA, an employee on a qualified FMLA leave will be provided with health coverage continuation or reinstatement of coverage upon the employee's return to work as required by the Act.
26
K.	Employees must maintain a weekly average of al least twenty-four (24) hours per week to continue health coverage. The required minimum weekly hours average will be determined by taking the total hours paid for actual work, paid days off, holiday pay, jury duly pay, and bereavement pay and dividing these total hours by the number of the employee's active service weeks during the accounting quarter. An active service week is any week for which an employee receives pay as described above.
Employees who do not maintain an average of at least iweniy-four (24) hours per week during two (2) consecutive accounting quarters will be subject to a cancellation of coverage on the last day of the month in which the second consecutive quarter with insufficient hours ends. Employees losing coverage as a result of this provision may become eligible for coverage again on the first day of the month following the completion of an accounting quarter during which the employee has maintained an average of at least twenty-four (24) hours pcr week.

The duration of continuation coverage will also be consistent with the Federal COBRA law,
L.	An employee whose coverage terminates for any reason is to return all Health Benefits Identification cards to the Employer immediately. In addition, if an employee owes the Employer any amount for unpaid employee contributions toward health coverage, for benefits paid in error, or for any other reason, the Employer may deduct such amount owed by the employee from the employee's accrued unpaid wages and benefits.
M.	Effective April 1,2001, the benefit coverage available under the Comprehensive Medical Plan (including Prescription Drug coverage), the Dental/Optical Plan, and the required weekly pre-tax contribution rates for health coverage are set forth in subsections 10,1 M I through 6. Each health benefit plan will operate on the basis of a Plan Year which begins on April J and ends on the following March 31.
1.	Medical Plan Funding / Contribution Requirements
All Medical Plans offered by the Employer will be funded as described in this subsection 10.1M1.
a.	The Comprehensive Medical Plan and Prescription Drug coverage will be funded by the Employer according to ihe cost that is established on the basis of the actual cost experience of previous claims, adjusted by an actuarial projection of future claims and costs, plus administration expenses.
Eligible employees who choose to participate will finance a portion of the established cost through weekly pre-tax contributions. The actual amount of an employee’s contribution will be equal to the percentage of the
27
established cost of the employee / dependent coverage category elected, as listed in the following schedule.
Plan Year	Contribution Requirement
Plan Year 2001 (4/1/2001 - 3/31/2002)	16% of the Established Cost
Plan Year 2002 (4/1/2002-3/31/2003)	17% of the Established Cost
Plan Year 2003 (4/1/2003 - 3/31/2004)	18% of the Established Cost
Plan Year 2004 (4/1/2004-3/31/2005)	20% of the Established Cost
-Plan Year 2005 _ (4/1/2005-3/31/2006) ’	20 % of the Established Cost
b.	When an eligible employee elects coverage under an Alternative Medical Plan, the Employer will fund the Alternative Medical Plan coverage and the Prescription Drug coverage in an amount that is equal to the _ Employer’s portion of the cost for the same employee / dependent coverage election under the Comprehensive Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage. The Employer’s equal dollar funding will apply to all Alternative Medical Plan / Prescription Drug coverage options except as limited by the minimum contribution requirement described in subsection IO.lMl(d), below.
c.	The employee’s contribution to the cost of the Alternative Medical Plan and Prescription Drug coverage elected will be the difference between the Employer funded amount, as described above, and the total cost of the coverage elected. Therefore, if the Alternative Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage is more costly then the Comprehensive Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage, then the employee weekly contribution will be greater for this option. However, if the Alternative Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage is less costly than the Comprehensive Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage, then the employee weekly contribution will be less for this option.
d.	Notwithstanding the above provisions, it is the policy of the Employer that any employee participating in a Medical Plan offered by the Employer shall contribute on a weekly basis to the cost of the coverage of the plan elected. Therefore, no employee participating in a Medical Plan offered by the Employer shall pay less than fifty percent (50%) of the contribution amount required for participation in the Comprehensive Medical Plan with Prescription Drug coverage.
28
e.	The Employer agrees that the methodology used to establish the cost of coverage under the CMP and the Employer’s contribution to the cost of coverage under an Alternative Medical Plan will be in compliance with applicable Federal laws and regulations as described in COBRA, ERISA, IRC, and the HCFA regulations. Although these Federal requirements were written for specific purposes, there exists a common requirement, either stated or implied, that the “applicable premium" will be equal to a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing that coverage.
The union agrees that these are the legal obligations of the Employer and that these requirements provide sufficient assurance that the established cost of the CMP and the Employer's contribution to an Alternative Medical Plan has been determined reasonably.
Each year the Employer establishes costs for each coverage category within the CMP for setting COBRA rates and for bargaining with Alternative Medical Plans (such as HMOs). The Employer will provide the Union with this cost information as early in the year as is practical after these costs have been established. In addition, the Employer will provide the Union with Health Plan enrollment information on a quarterly basis.
2.	Comprehensive Medical Plan (CMP)
The CMP makes available to participants a Preferred Provider Network. When participants use such Preferred Providers (In-Network) for covered services, the benefits payable under the Plan are enhanced according to the “In-Network Payment Formula.” When participants use providers who are not designated as Preferred Providers under the Plan (Out-of-Nctwork), covered services will be paid according to the “Out-of-Network Payment Formula” which provides a lesser benefit. The In-Network and Out-of-Network Payment Formulas and other benefit features are described below.

calculate the employee contribution rate for each coverage category on the basis of the actual monthly cost of the coverage and the Employer contribution amount. Then the monthly contribution amount is converted to a weekly contribution amount, The Employer will set its contribution at an amount that will result in employee contribution rates equal to, or mathematically as close as possible to, the rates listed in the weekly pretax contribution schedule shown above. However, because the computation of these rates are subject to fractional amounts and standard rounding procedures, the weekly pre-tax contribution rates provided in subsection 10.IM 4 could vary by plus or minus (+/-) 3d (3 cents).
