Section 14 On-Call Employees. Maintenance Section craft employees and employees in the Yard classification may be placed on an on-call system; such employees (on-call employees) will carry a pager and are responsible for responding to emergency/unscheduled situations that occur in the refinery.
The on-call employee will respond to the on-call supervisor’s page by calling the telephone number indicated on the pager. If the on-call supervisor’s telephone number indicated on the pager is a long distance call, the employee may submit an itemized telephone bill listing these long distance calls and be reimbursed by the Company.
The on-call employee will respond to any callout from the on-call supervisor; however, the on-call supervisor can request that the on-call employee call the unit/person that initiated the request and determine if the problem may be resolved over the telephone. The on-call employee will then notify the on-call supervisor of his decision only if it is determined that the on-call employee need not respond to the callout. If the situation cannot be resolved by telephone, the on-call employee must respond by coming to the refinery.
The on-call supervisor, when calling the on-call employee will be required to give the following information:
A.	Name of contact requesting callout
B.	Unit requesting callout and telephone number
C.	As much information as possible to describe the needs.
The on-call employee will be responsible for responding during the nonscheduled work hours from Monday 7:30 a.m. until the following Monday 7:30 a.m. or as agreed upon by employees in the classifications on-call.
If the on-call employee has evaluated the situation and, in his opinion, the situation requires on-site assistance (additional support), he will notify the on-call supervisor and detail the situation.
On-call employees will be rotated for purposes of being placed on “on-call” status. In the event, an on-call employee cannot fill his “on-call” obligation,
19
he may arrange a replacement from his classification and notify the on-call supervisor in writing by noon on Friday preceding his “on-call” week of such arrangements and the name of the substitute on-call employee.
Overtime hours worked as a result of the on-call system will not be considered for equalization of overtime purposes under Article Four, Section 1. Overtime hours worked other than as a result of an employee being on-call shall be considered for overtime equalization purposes under Article Four, Section 1.
A record of the on-call rotation will be maintained and an attempt will be made to equalize the rotation by seniority by establishing a cycle determined by annually dividing fifty-two (52) weeks by the number of employees in the classification and allowing each employee (the employee with the most job seniority first) to select a cycle.
Employees in the Yard classification will not be required to be on-call for more than eighteen (18) weeks in a calendar year, except in cases of emergency. Yard employees will only be placed on-call after they have completed ninety (90) days of employment. Yard employees scheduled for on-call will only be called out to assist craft employees or to perform work which they are qualified to perform on their own.
The on-call employee will be responsible for completing and closing out the work order. This includes sign off by the Refinery Shift Supervisor (RSS).
Warehouse materials required to repair equipment will be available through the RSS or on-call supervisor. Appropriate Warehouse procedures must be followed.
If due to an emergency situation, of which the Company is advised, an employee on on-call status for a week is unable to complete his week, the Company will survey the remaining employees in the classification to determine if there is a volunteer replacement. If there is not a volunteer, then the employee with the least job seniority in the craft or Yard classification, whichever is applicable, will be assigned to work, unless that employee is on scheduled vacation or leave.
20
If notification is served on the weekend, employees will not be surveyed and the employee with the least job seniority in the craft or Yard classification, whichever is applicable, will be assigned to work, unless that employee is on scheduled vacation or leave.
The employee who had to be absent due to the emergency will assume the next cycle of the employee who filled in for him for the applicable number of days.
If the on-call employee reports to the refinery, he will be compensated as provided in Article Five, Section 6(b).
Section 15 ERT Training and Pay. Employees represented by the union who participate on the Valero Emergency Response Team will be governed by the Valero Training Standards and the Valero Emergency Response Team Incentive Pay rates as reflected in the attached Exhibit B. The Union understands and acknowledges that an employee’s failure to meet the applicable Valero Emergency Response Team standards will result in rescinding any pay increase applied under the Valero Emergency Response Team Incentive Pay rate.

Changes or amendments of said chart shall not be made except by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union.
In discussing changes to the lines of progression, the Company and Union agree to engage in good faith discussions with a goal of coming to a resolution that meets the business and efficiency needs of the Company while recognizing the interests of the members of the Union. The Company commits that it will begin discussions of any proposed change at least sixty days before the date of the proposed implementation of the change. The Company and the Union further agree that if discussions at the local level are not able to reach resolution, the Union will inform its Business Manager and/or its International Representative
23
and the Company will inform its Vice President of HR Labor Relations and/or Regional Director of HR Refinery Operations in order that these parties may be able to assist in coming to a satisfactory resolution.
It is hereby agreed that if the parties are unable to resolve issues relating to adding, eliminating, modifying and or re-defining lines of progression during the term of this Agreement, that either party may reopen the same upon sixty (60) days written notice delivered to the other party, for the limited purpose of renegotiating matters pertaining to the lines of progression. Upon failure of the parties to agree in such negotiations, within the subsequent sixty (60) day period thereafter, the Company shall have the right to declare impasse and implement its proposal, and either party shall be permitted all lawful recourse, including but not limited to the Union’s right to strike, to support its position. The parties agree that the notice provided herein shall be accepted by all parties as compliance with the notice requirements of any applicable law. It is further understood that neither party will be able to initiate this reopener process prior to July 1, 2011. This Agreement may also be reopened by the mutual agreement of the parties.
As to the Progression and Retrogression Chart in Attachment 10 to the Agreement, The Company and the Union agree that beginning May 31, 2010, there will be four classifications in the Operations Section, save and except for the Lab which shall remain unchanged. The four classifications in the Operations Section outside of the Lab shall be: Chief Operator, Board Operator, Operator, and Relief Operator.
1)	In the Crude/DHDS, FCC, and CFHT lines of progression, the Chief Operators and Relief Operators will keep the same titles and will be paid the Chief Operator and Relief Operator rates respectively. The A Board Operator will be renamed Board Operator and will be paid at the Board Operator rate. In these lines of progression, the B and A- Operators positions will be combined into the new Operator position, with all full time A- and B Operators as of April 30, 2010 being paid the new Operator rate.
24
2)	In the ARU/SRU line of progression, the Chief and Relief Operator classifications will keep the same titles and will be paid the Chief Operator and Relief Operator rates respectively. The A Board Operator will be renamed Board Operator and will be paid the Board Operator rate. The A Operator (Boiler Fireman) position and B Operator position will be combined into a new Operator position and will be paid the Operator rate of pay. However, the four employees employed full time as an A Operator (Boiler Fireman) as of April 30, 2010, will retain the rate of pay received as an A Operator under the collective bargaining agreement expiring on May 10, 2010 so long as they remain in the Operator position and subject to any rate adjustments as otherwise indicated in this Agreement.
3)	In the Plat and Alky lines of progression, the A Board Operator will be renamed a Board Operator and will be paid the Board Operator rate. The Relief Operators will keep the same title and will be paid accordingly. In these lines of progression, the B and A- Operator positions will be combined into the new Operator position, with all full time A- and B Operators being paid the rate for the Operator classification.
4)	In the Product Movement line of progression, the Blender Board Operator will be renamed a Board Operator and will receive the Board Operator rate of pay. The Pumper Gauger and Pumper Loader classifications will be combined into a new Operator classification and will be paid the Operator rate of pay. The Relief Operator will keep the same title and will be paid according to the Relief Operator rate.
5)	In the Polymer Modified Asphalt line of progression, the Truck Dock classification will be renamed Chief Operator and will receive the Chief Operator rate of pay. The PMA Blender classification will be renamed Board Operator and will receive the Board Operator rate of pay. The PMA Loader Operator will be renamed Operator and will receive the Operator rate of pay. The Relief Operator will keep the same title and will be paid according to the Relief Operator rate.
6)	In the Waste Water Treatment Line of Progression, the Waste Water
25
Treatment Operator shall be renamed Board Operator and will receive the Board Operator rate of pay. The Centrifuge Operator will be renamed Operator and will receive the Operator rate of pay. Relief Operators will retain the same title and will be paid according to the Relief Operator rate.
7)	In any of the lines of progression referenced in this section, for an employee to receive the new, higher rates of pay, he must have been employed on a full-time basis in his position as of April 30, 2010. The pay rate for the new Operator classification will be equivalent to that of a former A- Operator, subject to any adjustments reflected in this Agreement. This paragraph is meant to apply only to the initial conversion to the new pay rates and is not meant to limit employees being promoted and receiving the new rate corresponding with their promotion.
The Company will initially organize the Relief Operators on the payroll as of May 1, 2010, except those Yard employees filling an Extended Temporary Vacancy, into five separate pools of Relief Operators. Each pool of Relief Operators will be assigned to no more than two lines of progression, except that one pool of Relief Operators may be assigned to the Product Movement, Polymer Modified Asphalt, and Waste Water Treatment lines of progression. The Company shall have the right to make one change annually in the organization and assignment of relief operators. If business needs require additional changes in a year, the Company will provide reasonable advance notice of the change and seek input from the Union on same. This notice will allow for the consideration of the vacation schedule. While changes may be implemented based on the needs of the business, any such changes will not be intended to disrupt or upset planned vacation for affected Relief Operators. The Company will work with the Union to attempt to minimize the impact on vacation schedules and to find solutions to any vacation scheduling issues, subject to business needs. Any changes made in the organization and assignment of Relief Operators shall be offered to Relief Operators in the order of seniority. If no Relief Operator shall voluntarily accept the chance, the least senior Relief Operator in the line of progression shall be moved. In addition, if a Relief Operator is moved into a different line of progression, he will retain his seniority in his former line of progression.
26
The Company and the Union further agree to modify Article 7, Section 1(b) as follows: Promotions within a line of progression shall be based upon job seniority and qualifications and shall be made in accordance with the lines of progression set forth on the Progression and Retrogression Chart in Attachments 10 and 11. In making such promotion, the employees qualified in the next lower job classification, as indicated on the Progression and Retrogression Chart, shall by seniority be given the opportunity to fill the position. However, in filing the Board Operator position only, the Company will first offer the job to the Chief Operators in that line of progression by seniority. If a Chief Operator accepts the Board Operator position, he will be paid at the Board Operator rate. If no Chief Operator accepts the position, the job will then be offered to the Operators in that line of progression by seniority. In filling Chief Operator positions in a line of progression, Board Operators will be given the opportunity to freeze from taking the Chief Operator position. In all cases except as may be limited above, in the event no qualified employee in the next lower job classification accepts the promotion, the senior employee that is not frozen must take the promotion. An employee who works in the Relief Operator classification shall not freeze. In the new Operator classification, up to two employees shall be allowed to freeze in each line of progression. If in any line of progression there were three (3) employees frozen in the B and/or A- classifications on April 30, 2010, these three employees may continue to freeze, but no additional freezes will be allowed in the Operator job classification in that line of progression until the number of freezes in that line is reduced below two (2). In the new Board Operator and Chief Operator classifications, only one employee shall be allowed to freeze in each job classification in each line of progression.
The Company and the Union also agree to make the following changes to the lines of progression in Attachment 10. The Company will eliminate one (1) post, which equates to four (4) former A- operator employees, in the CFHT line of progression. The Company will add one Chief Operator post, which equates to four (4) employees, to the Platformer line of progression. Despite the post elimination in the CFHT line of progression, Don Cash will be retained as an extra Operator in the CFHT line and will be allowed to maintain his freeze. As a result, the first available Operator position in that line following May 1, 2010 will not be filled or posted for bid. Demotions from the elimination of
27
the A-positions will be handled in the following manner. Jimmy Snodgrass, William Scott, and David Cartwright will be demoted to Relief Operator but will receive the new Operator pay rate. Christopher Mote, Brian Reed and Keith Flatt will be demoted to Relief Operator and will be allowed to remain in that position and receive Relief Operator pay for three months from May 1, 2010. If Mr. Mote, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Flatt are not the successful bidder for another position in these three months, they will be demoted to the Yard but will retain Relief Operator pay for another three months. If these employees are not the successful bidder for another position following this second three month period,they will thereafter receive the appropriate Yard pay rate. In filling the Platformer Chief Operator job, the Company will fill that job and the resultant vacancies under the normal procedures outlined in the Articles of Agreement. However, should Mr. Snodgrass, Mr. Scott, Mr. Cartwright, Mr. Mote, Mr. Reed, or Mr. Flatt bid into any of the vacancies resulting from the creation of the Chief Operator job in the Platformer, this move and this move alone shall not count as these employees’ one allowed bid in a four year period. Similarly, none of the bids associated with the deletion of the A- position in the CFHT unit and creation of the Chief Operator in the Platformer unit described in this paragraph shall be counted as the employee’s one allowed bid in a four year period.
Section 1(b) Promotions Within Line of Progression. Promotions within a line of progression shall be based upon job seniority and qualifications and shall be made in accordance with the lines of progression set forth on the Progression and Retrogression Chart in Attachments 10 and 11. In making such promotion, the employees qualified in the next lower job classification, as indicated on the Progression and Retrogression Chart, shall by seniority be given the opportunity to fill the position. However, in filling the Board Operator position only, the Company will first offer the job to the Chief Operators in that line of progression by seniority. If a Chief Operator accepts the Board Operator position, he will be paid at the Board Operator rate. If no Chief Operator accepts the position, the job will then be offered to the Operators in that line of progression by seniority. In filling Chief Operator positions in a line of progression, Board Operators will be given the opportunity to freeze from taking the Chief Operator position. In all cases except as may be limited above, in the event no qualified employee in the next lower job classification accepts 28
the promotion, the senior employee that is not frozen must take the promotion. An employee who works in the Relief Operator classification shall not freeze. In the new Operator classification, up to two employees shall be allowed to freeze in each line of progression. If in any line of progression there were three (3) employees frozen in the B and/or A- classifications on April 30, 2010, these three (3) employees may continue to freeze, but no additional freezes will be allowed in the Operator job classification in that line of progression until the number of freezes in that line is reduced below two (2). In the new Board Operator and Chief Operator classifications, only one employee shall be allowed to freeze in each job classification in each line of progression.
Section 2(a) Vacancies Within Maintenance and Laboratory. Maintenance Section and Laboratory openings shall be filled based on seniority among those employees bidding for the job who have the qualifications immediately to perform the job. For purposes of this Section, “immediately qualified” means that the employee has completed the requisite training and course work established by the Joint Training Committee. If an employee has completed such requisite training and course work, he shall be given a thirty (30) day orientation period within which to demonstrate his capability to fully perform the job.
Section 2(b) Vacancies Within Operations. Operations Section openings will be filled by employees progressing up the progression set forth in the organizational chart in Attachments 10 and 11. In filling the “Relief Operator” position in each progression, seniority and relative fitness and ability to perform the job shall be the determining factor.
Section 2(c) Vacancies - Lack of Qualified Bidder. If there are no qualified bidders, the Company may fill the opening with a new hire who at least meets the same qualifications established for bargaining unit employees to meet.
Section 3 Posting Vacancy. If there is only one classification, or no employee within a line of progression accepts the promotion, or as a result of a promotion a vacancy continues to exist, such vacancy will be posted within three (3) days of such vacancy on the bulletin board for seven (7) days, during
29
which time all eligible employees interested therein may submit a job bid to the Company. A copy of the notice of vacancy will be furnished the Chairman of the Workers’ Committee.
Section 4(a) Disallowance Of Future Bids. An employee awarded a job by bid shall only be allowed one award within any four (4) year period; whereas an employee who is assigned a job shall not be allowed to bid for a period of one (1) year, except when an employee’s job is eliminated. The four (4) year period for bidding shall be reset for every employee to begin on May 1, 2010 and thereafter every employee shall be able to exercise one bid within a four (4) year period.
If, as a result of bidding for an extended temporary vacancy, an employee holds seniority in a classification, such bid is counted for purposes of determining the “one award” under this Section. If an employee has lost his seniority in a classification in which he filled an extended temporary vacancy, the bid to such classification however, will not be considered as a bid for the purpose of determining the “one award” under this Section.
Section 4(b) Withdrawal Of Bid Prohibited. An employee who bids for a job shall not be permitted to withdraw his bid after the date and time posted for all bids to be received.
Section 5	Posted Vacancy - Impact Of Vacation Or Leave Of Absence.
Any employee on vacation or leave of absence or accrued leave of absence shall be permitted to enter his bid for a job within three (3) days after his return to work.
Section 6 Evaluation Of Qualification For Job. It is recognized by the parties hereto that it is the right, duty, and responsibility of the Company to evaluate fairly the qualifications of an employee, and in doing so, the company will exercise this function without prejudice or discrimination. Consistent with Section 2 of this Article, an Operations employee shall be given a maximum of forty-five (45) training days to qualify for a job that was a result of a promotion or job bid award. If the employee does not qualify, then the employee shall be placed in the Yard job classification or by mutual agreement between the 30
Company and the Union, be allowed to freeze in the job classification before the promotion occurred.
Section 7	Training Opportunity For Next Job InA Line Of Progression.
The Company will provide, insofar as it is practical, equal opportunity for all employees of comparable standing within a given job classification to learn the duties and responsibilities of the next job for which they are to become qualified. For such purposes, the employees may, with the approval of their supervisor, exchange jobs temporarily without affecting plant or progressive seniority or rates of pay.
Section 8	Standing Of Employees In Progression. An employee who has advanced in a line of progression beyond an employee who has failed on a promotion or elected to freeze, shall, for the purpose of promotions, continue to remain ahead of such employee.
Section 9	Demotion by Force Reduction. Demotions required by force reduction shall be in the inverse order of promotions, and the line for demotion determined by reference to the Progression and Retrogression chart. An employee demoted because of force reduction shall carry back to the lower classification all job seniority acquired in the higher classification. If an employee is bumped from a line of progression because of force reduction, he shall retain that line of progression seniority until he relinquishes it by being awarded a job bid.
Section 10	Demotion by Force Reduction - Pay Rate. A permanent employee with a permanent classification who has been permanently demoted to a lower job classification through no fault or choice of his own shall continue to be paid at the same rate as the rate of the higher classification from which demoted for the following number of days, depending on his years of service in the plant, to-wit:
Years of Service	Pay Continuation Period
At least 5 years	10 days
At least 10 years	15 days
At least 15 years	20 days
31
Section 11	New Jobs - Determining Job Status. Any additional equipment, maintenance, manufacturing, or processing hereinafter put into operation in and under the direct supervision of the refinery shall be given definite organizational status before selecting employees to fill jobs thus created. The wage schedule for jobs thus created shall be comparable to the wage schedule for comparable jobs in the plant. In selection of employees for such newly-created jobs in maintenance or a new operating unit, jobs shall be filled by the qualified person in accordance with the bidding procedures stated in this article. If, however, qualified employees are not available at the refinery, the Company may obtain such employees from any other source.
Section 12 New Jobs - Disqualification From. Within thirty (30) days after the start-up of a new unit, an employee having bid into a newly created job with that unit and being disqualified either by the Company or himself, may return to his former job. An employee may return to his former job in the event a new unit should be completely shut down and the operation discontinued within one year of its start-up. In either of the two situations herein above set forth, it is understood that return to a former job means return to the same pay classification and does not entitle an employee to advancement that may have taken place during his absence from his former job.
ARTICLE EIGHT - TEMPORARY VACANCIES
Section 1 Temporary Vacancies - Defined. Temporary vacancies referred to herein shall be all vacancies caused by vacations, sickness, injuries, absence (excused or unexcused), and leaves of absence not expected to last more than thirty (30) days.

The senior qualified employee who was absent when a temporary job was filled hereunder, may upon his return to duty, during the existence of said temporary job, claim the right to be placed in the same, and upon making such claim to his supervisor, he will be substituted in such temporary job as quick as said change can be made without involvement of overtime pay.
Section 3(c) Temporary Vacancies - Use of Yard Employee.

When work is required in the bottom job in a progression line or jobs not in a progression line, the senior qualified yardman on duty shall have first refusal of the job. In either case, in the event of refusal, the next senior qualified man shall have next refusal and so on.
Section 4(c) Extended Temporary Vacancy - Upgrade Opportunity.

Section 4(d) Extended Temporary Vacancy - Job SeniorityAccumulation.

In such Operation and Refined Products Sections, first preference shall be given to the highest job classification in a line of progression; second preference shall be given to the second highest job classification in a line of progression and so on until all employees in the different job classifications in a line of progression have selected vacation. When job seniority is identical, then plant seniority shall govern. Any jobs on the same level on the Progression Chart, even though the job titles are different, shall be considered the same for the purpose of choosing vacations.
Job seniority shall govern preference in selecting vacation in the Laboratory Section. Only one employee assigned to the eight (8) hour day shift may be off on vacation at a time.

In such Laboratory Section, first preference shall be given to the highest job classification in the line of progression; second preference shall be given to the second highest job classification in the line of progression and so on until all employees in the different job classifications in the line of progression have selected vacation.

The temporary vacancy will have been filled under this Agreement’s provisions under the circumstances brought about by the jury duty or legal proceeding requirement. Because of this, the employee reporting for work not later than 1:00 p.m. will be assigned to Maintenance Yardman work at his regular hourly rate of pay.
Section 3	Jury Duty/Legal Proceedings - Services Not Required.

It is only on rare occasions that a prospective juror will be expected to report to the court or sit as a juror on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
On these days when prospective jurors or employees involved in legal proceedings are excused from reporting to the court or when the court is not in session, Article Fifteen does not provide that an employee have a day off with regular pay or that he be assigned to work other than that scheduled had he not been called for jury duty.
Section 4	Jury Duty/Legal Proceedings - Duty to Work Regular Shift/Notice to Supervisor.

Subject to Section 1(b), the benefits which an employee can draw in any given calendar year will not exceed the total number of hours set out for his particular number of years of continuous service, regardless of the number of absences the employee may have in said year due to various non-industrial illnesses or accidents. In other words, the STD benefits set forth do not represent the total that an employee can draw for each separate non-industrial illness or disability, but represents the total benefits which an employee may draw during a calendar year and once they have used the total, they cannot draw any further benefits in that calendar year even though they may have further absences.
Section 3(e) Adjusted Hiring Date. An employee’s “adjusted hiring date” will determine eligibility for STD benefits. For purposes of STD, “adjusted hiring date” means the employee’s last date of hire adjusted for any prior employment with Valero or any entity acquired by or merged with Valero.

In case of a leave of absence granted to an employee, the employee’s STD benefit, if exhausted during a calendar year, will be replenished as of the following January 1 if the employee has returned to work by such date, or upon his return to work for at least one (1) work day, if such return is after January 1.
57

Section 3(i) STD -- Termination of Benefits Due to Quit, Retirement, Termination for Cause. All STD benefits will automatically cease whenever an employee’s seniority terminates due to quit, retirement, or termination for cause, including exceeding the term of a leave of absence provided if an employee is receiving LTD benefits at the time that his seniority terminates, such loss of seniority will not affect his eligibility for continuation of LTD benefits.
Section 3(j) Industrial Accident/STD -- Assignment, Garnishment & Attachment. Unless otherwise required by law, benefits under Section 1(a) or 1(b) will not be subject to assignment pursuant to a legal proceeding, garnishment, attachment or execution. Neither will the Valero Benefits Plan be construed to give an employee the right to be retained in the service of the Company or to obtain benefits under Section 1(a) or 1(b) after separation from service.
Section 3(k) Industrial Accident/STD -- Deductions for Other Compensation. Deductions from benefits will be made for all other compensation paid in connection with disabilities covered by Section 1(a) or 1(b) of this Article except for private insurance policies for which the employee is solely responsible for the premium.

Section 5 Long Term Disability. Eligible employees are covered by the Valero Long Term Disability Plan (“LTD Plan”) provided through the Valero Policies. LTD covers total disability after a waiting period of one-hundred eighty (180) days of continuous absence from work. Under the Valero Policies, the Company provides LTD as a “Base Benefit,” which means it is provided at no cost to an employee, with coverage at 65% of the employee’s monthly “benefit pay” at the time of disability; such benefit continues as long as the employee is disabled, as defined in the LTD Plan, up to age 65. The premium cost of such Plan will be considered taxable income to the employee with the result that, if consistent with the law, when received, the benefit is non-taxable.
LTD benefits will be administered consistent with the Valero LTD Plan.
The Valero LTD Plan is considered voluntary on the part of the Company and may be terminated or modified at any time by the Company, should the Company elect to provide other comparable coverage in-lieu-thereof.
Under the Valero LTD Plan, for the same weeks in which benefits are allowed under the Plan, deductions from benefits will be made for all amounts awarded or paid under Workmen’s Compensation laws, other state laws or federal laws, or any other insured plan paid by the Company.
Section 6 Sick Leave - Light Duty - Temporary Assignment To. The Company and the Union recognize that in cases where employees become physically impaired so that they are temporarily unable to perform their job, it may be desirable to temporarily assign such employees to work which they can perform and which will aid in their rehabilitation. The Company and the Union will attempt to develop a mutually satisfactory basis upon which jobs most suitable for such rehabilitation purposes may be made available to such employees.

ARTICLE TWENTY-SIX - TRAINING

Section 2(a) Training Program - Purpose and Determination of PreQualification. The Company and the Union agree that the training program is intended to provide employees the opportunity to obtain training over an extended course of both classroom and hands-on training to attain the prequalifications established for each Maintenance and Laboratory classification. The Company will initially present to the Union the pre-qualifications for each Maintenance and Laboratory classification, and will negotiate with the Union concerning such pre-qualifications. In the event the Company and Union are unable to agree on such pre-qualification, they will jointly select a facilitator to work with the Company and the Union, and, in the event the Company and the Union are unable to reach agreement with the use of a facilitator, then the facilitator will act as an arbitrator and determine the merits of the disagreement.
Section 2(b) Training Program - Use of Facilitator. The facilitator selected must have knowledge and training in the specific Maintenance craft or Laboratory job for which the pre-qualifications are being established.
If the Company and the Union are unable to agree on a facilitator, each party will select one expert from the Maintenance craft under consideration, and these respective experts will select a third party, with specific knowledge and training in the Maintenance craft, who is a neutral. These three persons will then serve as a panel, with the neutral member empowered to act as the arbitrator.
Section 3	Training Program and Fund-Funding Of. The Company will contribute five cents (.050) per straight-time hour up to a maximum of

forty (40) hours per week per employee to fund the Trust which will be used to provide money for tuition and other training costs associated with the Training Program. Until the training program is established as determined by the Joint Committee, the Company will accrue the five cents (.050) (rather than make a contribution to the Fund) and furnish the Union a report every two (2) months of the amount accrued. Once the program and the Fund are established, the accrued amount will be the initial contribution into the Fund.
Section 4	Training Program - Joint Committee Determination. The Joint Committee will have authority to determine which classes or programs to offer, how many persons to enroll at any one time in such classes and programs, and which facilities to use to furnish such programs and courses. The Company and Union recognize that the value of the training program depends on the availability of openings once an employee completes the courses and programs necessary for pre-qualification, and therefore, recognize that there will be a limited number of enrollees permitted.
Section 5	Training Program - Test Development. Any testing procedure
to be used in determining whether an enrollee passes a particular course or program will be developed by the agency or institution providing the course and program, subject to joint agreement by the Company and Union, and recognizing that confidentiality of the tests is important to the test’s validity.
Section 6	Absence of Pre-Qualified Bidders - Effect of. In the event that an opening occurs in a Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification and there are no pre-qualified bidders and no employees in the Joint Training Program for the Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification, the Company may hire a new employee to fill that opening.
* Refer to attachment 7 dated 11-29-2004
In the event that an opening occurs in a Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification and there are no pre-qualified bidders, but there is an employee(s) in the Joint Training Program who has completed less than 75% of his established curriculum, but who is anticipated will complete 75% of his training program as initially established by the Committee within at least twelve months of
64
the opening being available, the Company may hire a temporary employee to fill that opening for that period and the opening will be held open for the employee in the Training Program for that period of time. If that employee in the Training Program does not complete 75% of the Program within the time period initially established by the Committee, the Company may hire a new employee to fill that opening.
If the Company is employing a temporary employee as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, and an additional opening(s) occurs in that Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification, and there are no pre-qualified employees who bid to fill such opening(s), the Company may offer that opening to the existing temporary employee, and re-fill the temporary opening for the balance of time provided above. The hiring will occur if the number of openings exceeds the number of employees in training.
When an opening occurs, if there is an employee in the Training Program who has completed 75% of his established curriculum, he will be awarded the opening or the position being held by a temporary, regardless of any bidding restrictions as stated in Article Seven, Section 4, subject to the employee continuing his curriculum according to the established time period for completing that curriculum. If such employee having been placed in the Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification fails to complete his training within the time period originally established, he shall be reassigned to the Yard.
A temporary employee provided under this Section will not be covered by the contract while he is in that status; if the temporary employee is hired as a regular employee as provided above, he will begin to accumulate seniority from his date of hire as a regular employee.
If, under the above provisions of this Paragraph 6, a pre-qualified employee bids for a Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification, he will have a thirty (30) day orientation period within which to fully demonstrate his prequalified skills for such job. If he is unable to do so, he will be considered as a disqualified employee and transferred as provided in this Agreement.
An employee in the Training Program who has completed 75% of his
65
curriculum and fills a vacant Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification as provided above, will be paid the Maintenance craft rate or Laboratory classification rate and accumulate job seniority commencing with his transfer to such Maintenance craft or Laboratory position.
Section 7 Training Program - Safeguards for Procedure to Establish. To assure the Union that the Company will not abuse the above procedure by not expeditiously attempting to establish the joint training program, the Company agrees to meet and negotiate with the Union and to use a facilitator/ arbitrator and to reach a resolution of the qualification for the Maintenance craft or Lab position within nine (9) months of the ratification of this Agreement. If an agreement is not reached, all remaining issues will be submitted to binding arbitration within 60 days of the conclusion of such nine (9) months. The arbitrator selected must have expertise in the Maintenance craft or Lab position under consideration and render his decision within 60 days of the commencement of hearing. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator with sufficient expertise, the above procedure for selection of a panel and a neutral arbitrator shall be followed.
Section 8 Training Program - Model for Program and Courses. During the 1996 negotiations, the Company furnished to the Union the type of program and courses which it anticipates will be developed. While the Union has not agreed to this program and courses, it understands that in the negotiations provided in this Article, the Joint Committee will seek a program course similar or equivalent to the program and courses given to the Union during negotiations.
Section 9	Helper Classification Eliminated. As a result of the provisions
of this Article, the Helper classification was eliminated.
Section 10	Training Program - Intent Re: Excess Hiring Of Employees To Avoid Training. During the 1996 negotiations, the Union expressed concern that during the implementation of the Joint Training Program provided in this Article, the Company would hire an excessive number of employees into a Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification(s) and as a result limit future
66
openings for employees through the Joint Training Program. The Company indicated that its intent is not to hire such excess number of Maintenance craft or Laboratory employees. The Company has indicated to the Union that after the reduction in force, that it anticipates the following number of employees in each craft and does not intend to exceed that number:
Instrumentation	9
Electrician	5
Pump Repair	8
Equipment Operator	3
Coded Welder	4
Refinery Maintenance Welder	10
Warehouse	3
Carpenter/Insulator/Painter	1
Lab Tester	3
This paragraph does not in any way limit the Company’s right to determine the number of employees to be employed in any Maintenance craft or Laboratory classification, and the above listing of Maintenance crafts and Laboratory classifications and the number of anticipated employees in them is only made to reflect anticipated staffing for purposes of the Union being able to determine if the Company is overstaffing a Maintenance craft or Laboratory classifications as to preclude employees having available jobs after completing the training program for a particular Maintenance craft or Laboratory position.

Notwithstanding the requirement to adopt the Collective Bargaining Agreement, any successor company shall not be required to continue the existing employee benefits offered in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, but shall be entitled to establish a package of benefits for employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement that are reasonable comparable in the aggregate to those provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. If requested by the Union the successor company shall negotiate with the Union in good faith regarding those benefits. Should an agreement not be reached at the conclusion of any such negotiations, the successor company may proceed with implementation of the proposed benefits plans, and the Union will not have the right to strike.

AGREEMENT RE: CODED WELDERS AND GRIEVANCES REGARDING CODED WELDERS AND IE
TPI Petroleum, Inc. (Ardmore Refinery), and Operating Engineers International Union, and its Local 351, agree as follows:
During the negotiation of their 1996-1999 collective bargaining agreement, Total Petroleum, Inc. (Ardmore) and Operating Engineers Union, Local 670 (now Local 351), negotiated the Refinery Maintenance Welder position and Coded Welder Positions, and Grievance Dated August 11, 1995 (8/95 Grievance), and the two Grievances dated September 21, 1995 (9/95 Grievances) were resolved as follows:
(1)	The classification of Coded Welder was established as a separate line of progression. The qualifications of Coded Welder are attached as Exhibit A to this Letter.
(2)	The Company and Union agree that Herb Belt will be recognized
as a Coded Welder and be considered as retaining line of progression seniority in that classification as of June 6, 1995.
(3)	At the time of this Letter Agreement, the Company, for seven days, posted three Coded Welder vacancies. The employees in the Refinery Welder classification were given priority over other Total employees to bid for such openings. To be a successful bidder for a Coded Welder opening, the employee had to be immediately qualified to perform all Coded Welding work. To establish such immediate qualification, the Company, within seven (7) days after the posting period ends, started to test the applicants to determine their immediate qualification to perform the job. The Coded Welder position was awarded to the three immediately qualified employees with the most line of progression seniority in the Refinery Maintenance classification. For this purpose, Fred Allen was considered as having Refinery Maintenance classification seniority as of February 28, 1995. If Fred Allen was awarded
84
one of the Coded Welder positions, the Company and the Union agree that he need not repeat the qualification test described in this paragraph 3.
(4)	In the event there are future Coded Welder openings, the Company will post, for a period of seven (7) days, such opening(s) for all employee(s) in the Ardmore Refinery to bid. Such employees will be tested to determine their immediate qualification as provided above. In the event there are not sufficient immediately qualified employees to fill the openings, the Company may hire a new employee.
(5)	Employees successfully bidding for the Coded Welder classification will transfer to that classification and line of progression seniority will begin accumulating from the first day on the job, provided that among the initial employees bidding for such jobs, the employee(s) with the most plant seniority was considered the employee with the most line of progression seniority.
(6)	The Company and Union agree that the above Paragraphs 1 through 5 resolve pending grievances 8/95 and 9/95.
(7)	As part of resolving Grievance 8/95, Ronald Glenn will be recognized as having line of progression seniority as of January 19, 1993, and therefore be ranked on the line of progression seniority list ahead of Larry Wood (line of progression seniority May 24, 1993), and Wayne Stewart (line of progression seniority April 18, 1994).

Laboratory Positions
The laboratory will be made up of Lab Technicians assigned to eight (8) hour day shift, Lab Technicians assigned to twelve hour shift, Testers, and Relief Testers. Lab Technicians assigned to eight (8) hour day shift will work an eight (8) hour work schedule, on day shift Monday through Friday. Lab Technicians assigned to Twelve Hour Shift Technicians and Testers will work a four (4) crew, twelve (12) hour work schedule. Relief Testers will work the same twelve (12) hour daylight shifts as Relief Operators on their regular shift. The Relief Tester will be paid eight (8) hours x ABR + 1.5 x four (4) hours x ABR.
The laboratory will be staffed with three (3) Lab Technicians assigned to eight (8) hour day shifts, four (4) Lab Technicians assigned to twelve (12) hour shifts, four (4) Testers and two (2) Relief Testers. Lab Technicians assigned to eight (8) hour day shifts will be on an eight (8) hour shift schedule. Management reserves the right to adjust staffing in the future.
Unscheduled & Scheduled Vacancy Coverage 12-hour Shift Laboratory Employees:
Unscheduled vacancies that occur in the Laboratory during a daylight shift will be filled by the Relief Tester on shift. If that Relief Tester is not available (sick, vacation, etc.) to cover the shift, the supervisor will fill the position per Attachment 9(d). If an unscheduled vacancy occurs in the Laboratory during the night shift, the supervisor will fill the position per Attachment 9(d). The Relief Tester will be paid relief tester pay when he reports on his schedule and is extra.
The primary option for filling scheduled vacancies that occur in Laboratory will be Relief Testers.
89
8-hour Shift Laboratory Employees:
Any eight (8) hour Day Technician vacancy will be covered. The following describes the possible coverage scenarios for Laboratory Day Technician vacancies:
•	Vacancies with Relief Available - Unscheduled vacancies that occur in the Day Technician classification will be filled by the Relief Tester on shift, everyone will step-up one (1) classification. The Shift Technician on duty will cover the Day Technician duties in the knock engine lab (rating, sample analysis,shipping, regularly scheduled maintenance such as oil / filter changes, total nitrogen testing, and plat catalyst analysis) and will not switch to an eight (8) hour shift schedule. Once the duties have been completed, the Shift Technician will assist the Shift Tester who has stepped up to cover their duties. Relief Testers and Shift Testers who have stepped up at the start of the shift under these circumstances will receive step-up pay for the entire shift.
•	Vacancies with no Relief Available, and Shift Technician accepting Overtime - Unscheduled vacancies that occur due to Day Technician vacancies when no Relief Tester is available will be filled according to the Coleman agreement. Overtime will first be offered to the other Day Technicians. If they refuse, a Shift Technician will be called to cover. If accepted that Shift Technician will cover the Day Technician duties in the knock engine lab, as described above, for eight (8) hours. They will have the option to go home, with eight (8) hours of pay, or stay for a total of twelve (12) hours. Once the duties have been completed, the Shift Technician who was called out, may assist the Shift Technician on duty for duration of shift.
•	Vacancies with no Relief Available and Shift Technician not
accepting Overtime - If no Shift Technician accepts the overtime, a Shift Tester will be offered the overtime. If accepted, they will work in the Shift Technician job, and the Shift Technician on duty will step up to cover the Day Technician position as described above. The Shift Tester will have the option to work eight (8) or twelve (12) hours. If working only eight (8)
90
hours, they go home with eight (8) hours pay at step-up rate. The Shift Technician will then step back down to their normal duties. If the Shift Tester chooses to stay twelve (12) hours, the Shift Technician will cover eight (8) hours of Day Technician duties, then four (4) hours assisting the Shift Tester. The Shift Tester will work twelve (12) hours in the Shift Technician job at step-up rate.
•	Vacancies with no Relief Available and Shift Technician, Shift Tester not accepting Overtime - If no Shift Technician or Shift Tester accepts the overtime, a Relief Tester will be offered overtime. Everyone will step up one (1) job classification and cover in the same manner as described above under ‘vacancies with relief available’. The Relief Tester will be paid overtime accordingly.
•	If no Shift Tester, Shift Technician, or Relief Tester accepts overtime the vacancies will be covered by Day Technicians.

AGREEMENT RE: REVISED JOINT TRAINING COMMITTEE AGREEMENT
NOVEMBER 29, 2004
After reconsideration from the Joint Training Committee and a discussion with the Worker’s Committee, the revised proposal is respectfully submitted.
This letter of agreement is to establish a compromise to the contract language on bidding craft maintenance and lab positions. The parties agree to change the requirements in Article 26 Section 6 to allow 50% completion of curriculum which includes written material and testing. Once an opening occurs, the employees that are at 50% will complete the curriculum which includes the remainder of written material and hands-on requirements while on the job, according to the Joint Training Committee’s (JTC) milestones.
Once the employee has accepted the new position, and has been released from his old position, he will be placed in the craft and will be paid at 90% of the rate of the craft until he reaches 100% completion of the curriculum. The Union and the Company will split the wages from this training period for a maximum of one year. The union portion of 50% will come from the JTC money and 50% will come from the Company. If the JTC money is exhausted, the Company will fund the JTC program.
If the successful bidder does not complete the curriculum as established, they will be placed in the yard.
All employees that are 75% or greater at the signing of this agreement will be grandfathered in their respected craft or lab position, for one time only. In other words, each listed employee that chooses not to accept the next bid available to them in their craft will be removed from grandfather status and then compete with employees having completed 50% training in the same craft, under the new language based on seniority, per the contract. In the event the employees
96
listed accept their chosen craft position during the grandfather period, or are awarded a bid after the removal from grandfather status, they will receive 100% of that craft pay.

	James Stevens	1-10-1994
Warehouse	Jackie Miller	11-14-1975
	Bruce Huffman	9-17-1979
It is further agreed to remove all language relating to a time limit, as it pertains to becoming 50% qualified. Due to the recent opening of the training pipeline to all employees, and the proposed language change stated in this letter of agreement, it is agreed that the time constraint on employees prior to becoming 50% qualified serves no purpose.

RULES APPLIED UNDER THE COLEMAN AGREEMENT
1.	The supervisor goes to the Primary and Secondary shifts and looks for volunteers. He will start at the classification that requires coverage. When doing so, he will first offer the overtime to the individual on the Primary shift and then the secondary shift before going down another classification.
2.	The only exception to this is that the second consecutive day vacancy can be filled by either the person on the Primary or Secondary List, whoever did not work the previous day. If this fails, the supervisor will then offer the overtime to the other employee of the same job classification at time and one-half.
3.	If there are no volunteers in that particular classification, the supervisor will look down one classification for an employee willing to step up to fill the position. If there is still no one available, the supervisor will continue to look down, one classification at a time.
4.	If there are no volunteers of equal or lesser classification, the supervisor will look up, one classification at a time for an employee willing to step down to fill the position.
5.	A Mark Off List will be made available for employees to indicate that they would not like to be offered overtime on certain days. An individual on the Mark Off List gives up his first right of refusal of the overtime. If no one can be found on the Primary or Secondary lists in the job classification, step ups, and step downs, the person on the Mark Off List will be given the chance for the overtime before splitting the shift.
Splitting a shift will require the employees involved to work eighteen (18) hours.
6.	If the employees are forced to split a shift, all of the employees in that unit will be notified. After each occurrence of split shifts, the employees will be notified. After the third occurrence in a calendar year, that area may implement an On-Call system developed by the Worker’s Committee and Company.
