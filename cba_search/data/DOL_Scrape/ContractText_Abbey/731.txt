WITHDRAWAL CARD PROCEDURES
All members of Local 1473 who are current in the payment of their monthly dues may request a withdrawal card, in writing, from the Local Union offices. A withdrawal card is necessary whenever your job status changes. This status change could be for illness, resignation, lay-off, termination, leave of absence, or any other reason that would require absence from work. Every time that anyone of the above status changes results in you not working in any one month or more, you may, upon written request, receive the withdrawal card from this Union at no charge.
Failure to request a withdrawal card, in writing from this Union could result in suspension.
Suspension occurs when you become delinquent in payment of your dues for two months and according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Unions’ Constitution and the Local 1473 Bylaws you would have to pay a reinstatement fee and the two months’ delinquent dues. No fees would be required from you if you remember to get a withdrawal card.
GRIEVANCES
To report a grievance, phone, write or contact your union immediately. Give all the facts of the grievance and your union will investigate and adjust the grievance for you.
MEETINGS
Your local union meets regularly and all meeting notices are listed in each issue of the Local’s newsletter, the Local 1473 Union Messenger. You should make every effort to attend each meeting. By attending the meeting you will become informed of the activities of your local union.

KNOW YOUR RIGHTS
YOUR RIGHT AS AN EMPLOYEE TO UNION REPRESENTATION DURING QUESTIONING BY YOUR EMPLOYER
What you say can and will be used against you.
Employees have specific rights when confronted by employers who want to question them for alleged wrongdoing. These rights were developed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Weingarten case in 1975.
As with any rules, there are certain things that it covers, and there are certain things that it does not cover.
A.	Your right is not automatic. YOU MUST ASK FOR IT. Your employer is not under a duty to advise you of your rights.
B.	You have to request the union representation from the person who is doing the questioning, not from your immediate supervisor or your union representative. The questioner must be told that you do not want to proceed without union representation.
C.	You do not have the right to a union representative if the interview is only for the purpose of informing of discipline already decided upon by the employer. However, in that case, you only need to listen, you do not have to answer any further questions by your employer. Further, you can ask for union representation under those circumstances, but the employer is not required to give you union representation.
D.	The rule does not apply to the normal everyday conversations between a supervisor and an employee, which pertains to performance of job duties and normal work performance.
E.	The employer’s rights.
Once you request union representation, your employer has three options:
1.	He can grant your request and bring in a union representative.
2.	He can discontinue the interview and proceed with the employer’s own investigation without your participation.
3.	The employer can offer you the choice of proceeding without union representation.
While an employee may waive the right to union representation, it is highly recommended that an employee not do so. Most of us feel that we are not guilty and that we are adequately able to represent ourselves. However, in the emotionally charged situation where you are being questioned by your employer, it is very possible that you will say things that the employer has no knowledge of which will incriminate you or will cause the employer to undertake a new investigation regarding other conduct.
Local 1473 has prepared an interrogation rights statement for you to present to your employer if you are too nervous or upset to recall your rights.
“I refuse to submit to this questioning because I fear that I may suffer severe discipline or termination of my employment, and 1 demand my right to have a union representative present with me before this proceeding continues, and if my demand is not acknowledged, then I refuse to participate in this process, and you may take whatever action you deem appropriate.”
Keep this card with you and use it at any time you are subjected to an interrogation interview which might lead to discipline.
