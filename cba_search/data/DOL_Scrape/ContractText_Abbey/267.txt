27
Article VII - Section 2
Representative asks to examine a Labor Standard because it is incidentally involved in connection with a grievance involving the appropriateness of an allowance payment or the determination of whether an Employee is entitled to be put on an off standard or downtime basis, the Company will make the necessary data available at the next Step 2 Grievance Meeting. In no event will the Company provide either a recheck or a Comparative Data Sheet for grievances originating in Step 2, and if the grievance actually involved the time values of a Labor Standard or the question of the extent of change from a prior Standard, and a recheck or Comparative Data Sheet is needed, the grievance will be returned for resubmission as a written Grievance in Step 1 (b). In such case, the date the grievance was filed at Step 2 will be considered the date the grievance is resubmitted at Step 1 for purposes of determining eligibility for a retroactive settlement.

Step 3.
Article VII - Section 2 Employee was improper. Such list of Employees must indicate the job classification to which each Employee presumably would have been transferred if the aggrieved Employee had not been improperly transferred. If the grievance to which the list of Employees relates is subsequently resolved in favor of the aggrieved Employee, the Employees on such list may enter written Step 2 Grievances within three (3) workdays after such resolution if each such Employee signs an individual grievance, and if such grievances are ultimately resolved in favor of the Employee, retroactive settlement, if any, may be paid to the date of the original grievance which preceded the filing of the list, but not beyond that date.
If the grievance answer is not satisfactory, an appeal may be filed by the Chief of Assembly/Support Representative within ten (10) workdays after the Department Head's answer has been time-stamped in the Plant Labor Relations Office and placed in the receptacle in the Plant Labor Relations Office for attention of the Chief of Assembly/Support Representative, and if not filed within that time period, it shall be considered settled and not subject to further processing. Such appeal shall be filed in writing with the Company Representative designated to represent the management in this Step. Such appeal shall be made on the Appeal Form provided by the Company. The reasons why the answer of the Department Head was not satisfactory shall be set forth briefly on the Appeal Form.

If the grievance is not settled in Step 3, the matter may be taken up at a meeting between Company Representatives and the Central Grievance Committee. An appeal, on a Form to be provided by the Company, shall be filed, setting forth the reasons why the Step 3 answer was unsatisfactory. Such an appeal must be filed within ten (10) workdays after the answer in Step 3, or the grievance shall be considered settled and not subject to further processing. Such meetings shall be held every other Friday if there are any Fourth-Step Appeals on file, and shall begin at 9:00 A.M. and shall continue until 12:00 Noon; and shall reconvene at 1:30 P.M. and shall continue until 3:30 P.M., unless the meeting terminates earlier because all grievances have been discussed.

Article VIII - Section I
(e) Steam Plant Operators (Plant 2), who, by nature of their duties, are required to work Saturday and/or Sunday, will have normal weekly work schedules of five (5) consecutive days which need not start on Monday and may occur in two plant payroll weeks. The start of the first scheduled day in each plant payroll week will determine the twenty-four (24) hour periods for that payroll week- It is understood that Employees in this group do not qualify for premium payment merely by working on a calendar Saturday or Sunday, but such Employees will be paid tbe applicable premium rate whenever they work on the sixth day (time and one-half) or the seventh day (double time) following their normal five (5) day schedule. It is also understood that no premium shall be paid when an Employee requests to be returned to his normal weekly work schedule after filling in for another Steam Plant Operator who was on vacation. At the time such Employees change shifts, such an Employee may work during the first week on his new shift assignment on the sixth and/or seventh day following the five (5) days of his prior week's schedule, and such an Employee will qualify for sixth and/or seventh day premium pay, but his new shift schedule shaft establish a new weekly work schedule to be used in determining the new sixth and seventh day for the duration of his assignment to the particular shift. An Employee scheduled on a Monday through Friday work week under this paragraph who would otherwise be entitled to receive premium pay on calendar Saturday or Sunday as such, shall not have his weekly work schedule changed to a seven day
42
Article VIII - Section 1 schedule for the sole purpose of avoiding such premium payment for calendar Saturday and Sunday.
This Section shall not be construed as a guarantee of hours per day or per week.
Section 2.	Daily Overtime Compensation. The Company shall have the right to schedule overtime provided that all hours compensated in excess of eight (8) hours within any twenty-four (24) hour period shall be considered daily overtime hours and paid for at the rate of time and one-half. Such twenty-four (24) hour periods shall commence at the Employee's regular shift starting time on his first scheduled work day of each work week. If he is assigned to a different work shift, a new twenty-four (24) hour period will be established commencing at such new starting time. Hours paid as overtime hours within a previously established twenty-four (24) hour period shall not be considered for calculation of overtime hours in the new twenty four (24) hour period. When Employees exchange shifts or starting times for their own persona! convenience, with the agreement of the Supervisor, or when an Employee is transferred to a different classification or shift, as a function of seniority (including such changes resulting from job bidding, transfer, request, interdepartmental requests for transfer, medical placements, etc.) such change shall not require the payment of daily overtime, but when the Company assigns an Employee to a different shift during a workweek, to include downgrades other than medical, the provisions of this Section shall apply. Absences of Union representatives On Union business, either inside or outside the. plant, requested by the President of the Union, where approval of such absence is given by the Company in
43
Article VIII - Section 2 advance, shall be permitted and shall be counted as hours worked in the determination of daily or weekly overtime as set forth above.
Section 3.	Lunch Periods. When Employees are scheduled on one (I) or two (2) or three (3) shifts, Employees on the second shift (day) shall have a thirty (30) minute lunch period, without pay, except where longer lunch periods are established practice. Employees on the third shift (afternoon) or first shift (night) shall have a one-half (1/2) hour lunch period, without pay. However, if it is necessary for the Company to schedule an Employee for only eight (8) continuous hours, the Employee shall have an eighteen (18) minute lunch period, with pay at his hourly rate. It is the intention of the Company to make a reasonable effort to suit the convenience of the Employee in cases where it is necessary to schedule special lunch periods. When the Company assigns an Employee, who normally works on eight (8) hour continuous shifts with a paid lunch period, to a shift with an unpaid lunch period, they shall notify the Employee one (I) day in advance of such change; and if such prior notice is not given, the Employee shall be paid his lunch period allowance, and in addition, if he so requests, he shall be permitted to quit at his regular quitting time if such quitting time is earlier than the quitting time of the shift to which he has been assigned. The lunch periods, either paid or unpaid, of Employees need not necessarily coincide with the lunch periods of other Employees on the same shift, as the Company reserves the right to schedule individual lunch periods so as to meet production requirements.
Unpaid lunch periods shall start no earlier than the end of tite fourth hour of an Employee's regular starting
Article Vin - Section 3 time and no later than one hour thereafter. When it is necessary for the Company to schedule an Employee's lunch period at a time other than that specified above, he shall be notified as soon as practicable, and shall be permitted an eighteen (18) minute paid lunch period on that day only, which, whenever practicable, shall be uninterrupted, unless the Employee voluntarily requests that he be granted a thirty (30) minute unpaid lunch period instead of an eighteen (18) minute paid lunch period.
Where an Employee who normally observes a thirty (30) minute unpaid lunch period qualifies for an eighteen (18) minute paid lunch period, he may be idle for the remaining portion of a regular thirty (30) minute unpaid lunch period.
The Company will not require an Employee to punch out early at the end of his shift solely to avoid the overtime premium payment which would otherwise apply because the Employee has qualified for an eighteen (18) minute paid lunch period.
Employees shall be permitted to leave their work area and/or the Company premises during lunch periods, both paid and unpaid; but it is necessary, as in the case of the Steam Plant Operators and other operations requiring continuous observation to require such an Employee who qualifies for an eighteen (18) minute paid lunch period to remain in his work area and where necessary, interrupt his paid lunch period to attend to his work station assignment. Except as otherwise provided, Employees shall not perform any work during their lunch periods.

Article Vin - Section 4
Section 4.	Week End Overtime.
(a)	Saturday Overtime. The Company will pay time and one-half to Employees scheduled to work on Saturday, except Employees as set forth in Section 1 (e) of this Article.
(b)	Sunday overtime. Daily overtime at the rate of double time will be paid for all hours worked on Sunday, except for Employees as set forth in Section 1 (e) of this Article, who, by the nature of their duties, are required to work Saturday and/or Sunday and who have normal weekly work schedules of five (5) consecutive days, which need not start on Monday.
(c)	For the purpose of computing premium pay on Saturday and Sunday, as provided in Paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the Saturday and Sunday shall be die calendar day except:
(i)	for Employees whose regular shift starting time extends into the beginning of the calendar Saturday or Sunday by not more than one (1) hour, the Saturday or Sunday under this Section shall be the twenty-four (24) hour period beginning one (1) hour after the start of the calendar Saturday or Sunday, provided that when an Employee works beyond such one hour limit, all hours worked by him after Midnight of that day shall fall outside this exception and be paid for on a calendar day basis; and
46
Article VIII - Section 4
(ii)	for Employees whose regular shift starting time begins not more than one (1) hour prior to the beginning of the calendar Saturday or Sunday, the Saturday or Sunday under this Section shall be the twenty-four (24) hour period beginning one (1) hour before the start of the calendar Saturday or Sunday, provided that when an Employee is called in early on a shift that starts Saturday or Sunday night and he Starts work prior to 11:00 p.m. on such Saturday or Sunday, all hours worked by him prior to Midnight of that day shall fall outside this exception and be paid for on a calendar day basis.
Section 5.	No Pyramiding Of Premiums. An Employee shall receive either daily overtime or weekly overtime under Sections 2 and 4, whichever is greater, but not both, and shall receive the highest premium applicable during the same hours worked under Section 2,4, and 7.
Section 6.	Distribution Of Opportunities To Work Overtime. Opportunities to work daily and weekly over-lime and to extra work in short workweeks shall be distributed according to the following rules:
(a)	Employees in each department who are working on the same shift, and who would normally divide overtime, shall be placed in groups which will be identified on the Overtime Group List, Opportunities to work overtime will be distributed equitably among the employees in each overtime group.
47
Article VIII - Section 6.
(b)	Overtime records shall be kept within the Department Office for each overtime group in the department, which will establish any differential in overtime distribution among the Employees within the group. These overtime records will be made available for inspection by the Employees involved and the Union Representatives.
(c)	When any Employee within an overtime group achieves an excess of twelve (12) or more charged hours of overtime in excess of any other Employee in the same group, such other Employee may file a written notice with the Department Head, to the effect that one (1) or more Employees in the group are twelve (12) or more charged hours of overtime in excess. Such a notice must be signed by one (1) Employee, and must be filed prior to the end of the shift during which the overtime assignment, which would result in the further unbalance, was scheduled.
If, following the receipt of such notice, an Employee who is twelve (12) or more hours in excess of the aggrieved Employee who signed the notice is permitted to work overtime without clearly justifiable reasons, the Company shall pay to the aggrieved Employee, who signed the notice, the eamings that the Employee who was in excess and who was permitted to work earned during such period. Such payment shall be charged as overtime worked. 1 fatty such notice is filed, it shall become cancelled and shall have no effect when no Employees in the group have twelve (12) or more hours in excess of the aggrieved Employee. If more than one (1) such notice is on file and an error m scheduling over-
49
Article Vin - Section 6 time occurs, the Employee with the lowest over* time credits, who had a notice on file, will be paid the earnings received by the Employees improperly scheduled. If several Employees filing such notice have equal overtime credits, the penalty payment will be divided among them. This paragraph shall not prevent the Company from scheduling groups of Employees, working in the skilled trades classifications, and Employees who normally work with them, such as truckers and laborers, for Saturday and then Sunday overtime, even though the Sunday assignment may be after an unbalance of twelve (12) or more charged hours has been created.
(d)	When all Employees working in an overtime group on a particular day have been scheduled to work overtime and the Company desires to schedule additional Employees to perform such work, such additional Employees from the Department shall first be scheduled and then, if necessary, Employees from outside the Department, and the overtime charged to the overtime record of such Employees so scheduled. So far as is practicable, the Company will endeavor to schedule such additional Employees who have the least amount of overtime credit in their own overtime group, except as otherwise provided in (g) of this Section. If the Company schedules an Employee on a daily overtime basis to perform work normally performed by Employees in another overtime group, and all Employees in such other overtime group have not been scheduled, and the Company cannot show a reasonable justification for such scheduling, the Employee with the least amount of charged hours in the group which normally performs such work
49
I
Article VHI - Section 6
may file a grievance, asking for payment as set forth in Subparagraph (c) above.
(e)	When weekend overtime is scheduled* the Employee with the least amount of overtime in the parallel groups on different shifts will be scheduled for such work, unless such schedule requires the Employee to work sixteen (16) consecutive hours or unless such schedule requires the Employee to work an unreasonably long period of time, which is not a consecutive period, and there is less than five (5) hours between the start of the weekend overtime assignment and the completion of his prior work assignment. (If the work on fixed shifts is different* the groups will be regarded as nonparallel groups.) Where it is found that an excess number of Employees in an overtime group have been scheduled for weekend overtime (more than the number found to be actually needed in that overtime group), such excess Employees may perform work normally performed by Employees in other overtime groups for the first four (4) hours of the overtime assignment to satisfy the reporting pay requirements.
At the end of such four (4) hour period, the excess Employees shall be scheduled off. This provision is not to be construed to prohibit the assignment of an Employee intermittently during the entire shift to work of another overtime group. Neither is it to be construed to permit the Company to violate the intent of this Section by assigning an Employee to work of another overtime group for Substantial and uninterrupted periods when it is clearly evident that an Employee from the other overtime group should have and could have been
SO
51
Article VllI - Section 6 scheduled. Violations of this subparagraph may be processed through the Grievance Procedure requesting payment to the aggrieved Employee, as defined in Article VIII, Section 6 (c).
(f)	Hours will be charged as time and one-half hours or double-time hours on the assumption that the Employee qualified for the maximum possible premium during such hours. It is specifically understood that straight-time hours assigned as extra work tti a short work week will not be charged in the overtime records.
Where overtime work is offered an Employee, but the Employee is excused or fails to report, or where overtime would have been offered to an Employee who is absent, such hours shall be charged in maintaining these differential records. Where several Employees have equal number of overtime hours, an Employee in such group who is absent will not be scheduled for overtime if the remaining Employees with the equal number of overtime hours are sufficient to perform the work. When an Employee is excused from scheduled overtime and is charged with the hours scheduled, and the scheduled overtime is subsequently cancelled, he shall not be charged with such hours. When an Employee has been excused from scheduled overtime, he shall not subsequently be required to report for the overtime assignment, except in case of an emergency. If the original overtime assignment from which such an Employee has been excused is rescheduled, or if a new overtime assignment is scheduled, to begin at a time more than eight (ft) hours removed from
Article V1H - Section 6
the starting time of the overtime assignment from which the Employee has been excused, such excused Employee shall be reconsidered for the rescheduling of the new overtime assignment.
(g)	Work performed by an Employee on a temporary basis in a classification other than his regular classification is to be credited as overtime worked within the group in which the Employee regularly balances overtime, and where an Employee is scheduled for overtime in his regular classification, and incidentally does work outside his classification, the total period of overtime shall be credited as overtime worked in the group in which such Employee regularly balances overtime. If an Employee is temporarily assigned during straight-time hours to work which is not covered by his regular overtime group and by virtue of such assignment works overtime that day as provided for in Subparagraph (d) above, and if the resulting overtime hours credited to his regular overtime group causes him to exceed the normal out-of balance limits established in Subparagraph (c) above, no claim of unfair overtime balance can be filed in such a case. Where less than an entire overtime group is scheduled for an overtime assignment, a list of the Employees scheduled for such assignment shall be posted on the departmental bulletin board. Where possible, such list shall be posted in advance of the start of the overtime or as soon thereafter as practicable.
(h)	When an Employee is permanently transferred into another overtime group, and is scheduled to
52
Ankle VIII - Section 6 begin work in such group, he shall automatically be credited with the bargaining unit overtime granted up to that date to die Employee with the most bargaining unit overtime in the new group. When an Employee is returned to an overtime group, after having been classified in an out-of-unit classification for 45 days or less, he shall be credited with overtime credits which he had, when he left the group, plus credits for overtime which he worked while classified in an out-of-unit classification. When an employee is retunfed to an overtime group after having been classified in an out-of-unit classification for more than 45 consecutive days, he shall be credited with the overtime granted up to that date to the employee with the most overtime in the group.
(i)	All hours worked or paid as a result of call-in pay assignments will be charged to the overtime records maintained in each department. These hours will be charged at the applicable straight-time or premium rate, as defined in Subparagraph (b) above. When an Employee is offered call-in work and requests to be excused from such assignment, he will be charged with the same hours as the Employee who works such call-in assignment. When call-in pay assignments are of an emergency nature, as defined below, the Company shall be free to call any qualified Employee without regard to the overtime lists, or the amount of overtime previously assigned to that Employee or any other Employee. The Company shall not under any conditions be required to pay any other Employee, under the provisions of this Article and Section, when such
53
Article VllI - Section 6
call-in assignments result because of an emergency situation.
When such call-in assignment results from other than an emergency situation, as defined below, the Company shall be required to follow the procedures set forth under this Article and Section with respect to the distribution of overtime, and shall be subject to the payment procedure described in Subparagraph (c) above when such payment is warranted. The phrase "emergency situation", as used in this Article and Section, shall mean any situation in which the Company representatives, having decided to make call-in work assignments are faced with an insufficient amount of time to consult die overtime records and to cal) Employees in order of their positions on the overtime lists. No other consideration shall determine whether or not the situation is An "emergency situation". 'The sole determinant shall be the amount of time available to Company representatives when the decision has been made to call in Employees for such work assignments.
(j)	While an Employee is absent on vacation, or excused absence days in conjunction with such vacation, or is absent for five (5) or more consecutive vacation days, excused absence days, or combination thereof, he shall not be charged with overtime which he presumably would otherwise have worked. Overtime worked taking inventory or during vacation shutdowns or generated by work during lunch periods, shall be entered in the overtime records, but it is specifically understood that, in the scheduling of such overtime, the
54
Article VIII - Section 6 Company will not be required to consult the over-time records, nor will any grievance be processed because, as a result of such overtime assignment, an Employee has achieved an excess of twelve (12) or more hours over another Employee within the same overtime group, even though such other Employee may have a written notice on file as set forth in Subparagraph (c) above.
t
(k)	During periods of overtime, if neither the Chief of Assentfjly/Support Representative nor the applicable Area Representative is entitled to be working, and five (5) or more Employees represented by the same Steward are scheduled for overtime, the Steward shall be one of such group if qualified to perform the work available. If five (5) or more Employees within one department (or within the "various areas" referred to in Article VI, Section 7) are scheduled for overtime, and are not represented by any Line Steward because they are on the day shift, and neither the Chief of Asscmbly/Support Representative nor the applicable Area Representative is entitled to be working, the Department Steward shall be one of such group if qualified to perform the work available. If any Steward, entitled to an overtime assignment as noted above, asks to be excused, no Steward need be scheduled. This provision will not be used to require the Company to schedule more than one (1) Steward at a time, provided that the Company will recognize any Steward who is scheduled as the representative of all Employees within the department who are then working. If the Company fails to schedule a Steward as set forth above, the Company shall pay to the Steward who ought to have been sched-
55
Article VIII - Section 6
tiled (he applicable overtime rate for the number of hours which he would have worked had he been scheduled. If a Steward fails to report for such scheduled overtime, the Company shall be deemed to have met the requirements of this Section, and no penally payment shall be made to any Steward.
(1)
Employees who are scheduled for overtime work because they are serving as Stewards, actually working as Leadworker, participating in training courses, or because they have had their starting time changed in the middle of a workweek, shall have such overtime noted on the overtime records, but it shall not be accumulated, nor shall it be the basis for a grievance alleging improper distribution of available overtime.
(m)
When less than the full complement of the Employees within an overtime group is required for an overtime assignment and where there are sufficient Employees within the overtime group available who wish to work overtime. Employees who do not wish to work overtime will be excused from doing so insofar as practicable.
(n)
Except in the case of an emergency, or unforeseen circumstances, a scheduled weekend overtime assignment shall be voluntary unless the notice of such assignment is posted by 3:30 P.M. the Thursday immediately preceding such weekend, and in the case of daily overtime, the Employee must be notified of the daily overtime assignment by the end of the work shift on the day preceding the overtime assignment.

In some circumstances, the work activity may require fixed shifts (Plant 2 Porcelain Department). Additionally, Employees working on parallel jobs cm different shifts may agree in writing with the Department Head to work fixed shifts. If a change is made in the hours of any shift, the Company will notify the Union of such change.
An Employee whose job duties are for any reason confined to the first or third shift and who is able to perform a parallel job on other shifts shall not be fixed, provided he is qualified to perfbrm the same or substantially similar job duties on such other shifts that are within his Supervisor’s jurisdiction. Such Employee shall rotate shifts with the junior Employee and with those Employees who are in rotation with the junior Employee. Where a classification under a Supervisor's jurisdiction does not have a sufficient number of Employees to permit rotation as provided above, the junior Employee in the classification in the Department and those Employees who are in rotation with the junior Employee shall rotate with the Employee whose job duties are for any reason confined to the first or third shift (e.g. Relief Operator opposite those Union Officers listed in Article VI, Section 13).

A second shift Employee will not be paid for time lost from any portion of his scheduled work shift when he might reasonably be expected to have worked for an uninterrupted period of al leasf four (4) hours and he fails to do so. If an Employee on the first shift is required to serve on Jury Duty for at least four (4) hours in one (1) day, he shall not be required to work his scheduled shift the immediate following calendar day. An Employee on the first shift may be excused up to one (1) hour prior to the end of the shift if he is scheduled to report for Jury Service on that day. If an Employee on the third shift is required to serve on Jury Duty for at least four (4) hours in one day, he shall not be required to work his scheduled shift the evening of the day of such Jury Duty.
Section 12.	Bereavement Pay. In the event of a death in an Employee's immediate family (defined for this pur
pose as: current spouse; parent; child; grandparent; grandchild; brother; sister; current spouse of brother or sister; current spouse of son or daughter; current spouse's parents, brother or sister or current spouse of such brother or sister) an Employee on request, will be excused up to a maximum of three (3) regularly scheduled days of work during the period beginning with the dare of death and ending three (3) calendar days following the funeral, provided he attends the funeral. The Company shall pay each Employee at his hourly base rate (including the applicable Cost-Of-Ijving Allowance) up to eight (8) hours a day for each day of such absence up to a maximum of three (3) days.
Article VIH - Section 12
In the event of the death of a grandparent of an Employee's cunent spouse, the paid absence under this Section shall be limited to one (1) day, for the purpose of attending the funeral. An Employee working the first shift may be paid for an absence under this Section either the day of or the day following the funeral.
ARTICLE IX
WAGES
Section I.	Wage Schedules. Wage rates are set forth in Wage Schedules attached hereto and made a part here of.
Section 2.	Establishment Of New Hourly And Incentive Base Rates. The hourly and incentive base rates for new or changed job classifications shall be established by the Company by comparing factors of the job content of the work involved in such job classification with the work involved in other job classifications for which rates have already been established, so that the rate for such job classification will be in relation to and compatible with the existing structure. The Chief of Assembly/Support Representative of the Plant in which such job classification is located shall be provided with a job description, the factor point values, the applicable wage rate, and Wage Group of such job classification. Where there is a change in the work content of a job classification. the job description shall be revised, but the Wage Group rating of the classification shall not be changed, unless the total factor points resulting from one or more changes in the degree ratings exceed an increase or decrease of at least twelve (12) points and the total of
65
Article IX - Section 2
such factor points is within the factor point range of a different Wage Group. If the degree rating changes do not equal an increase or decrease of twelve (12) points, they shall be noted on the Evaluation Sheet, with the date of such changes, and will be accumulated into the calculation of the total factor point changes in connection with a future work content change, provided, however, if any given change in work content results in twelve (12) or more points of change and the total points fall in another Wage Group, the prior noted point changes shall not prevent the Wage Group change from occurring. The Rate Representative shall have the nght, upon request, to discuss the factor point value assigned new or changed job classifications or changes in the work content of an established job classification which would affect the evaluated rating of the classification with representatives of the Job Evaluation Section of the Human Resources Department, and may, after discussion, file a written grievance in the Second Step of the Grievance Procedure challenging the correctness of the Company’s evaluation of the factors, and such grievance may be processed through the Grievance Procedure. Such grievance, however, must define the alleged error in the Company's evaluation of the several factors. Such grievance, to be considered in the Grievance Procedure, must be filed within thirty (SO) calendar days after notification to the Chief of Assembiy/Support Representative of the evaluation of such job classification, or within thirty (SO) calendar days after an Employee has been first assigned to work in such job classification, whichever is longer, if no such grievance is filed within such applicable thirty (30) calendar day period, the rate will not be subject to review under the Grievance Procedure.

Article IX - Section 3
Section 3,	New Employee Rate. Employees hired on or after June 1, 1995 (excluding apprenticable skilled trades classifications) will be compensated at a rate which is 70% of the applicable incentive base rate or hourly rate including 70% of the applicable COLA and will increase 5% after each six month period during the first 36 months of employment. (Reference Exhibit C Wage Structure Tables).

Section 4.	Night Shift Premium. All Employees on the first (Night) shift shall, for hours worked on that shift, receive twenty-five cents (25tf) per hour in addition to their regular pay, and all Employees on the third (Afternoon) shift shall, for hours worked on that shift, receive twenty cents (20jf) per hour in addition to their regular pay. An Employee scheduled on a shift which docs not precisely duplicate the hours of normal shifts will be paid the shift premium, if any, for his entire shift which attaches to the shift upon which he is scheduled for fifty percent (50%) or more of his straight-time hours. Pay for overtime hours worked by any Employee shall include the shift premium, if any, which was applicable to the straight-time shift on which he commenced to work that day, unless he works four (4) or more hours of such overtime hours, in which case the shift premium, if any, for such overtime hours shall be that which attaches to the shift during which his overtime hours were worked or the shift premium which attaches to his straight-time hours, whichever is the greater. Only for the purpose of identifying the shifts for the application of this Section, the first (Night) shift shall be between 12:00 Midnight and 8:00 AM; the second (Day) shift shall be between 8:00 A.M, and 4:00 RM.; and the third (Afternoon) shift shall be between 4:00 P.M. and 12:00 Midnight.

Article IX * Section 5
Section S.	Temporary Assignment Outside An Employee's Classification. An Employee temporarily assigned to work in a lower rated classification shall be compensated at his regular rate. An Employee temporarily assigned to a higher rated classification shall be compensated at the rate of such higher rated classification, To qualify for the rate of the higher rated classification, the duties to which the Employee is assigned must be the principal duties of the higher rated classification.
Section 6.	Rates On Permanent Transfers.
(a)	An Employee transferred to another job classification will be paid at the rate of such other classification, except during his probationary period of employment in which case his rate shall be as set forth in Section 3 of this Article.
(b)	An Employee transferred into a job classification which has a long-step-rate schedule will be allowed step rate credits in accordance with his experience and ability, as determined by the Company. He will qualify for step-rate adjustments in such classification as set forth in the Wage Schedule, using the date of his transfer as the beginning of the applicable step-rate period; provided, an Employee returning to his former long-step-rate classification within twelve (12) months after he left such classification shall qualify for the same step-rate position, or portion thereof, he occupied at the time of his leaving such classification.
Section 7.	Establishment Of Labor Standards. The Company and the Union, being firmly committed to the
68

i
Article IX - Section 7 principle that high wages can result only from high productivity, agree that the Company will establish Labor Standards that:
(a)
(b)
(d)
(e)
Are fair and equitable to both the Company and the workers; and

Are based on the working capacity of a normally qualified worker property motivated and working at an incentive pace; and
Give clue consideration to the quality of workmanship and product required; and
Provide proper allowances for fatigue, personal time, and norma! delays, and
Provide for payment of incentive workers based on the earned hours produced on standard (except when such Employees are working on a Preliminary Estimate, etc), and for each one percent (1%) increase in acceptable production over standard, such workers shall receive a one percent (1%) increase in pay over the applicable incentive rate.
The Company will, at its discretion as to the time and as to jobs to be placed on, or removed from incentive, continue the eamed-hour incentive system now in effect, and extend it to jobs in such other job classifications which, in the opinion-of the Company, can properly be placed on incentive, with the objective of increasing productivity and providing an opportunity for workers to enjoy higher earnings thus made possible. The
69
Article IX - Section 7
plan shall be maintained in accordance with the following principles:
■tr
(1) Permanent direct and indirect Labor Standards are to be set, after study by the Industrial Engineering Department, and Standards shall be expressed in terms of standard hours per unit of output, and are to be computed from the normal minimum work time for a given job, plus proper allowances for personal time, fatigue, and normal delays, plus an allowance for incentive opportunity of eighteen percent (18%) for manual work elements, and eighteen percent (18%) for net machine observation time. It is expressly understood that where changes in job conditions are made to require manual activity in place of machine observation time, that such activity can be added, without establishing a Labor Standard which is higher than the prior Labor Standard, until the observation time in the prior Labor Standard is used up. U is the intent of the Company to provide in the Labor Standards, an opportunity for normally qualified Employees, properly, motivated and working at an incentive pace, to achieve the calculated premium level, provided, however, that the Company does not guarantee that every Employee will achieve such level. The Company will not limit the earnings of Employees who, by extraordinary ability or exceptional effort, achieve more than anticipated production, provided:
(I)	Thal the methods specified in the Labor Standard are being followed.
it.
70
b!
&
Article IX - Section 7	jjl
(2)	That machine feeds and speeds, convey-	"4
or speeds, process cycles, etc., taken into	Si
account when the Labor Standard was	B
established, are being maintained.	a
(3)	That the quality Level and safety require-	I
merits on which the Labor Standard is	I
based are being maintained.	I
(g)	The rate of such Employee shall be the applicable	I
incentive base rate. Such rate shall be his base	I
rate f8r all standard hours produced and for the	I
minimum earnings guarantee on incentive work,	I
as set forth in Section Id of this Article. The pre-	I
mium earned by an Employee, working either	|
individually or in a group shall be directly pro-	]
portionatc to his or the group's rate of production over standard. Earnings on incentive work shall	।
be computed from the standard hours produced multiplied by the Employee’s incentive base rate.
(h)	No incentive pay will be allowed an Employee or a group for scrap or defective parts caused by the Employee or the group when more work must be added to render the parts acceptable for use. When an Employee or group makes defective parts and is required to sort or repair them, the time required to sort or repair them shall be computed with the time during which the defective parts were made, even if these times fell in different days.
(i)	A prior Labor Standard on assembly lines will apply when the production level has been changed and then returns to the prior level, except
71
i
Article IX • Section 7
that the prior Standard will not apply if a definite change of method has been made as provided in (j) below. In such a case, die Standard change will apply only to the affected elements as provided in (1) below.
Permanent direct or indirect Labor Standards, as established by the Industrial Engineering Department, shall remain in effect for the duration of this Agreement, unless they are, or become, inapplicable because of arithmetical or clerical errors, or because of changes in job conditions, resulting from changes in equipment, methods, materials, quality standards, production levels, and machine speeds or feeds, which substantially affect the Standard (including an individual Standard which is part of a Group Standard). An accumulation of minor changes of this type, over a period of time, may, in total, substantially affect the Standard. Changes which substantially affect a Labor Standard are defined as changes or an accumulation of minor changes which increase the Labor Standard time value by two percent (2%) or more, or which decrease the Labor Standard time value by five percent (5%) or more. In such case, a new Labor Standard will be established to take account of such change or changes, and time allowances or disallowances may be applied to the existing Labor Standard until a new Labor Standard is issued, or until the original conditions are restored, making the original Standard applicable. If changes which affect a Labor Standard by less than the percentages set forth above are observed, no new Standard shah be established, but the change (and percentage
72
1
(k)
Article IX - Section 7
effect) will be noted on the Labor Standard and taken into account if future additional changes make the total change in the Labor Standard time value exceed the percentages set forth above.
A description of type and location of tools. equipment, slock, etc., and method prescribed on the job to which the Standard applies, shall be available for inspection by any Employee assigned to the job or his Area Representative. If a question arises concerning a methods change, the Area Representative shall have the right to compare this description with the methods actually in use, by observing the job in operation. If a Step 1 "Grievance On A Labor Standard" is filed, claiming noncompliance with this provision, a Comparative Data Sheet shall be prepared by die Industrial Engineering Department, showing the changes made in the job.
(1) A new Standard for a changed job shall be related to the prior Standard (the Standard in which the time value for the element in question was established), in that only the new time values for the elements of work affected by the change may be incorporated into the calculation of the new Standard, and the time values for elements which have not been affected by a change shall be carried forward from the prior Standard (the Standard in which the time value for the unchanged element was established). If a Step I "Grievance On A Labor Standard" is filed, claiming non compliance with this provision, a Comparative Data Sheet shall be prepared by die
73
Article IX - Section 7
Industrial Engineering Department showing the elements and their time values before and after the change. To the extent possible, such elements shall have the same break points.
The Rate Representative shall also have a tight to examine the prior Standard (or series of prior Standards) if the time values for elements in question were not established in the most recent Standard, but were carried forward from an earlier Standard.
When an Employee is able to change an elemental manual method as set forth in a Labor Standard solely because of extraordinary physical ability or skill, without adversely affecting the quality of the work or the safety of the job being performed, or without using tools, machinery, or equipment in an unacceptable manner, and the changed method cannot be performed by a normally qualified operator, the Company will not modify the existing elemental description or related time value because of that change in the manual method.
(tn) If a group of Employees works on a Labor Standard, and the time required to perform the operation is controlled by a bottleneck, either in or outside the group, and the bottleneck time can be reduced by a methods change or changes in the amount of work required by individuals in the group, each member of (he group will be required to meet the new output, based on the new bottleneck time. Before the Company time studies any job and makes a record of such study, the worker
74
iSI
Article IX - Section 7 on the job shall be notified that the study is about to be made.
(n)
Long Cycle Assembly Group Coordination Allowances. Long cycle assembly groups requiring more than the normal coordination between operators will be provided coordination allowances in the Labor Standard which will be in addition to the appropriate allowances for personal time, fatigue, and normal delays and will be related to the manual work content (TWT) of the bottleneck operations.
The following coordination allowances will be used in calculating the group Labor Standard in the event of a bottleneck TWT:
Coordination Allowance 2 1/2% 3% 3 3/4% 4 1/2% 5%
Cycle Time 4 minutes but less than 5 5 minutes but less than 6 6 minutes but less than 7 7 minutes but less than 8 8 minutes and over
(o)
Area Code Application. An Area Code is applied in those situations where an operator is required to perform more than one operation, having separate pay factors, either intermittently or concurrently and it is impractical to separately record and accumulate elapsed hours for each of the multiple time increments spent on each job.
75
Article IX - Section 8
Section 8.	Other Incentive Compensation. Where work is inappropriate for the application of a Labor Standard as set forth in other Sections of this Article, rather than to compensate Employees on an hourly base rate, the Company may develop and establish an incentive compensation plan appropriate for such work, which will provide suitable opportunities for earnings with specified rules for the administration of the plan. Such an incentive payment plan when installed, will be temporary for a maximum period of twelve (12) months before either being made permanent or cancelled. During the period of time in which the plan is considered temporary, an Employee will be guaranteed a minimum earnings level of the hourly rate for the classification. Before permanently installing such a plan, it must be folly discussed with the appropriate Union Representatives and agreed to by the Union and the Company. Furthermore, once the plan has been permanently established, a grievance alleging noncompliance with the plan and the rules for administration under which
it has been established may be processed through the grievance procedure.
-S
Not withstanding the above, the parties further agree that other Incentive Compensation Plans may be imple
mented, by mutual agreement, that may include employ
ees covered by the current earned hour incentive system. If the Company chooses, such Plan or Plan’s may be cancelled after six (6) months of becoming permanent but no sooner than eighteen (18) months from inception by giving the Union sixty (60) days notice and the opportunity to discuss the reason for cancellation. These Plans would also require Union agreement prior to becoming perma-
nent.
76
Article IX - Section 9
Section 9.	Payment By Preliminary Estimate Before Labor Standard Is Established. The payment on jobs which will have a Labor Standard, but where the Standard has not yet been established, may be as follows:
(a) lh cases where either (I) the method of performing an operation is changed substantially, and a time allowance or disallowance on a previous Standard is not made and applied, or (2) a new operation is being introduced, and the new Standard is not yet established, a Preliminary Estimate may be established by the Industrial Engineering Department. The Preliminary Estimate will be the break-even point, based on observations or standard data and experience, and on the anticipated method of performing the operation. The Preliminary Estimate will be revised and kept current, in accordance with methods changes, and time allowances on the Preliminary Estimate may be granted in the same manner as on Labor Standards: If the Employee (or Group of Employees in the case of group incentive work) averages one hundred petcent (100%) or better of the Preliminary Estimate over the entire period of time that he (or the group) performs the operation during any one shift, he (or the group) will, until the Labor Standard is established, receive the larger of: The incentive earnings based on the Preliminary Estimate, or one hundred and thirty percent (130%) of this incentive base rate. If the Employee (or the group) averages less than one hundred percent (100%) during a shift, he (or they) will be paid at his incentive base rale.
77

78
Where questions arise in regard to prompt application and effective utilization of Preliminary Estimates, either party may initiate discussion to resolve the specific cases al the department level or, if unresolved, subsequently al the plant level.
(c) It is the Company's intent and desire to apply Preliminary Estimates on new or changed jobs, where the standard hour plan is applicable, at the earliest practical point in time in order to provide Employees an early opportunity for incentive
Article IX - Section 9 *
(b) If Preliminary Estimates or any revision thereof remain in effect (1) for more than forty (40) hours during which at least one (1) Employee could have been assigned continuously to the operation during periods it was operating, or (2) in rhe Assembly Department on primary product assembly lines, a Preliminary Estimate form of payment has been effective for a period of eighty (80) hours (for example, Preliminary Estimates applicable to different models have to be applied, but none for an accumulated forty (40) hours). Employees (or an Employee if only one (1) Employee is assigned to work on the Preliminary Estimate) shall have the option of being paid their hourly rate or continuing on the Preliminary Estimate. When a group (or an Employee) requests to be paid the hourly rate as set forth above, the Preliminary Estimate will be cancelled for such Employees as of the end of the workday during which the fortieth (40th) hour (or the eightieth (80th) hour in the Assembly Departments on Primary Production Assembly lines) on Preliminary Estimates, as defined above, is completed, or at the end of the workday at which the request is made, whichever is later. In group Preliminary Estimates, the option shall be exercised by shift by a majority vote of those working on the job to which the Preliminary Estimate is applicable on the day of such vote.
Article IX - Section 9 earnings. Both parties agree to cooperate in establishing understanding and acceptance among incentive Employees of, (1) the necessity for the use of time estimates and general methods descriptions if early Preliminary Estimate applications are to be made, (2) the consequential expectation that there may be significant difference between a Preliminary Estimate and subsequent Labor Standard values, and (3) the importance of Employees producing at their capabilities during the time a Preliminary Estimate is in effect.
Section 10.	Rest Periods And Relief. Individual Labor Standards contain a three percent (3%) allowance for personal time, which amounts to approximately fifteen (15) minutes per eight (8) hour shift. Employees working on such Labor Standards or Employees working on an off-standard basis are, therefore, permitted time out for personal necessities up to a total of fifteen (15) minutes each eight (8) hour day. Normally, such timeout is expected io be taken in increments of ten (10) minutes during the first portion of the shift and five (5) minutes during the latter portion of the shift. Fatigue allowances in such Labor Standards are to compensate the Employee for any decline in production which results from his personal fatigue. They are not intended to permit him to leave his work station assignment for rest periods. In group operations, where the worker cannot leave his work station, relief

Article IX - Section 10
operators are provided to relieve each such Employee a maximum of twenty-four (24) minutes on each eight (8) hour shift (In group operations where an incentive group is working on a machine-paced line where the output cannot be substantially increased by increased Employee effort and in which work in process cannot be stored between operations, a maximum of thirty (30) minutes is permitted.) Such periods of relief are intended not only for personal needs of the Employee, but also to give him an opportunity to rest briefly and thus overcome the fatigue which otherwise would occur. Where Employees are relieved by Relief Employees, such relief periods shall start not earlier than one (1) hour following the beginning of the Employee's regular work shift, and not earlier than fbrty-five (45) minutes following the end of the Employee's scheduled lunch period.
Section 11.	Payment Of Downtime. An Employee working on a Preliminary Estimate or Labor Standard who encounters a complete cessation on that job for any reason beyond his control shall be paid his hourly base rate for each cessation which is twelve (12) minutes or more, or two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the total elapsed hours which he has worked on standard during that shifl, whichever is less, and for the total of alt cessations, each of which is over three (3) minutes in length and not more than twelve (12) minutes in length, when the total of such minor cessation is twelve (12) minutes or more. The following provisions shall also apply:
(a)	If a cessation occurs, the Employee shall notify his Supervisor, and except in those areas where cessations are automatically recorded, shall immediately punch out, provided, however, that if the Foreman believes that the cessation will be
Article IX - Section 11 less than three (3) minutes, he may instruct the Employee that it will not be necessary t0 punch out. If the cessation does exceed three (3) minutes, it is the Supervisor's responsibility to see that such time is recorded and that proper credit is given to the Employee immediately after the cessation ends.
(b)	A cessation in production, self-induced by the individuals or group, or directly related individuals or groups, will not require the payment of downtime for such cessation to the individual or group or related individual or group.
(c)	In group operations, any downtime payment for such cessation shall be granted to the number of individuals in the group directly affected by the cessations in the group, and to the extent that such various individuals in the group were affected by such cessations. Paid downtime will not be added to either the group’s actual hours or earned hours in calculating the percent pay performance of the group.
(d)	During downtime periods, Employees may be assigned to any work as required by the Company.
(e)	In group operations where the worker cannot leave his work station, and twenty-four (24) minutes or more relief time is provided on each eight (8) hour shift, the Company will apply the following method in the payment for abnormal and excessive minor delays which, as set forth in this Article and Section, would be subject to the
Bi
Article IX - Section 11
application of the downtime rule if they total twelve (12) minutes or more:
At the end of the workday, the Company will examine the total accumulation of ah downtime periods of three (3) minutes or more. When this daily total of such downtime periods is in excess of two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the hours during the day which a Labor Standard was in effect (such hours will include downtime hours which may have occurred during the time the Labor Standard was in effect), the Company will pay downtime retroactively for the amount of such downtime periods. The granting of such downtime retroactively shall be subject to the approval of the Industrial Engineering Section, upon the recommendation of the Superintendent of the Department involved.
Section 12.	Time Allowances To Compensate For Unusual Conditions. If an Employee is assigned to an operation on which there is a Labor Standard or Preliminary Estimate, and, after notification to the Supervisor, is directed by the Supervisor to continue the operation in the face of apparent handicaps, such as hard stock, oversize stock, tooling and equipment not functioning properly, and irregular equipment, and as a result of such conditions, his output is curtailed and the Labor Standard or the Preliminary Estimate would be affected by two percent (2%) or more, a time allowance shall be added to compensate for these conditions until a new Labor Standard or Preliminary Estimate is established to cover these conditions, or the original conditions are restored, making the original Standard or Preliminary Estimate applicable. Such allowance shall be the necessary addi-
82
Article IX - Section 12 tional time required to perform the operation; and such allowance shall apply to the specific element or elements which depart from the original conditions, as described in the Labor Standard or the Preliminary Estimate. If the unusual conditions result in a reduction of the Preliminary Estimate or Labor Standard time required to perform the operation by five percent (5%) or more, a disallowance will be applied in the same manner. Such temporary additions to, or subtractions from, the Preliminary Estimate or Labor Standard rime shall be permitted only so long as the unusual conditions exist. A new count of incentive production shall be mlde for such period. The provisions of this paragraph shall in no way limit the Company's right, under Article IX, Section 7, to remove operations from incentive.
When, because of unusual conditions, a Helper is added to a group and, as a result, an operator in the group is taken offstandard and put on his hourly rate, the Supervisor will explain to him why the addition of the Helper has resulted in placing the operator off-standard. However, where a Helper is added to a group to perform an extra operation, and the regular operator continues to perform his normal operation, the operator will be continued on incentive, while only the Helper will be paid at his hourly rate.
Where an Employee is assigned to perform jobs on more than one (1) machine with a separate Labor Standard on each machine (such as Automatic Screw Machines), and one (1) or more of the machines is temporarily not operating, due to no fault of the Employee, and he is instructed by the Supervisor to continue to perform the jobs on the remaining machine or machines, the Employee shall be granted downtime equal to the time each machine

Article IX * Section 12
is idle, divided by the total number of machines specified to be operated under the Labor Standard, or, as an alternative, the Company may establish a new Labor Standard io cover the remaining machine or machines.
Where a Labor Standard applies to a job where identical operations are performed simultaneously on a multiple-station machine, and one (I) or more stations are temporarily not operating, (he Employees shall be granted downtime equal to the time each station is idle, divided by the total number of stations operated under the Labor Standard, or, as an alternative, the Company may establish a new Labor Standard to cover the remaining station or stations,


Section 13.	Hourly Payments To Employees Who Normally Work On Incentive, When an Employee, who normally works on incentive, is directed by the Supervisor to perform productive work not on Standard or Preliminary Estimate, he shall be paid the applicable hourly rate for his classification. Productive work paid for at an Employee's hourly rate includes off-standard work, described in Section 14; work on jobs on which Preliminary Estimates or Labor Standards have not been established; conference time with supervision at the specific request of the Supervisor, and conference time of Union Representatives paid under the Grievance Procedure; the rc-perfbrmance of work not properly per* formed by another Employee when not paid on a Standard; the performance of incidental maintenance work during a breakdown, when specifically instructed to do so by the Supervisor; the replacement of an absent day worker. Productive work does not include call-in or reporting payments during the period no work was performed, and such time shall be paid at the Employee's incentive base rate. Time during which an Employee is
84
1
Article IX - Section 13 transferred to the Development and Instruction Classification will be paid as provided in Section 19. When an Employee is being instructed in proper operating methods and safe operating procedures by toe Supervisor, when initially assigned to the job for a period determined by the Supervisor to be necessary for such instruction, even though an applicable Labor Standard is available, he shall be paid the applicable hourly rate for his classification.
a. jit
Section 14.	Off-Standard Work. Where shortages or infrequent supply of material, parts, or supplies are estimated by the Supervisor to reduce a group’s or individual's end output or rate of production below one hundred twelve percent (112%) of the production rate established in the Labor Standard, unless it is possible to reduce the crew size in direct proportion to the reduction in rate of production, the Supervisor shall declare the beginning of a period which shall be considered as off-standard work and paid at toe hourly rate provided in Section 13, until the condition is corrected, provided that the period declared as off-standard continues without interruption for at least one-half (1/2) hour. If the period declared to be off-standard continues for less than onehalf (1/2) hour because the shortages or infrequent supply of material, parts, or sup-plies are corrected, the determination that the period shall be considered off-standard shall become null and void, and the Employees involved shall be compensated during such period just as though the determination had not been announced. The provisions in this Section shall be applied only where major shortages occur, and shall not apply where shortages are inducted by fluctuations tn performance levels by the group itself or related groups. While the Company desires to have Labor Standards to cover most incentive-type work, it must be recognized that, at times, there will be some work run as offstandard work.

Article IX - Section 15
Section 15.	Allowance To Group For Learners. An Employee assigned to an incentive group shall be considered a Learner when-.
He is a probationary employee, or
He has not worked in one (1) or more incentive groups in the same department (Large Press and Small Press areas in the Sheet Metal Department will each be construed as a separate "department") more than forty (40) hours, in the last twelve (12) months, and
He is working in a group where his work pace can significantly retard the output of the group.
When one or more such Learner is in an incentive group, the following rules shall also apply:
(d)	The group's earned hours will include an allowance according to the following table:
Elapsed Time 0 to 8 hours 8.1 to 16 hours 16.1 to 24 hours 24.1 to 32 hours 32.1 to 40 hours
Allowance 15% 12% 9% 6% 3%
(e)	If a Helper is added to the group during the time a Learner is in the group, no Learner’s allowance shall be paid the group during such period, and both the Learner and the Helper will be paid only their applicable hourly rate.

(ii)
(iii)
(iv)
such new Employee has not worked in one or more incentive groups in the same department for more than twenty-four (24) work hours; and
a Helper cannot be added under (e) above; and

(2) Wage Group Structure Classification. Whenever there are vacancies in a department in a classification in the Wage Group Structure (whenever the number of Employees needed in a classification is more than those classified therein, vacancies exist up to (he required number), the procedures under this Section shall be used to fill such vacancies.
(a)	The vacancy will be posted on the department bulletin board, indicating the shift, if it is a fixed-shift department, for a period of twenty-four (24) hours (hours during Holidays, Saturdays, Sundays, Inventory Periods, and Vacation Shutdowns shall not count).

fit cases where several applicants fora vacancy in Wage Group 4 (except those job classifications in Wage Group 4 where the work content of the classification has been evaluated m the First Degree of the Experience Factor) or above have approximately equal qualifications based on ability, experience, and skills the Employee with the greatest applicable seniority will be entitled to the job. Applicants for a vacancy in Wage Groups 1, 2, and 3, and those job classifications in Wage Group 4 where the work content of the classification has been evaluated in the First Degree of the Experience Factor, will be accepted in seniority order, provided die Employee is physically able to perform the work.

An Employee who is awarded such vacancy shall have all other bids which he then has on file automatically cancelled and shall be required to accept the vacancy. Unsuccessful bidders for such vacancy will have their bid for such vacancy automatically cancelled when the vacancy is filled by the selection of another Employee.
If an Employee leaves a department as a result of a recall, or "Request For Interdepartmental
I
Article X - Section 6
Transfer", and creates a vacancy, such vacancy shall be filled by posting or subsequent procedures as defined in this Section 6.
(g)
When a vacancy is posted, it shall be deemed filled only when one (1) of the Employees who has bid for the job has been notified by the Company that he is the successful bidder. Such notification shall consist of posting on the depart- t went bulletin board, the name of the successful ; bidder, his seniority date, his supervisor's name, his present classification, and the classification which he has been awarded, as well as the names of the unsuccessful bidders. Until such notification has been given, the vacancy will continue to exist, and may be filled under any other applicable provision of this Article. A copy of this notice shall be forwarded to the appropriate Area Representative, and on this copy will be shown the seniority dates of all Employees listed. In the event the Company elects to cancel a posted vacancy, the original posting will be marked "Cancelled" and a brief reason for such cancellation will be stated.
Where a vacancy is created by the absence of an Employee on a written Medical Leave of Absence which will extend ten (10) working days or longer, it will be posted under the above procedure, provided that the successful applicant shall be automatically displaced by the Employee returning from such leave, if he returns immedi- ’ ately upon the expiration of such leave, and in 1 such event the displaced Employee will be downgraded as provided in Section 3, beginning with
tih
Article X - Section 6 3(b)(1), within six working days unless there are justifiable reasons for delaying such downgrade -except that such Employee shall not displace the Employee returning from the leave of absence if the returning Employee is the youngest seniority Employee in the Wage Group (unless he has the special right of displacement, provided in the next to last sentence of Section 3, Sub paragraph (b). If two or more Employees are temporarily classified in the same classification, upon return of an Employee from Medical Leave the least senior Employee ?Uill be downgraded first. If during the period such Employee is absent on leave the successfill applicant who replaced him leaves the job classification fay bid, transfer request, recall or request for interdepartmental transfer, the vacancy may be posted anew (such posting may be delayed so as not to affect the transfer of other Employees), and the same protection will continue to the Employee absent on leave for the remaining portion of his leave. If, however, the successful applicant is removed from the classification by downgrading, the right of the Employee on (eave to return to the classification shall be determined by his applicable seniority, furthermore, if a permanent vacancy occurs in the classification during the period of the leave, the successful applicant who is then in the temporary vacancy shall be deemed to have filled the permanent vacancy, and the temporary vacancy may be posted anew with the same protection for the __ absent Employee during the remaining portion of his leave. Furthermore, if no Employee bids successfully for such temporary vacancy, transfer requests will be ignored, and the Company will
fl
119

Article X - Section 6
proceed to fill the vacancy starting with Step 3 of this Section. If a vacancy is filled in this fashion, the Employee on leave shall have the same protection for the period of his leave as set forth above.
Step 2. Transfer Requests (Witbin a Department).
(a)	Any vacancy in the department caused by the transfer of an Employee to a vacancy, as a result of the posting of the original vacancy, as set forth above, will be filled by transferring an Employee to such vacancy as a result of a Transfer Request. Any vacancy caused by the recall of an Employee to a long-step-rate job classification will be posted as an original vacancy,
(b)	Employees who desire transfers shall sign a "Transfer Request" Form, which may be limited to a particular shift in a fixed-shift department if the Employee desires, and which in any department may be one of the following types:
(i)	Request for transfer to a specific job classification or Wage Group.
(ii)	Request for transfer to any higher rated job classification.
Requests for transfer, to receive consideration, must be on file before the end of the 24 hour posting period specified in Step 1 above. If there are no requests for transfer on file by applicants who can become qualified with a minimum amount of training, the vacancy shall be filled by request to the Human Resources Office, but no Employee
120
ill
Article X - Section 6 in the department will be considered by the Human Resources Office in filling such vacancy. When an Employee is offered transfer, as a result of a "Transfer Request*, he shall be required to accept such placement and all other Transfer Requests which he has on file shall be automatically canceled.
(c)	Where there are several candidates for such transfer to a vacancy in Wage Group 4 (except where the work content of the classification has been evaluated in the First Degree of the Experience Factor), or above who have approximately equal qualifications, based on ability, experience, and drills, the Employee with the greatest applicable seniority will be entitled to the vacancy.
Step 3. Recall.
Vacancies which exist after posting and transfer have taken place, as set forth above, will be filled by recall* ing, in seniority order, die necessary number of those Employees who have active department recall rights (Employees in the Plant and those described in Section 5 (e)) and placing them in the resulting vacancies according to Article X, Section 5 (c). When an Employee is thus recalled, "Requests For Interdepartmental Transfer1 which he may have on file will be automatically cancelled.
Step 4. Interdepartmental Transfer.
(a)	Vacancies which may still exist will be filled by Employees who have filed "Requests For Interdepartmental Transfer". Employees working
121
Article X - Section 6
the first shift may initiate "Request For Interdepartmental Transfer" in the departmental office, all other Employees shall file such requests in the Human Resources Office, All such requests must be time-stamped prior to the time the postings for the original vacancies, as described above, are made.
(b)	Such requests may specify that the Employee requests a transfer to any other department, or they may be limited and may specify only one (I) or more selected departments, or they may be limited and may specify a minimal Wage Group level to which the Employee requests transfer.
(c)	If the vacancies to be filled by "Request For Interdepartmental Transfer" are in Wage Group 4 (except where the work content of the classification has been evaluated in the First Degree of the Experience Factor) or above, and there are several candidates requesting such transfers who have approximately equal qualifications, based on ability, experience, and skills, the Employee with the greatest applicable seniority will be offered the opportunity to transfer, provided that he can become qualified to perform the work in the vacancy with a minimum amount of training. If the vacancies to be filled by such "Requests For Interdepartmental Transfer" are in Wage Groups I, 2, 3, or to those job classifications 7 in Wage Group 4 (where the work content of the classifications has been evaluated in the First Degree of the Experience Factor), the applicants will be selected in seniority order, provided that they are physically able to perform the work in the vacancy.
122
Article X - Section 6
(d)	Any Employee selected to transfer from one department to another in this fashion shall be required to accept the transfer, and all other "Requests For Interdepartmental Transfer" which he has on file shall be automatically cancelled. Furthermore, he shall be ineligible to file another "Request For Interdepartmental Transfer" for a period of six (6) months for following his transfer in this fashion. When an Employee has been transferred as a result of a "Request For Interdepartmental Transfer" which request specified a particular department in which he wished to be located and he is subsequently downgraded out of that department within such six (6) month period, he shall at the time be permitted to file an additional "Request For Interdepartmental Transfer", even though the six (6) month limitation set forth above may not have yet expired. Furthermore, all Requests for Inter departmental Transfer that an Employee has on file shall be automatically cancelled when such Employee is transferred according to a "Job Availability" or Transfer Request" form.
Step 5. Recall From Plant Recall List.
Vacancies which may still exist will then be filled by recalling Employees from the top of the Recall List, in seniority order, provided that they can become qualified io perform the work in the vacancy with a minimum amount of training.
Step 6. New Hire.
Vacancies which may still remain will be filled by the employment of new Employees.

Article X - Section 7
Section 7.	Procedure To Be Followed When Downgrading Occurs In One Or More Departments At The Same Time That A Vacancy Situation Exists In One Or More Other Departments. The downgrading procedure shall be followed as sei forth in Section 3 above in each department where a downgrading is required. If, at the time Employees arc removed from the department or departments as a result of such downgradings, vacancies exist in another department, the procedures as defined in Section 6 shall be followed up to, but not including, Step 5. The resulting vacancies then existing in any department shall be pre-empted for use in the placement of downgraded Employees under the provisions of Section 4.
Section 8.	Procedure To Be Followed When There Is A Simultaneous Downgrading And Vacancy Situation Within One Department Existing vacancies shall be posted as set forth in Section 6, Step 1, above. Resulting vacancies shall be filled by transfer request as set forth in Section 6, Step 2, above; and then the downgrading as set forth in Section 3 above shall take place, if, as a result of such downgrading, Employees are removed from the department, they will be placed as provided in Section 4 above; but if, after such downgrading, there are still vacancies available within rhe department, these vacancies shall be filled as set forth in Section 6, beginning with Step 3 and continuing with the subsequent steps as far as may be required.
Section 9.	Freeze Period. Where the Company has declared a freeze period during a substantial movement of Employees (that is, a move of twenty (20) or more Employees under the applicable sections of this Article), no transfer rights shall mature as a result of changes in con* ditions occurring during the period of freeze; however, this
T24
Article X - Section 9 will not limit the Company's right to temporarily assign Employees to work of other classifications. Norice of the beginning of a freeze period, indicating the revision of production levels contemplated, shall be posted on the departmental bulletin board two (2) workdays in advance of such freeze.
Section 10.	Limits On Bidding Or Transfer Request Opportunities. Employees may move within a department by bid or transfer request as many times as they wish, provided that in such movements within a department they aremoving upward from one Wage Group to a higher ranking Wage Group or are moving laterally from one job classification to another job classification within the same Wage Group. Whenever an Employee bids or requests transfer downward (to a job classification in a lower ranking Wage Group), he shall be denied any additional bids or other transfer during the following four (4) months, unless having thus lost his rights to transfer, he is subsequently downgraded to another job classification in the same or lower ranking Wage Group, or if he is subsequently recalled to his home department, he shall be permitted One (J) additional bid or one (1) additional transfer request during such four month period. Such four month period described above shall begin on the date of his notification on the department bulletin board as described under Section 6, Step 1(g). This restoration of one (1) bid or one (1) transfer request shall occur each time that the Employee is thus downgraded, except that at no time will he have a right to more than one (1) such additional bid or one (I) such additional transfer request.
An Employee whose four month restriction expires prior to the date on which a vacancy is to be filled will be permitted to bid on such vacancy.
125
Article X - Section 11
Section IE Right of Assignment. Employees within a job classification are subject to assignment to type of work, place of work, machine or equipment, in that job classification by the Company.
Employees may be assigned temporarily to work in another classification, subject to the provisions of Article IX, Section 5. Where a temporary assignment is from work in one classification to work in a classification in Wage Groups I, 2 or 3, or to those job classifications in Wage Group 4 in which the Experience Factor is evaluated in the First Degree, the most junior Employee under the Supervisor's jurisdiction (when an Employee is assigned to a job classification on a regular basis under more than one Supervisor's jurisdiction, this Section shall also apply) who is then available in the first classification shall be so assigned, provided he is physically able to do the work, (unless there is an Employee working in the first job classification who is classified in another job classification, who shall be assigned, provided that he is physically able to do the work); furthermore, during the period that the junior Employee is so temporarily assigned, there shall be no re-assignment within the first classification involving a junior Employee still in the classification and no other Employee shall be assigned to the job classification from which such junior Employee was removed.
The above paragraph shah apply to an Employee working in a combination job assignment or a Utility Employee classification (unless the Utility Employee is replacing an Employee absent from his job assignment), only when: (I) a temporary assignment is required from a classification for the sole purpose of reducing the number of Employees then assigned to the classification, an Employee working in the classification who is classified

Article X - Section ) 1 in another classification shall be the first to be so assigned; or (2) if it is known that the Employee so classified in another classification can reasonably be expected to complete the temporary assignment in question without interfering with the performance of his normal duties, he shall be the first to be so assigned.
।
j When the temporary assignment is to work in a classification in Wage Group 4 or above (except those Wage
' Group 4 classifications described above), the Supervisor i shall have the unqualified right to assign the Employee of his choice; and during such period of temporary assign-i ment, anothq* Employee may be assigned to the job clas-| sification from which such Employee has been assigned and/or realignments within the first job classification may be made as necessary.
Work in a classification which is assigned cm a temporary basis to Employees classified in another classification shall be considered a vacancy in the classification when the work becomes regular, and over any significant period of time is operated more than fifty percent (50%) of the regular work shift involved.
An Employee who regularly performs work which is normally classified in two (2) different classifications will be classified in, and paid the rate of the higher paid classification whenever the work in the higher paid classification equals or exceeds forty percent (40%) of the Employee’s time. This does not mean that work on combinations of different types of machines cannot be established by the Company for one (1) Employee; but this test shall determine the classification into which the Employee shall be classified. If the Company has filled in observation time on a machine in a higher Wage Group with work
127
Article X - Section 11
normally classified in a lower Wage Group, the job will be rated in the higher Wage Group.
When two (2) or more Employees are transferred into a job classification and the work station assignments which are then available include both day work stations and the incentive-rated work stations on the same shift, the senior Employee shall be assigned to the incentive-rated work station, unless such an assignment would result in lessened efficiency of the classification as a whole or of one or more of the Employees thus assigned.
These rights of assignment, which are necessary for efficient operation, shall not be used to unfairly discrimi-nate against any Employee.
Section 12. Physically Disabled Employees. Employees who have attained seniority including Employees in Skilled Trades classifications, and who are presumably permanently or temporarily, partially disabled or infirm, and are physically unable to perform their norma) work assignment, may be placed by the Company in job classifications in the following procedure:
(a)	To any existing vacancy within his classification or to work not regularly assigned or to work available in other classifications.
(b)	To the work station within the original classification then occupied by the least senior employee, displacing that Employee. If the disabled Employee cannot perform the work assignment then occupied by the least senior Employee, the Company would examine the work assignment within the classification occupied by the next
128
t»
Article X - Section 12 least senior Employee, and so forth, progressing upward through die classification through al) Employees with less seniority than the disabled Employee.
(c)	If the above does not result in placement, the Company will use the established downgrading procedure as described under Section 3 of this Article. The Company and the Union may agree to make exceptions to the downgrading procedure in placing such Employee.
(d)	If an Employee is sent home because he is physically unable to perform work, the Company will endeavor to notify the appropriate Union Representative.
The Company shall have the discretion of holding in the classification the employee displaced by the disabled employee pending demonstration by the disabled employee of his ability to perform the Job. Moreover, if the displaced employee is downgraded out of the classification after such displacement, and, within five (5) work days of such displacement, the disabled employee demonstrates that he can not perform the job, the Company has the discretion of returning the displaced employee to the classification without the need to post the vacancy, provided it is practical to do so and it can be done with the minimum movement of one or two employees.
At such time as the downgraded Employee pros' ents evidence acceptable to the Company that he has recovered sufficiently to perform the work of
Article X - Section 12
the classification from which he was displaced, he will be returned to the classification precisely as though he were returning from a leave of absence under Article X, Section 6 (2) Step 1 (h).
The names of Employees reclassified outside their home department under this section, along with the appropriate information, will be provided to the Chief of Assembly/Support via memorandum at the time of reclassification. The names of physically disabled Employees medically downgraded under the above procedure that have their medical restrictions either modified or removed shall be provided to the Union.

If an Employee who has been suspended or discharged requests, he shall be permitted to talk, privately, with one (I) Union Representative at the Human Resources Office before being required to leave the Company premises.

All counselings and verbal warnings given to employees will be removed from the employee’s file six (6) months after the occurrence.

Section 3,	Attendance Policy. Regular attendance is expected of every employee.

Section 4,	Initial Absentee Percent. Call-ins will be tracked as initial absenteeism. Employee's who call in to work in an excess of two percent (2%) in a rolling twelve (12) month period may have their casual time denied. If denied, their attendance bonus cycle will be broken and the time will be counted towards their controllable absenteeism percent. Management does realize there are many situations which could cause an employee to be absent from work. For this reason the Company will review each call-in on a case-by-case basis and will not be based on being short of help.
Section 5,	Controllable Absenteeism Corrective Action Program. Since the purpose of any-attendance policy is to encourage regular and punctual attendance
139
Article XII - Section 1
on the job, and since employees with poor attendance affect the earnings of fellow employees and the total operation of the plant, the following corrective action program will be applied;
(a)	When an employee's controllable absenteeism percent in a rolling twelve (12). month period reaches two percent (2%), there will be a nondiscipline Level 1 meeting with the employee, Management Representative and Steward to discuss the employee's attendance responsibilities, any reason identified by the employee for the absenteeism, and the Company's expectations and responsibilities of all employees in regards to attendance.
(b)	When an employee’s controllable absenteeism percent in a rolling twelve (12) month period exceeds four percent (4%), the employee may be issued a counseling.
(c)	If within the following six (6) month period the employee has another unexcused absence, and his controllable absenteeism percent in a rolling twelve (12) month period exceeds four percent (4%), the employee may be issued a verbal warning.
(d)	If within the following six (6) month period the
employee has another unexcused absence, and his controllable absenteeism percent in a rolling twelve (12) month period exceeds four percent (4%), the employee may be issued a final written letter.

(2)	The Company lacks the necessary equipment or tools for performing the work, or
(3)	The work cannot be completed within a time limit
which is necessary for the efficient operations of the Company plant. (This limitation shall not

(4)	The cost of doing the work with its own Employees would be $22*000 or more and the Company can obtain the work to be performed at a cost at least twenty percent (20%) less than the cost of doing the work with its own Employees, using its established cost accounting procedures.

Such option shall be exercised at the time an Employee has been notified of the job classification to which he will be transferred under this Section. The exercise
159
Article XVI - Section 4
of such an option by a Journeyman will not affect in any way the transfers of other Employees being placed in other departments under the procedures of this Agreement. Once an Employee has made this election to take a layoff, he cannot later change this election. He will be recalled to vacancies in his Skilled Trades classification only, unless he makes an irrevocable election, in writing, as to whether he desires general recall or recall to his Skilled Trades classification only. A copy of the Employee's election shall be sent to the Union.
Section 5.	Recall Of Skilled Trades Personnel. A Journeyman who has been removed from his Skilled Trades classification in a prior reduction of force, and who is either working or who is on the Recall List, shall be recalled to his Skilled Trades classification in line with his Skilled Trades Seniority, provided that he has not lost his recall rights.

Section 7.	Assignment of Skilled Trades Journeymen,
(a)	Assignment. The Company may assign Journeymen within the Skilled Trades classifications for the duration of any emergency condition which may warrant such assignment. The Company may assign Journeymen for any length of time to perform work within their classifica-
160
Article XVI - Section 7 lion. Whenever the Company has time to post a notice on the time clock by 12:00 o'clock noon the workday preceding the day of the required assignment, the Journeymen with the most Skilled Trades seniority, working the same work shift will be permitted the opportunity to perform such assignment If such assignment is not accepted by the necessary number of Journeymen the Company will schedule the Journeymen in reverse order of seniority. This procedure will be followed unless the Company can show clearly justifiable reasons for assigning another Journeyman. Should 'an assignment require a Journeyman to be scheduled to work more than eight (8) hours within a twenty-four (24) hour period, the provisions of Article Vin, Section 2 will apply.
(b)	Request for Permanent Assignment.
Journeymen may request to be permanently assigned on occasions when the complement of Journeymen in a particular craft is being increased either by a graduating Apprentice from the Skilled Trades training program, by hiring directly into a Skilled Trades classification and such Employees will be assigned as Journeymen.
The Company shall post a notice in advance of such intended assignment. Such notice shall be posted for a period of twenty-four (24) hours. Requests for permanent assignment will be determined on the basis of the Journeymen's Skilled Trades seniority. Nothing in the foregoing shall be construed in any way to limit the Company's right to assign Journeymen in the Skilled Trades classifications as provided in this Section.
161
Article XVI - Section 7
(c)	Plant Overtime Assignment. When alt Journeymen in a craft have been scheduled for an overtime assignment and additional Journeymen are required to perform the overtime, it shall be the policy and intention of the Company, insofar as reasonably practicable, to schedule such additional Journeymen from the same craft who have the least amount of credited overtime in their own overtime group, except as otherwise provided in Article 9 of the Apprenticeship Standards.
Cd) It is the policy and intention of the Company to assign its Skilled Trades Journeymen and Apprentices to work requiring skills and experience provided in the Apprenticeship Training Outlines for the Craft involved. Management intends to respect basic differences between the Crafts when making job assignments and tasks which require the unique and central skills of one particular Craft will be assigned to that Craft (unless such tasks are incidental to a principle job being performed by other crafts). A particular skilled assignment may fall within the scope of two or more Crafts because Craftsmen have overlapping capabilities. The Company intends to act consistently and reasonably, and past practices relating to the assignment of skilled tasks will be heavily weighted in making such assignments.
Section 8.	Work During Shutdown Periods. The Company reserves the right to require all Skilled Trades Employees, where necessary, to work during the vacation shutdown periods and to take their vacation time off at other mutually acceptable times, At least sixty (60) days prior to the annual summer vacation shutdown period, the
162
Article XVI - Section 8 Company will poll its Skilled Trades Employees io determine whether or not such Employees wish to accept work which may be available during such vacation shutdown period, or, as an alternative, wish to take vacation time off to which they may be entitled. Insofar as may be practicable, the Company will schedule Skilled Trades Employees to take their vacation time off, during the vacation shutdown period when such Employees have indicated a desire to do so. The Company shall not cancel vacation time off scheduled during the vacation shutdown period within thirty (30) days prior to the start of the shutdown, nor shall it cancel an Employee's work schedule within seven (7) days prior to the start of the shutdown, unless such changes are due Co conditions beyond the control of the Company. Furthermore, having once scheduled such Employees to work during the shutdown, the Company may schedule outside contractors as it may deem necessary, and no grievance may be filed because of such scheduling of outside contractors, [n the Skilled Trades Departments (Departments 64, 92 and 93) overtime scheduled during shutdowns will be scheduled according to the overtime rules for those Employees scheduled to work during the shutdown and departmental overtime records will be utilized.
Section 9.	Circumstances Involving Interclassification Transfer. If any Skilled Trades classification is abandoned or decreased, the Journeymen classified therein will be permitted, if they are completely qualified, to transfer into another Skilled Trades classification but their Skilled Trades seniority in the new classification shall be as of the date of entry into such classification.
163
Article XVI - Section 9
Upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the Company, consideration will be given to requests from Journeymen for downgrade to production classifications for health or compelling personal reasons.
Section 10.	Relationship Of Skilled Trades Work To Work Of Production Classifications. Maintenance work represents work requirements exceeding those normally expected of Employees in production classifications. It is the intent of the Company to assign qualified Journeymen or Skilled Trades Apprentices to maintenance work. However, minor maintenance work, which can be performed in a safe and efficient manner with the skills and experience typical of production Employees, may he performed by production Employees. This paragraph, however, is not to be used at any time during the life of this Agreement in an attempt to extend such work by production Employees so as to erode the work of the Skilled Trades crafts.
The Company does not expect to engage in a program of eroding the skilled trades classifications. At the same time, it must maintain its right to utilize production Employees as provided for in the agreement.
If there is a violation of this Section, the Journeyman within the Bargaining Unit identified as the person who lost time shall be paid his applicable rate for such time actually lost without regard to Article VIII, Section 9.
Section 11.	Uniforms. Effective September 1, 2001, all current Skilled Trades Employees will be provided up to five (5) sets of uniforms (shirts and pants or coveralls) for each year of the current agreement, at no cost to the employee. Any Employee entering a Skilled Trades clas-
164
Article XVI - Section II sification or Apprenticeship Program will be provided up co five (5) sets of uniforms on the same basis during his first year in the Skilled Trades classification or Apprenticeship Program (as (he case may be), and live (5) sets each year thereafter.
Guaranteed initial lit will be provided to those that elect to be measured by the vendor. Name tags will be provided. The laundering and normal repair of damaged uniforms will be the responsibility of the Employee. Uniforms damaged through normal on-the job use that obviously cannot and should not be repaired, may be replaced on the same basis as described above if they were damaged during the same twelve (12) month period for which they were issued.

Dear Pal:
Men and women enter the work force today with little or no knowledge, of what is expected of them as employees and as Union members in a unionized, industrial plant community. Many of them have not been adequately prepared to Cope with the industrial situations in which they suddenly find themselves.
New employees come to Maytag, Newton Laundry products with little or at best incomplete information about the employer and the Union. They have little knowledge of the extensive economic benefits available to them as agreed upon in collective bargaining between the UAW and Maytag, Newton Laundry Products over a period of many yean.
Many new Employees may be unaware of the commitment of Maytag, Newton Laundry Products and the UAW to fair employment practices and to the application of the Agreement to ail Employees without regard to race, color, creed, age, sex or national origin. They are not familiar with basic contract provisions covering such subjects as transfers, promotions and seniority. They may be unaware of the opportunities for advancement to highly paid skilled trades jobs through the Apprentice programs. Many are unaware of the importance of regular attendance,
200

Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding quality workmanship and the need for cooperation by al J in getting the job done, Too often they are unacquainted with the various procedural matters related to their job.
New Employees usually have little knowledge of the tong history the UAW and of the administrative structure of the UAW at the International and local Union levels. They do not understand about their relationship to the Union, about the initiation fees and dues requirements and the rights within the Union contained in the UAW Constitution and guaranteed by right of appeal to the Union's Public Review Board.
Frequently, they have never seen the inside of a manufacturing plant before and are unfamiliar with the operations, the nature of the product and how it is used.
Accordingly, pursuant to the Union's suggestion, the Company has in cooperation with the international Union, attempted to modify the present video-slide presentation so as to include certain orientation information regarding the Union. Such modified presentation has replaced the video slide presentation utilized prior to the 1971 Labor Agreement and it is presently being shown by the Company to each new Employee hired into the Bargaining Unit.
The orieniattoo presentation concerning the Union will not be subject to the grievance procedure and can be terminated by cither the International Union or the Company, in the event that the program is not being carried in a manner consistent with the purpose and intent of the program as established by the parties. The establishment of such a program wifi not limit any other communication by Management with its Employees or by the Union with its members.

Dear Fat:
The Company for many years as a courtesy to Employees has been willing to honor reasonable requests on the pan of Employees to be assigned to specific work stations within their Classification. It is the intention of the Company to continue to approve the requests of Employees to be assigned to particular work stations within their classification so long as granting such request does not reduce efficiency within the classification.
Employees retained in a former classification according to terms of Article X. Section 16 (Delayed Transfer) shall be permitted to request assignments to specific work stations after the date they would otherwise have been transferred. In addition, Employees transferring into such classification from within the Department, will be given prefer-
,	ettce in seniority order to the vacancies remaining in the classification
I	after consideration has been given to the oral requests above.
Employees may have four (4) oral requests on file at any one time. Employees wishing to submit oral requests will have not less than 24 hours to view and consider existing openings after all jobs have been awarded. Such requests Io be considered must be made by 12:00 Noon on Friday In the event a Thursday or Friday is a holiday, such requests
must be made by 12:00 Noon on the day preceding the holiday. Requests for assignment within the classification on another shift (including parallel work stations) must be made prior to the notification of another
202
Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding Employee to report for work on the shift requested. All requests to be effective at the time of a production' level change must be made at least two full workdays (excluding weekend overtime shifts) prior to the date and time of the production level change (normally 3:30 p.m. on the Wednesday preceding the week of the change).
When two or more Employees request the same work Station assign-menu the request of the senior Employee will be granted except the senior employee assigned to the same work station on another shift will be given first preference. The Porcelain Department (D86) will be exempt from this paragraph.
An Employee returning in the classification from a Written leave of absence or a fulltime Union Representative returning to the classification stall be permitted to return to the work station assignment he normally performed within the classification.
Where a reassignment within a classification occurs as a result of a job elimination on parallel jobs, the junior Employee shall be reassigned, unless a senior Employee oral requests the open work station assignment involved.
The accumulation of Employee's requests to be assigned a particular work Station within their classification shall in no way be construed to limit the Company's right to assign Employees within the classification as provided in Article X, Section 11.

Dear Pat:
The nature at certain operations in the Plants involve to varying degrees an exposure tp radiant heat. During periods of sustained abnormally hot weather, temperatures in these work areas may be elevated above normal levels in the area.
The Company has evidenced its concern for working conditions during periods of abnormally end excessively hot weather by adopting a policy providing additional time away front the job for employees working under such conditions.
The debilitating effects of working during hoc weather are not produced by conditions on the job alone. Employees working in hot areas during the summer months should follow sensible and recommended precautions during periods of hot weather. Employees should wear proper clothing and avoid to the extent possible undue exposure to heat and heavy physical exertion at home prior to coming to work. Additional time away from the job can obviously have no affect if an employee is already suffering from the effects of heat when reporting to work.
The following guidelines concerning special relief during unusually hot weather are applicable to personnel assigned to work stations where there is a continuous work flow and where personal time is provided by replacement employees.
205
I
Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding	।
I.	Normal Relief: Employee* assigned to work stations of this type are normally provided personal (relief) lime away from Ihtjob of either 24 or 30 mi notes per 8-0 hour work shift.
2.	Special Relief For Unusual (Severe) Hot Weather: (This applies where there is a succession of high temperature days where all or most of the work shift is involved (such as may	J
occur during lune, July and August) and where it becomes	■
more difficult for employees, to obtain proper rest between i work shifts.)
i
(a)	An additional three minutes for each hour that the | temperature of the work station is 195 degrees or over will be provided to each operator.
(b)	When work station temperatures are 110 degrees or more an additional six minutes (over normal) for each hour is to be granted to each operator affected.
(c)	When the work station temperatures are 115 degrees or more an additional nine minutes (over normal) for each hour will be provided to each opera! or affected.
3,	Special Relief For Individuals Unaccustomed To High Temperature Working Conditions:
la inch cases. Foremen are authorized to provide time away from the job as necessary to meet the needs of the employee. Individual needs will vary but normally an employee can become properly accustomed to high temperatures within one week.
4.	Special Relief Frier To Lunch Period* And End of Shift;
Additional relief related to heat is not provided for the hour immediately preceding an employee’s lunch period pt the hour
206
Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding immediately preceding the end of an employee's shift, although relief may be given during those periods for the preceding hours.
Policies relating to heal relief must of necessity be somewhat flexible, inasmuch as there are many variables which relate to the effects of working under abnormally hot conditions.
It is recognized, for example, that an unusually warm day in the early spring or fall could result in temperature levels meeting the special relief guidelines during part of a shift on that particular day. This, however, is not the type of condition which contemplates the application of special heal relief allowances.
It is further understood that temperature alone is not a reliable or accurate reflection of stress heat conditions. Many factors are involved in determining the effects of heat stress ineluding humidity, rates of heat flow, length of exposure, presence, or absence of radiant heat and individual differences in sensitivity to hear among others.
The above guidelines are based on conditions as they previously existed within certain departments in the plants. The Company is continuing to research the problem of heat in the plants. New developments and findings concerning the effects of heal and heat stress conditions along with changes in technology may necessitate changes in the guidelines as set forth above.

The purpose of this letter is to state precisely the Company's intentions with respect to the application of charge-back procedures as set forth in our Labor Agreement.
The Company will suspend the application of such charge-back ptovi-Stotts for the duration of this Labor Agreement, unless during such peri-od there is a decrease in our current quality levels or there are specific | instances of significant faulty production caused by Employees.
This suspension shall tn no way affect any other provisions of the Labor Agreement.

When the Company finds it necessary to make charge-backs during the Efe of this Labor Agreement, the Company will charge back only such rejects as were caused by the Employees involved.
Furthermore, when a related work group encounters downtime because of faulty production by another group, and such faulty production has not been charged hack, the related group will be deemed eligible for

Dear Pat:
Re: Steam Plant Operator Work Schedules And Determination Of Sixth and Seventh Qays For Premium Pay Purposes When Working on a Seven Day Schedule.
A number of discussions have been held in relation to Steam Plant Operator work schedules and the establishment of the Employee’s sixth and seventh day when the schedule s Steam Plant Operator actually works departs from the schedule published.
The determination of a Steam Plant Operator's sixth and seventh days becomes important when considering such questions as the observance of holidays in relation to a Steam Plant Operator's individual schedule, premium payment for working on a sixth and/or seventh day and premium payment resulting from the so-called wrap-around provision when a Steam Plant Operator rotates shifts and establishes a new weekly work schedule providing different days off.
Both Supervision of the Steam Ptant and the Steam Plant Operators themselves have principally relied upon Che schedule as published to establish an Employee's sixth and seventh days without regard to the schedule an Employee may actually have worked. Departures from the published schedule have basically been perceived as temporary interruptions in an Employee's normal schedule with the Employee's days off for premium pay purposes being determined by the published schedule.
271
Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding
A certain amount of confusion with respect to payment of Employees has resulted on occasion, particularly when an Employee’s actual Schedule is different than the published schedule the first week following a normal shift change. When this occurs, an Employee’s actual days off a re different than those scheduled off by the published schedule and the question then becomes which are his days off for premium pay purposes when worked.
The Company's interest has been to develop scheduling rules which are basically fair. understandable and capable Of consistent administration. In discussions with representatives of the Bargaining Committee, the following understandings were arrived at as the interpretation of Article Vfll, Section I (e) which will be observed by both the Company and the Union in determining an individual Steam Plant Operator’s sixth and seventh days for premium pay purposes.
(I)	A Steam Plant Operator's sixth and seventh days shall be determined by the schedule actually worked the first week worked following a change in shifts on the occasion of normal shift rotation (normally occurring every four weeks, 28 consecutive calendar days).
(2)	tn most instances, the schedule actually worked by a Steam Plant Operator will be the schedule published. However, where the schedule actually worked the first week worked following a normal shift rotation is different than the published schedule, the schedule worked shall control.
(3)	A Steam Plant Operator's sixth and seventh days as determined by the schedule actually worked the first week worked following a normal shift change shall remain unchanged for the duration of that shift rotation period.
(4)	When a Steam Plant Operator works seven consecutive calendar days the first week worked following a change in shift, the
212	j
______________ _________________ I
Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding determination of his days off that week is entirely academic and would not affect the amount of pay received. The days off for premium pay purposes the remainder of that four week sh ift change period shall be the days actually scheduled off the following week, which will normally be those identified as his sixth and seventh days on the published schedule (except where a Steam Plant Operator may have been assigned to the shift assignment and work schedule of another),
(5)	A Steam Plant Operator rotating from the swing shift on the occasion of a shift change, observes a three day weekend as a product of the schedule. Oa that occasion, the three days scheduled off ate no t identified as either sixth or seventh days, however, a Steam Plant Operator scheduled to work cm oik or more of the three days will be paid as follows’.
(a)	if the Steam Plant Operator is scheduled to work on
the first of the three days scheduled off (always a calendar Sunday), he will receive double time.
(b)	If the Steam Plant Operator is scheduled to work only the following Monday or only the following Tuesday, he would receive either time and one-half for Monday or double time for Tuesday and his days off would remain Monday and Tuesday.
(c)	If a Steam Plant Operator is scheduled to work both
that Monday and that Tuesday and as a result works seven consecutive calendar days that week, bis premium pay and days off the remainder of that four week shift rotation period would be determined as provided in paragraph 4 above.
(d)	If a Steam Plant Operator works both that Monday
and that Tuesday and then takes two other days off
213
Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding
that week, his days off the remainder of the four week shift rotation period will be die days actually scheduled off as provided in paragraph I above;
(5)

During any shift rotation period, a Steam Plant Operator may be reassigned to a different shift and/or actually take different days-off than his sixth and seventh days as determined above, however, his days off for premium pay purposes will be those determined by his fust week worked following a normal shift rotation and he will be paid the applicable premium whenever he works on such days.
Since the sixth and seventh days of a Steam Plant Operator will remain unchanged for the duration of a shift rotation period, a change in shift assignment and/or days actually taken off during the four week period, will not establish new sixth and seventh days and will not result in premium pay for any day worked as a sixth and seventh day other than the sixth and seventh days identified above.
In addition to the understandings set forth above, when a Steam Plant Operator has a built in sixth day or holiday in his work schedule, the work on such day shall be distributed among all Steam Plant Operators in accordance with Article VIII, Section 6 (c).Such distribution will not be scheduled in other than eight (8) hour increments, unless it is an extension of a regular work shift. Neither shall such distribution generate additional premium pay. It is also recognized that the nature of the work schedule may not permit such distribution.

Dear Pat:
During the 1977 negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed the impact of technological progress on the job responsibilities of unit and nan-unit personnel. The Union's specific concern centered on the problems which arise due to the fact that some work assignments performed by non-unit personnel, specifically certain technicians and/or engineers, are similar to work assignments performed by unit personnel. During 1983 negotiations, the parties discussed the rapid emergence of robots, computers and higher technological machinery and the fact that the Company is willing to respond io the effects that this high technological movement could have on unit employees. During the 1986 negotiations, the parties continued to discuss the continued development of new technology and the Company's commitment to train and to provide the prop-
216
Exhibit £ - Letters of Understanding er educational tools to bargaining unit employees so that their skills may progress through and with such new technologies.
During the 1989 negotiations, the parties discussed the importance of developing, implementing and maintaining learning programs and the evaluation of such programs on an ongoing basis in order to keep pace with the ongoing needs and requirements of the workplace. The Company will continually monitor and report to the Union the progress, usage and assessment of these educational programs.
During the 1992 negotiations the patties discussed the importance of continuing to produce the Maytag brand clothes washer and clothes dryer in Newton, Iowa. The parties also discussed the various restrictions on management in moving its plants and transferring work from the plants presently contained in their labor agreement. In this regard Management stated its desire to mamtam employment and productivity levels in Newton, Iowa and hopefully increase the production of washers and dryers in the Newton, Iowa plants over the term of the labor agreement. In the discussions pertaining to technological improvements, management stated that such improvements and increased productivity should permit the Company to provide employees an employment package which is likely to increase in cost even though there may not be com* mensurate increases in the selling price of the products manufactured. In this way, technology should be able io create or maintain jobs and improve the working conditions of bargaining unit employees.
When new equipment is being installed or when substantial new modifi* cations are being made to existing equipment by the vendor (or its representatives) and it is detemtined that portions of this work relate to future maintenance antVor repair functions of such equipment that will be assigned to electricians, machine repairers or other unit skilled trades, such appropriate unit skilled tradesmen will be allowed to observe and participate in the installation and/Or modification (at the direction of the vendor's representatives and/or the Company) for the time necessary to become familiar with such equipment.

Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding
The Company agrees that a committee consisting of not more than three Union representatives and three Company representatives will be established and will meet al mutually agreed upon times to discuss such subjects as (I) the job impact resulting from the introduction of new technologies; (2) the nature and scope of such technological changes; (3) training needs and, if such new technology results in the layoff of more than 5% of those employees then eligible for SUB, the portion of such needs to be paid by the Company; (4) possible safety problems resulting in the introduction of new technology and (5) plans for future introduction of new technologies. Requests for meetings will be referred directly to the Manager of Human Resources
The Company recognizes the seriousness of the Union's concern and will make every effort to examine and evaluate assignments given to these non-unit personnel in order to avoid improper assignments within the framework and intent of Article 1, Section 2 of the Labor Agreement
Any dispute alleging improper work assignments to non-unit employees may be made the subject of a grievance by the Union.

During the 1980 negotiations, discussions were held concerning the fourth week of vacation pay for employees who go on a medical leave prior to thrtr scheduled fourth week vacation period.
It was agreed to allow automatic waiver of the fourth week of vacation up to the end of an employee’s last scheduled work day preceding the scheduled vacation period. Such a procedure allows an employee the opportunity io waive his fourth week of vacation up to the last possible point in time and avoid loss of one week of Accident and Sickness payments. Contrastingly, an employee who goes on medical leave following the end of his last scheduled workday would not be allowed to waive bis fourth week of vacation and would lose one week of Accident and Sickness payments.
This arrangement would not apply to the scheduled winter and summer vacation shutdown periods, nor under any circumstance related to employees with less than four weeks of vacation entitlement
In the event an employee desires additional time away from the job, such may be arranged in accordance with the provisions of Article XI, Leaves of Absence, Section t, General Leaves, of the current Labor Agreement.

Newton, Iowa 10206
Dear Pat:
During 1992 negotiations and 1993 contract modification discussions, the parties discussed the potential benefits of voluntary increased involvement of employees in mutters ufieciing their work. Employee involvement, we agreed, holds promise for aiding and expanding effons-of the Company and the Union to improve employee safety and working conditions, as well as quality and production efficiency, improvements which will contribute towards increasing our products competitiveness in the market place.
236
I
Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding The parties agreed that implementation of employee involvement would benefit all by striving to achieve the following goals:
•	Provide new and better ways for production and maintenance employees, supervision and management staff Io work closer together for improved safety, quality and production efficiencies.
•	Provide an improved atmosphere which promotes dignity and pride in workmanship and quality.
•	Encourage participation of all Maytag, Newton Laundry Products people to express their ideas to identify and solve problems of mutual interest and thus have more input in decisions that ate made.
•	Enhance job security for all Maytag, Newton Laundry Products employees as a result of improved quality and productivity.
Because both parties recognize that our job security and standard of living depends on our ability to provide maximum customer value, all employees may be involved and included in managing the processes within their areas of responsibility.
It is agreed that teams may be formed, trained, and utilized throughout the facility, as needed, in order to continuously improve the Company's processes (the way we do things}. Any employees involved in training, meetings, or similar activities will be compensated using Code 89.
These teams will be empowered to focus on the elimination of waste which would include, but not be limited lo, the fallowing items:
Safety &. Housekeeping	Scheduling (Prod. & Shifts)
Scrap	Materials
Time (Labor Efficiencies)	Unacceptable Quality
Energy	Excessive inventories
237
Exhibit B - Letters of Understanding
The Company and the Union recognize that the objective of continuous improvement is to provide customer value by improving the quality of processes and increasing labor efficiency. The ultimate goat is to increase the demand for products by increasing customer value. While the Company must continue to make adjustments to the work force for labor efficiencies resulting from technological changes, economic conditions, and competitive make or buy decisions which have a critical impact on our ability to compete, as well as, for other reasons as we have in the past, the Company nevertheless recognizes that employee involvement activities can also result in improved labor efficiency. Therefore, the Company agrees that any labor efficiency gained as a direct result of employee involvement team activity will be absorbed through norma) anrilion (quits, deaths, discharge, etc.) In addition, the Company will discuss the impact of Make vs Buy decisions upon the work force prior to implementing a change.
When such employee involvement activities result in labor efficiencies, the most junior employees following a plantwide downgrade will be placed in a labor pool and will be utilized to fill in for a multitude of labor needs (i.c., vacation, leaves, etc.). For example; assume the Labor pool is ten (10) and production increases such that fifty (50) additional people are required,, forty (40) wi)J be hired and the pool of ten (10) utilized to meet the total of fifty (5ft). If production decreases, and there is a need to reduce the work force by fifty (50), forty (40) people will be laid off and the pool will be reestablished at ten (10). Attrition and/or tabor efficiencies gained from employee involvement activities will result in additions to, or subtractions from the pool.
