A claim by a staff member, group of staff members or the Association, hereinafter referred to as a "grievant", that there has been a violation of any provision of this Agreement may be processed as a grievance as hereinafter provided, so long as the dispute deals with the interpretation or application of the terms of this Agreement
If a number of grievances are filed involving the same issuefs), the first such’ grievance filed shall continue to be processed as precedent and all similar grievances held in abeyance. When such grievance is resolved, the remaining grievants and the Superintendent, or designee, shall review the grievances held in abeyance in an effort to resolve them. If any such grievance cannot be settled on the basis of the precedent grievance, it shall be further processed in accordance with the grievance procedure.
PROCEDURE: Grievances will be processed as rapidly as possible with the number of days Indicated at each step to be considered as mandatory maxima. Time limits under unusual circumstances may be extended by mutual consent.
A staff member will first discuss an alleged grievance with his/her immediate supervisor either privately or accompanied by an Association representative if desired.

If the grievant wishes to file a formal grievance, he/she shall invoke the formal grievance procedure through the Association on the Grievance Form (See Appendix E). The grievance form must specify the article and specific language, if possible, of the Collective Bargaining Agreement that has allegedly been violated. A copy of the grievance form shall be delivered to the immediate supervisor. The building principal will be considered the "immediate supervisor" for staff members assigned to a particular school building. The "immediate supervisor" for itinerant staff members will be the administrator who is most closely responsible for matters pertaining to the alleged grievance. If a staff member is in doubt as to whom the "immediate supervisor11 is as it relates to the alleged grievance, the staff member may meet with the Superintendent or designee to make that determination.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE HIGHLINE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE HIGHLINE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE (ESL) STUDENT RATIO.
The Association and the District agree that the ESL student ratio of 18 to 1 shall be implemented in the following manner:
A.	ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS:
1.	A multiple school ESL center will consist of all the classes within a
geographical area.
2.	In each ESL center an FTE teacher will be authorized for each eighteen (18) FIE students.
3.	The maximum number of students in an ESL classroom will be twenty-one (21).
4.	A student who is mainstreamed up to one (1) hour per day is considered an FTE
student for purposes of allocation.
5.	No ESL center will include more than three of the four language "levels" by which English competence is defined.
6.	Every ESL class will be limited to a maximum of three grade levels.
7.	In addition to the teacher, any single teacher ESL center will qualify for a .S
FTE teacher aide at sixteen (16) FTE students.
8.	All elementary ESL classes north of 152nd Street shall be considered as a single ESL center for purposes of staffing.
B.	SECONDARY SCHOOLS: Because of its larger student population,, the typical secondary school program consists of more ESL classrooms than does its elementary counterpart. Because of its more complicated scheduling pattern, the number of students in a given ESL teacher's class might vary greatly from period to period throughout the day. Therefore, the secondary school equivalent of the sixteen to one (16:1) student teacher ratio would be a daily class load of eighty (80) students. A total of one hundred twenty (120) daily students (the equivalent of twenty-four (24) self-contained students would be the maximum number before an additional teacher is obtained.	.
140
Appendix F (cent.)
For purposes of staffing and budgeting, any studcut enrolled two or mote periods per day in an ESL class is considered an FIE ESL student, since such a student will require additional teacher help in the non-ESL classes into which they are mainstreamed. The difference between this total ESL figure and the actual F.T.E. students scheduled into ESL classes may be applied to the provision of additional mainstream or ESL support as determined by the ESL program director and the school principal, in accordance with the following formula:
30 FTE students -1.0 FTE mainstream teacher; or,	.
16 FTE students - 1,0 FTE ESL teacher; or,
5 FTE students - LO FTE teacher aide; or, a combination of the above.

Letter of Agreement
Between the Highline Education Association and the Highline School District
Regarding
The Continuation of the Joint HE A-HSD Special Education Research and Review Committee
A special education research and review committee will be established to make recommendations to our bargaining teams for the creation, piloting and adoption of a Highline special education staffing model; and to provide for ongoing dialogue between staff and the Special Education Department about staffing.
The committee will consist of at least six HE A appointed representatives, e.g, selfcontained, resource room, specialist; elementary and secondary; general education; the director of special education, and. other building and ERAC administrators. The committee will invite HASSP representative(s) and other interested and affected parties to participate. The committee will select co-chairs.
Research Process
As part of its research duties, the committee will:
a)	identify districts with which to compare staffing models;
b)	consider budget parameters;
c)	visit and/or interview representatives from Highline schools and other districts to learn about the staffing models;
d)	communicate with and invite feedback regularly from Highline general and special education staff;
e)	explore management and financial strategies for handling unexpected developments during budget periods {for example, creating a. reserve fund or balancing staff at midyear);
f)	carry out other tasks the committee deems appropriate.
Research Timelines
The goal of this process is to piiot/implement a staff allocation model for special education tn the 2002-2003 year. The committee will recommend to the bargaining teams:
1)	By January 1 - options for the total number of special education staff based on research of peer districts.
2)	By January 1 • a staffing model for meeting special education student needs.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT Between The Highline Education Association And The Highline School District
Regarding
The Continuation of the RESEARCH COMMITTEE FOR 2001-02
In order to thoroughly research and study fundamental issues affecting the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the District and the Association agree to create the research committees described below. These committees will conduct research according to their charge and make recommendations to the Joint bargaining teams by the dates indicated.
Composition of Committees
Each committee will consist of at least six members, three appointed by the district and three by the association. If the committee or the parties determine that a larger committee is needed, the additional members shall be appointed in equal numbers by the District and the Association. Each committee will be co-chaired by a District and an Association representative selected by the committee members.
Charge to the Committees
1.	Appendix D: Additional Pay for Additional Time/Responsibilities
The joint Association/District Appendix D committee finished their report to the district and association in June, 2001. The committee recommended three options: a) "moderate” increase; b) “large” increase and c) a "neutral” option. The neutral option included increases and decreases. For 2002-03 an amount equal to the state cost of living for Appendix D will be used create a "restructuring fund.” This fund will be used to address all three reports (neutral, moderate, large) done by the Appendix D Committee. Changes will be addressed both in Bargaining and with our constituencies during the 2001-02 school year. Changes are to be implemented for the 2002-03 school year.
2.	Compensation
Charge: Conduct research and make recommendations to facilitate the bargaining process for 2002-03 as it pertains to the compensation package.
Description: The District and the Association are in agreement about moving the compensation package toward a higher level in relation to peer school districts. A more
154

Letter of Agreement (Committees)
competitive compensation package meets the interests of both parties. There are many ways to improve the compensation package—it would be the job of this committee to conduct research and make recommendations about:	-
•	Closing the salary schedule gaps that currently exist when compared to peer districts;
*	Moving toward the median of peer districts with regard to supplemental pay, e,g. optional day% instructional materials allowance, health care premiums, and extra duty pay;
•	Using supplemental days.
Recommendation submitted by:

APPENDIX P
Domestic Partner Coverage
Details are outlined below along with common questions and answers
1)	“Domestic Partners” must qualify according to the definitions commonly accepted by the insurance carriers. Insurance carriers have addressed this issue in other districts. They all require domestic partners to verify that the relationship meets the conditions that define a long-term commitment of a partnership nature. Domestic partners are defined as: a) Sharing the same regular and permanent residence, b) Having a dose personal relationship, and
c)	Being jointly responsible for ‘basic living expenses/” and
d)	Not being married to anyone, and
e)	Being eighteen (18) years of age or older, and
f)	Not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the State of Washington, and
g)	Being mentally competent to consent to contract when the domestic partnership began,, and
h)	Being each other’s sole domestic partner and responsible for each other’s common welfare.
Parents, children and other relatives do not qualify as partners,
2)	Employees must be eligible for the district’s insurance plains). Employees not covered by a district medical insurance plan and/or part-time employees who do not qualify for medical coverage are also not able to elect coverage for a domestic partner.
3)	Employees may sign up their domestic partners for dental and vision coverage at no premium cost to the employee. Dental and vision coverage are quoted as a ‘composite’ rate.
4)	The dental and vision coverage will be a taxable benefit (unless the employee qualifies for and completes the IRS tax status exemption declaration). Generally the IRS does not recognize domestic partners as tax free ‘dependents? Therefore the district will report, as
■	added income, the value of the domestic partner benefit. Our insurance carrier has said that
■:	the value of the benefit would be 45% of the monthly premium for a partner. This would be
£	shown as added income on the employee’s year-end W-2,
.	5) Insurance rates for -partners (and partner’s dependents) are set by the various carriers. Most
insurers Have quoted partner and dependent rates at the same level as for spouse and g/	dependents. Since the employee pays the full cost of the premium, there is no cost to the
K-	pool or to other employees. For specific rates, contact the Benefits Coordinator in Human
k	Resources at 2281,
K 6) Employees may sign up their domestic partners for medical benefits provided the employee E.	pays any added cost over and above the employee’s and/or their dependents’ own coverage.
K	157
Appendix P
Domestic Partner Coverage
For example, if an employee has $50.00 left in their monthly benefit allotment, the employee may not use any of that money to cover a domestic partner. If the cost of adding medical coverage for his/her domestic partner is $300, the employee will need to pay $300 through payroll deduction.
7)	Employees may not currently use their state allocated dollars, pooled dollars, or Section 125 Flexible Benefits Account for domestic partner coverage. The state-funded benefit amount cannot be used to pay for the domestic partner’s premium. This would be considered a ‘gift of public funds’ and is prohibited by the State Constitution, Pooling cannot be used to pay the domestic partner’s premium for the same reason. The Internal Revenue Service does not allow domestic partners to be covered in the district’s Flexible Benefit Plan. Any expense for medical premiums must be taken out of the employee’s net pay.
8)	The district will extend domestic partner benefits consistent with changing legal requirements. If legal requirement changes broaden benefits for domestic partners, the benefit committee will meet to determine how best to implement that coverage. AU of the district insurance coverages are rated for the entire district rather than individual bargaining groups. Therefore, benefit changes apply to all employee groups. Obtaining separate ratings for each unit would likely increase the cost of coverage for each unit because the carrier would be taking on a larger risk relative to the size of the group.
9)	Employees may sign up their domestic partner/dependents during the open enrollment period. If you meet the requirements, complete the following affidavit form and the appropriate medical enrollment forms. For questions contact the Benefits Coordinator in Human Resources at 2281.

Those participating in the 21s1 Century program will be compensated at $13.78 per hour.

AFTERWORD
Interest Based Problem Solving
Although this section is not a part of the collective bargaining agreement, this material is referred to frequently and is included here for ready reference,
HEA and USD have worked together since 1998 to develop our skills in interest based problem solving. We are still learning how and when to use the interest based approach.
Attached to this section is an excerpt written by the consultants who have helped us in this process, John and Carol Glaser (used by permission).
HEA and HSD leadership refer frequently to this material in our working through negotiations and in resolving othes issues. We recommend and encourage the use of these materials at the building and classroom levels as well.

eg°tiations And Problem Solving
KEY ELEMENTS OF EFFECTIVE NEGOTIATIONS AND PROBLEM SOLVING
An inquiry approach to problem solving and negotiations is designed to bring problem solvers on both, sides of an issue together in a relationship that encourages cooperation instead of competition. Rather than imposing positions, or favorite solutions on one another, the parties work together to find the best possible solution. This active process involves a thorough understanding of each other's motivations, and then a creative and purposeful search for "what ought to be. "
These strategies, popularized in Getting To Yes by Roger Fisher and William Ury, are useful, even in the hands of a single practitioner who can use them to work with the most adversarial individuals to achieve mutually acceptable outcomes. When they are adopted broadly within the culture of an organization., they become an extremely powerful set of tools for achieving broad-based change and producing highly satisfactory results on some of the thorniest problems. This is a process intended to be used flexibly and intuitively, to facilitate the search for joint solutions, either on an organizational or a personal level The key elements can be summarized as follows:
Understanding the Problem, - Tell the story, understand the interests, define the question! issues that need to be resolved, know your alternatives (what will happen if you can't reach an agreement).
Searching For Solutions - Work as one team while generating options to address the question and meet the identified interests.
Reaching Agreements - Work together to a consensus solution. Plan and implement the agreement.
Reflection - Monitor the solution to evaluate its effectiveness and to ensure continued alignment with the circumstances, including the organizational vision. Make changes as needed.

UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
1.	Stay an the same team and focus on common goals- The configuration of the room helps problem solvers to work as a team to focus on the problem, rather than as separate teams focusing on each other.
2.	Tell the story and clarify the data. Put problems before answers. (What's going on?}
3.
5.
Identify the underlying interests (the underlying motivations for what each party wants from the negotiations) by probing the positions of all parties. (Ask why)
•	Look for the separate and common interests for all stakeholders. Discover your interests as well as theirs.
•	It's easier to reconcile interests than positions.
•	Focus on interests, not positions. (There is more than one way to satisfy interests.)
•	There are often multiple interests.
•	"Seek first to understand."
Sift the data and define the problem^) which should be resolved together. (What needs to be addressed?)
*	Is it well defined?
•	Does it reflect the circumstances?
•	Is it solvable?
■	Is it objectively stated so all parties can agree on what needs to be resolved?
Know your alternatives (What will happen if no agreement is reached)
• Think of these as "unilateral options" which become a baseline measure of success for any potential solution.

-■ Select your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement),
SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS
!■ Generate options (Possibilities the parties can implement together to address the problem and the interests),
•	Generate an ample number and variety based on the interests,
•	Look for the "other" right answer By checking assumptions.
•	Separate inventing from judging; no evaluation, commitment, or ownership.
•	Look for mutual gain, trying to satisfy the interests of each, at least acceptably, and "dovetailing" interests, when possible.
■	Work as one team and stay on the same page.
2. A search for options should include a search for mutually acceptable, objective standards (independent of the will of the parties) based upon, measurability, legitimacy, and impartiality.
REACHING AGREEMENTS '
1.	Evaluate options
•	Reduce and clarify the identified options, eliminating duplication and those lacking substantial support.
*	Select from the remaining options by determining which best meet the identified and prioritized interests.
*	"Experiment" together with the most promising combinations of options
•	Any solution, should be better than either party's perceived BATNA.
2.	Baridg-shd-EPmntit
*	Identify the potential for agreement and develop a "straw design."
*	Cheek for "yesability," amending the design, as needed to better meet the interests, and propose closure when "criticism" has been resolved.
•	Make commitments (to a solution) that are: realistic, credible, thorough, specific, and compliance-prone.
•	Develop a plan that cultivates constituency ownership.
•	Implement the solution and monitor commitments.

REFLECTION
1.	Evaluate the effectiveness of the solution.
2.	Make any changes necessary to align the implemented solution with the organizational vision.
3.	Revisit the assumptions, values, beliefs and interests.
4.	Focus on learning. (What can be done in the future rather than who can be blamed for failures in the past?)
The process chart below, represents a set of tools which can be used by participants to move deliberately and rationally through the problem-solving process. Individuals and groups preparing to negotiate will define the problem, consider the interests of all stakeholders, generate some possible options (carefully avoiding selecting a favorite) and select a "BATNA" from the alternatives.
Actual work among all the stakeholders will revisit the problem and interests, and a more extensive search for solutions. As BATNA's are often perceived to be coercive, they are usually only discussed if they are needed to help the parties understand, the consequences if agreement can't be reached. Once an acceptable solution has been found, the parties move toward commitment and implementation.
