ARTICLE VIII
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
8.01 This grievance procedure is designed to insure adequate and appropriate solution of grievances, as hereinafter defined, at the lowest possible administrative level.
8.02	A grievance is defined as an alleged violation regarding the interpretation or application of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.
8.03 A complaint is any matter of dissatisfaction which an employee has with any respect of his/her employment which does not involve any grievance as defined in 8.02. It is recognized by the parties that employees who feel that they have a justifiable complaint may register this complaint with the principal or immediate supervisor. Such complaint shall be extended in writing. In the event that the employee is dissatisfied with the principal's or immediate supervisor's response, the complaint may be brought to the Executive Director of Human Resources.
8.04 The term "days" when mentioned in this grievance procedure shall mean working days; thus, weekends or non-employment days are excluded. The first day shall be the next complete working day following receipt of the grievance by the appropriate party or receipt of an answer by the aggrieved. The grievance must be submitted within twenty (20) days of the incident which gives rise to the problem. Each occurrence of a disputed interpretation or application constitutes a new grievance. Disputed pay practices are subject to legal limits.
8.05 Initiation or withdrawal of a grievance shall in no way reflect upon the employee's professional standing or loyalty to the school, department, or other organizations to which he/she is responsible. Neither shall it be considered a reflection upon his/her supervisor, or upon the general administration of the School or Department. All parties to a grievance must be assured of freedom from restraint, coercion, discrimination or reprisal.
8.06 Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the number of days indicated at each level should be considered as a maximum and every reasonable effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits specified may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.
8.07 In the event that a grievance is filed at such a time that it cannot be processed through all of the steps in this procedure by the end of the school term, the parties will, upon receipt of written request of the

alleged aggrieved, make an effort to reduce the time limits set forth herein so that the grievance procedure may be exhausted prior to the end of the school term if possible.
8.08 In the event a grievance is fded so that sufficient time as stipulated under all levels of the procedure cannot be provided to pursue the grievance to all levels of the appeals, then said grievance shall be resolved in the new school term in September under the terms of the Agreement in effect at the time the grievance was initiated.
8.09 When used in 8.09, the aggrieved shall mean "the grievant and/or Association Representative". Any grievance as defined in paragraph 8.02 above, shall be processed as follows:
a.	Step 1 - Within twenty (20) days of the incident that gives rise to the problem, the aggrieved party shall present the grievance orally to the principal or immediate supervisor. (8.04)
b.	Step 2 - If the response of the administrator does not satisfactorily resolve the grievance in Step 1, it shall be presented by the aggrieved to the principal or immediate supervisor within five (5) days of the administrator's Step 1 response. At this and all succeeding steps, such advancement of the grievance shall be in writing as outlined in Section 8.13 of the Agreement. The principal or immediate supervisor shall respond in writing within five (5) days of receipt of the grievance.
c.	Step 3 - If the grievance is not resolved satisfactorily under Step 2 above, it shall be advanced to the Superintendent, or his/her designee, within five (5) days of receipt of the administration's response in Step 2 above. The Superintendent, or his/her designee, shall respond in writing within five (5) days of receipt of the grievance.
d.	Step 4 - If the grievance is not resolved satisfactorily under Step 3 above, it shall be advanced by the aggrieved to the Board of Education within five (5) days of receipt of the Superintendent's response in Step 3 above. Within twenty (20) days of receipt of the grievance, the Board of Education shall meet with the aggrieved. Within fifteen (15) days of this meeting, the Board shall render its response in writing. Step 4 of the grievance procedure shall be held in abeyance for the term of this Agreement. If either party wishes it reinstated at the conclusion of this Agreement, the inclusion of Step 4 shall be considered the status quo for bargaining purposes.
e.	If the grievance is not resolved in Step 4, it may be advanced within ten (10) days by the Association to compulsory, final, and binding arbitration. The Association will request the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission to submit a panel of five (5) arbitrators from which the parties shall alternately strike names until one name shall remain. The Association shall strike first.
f.	The Board and the Association shall share equally any costs of the arbitration proceeding except those costs arising out of their own preparation, witness fees or expenses, or representation costs. It is understood that the function of the arbitrator shall be to provide a ruling as to the interpretation and/or application of specific terms of the Agreement. This arbitrator shall have no power to advise on salary adjustments, except the improper application thereof, nor to issue any opinion advising the parties to add to, subtract from, modify or amend any terms of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties except as forbidden by law.
8.10 Initiation of Group Grievances. To avoid multiple filing of grievances by employees with identical claims, the Association may process the grievance commencing with Step 3.
8.11 Hearings held under this procedure shall be conducted at a time and place which will afford a fair and reasonable opportunity for all persons entitled to be present to attend. In the case of a group of grievants, a representative shall be selected by the group to represent them. Grievance meetings are

ARTICLE XIII
TEACHING HOURS AND TEACHING LOADS
13.01 The normal work day shall consist of eight (8) consecutive hours, including one-half (1/2) hour duty free lunch, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
13.02 It is assumed that the routine assignments necessary to run a good school will be shared equitably by all and that extra pay will not be granted for these duties. Notwithstanding other provisions of this article, routine assignments may be made and/or meetings may extend beyond the school day. In any event, the total of these shall be limited to two (2) hours per week on a monthly average.
13.03 Divergence from the regular school day, by an individual teacher, after the school day, for mutually understood and agreed upon professional and/or administrative reasons shall be agreed upon between principals and teachers.
13.04 The work year of teachers covered by the classroom teachers' salary schedule shall be determined by the official school calendar. Teachers shall be paid additional compensation for employment prior to or after the dates scheduled on the official school calendar.
13.05 Teachers shall be required to attend staff meetings at the call ofthe appropriate administrative person. Every reasonable effort will be made to limit the number and length of such meetings. It is recognized by the Association and the Board that attendance of teachers at parent-teacher organization meetings is beneficial to the educational program and to the image of both teachers and the District. Teachers shall make every reasonable effort to attend PTO meetings, but attendance shall not be mandatory. Attendance at one Open House annually shall be mandatory.
13.06 The normal teaching load in schools serving grades 7-12 will include ten (10) preparation periods per week. Preparation periods shall be equal in length to a class period. Except as provided in 13.02 above, any variation in scheduling shall not have the effect of reducing the preparation time of the teacher. It is the intent of the parties that the high school principals and their teachers work during the term of this Agreement to establish a workable hall supervision program based upon a spirit of cooperation, volunteerism, equity, and professional responsibility. It is understood that occasional supervision may be assigned without pay during periods of high need.
13.07 The Board understands the desirability of keeping the number of distinct preparations by each teacher in grades 7-12 to a minimum, preferably no more than two preparations. If the individual teacher desires an explanation of his/her assignment, it will be granted by the immediate supervisor. If the teacher is not satisfied, he/she may seek recourse through the complaint procedure.
13.08 Preparation time for regular elementary classroom teachers (K-6) will normally include the following minutes of preparation time per week:
Kindergarten-2 sections = 690
Kindergarten-all day = 560

Included in the above are:
350 minutes per week of before and after school time for all regular and special education classroom teachers.
140 minutes per week of elementary specialists for kindergarten.
210 minutes per week of elementary specialists for grades 1-3.
230 minutes per week of elementary specialists for grades 4-6.
Elementary special education teachers shall collaborate with their principal, chairperson, and executive director, if necessary, to build an appropriate amount of preparation time into their schedules.
The amount of time built into elementary level special education classroom teacher’s schedule shall be based on a number of factors. Factors may include, but are not limited to, the age range of the students, the organization of the program (example: a wide range grade 1-6 program vs. a program clustered at 2-3 grades), the amount of direct instruction vs. individual support in class, the degree of severity of disability of the students, the level of teacher aide support, the number of buildings served, any teaming requirements, the amount of technology to assist with required reports and lesson preparation an the number of annual, triennial, and initial IEP’s per year. Attempts by all involved in lEP’s will be made to schedule lEP’s during the regular staff working hours if mutually convenient with parents and other IEP team members.
It is understood by the parties that scheduling on particular days, or during a particular week, may necessitate the reduction of the above mentioned number of minutes. It is understood that certain duties and responsibilities attach themselves to the regular school day. When these responsibilities become a concern regarding time or function, collaboration with the building principal shall occur. It is further understood that calculation of this preparation time shall be based on the regular teacher workday excluding the thirty (30) minute duty free lunch period.
13.09 Whenever elementary physical education, art and music teachers are on personal illness, family or personal leave and no substitute teacher can be found, classroom teachers will be compensated at the rate identified in Appendix A, Section D, Paragraph 3.
13.10 The lunch period of traveling teachers shall not be reduced to less than one-half (1/2) hour duty free lunch provided in Section 12.01 of this Agreement. If no alternative to travel during the lunch period is available, the provisions of 12.02 shall prevail.
13.11 Teachers may take up to four students per semester in an Independent Study Option (ISO). ISO’s will be undertaken on a voluntary basis with the consent of a teacher. ISO’s will be approved by the building adminitrator.
a.	Teachers must meet an equivalent of once per week with each student and, will provide a written record of contact with students upon the request of the building administrator.
b.	Teachers who agree to undertake ISO’s will be compensated 8 hours of release time, per semester, available any time after completion of the ISO(s). Compensated time will be taken at a time mutually agreed upon between the teacher and building administrator, preferably during non-contact days (excluding parent teacher conferences and staff development days)
c.	Teachers will honor all deadlines that may happen to coincide with compensation time awarded

ARTICLE XIV
CLASS SIZE
14.0	1 The Board, as well as the Association, recognizes that class size and pupil load are important factors in good education. In order to ensure that class size and pupil load are of the most effective nature for both teacher and pupil, the Board will, whenever possible, consider space availability and all other educational considerations, including the recommendations of the professional staff, in establishing class sizes and pupil loads.
14.0	2 It is recognized that mainstreaming must be a consideration in establishing class size and pupil load. Therefore, the following factors shall be considered in the process of establishing the individual teacher's class size and pupil load:
a.	the number of students mainstreamed into the individual classroom and the total number of students that will result from the placement of mainstreamed students in that classroom,
b.	the nature and the degree of severity of the disability of each mainstreamed student,
c.	the special assistance required for each mainstreamed student,
d.	the additional workload or increase in hours required by the addition of mainstreamed students to the classroom, ie. oral or written reports, lEP's, parental conferences,
e.	the special services available to the teacher.
It is understood that it is the responsibility of the classroom teacher and the special education teacher to keep principals and other appropriate administrators advised of developing situations of concern so that adjustments can be made. Examples of adjustments that might be considered would include, but not be restricted to:
1.	A reduction in class size
2.	Revision of aide time
3.	Additional preparation time
4.	Additional secretarial help
5.	Inservice training
6.	Special administrative assistance
7.	Resource teacher assistance
8.	Adjustment in program requirements
9.	Adjustment of schedule

b.	the part-time employee has the appropriate certificate for the vacancy and wishes to be interviewed for the position.
Application of this section shall be limited to those part time employees who notify the Executive Director of Human Resources that they wish to be considered for full- time employment. Said notice must be renewed annually.
15.07 Initial Educators new to the District will be assigned a mentor by the building administrator.

TRANSFERS
16.01 The Superintendent is responsible for the assignment of instructional personnel. It is therefore the responsibility ofthe Superintendent and/or the Executive Director of Human Resources to effect all transfers, reassignments, or relocations involving instructional staff members. Reassignment of staff members may become necessary to meet changing enrollments, instructional requirements, or staff new buildings. There may be other acceptable reasons, including the granting of a request of an employee who desires to change his/her place of employment within the system. When, in the best interest of the school system, a transfer of a teacher from one position to another is required, the teacher will be given reasons, in writing, for the change as early as possible before the change is to be effected. Reasons for the transfer will be expressly explained to the teacher.
16.02 Although the Board and the Association recognize that some transfer of teachers from one school to another is unavoidable, they also recognize that frequent transfer of teachers is disruptive to the educational process and interferes with optimum teacher performance. Therefore, they agree as follows:
a.	When a reduction in the number of teachers in a school is necessary, volunteers will be considered first.
b.	When involuntary transfers are necessary, a teacher's area of competence, major and/or minor field of study, quality of teaching performance and length of service in the School District of Waukesha will be considered in determining which teacher is to be transferred.
c.	When program changes such as 6-3-3, or the opening or closing of a building result in multiple transfers, time sequences and procedures shall be established that clearly identify program requirements and allow for volunteers to express their desires. Wherever it is reasonably possible, voluntary transfers will be used to reduce the number of involuntary transfers. In the event that there are more volunteers or insufficient volunteers to meet staffing needs, the provisions of 16.02b shall be applied in determining the qualifications of potential transferees. Among equally qualified individuals the most senior teacher shall be given the option of available positions.
d.	A teacher involuntarily transferred or denied a voluntary transfer under the provisions of 16.02c shall be given preferential treatment in a future transfer request to any open position for which they are properly certified and make timely application. It is understood that the provisions included in 16.02b will continue to be legitimate considerations when preferential treatment is applied. In the event that such teacher has experience in the District in the course for which there is a vacancy, District seniority alone shall govern the transfer.
e.	An involuntary transfer will be made only after a meeting between the teacher involved and the Superintendent or designee, at which time the teacher will be notified of the reasons for the transfer. Requests by the teacher for transfer to particular positions will be given serious consideration.
f.	Notice of transfer will be given to a teacher as soon as possible and under normal circumstances, not later than June 1st.
g.	When involuntary transfers are necessary due to the implementation of lay-off pro visions of this Agreement, the teacher with the least length of service shall be the first transferred where program requirements permit.
16.03 A teacher desiring a transfer will submit a written request to the Executive Director of Human Resources stating either the assignment preferred or a general transfer request, within the area of the

16.04 Vacancies for any professional position in the School District of Waukesha shall be posted monthly in order to provide an opportunity for personnel to submit applications. Such posting shall not be interpreted as limiting the freedom of the Board to fill positions from applicants within and outside of existing staff.
ARTICLE XVII
TEACHER EVALUATION
17.01 All monitoring or observation of a teacher shall be conducted openly and with full knowledge of the teacher.
17.02 Observations will be performed only by building administrators, directors, coordinators or person authorized by the Administration. Persons not a part of the School District of Waukesha Administration shall be professionally qualified.
17.03 It shall be the responsibility of the teacher to make lesson plans available in the building. It is recognized by the parties that planning is an integral part of teaching and that planning by the teacher is a part of teacher performance. The form of the "daily" lesson plan shall not be part of the evaluation so long as satisfactory evidence of effective planning is available.
17.04 A minimum of one (1) evaluation shall be conducted once every three years for non-probationary teachers.The probationary teacher shall be evaluated a minimum of once (1) each year of probation.The evaluator for the probationary employee will make every effort to conduct the first evaluation in the first three (3) months of the school year. In no case, shall such first evaluation occur beyond the end of the first semester. Written evaluations shall be forwarded to the employee within prescribed timelines.
17.05 If the teacher is rated "Improvement Plan Required" or “Requires Job Targets” in any area, a postobservation conference must be held within five (5) working days of the observation (or of the final observation of a series). The five (5) working day schedule may be extended with mutual consent for all other ratings.
17.06 During the post-observation conference, the evaluation document will be signed and dated on the summary sheet and the individual pages will be initialed. The teacher will receive a copy of the document. The teacher has the right to attach a written statement.
17.07 A teacher will have the right, upon written request, to review the contents of any file reflecting on his/her professional status. References and placement bureau files received prior to the teacher's employment shall be treated as privileged information.
17.08 In the event the parties agree to changes in the evaluation system which are in violation of Article XVII, the parties shall meet to reconcile any differences.

It shall be the responsibility of the administration to make the employee aware of unsatisfactory performance or other possible cause for non-renewal of contract as soon as practicable after it is determined that consideration may be given to non-renewal.

1.	Be informed of the nature of the inquiry.
2.	Be given an opportunity to respond. In the event that an employee is not informed of citizen inquires as required above, such inquiries shall not be included in the employee's file nor be criteria for non-renewal.
b.	Upon determination that consideration may be given to non-renewal of contract, the employee shall be given the opportunity for conference with his/her immediate supervisor, the Executive Director of Human Resources, and/or the Superintendent regarding the matter. The employee shall have the right to invite representation of his/her choice to the conference.
c.	Fifteen (15) days prior to giving written notice of refusal to renew an employee's contract for the ensuing school year, preliminary notice shall be extended to the employee. The preliminary notice shall include:
1.	Notification that the Board is considering non-renewal of the employee's contract.
2.	Notification that the employee has a right to a conference with the Board prior to being given written notice of refusal to renew his/her contract, if the employee files a request for such conference with the Superintendent within five (5) days of receipt of the preliminary notice.
3.	Notification that the conference shall be private unless the employee specifically asks that it be public in his/her request to the Superintendent.

19.02 Teachers shall receive written final notice of layoff on or before May 15th ofthe current school year. Such notice shall include a statement ofthe employee's recall rights under this article. The District shall simultaneously provide the Association with copies of all layoff notices which it sends to employees pursuant to this section.
19.03 The layoff of each teacher shall commence on the date stipulated by the District in the layoff notice.
19.04 The teacher with the least length of continuous service to the District shall be the first terminated subject to the following considerations, and subject to other provisions of this article:
a.	Teachers in grades K-8 must be certified to fill the positions available, based on their seniority, and will be eligible for positions in grades 7-12 in their major field of training or in their minor if they have experience teaching their minor at the 7-12 level.
b.	Teachers at the 7-12 level must be certified to fill the position available based on their seniority, and in addition:
1.	They will be eligible for positions at the K-6 level only if they have teaching experience at that level.
2.	They will be eligible for positions in their minor area of training only if they have teaching experience in that area.

Such employees shall only exercise that seniority against other part-time employees and shall not bump full-time employees. The procedures and dates shall otherwise comply in all respects with this article.
19.07 No employee may be prevented from securing other employment during the period he/she is laid off under this section.

19.10	Any persons who leave the bargaining unit shall forfeit any seniority accumulated at the time of leaving the unit and, for the purpose of rehire, shall be treated as a new employee, except as provided in 19.11 below.
19.11	An employee in the Waukesha District who leaves the employee bargaining unit to become an administrator in the District, and whose administrative position is eliminated, may be returned to the bargaining unit subj ect to 19.04 (a) and (b) and will be credited with the seniority accumulated as an employee in the District.
19.12	Employees having co-curricular assignments shall not be laid off unless a qualified staff member is available and assumes the co-curricular assignment.
19.13	Full-time employees who are involuntarily reduced to part-time shall retain the full- time seniority. Although they shall accrue seniority from that point forward on the basis of the percent of a full load worked, this pro-rata portion shall be added to their full-time seniority to determine appropriate placement on the full-time list.
19.14	Full-time employees who volunteer for a reduction to part-time and for whom there is no break in service shall have their full time seniority frozen. From that point forward, they shall accrue seniority on the basis of the percent of a full load worked. They may exercise that seniority only against other part-time employees; however, should they get laid off from the part-time position they shall have the right to exercise their full-time seniority against other less senior full-time employees to bump back into a full-time position.
19.15	The intent at the time of signing of this Agreement is not to increase class size through the implementation of layoff under this article. In the event that circumstances arise that necessitate layoff which will raise class size in the District as a whole, the Board and the Association shall meet to bargain the impact of that change.
19.16	The contract of an employee who is initially hired in the District under an emergency certification shall be voided pursuant to Wisconsin Statutes if that employee fails to maintain that emergency certification or receive regular certification in that same area before the commencement of the next school year.

19.17	Employees are required to maintain all areas of Department of Public Instruction non-temporary certifications, with which they were hired, for a period of ten years. After that time, employees may deactivate a certification in which they have not actively taught for a period of five (5) years.

b.	Employees who plan to take early retirement shall notify the Superintendent, or designee, of their intent to do so by October 1st for retirement at the end of the first semester of the current school year, and by February 1 st, for retirement at the end of the second semester. The actuarial reduction form must be completed and returned by the above dates.
c.	Limitations: Unless otherwise specified, employees shall only be permitted to retire under this policy at the end of a semester.
d.	Contribution: For employees with at least twenty (20) years in the District, the District will
pay the actuarial reduction penalty of a retirement annuity forthe employee to a maximum of two (2) years as determined by WRS. This payment will be made in full directly to WRS upon receipt of the final calculation of the actuarial reduction penalty.

Once the dollar cap has been reached, no additional retirees will be eligible to receive the actuarial reduction payment for that year. If recalculation of the actuarial reduction payment costs would allow an employee to retire within the dollar cap amount, the employee may elect to retire without prejudice if they are otherwise eligible under 32.07(b) above.

In the event that the dollar cap is not fully expended, the residual will be used to adjust the following year’s salary schedule.
