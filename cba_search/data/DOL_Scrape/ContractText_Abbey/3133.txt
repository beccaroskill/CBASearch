ARTICLE 2
DEFINITIONS
I.	Countywide Seniority:
Includes the continuous, cumulative time spent in all the represented positions an employee has held and is used to determine layoff, bumping, and recall rights. Seniority is calculated using the rules found in Article 21.II.b.
II.	Department:
A "Department" is any organization so deemed by the Board of County Commissioners. The Office of the Sheriff and the Office of the District Attorney shall also be deemed Departments for purposes of this Agreement. Non-departmental employees currently assigned to the Office of the Chair shall be deemed in a department for purposes of this Agreement until and if they are reorganized into a departmental structure. The Labor Relations Manager shall be deemed "Department Director" for any functional purpose of this Agreement for such employees.
The County shall notify the Union no later than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of creation of a new Department of the title of the new Department and, if available, the name of the new Department Director or Acting Director.
III.	Full-time employee:
An employee regularly scheduled to work thirty-two (32) or more hours per week if on an eight (8) hour per day schedule; or an employee regularly scheduled to work thirty (30) or more hours per week if on a ten (10) hour per day schedule.
IV.	FTE, or full time equivalency:
The number of hours an employee is normally scheduled to work per week divided by forty (40). For example, the FTE for a forty (40) hour employee is 1.0; for a twenty (20) hour employee, .5.
V.	Job Sharing:
Job sharing position means a full time position that is held by two (2) employees on a shared basis, thus each employee works .5 FTE.

classification, and anniversary dates. Seniority is calculated using the rules found in Article 21.II.b. Additional Job Class Seniority rules are as follows:
A.	All continuous, contiguous service on a temporary promotion shall count toward seniority in the immediately previous classification, except in cases in which the promotion becomes permanent immediately following the temporary appointment; in these cases the time will be counted toward the classification to which the employee is promoted.
B.	Time spent on a probationary period that is not completed will count toward the employee’s previous classification, if any, unless such probationary period was in a classification outside the Local 88 bargaining unit, then such time will not count if such period is in excess of six (6) months. Time spent on a trial service period after lateral transfer that is not completed will be counted toward the previous classification.
C.	Time spent in an abolished classification that has a current equivalent will count toward seniority in the equivalent classification.
VII.	Limited Duration employee:
Limited duration appointments may be made for assignments of uncertain or limited duration. Such appointments shall be for a stated period not exceeding two (2) years but may expire earlier.
Limited duration means an employee who is regularly scheduled on a full-time or parttime basis, who receives benefits and union representation per this agreement but is excluded from layoff rights since his/her appointment from the outset is determined to be time, task and work unit limited. New employees appointed under this section will only accrue seniority pursuant to Article 21.II.B.6.
A regular employee appointed to a limited duration appointment shall be reinstated to a position in his/her former classification, looking first at vacancies within the department in which the limited duration appointment exists and then Countywide, for purposes of layoff or when the limited duration appointment ends. Regular status employees will continue to accrue seniority as if in their regular assignment and will appear on the annual seniority list in their base classification. Limited duration appointments shall be made only with the agreement between the Union and Labor Relations.
VIII.	On-Call employee:
An employee whose appointment is intermittent, irregular or is normally less than halftime is an on-call appointment. On-call appointments have no time limit. On-call employees may be terminated at any time and have no appeal rights within the County.
IX.	Part-time employee:

X.	Probationary employee:
An employee serving a one (1) year period of trial service to determine his or her suitability for continued employment, such period to begin on the date of his or her appointment to a permanent position from a certified list of eligibles. During the period of probation, the employee may be dismissed without recourse to the grievance procedure if, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor, his or her continued service would not be in the best interest of the County. The length of an employee’s probationary period may not be extended by a Memorandum of Agreement under the terms of Article 26, unless the employee was absent from work for a period of six (6) months or more previous to the extension.
XI.	Promotional Probationary employee:
A regular employee serving a six (6) month period of trial service upon promotion to determine his or her suitability for continued employment in the classification to which he or she was promoted, such period to begin on the date of his or her appointment to a higher classification from a certified list of eligibles. During the period of promotional probation, the employee shall be returned to the classification and department from which he or she was promoted, without recourse to the grievance procedure, if, in the opinion of the employee’s supervisor, his or her continued service in the classification to which he or she was promoted would not be in the best interest of the County. Subject to management approval, the employee may elect to return to their previous Department and classification.
If a newly appointed employee is promoted during his or her initial twelve (12) month probationary period (hereinafter "initial probationary period"), his or her initial probationary period shall terminate twelve (12) months from the date the employee began work in the classification from which he or she was promoted. The promotion has no effect on the initial probationary period. The promotional probationary period extends six (6) months from the date of the promotion or until the end of the initial probationary period, whichever is later. During the initial probationary period, an employee may be terminated without just cause or appeal regardless of promotion. If an employee is terminated from his or her promotional position after completing his or her initial probationary period, he or she has return rights to the classification from which he or she promoted unless dismissed for just cause.
XII.	Regular employee:
An employee who has passed the initial probationary period in effect at the time of his or her appointment, and has been employed by the County continuously since passing the

B.	A non-probationary employee who has been transferred to the County by intergovernmental agreement under ORS 236.610 through 236.650.
XII. Temporary employee:
An employee whose appointment is uncertain due to an emergency workload, absence of an employee or because of a short-term need for a skill or ability. A temporary appointment may be made for a period of up to six (6) months or one-thousand and forty (1040) hours within the preceding twelve (12) months. A temporary employee who has already worked one-thousand and forty (1040) hours may be appointed within the same twelve (12) month period to another position typically by a different Department, following a break in County service lasting fifteen (15) days or longer. A temporary employee may be re-appointed to a different position when an unforeseen circumstance requiring the employee's services arises shortly after the termination of one appointment, even when the break in service is limited. Temporary employees may be terminated at any time and have no appeal rights within the County.

working days per fiscal year, per member. An additional sixteen (16) working days of paid Union Reimbursable Time leave shall be granted upon request to any elected Union delegate selected to attend official AFL-CIO or other certified AFSCME activities. Additional paid time may be granted by mutual agreement of the parties.
Union Business (Union Reimbursable Time) addressed in this section would pertain to such activities as contract administration - such as time to cover for staff replacement, time to attend training conferences such as arbitration/grievance training; and time off to prepare for negotiations; Officers/Delegates Duties - such as attending AFSCME International Convention, Oregon AFSCME Council 75 convention, AFL-CIO Convention; Conferences/Other - Women’s Convention, appointment to AFSCME or other Union Board seat or committee; and other mutually agreed activities that would qualify for Union Business (Union Reimbursable Time).
Written notice of such time away from work shall be given to the affected employee’s immediate supervisor and to the County Labor Relations Manager five (5) working days in advance. The Union will make every effort to avoid disruptions of work. The Union shall reimburse the County for one hundred percent (100%) of the affected employees salary and fringe benefits (including pro-rata cost of workers compensation premiums, but excluding indirect administration or overhead charges) for straight time spent on Union activities conducted during regularly scheduled working hours. The County shall submit a quarterly statement to the Union itemizing the amount of the Union’s reimbursement obligation, and may directly withdraw the amount required from a fund maintained with the County. Funds for this purpose shall be maintained in a separate interest-bearing account with an initial balance of twenty-two thousand dollars ($22,000) to be replenished within ten (10) days upon notice from the County Labor Relations Manager whenever the amount falls below two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500). If the County incurs liability arising from the activities of a member engaged in Union Business during such reimbursed time, the Union further agrees to reimburse the County for losses caused by such activities, to the extent that such losses are attributable to the acts of the employee receiving continued compensation pursuant to this section. In the event of a dispute over the causation or amount of loss attributable to the actions of Union agents, the parties agree to arbitrate such dispute under Article 18.III step 4, unless such arbitration is inconsistent with the provisions of any applicable third-party insurance indemnification agreement, or unless binding arbitration might jeopardize the availability of coverage by a third-party insurer.

c.	Excessive absenteeism
The parties recognize that every employee has a duty to be reliably present at work, and that failure to confine sick leave usage to accrued and available sick leave raises the possibility of discipline for excessive absenteeism. Such cases, however, are subject to just cause review and require systematic examination of relevant factors, including but not limited to:
i.	Any legal requirements, including, but not limited to those of the FMLA or the ADA.
ii.	The tenure and work history of the employee, specifically to include whether there have been previous instances of this pattern of absenteeism.
iii.	Whether there is a likelihood of improvement within a reasonable period of time based on credible medical evidence.
iv.	The particular attendance requirements of the employee’s job.
v.	The pattern of use, and whether the absences are clearly
for bona fide sick leave purposes.
C.	Sequencing of Leaves
The use of vacation leave, saved holiday time, compensatory time, and leave without pay is subject to approval by management according to the requirements of Articles 8, 7, 14, and 10, respectively. However, unless otherwise required by law, forms of leave shall be used and exhausted in the following sequences:
1.	Leave for illness or injury, that does not qualify for FMLA will be taken in the following order:
a.	Sick leave until it is exhausted;
b.	Vacation leave, saved holiday time, or compensatory time, sequenced at the employee’s option, until they are exhausted;
c.	Leave without pay.
2.	Leave that qualifies under FMLA will be taken in the following order:
Paid leave until it is exhausted; employees will determine what order paid leave is used;
3.	Leave for other purposes will be taken in the following order:
a.	Vacation leave, saved holiday time, or compensatory time, sequenced at the employee’s option (to the extent allowed by vacation sign-up provisions) until they are exhausted;

Use of leave without pay in lieu of sick leave for non-FMLA and non-OFLA qualifying conditions is subject to the approval of management and further subject to the following provisions:
1.	Continuous leave
In the event of a continuous leave of absence without pay in excess of any legal requirement of the FMLA or OFLA, the County may require from the employee’s physician, and/or arrange for the employee to see a physician selected by the County to examine the employee and provide a statement of the disability, current condition, and the anticipated length of current absence. If the County requires the employee to see a physician it has selected, it will pay the costs. If deemed necessary by the County, such an examination shall be repeated every thirty (30) days. If management determines that continued leave would not be in the best interest of the County, then any resulting termination would be subject to review under the just cause standard as to the reasonableness of this determination. Following six (6) months of leave without pay, to include time spent on unpaid FMLA and/or OFLA leave, any extension of the leave shall be deemed permissive on the part of the County and if the employee’s leave is not extended, and the employee does not return to work, the employee will be deemed to have resigned.
2.	Intermittent leave
Intermittent leave without pay used in lieu of sick leave is not subject to the six (6) month entitlement provided for above. When such leave significantly affects an employee’s job performance and is not subject to the requirements of law (including but not limited to the FMLA), management may evaluate the employee’s use of leave according to the criteria of “Section B.2.c” above. Medical information as provided for in “Section D.1” above may be required for the evaluation. After completing the evaluation management may do one of the following:
a.	Approve a similar pattern of intermittent use of unpaid leave for a specified period followed by another evaluation; or
b.	Put the employee on a work plan to manage the use of leave without pay, followed by disciplinary action if the plan is not successfully completed; or
c.	Proceed with the disciplinary process.

Only actual hours worked will be counted when reviewing the number of hours worked to determine if an employee meets the minimum hours worked eligibility requirements to be covered under FMLA and/or OFLA. Paid time off (such as vacation leave, sick leave, and comp-time taken) does not count toward FMLA and OFLA eligibility requirements.
III. Fitness for Duty
The parties recognize that employees have the responsibility to report to work fit for duty. To ensure such fitness, management may send employees for medical or psychological examination when the supervisor reasonably believes that the employee is not fit for duty or may be a danger to themselves or others. Any such examinations will be at County expense. IV. Disability Insurance and Catastrophic Leave
A.	Disability Insurance
1.	Short term disability
Any full-time employee covered by this Agreement may participate in the short term disability insurance program developed by the Union and the County (consistent with carrier contract(s)), the monthly premium to be paid individually through payroll deduction.
2.	Long term disability
a.	All bargaining unit employees will be covered by a County-paid group long term disability insurance policy, the provisions of which will be the same as those in the UNUM group policy available to Multnomah County employees.
b.	The County will pay for COBRA medical and dental insurance coverage for a period of up to six months beyond the month in which benefits would normally terminate for an employee with an approved long-term disability claim. However, employees who "opt out" of benefits coverage under the provisions of Article 11, “Section I.D” of this Agreement will not be eligible for continued County-paid coverage under this subsection.
c.	If proposed by management and approved by the Union, changes in short term and long term disability insurance coverage will be put into effect.
B.	Catastrophic Leave Program
The Parties recognize that a Catastrophic Leave Program has been implemented which allows the donation of vacation leave, compensatory time, and saved holiday time to ill or injured employees who have exhausted all paid leave. This program may be terminated only subject to the terms and conditions of the implementing Ordinance.

I.	Unpaid Leaves of Absence
A.	Use of Leave
Leaves of absence without pay for a period of up to six (6) months may be granted by an employee’s supervisor for any reasonable purpose. The sequencing of the use of all leaves, to include leaves of absence without pay, is specified in Article 9, “Section II.C”. A separate standard for granting any leave of absence for sick leave purposes is specified in Article 9, “Section II.D”. Any time spent on unpaid FMLA or OFLA leave shall be deducted from the six (6) month period specified above. Extensions of such leaves may be granted solely at the discretion of the supervisor.
B.	Failure to Return from Leave
Except where otherwise provided by law, any employee who has been granted a leave of absence and fails to return to work within five (5) days after the expiration of said leave, shall be considered to have voluntarily resigned his or her position. However, if an employee provides evidence that he or she was unable to contact the County to request a leave extension on the date of, or subsequent to, the last day of the leave, the County shall rescind the employee's resignation. Nothing in this section is intended to prohibit application of Article 17, Disciplinary Action, in cases of absence without leave of less than five (5) days.
II.	Judicial Leave
A.	Jury Duty
1.	An employee shall be granted leave with full pay in lieu of jury fees on any scheduled day of work he or she is required to report for jury duty, if upon receipt the employee submits jury fees to Payroll. (Employees do not have to submit mileage and parking reimbursements.)
2.	Except during an emergency or due to operational requirements, the County will not require employees to report to work after completing a full day on jury duty, provided that if an employee is required to work over, any time spent on jury duty shall not be considered time worked for calculating overtime liability.
3.	An employee who is excused or dismissed from jury duty before the end of the day will report back to work if practicable.

An employee may also be returned to his or her pre-jury duty schedule with less than ten (10) days notice after jury duty ends. There shall be no additional cost to the County or days off for an employee as a result of any such schedule change.
B.	Subpoenas
1.	Time spent serving as a witness in State or Federal Court will be treated as time worked for pay purposes under the following conditions:
a.	The time served occurs during regularly scheduled working hours; and
b.	The employee is subpoenaed to testify; and
c.	The employee submits witness fees to Payroll upon receipt.
2.	Under no circumstances will employees be paid for time spent in a judicial proceeding or hearing in which they or their union is the plaintiff or the defendant, unless they are being defended and indemnified by the County for conduct occurring during the course of employment.
C.	Merit System Council Hearings
Time spent as a plaintiff or witness at a Merit System Council hearing will be treated as time worked to the extent that it occurs during regularly scheduled working hours.
III.	Military Leave
The County acknowledges its obligation under state and federal law to grant paid and unpaid leave for military training and service. Information about legally mandated military leave will be made available to employees upon request from the Department Human Resources unit.
IV.	Bereavement Leave
An employee shall be granted not more than three (3) days leave of absence with full pay in event of death in the immediate family or immediate household of the employee to make household adjustments or to attend funeral services. If such funeral is beyond three-hundred and fifty (350) miles, the employee shall be granted additional time for travel not to exceed three (3) additional days with pay. The amount of additional leave shall be at the discretion of his or her supervisor on the basis of the employee’s travel and personal needs. For purposes of Bereavement Leave, an employee's immediate family shall be defined as his or her spouse or domestic partner, parents, step-parents, children, step-children, siblings, step-siblings, grandchildren, grandparents, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law and the parents, step-parents,

In relationships other than those set forth above, under exceptional circumstances, such leave of absence may be granted by the Department director, Sheriff, or District Attorney, or their designee(s), upon request. Employees may request additional bereavement leave in accordance with “Section I” of this article.
V.	Personnel Examinations/Interviews
Employees shall be given paid time off for participating in County examinations and interviews for promotion, demotion, or transfer which occur during their regularly scheduled shift. However, paid time off will be restricted to examinations and interviews for five (5) positions per fiscal year.
VI.	Inclement Weather and Natural Disasters Policy
The County reserves the right to establish policy with respect to attendance at work during inclement weather or a natural disaster, and further reserves the right to determine whether or not an event qualifies as such an event under the terms of any such policy. Any time an employee is unable to be at work as scheduled due to such an event, may, at the employee’s discretion, be charged to:
A.	Vacation leave
B.	Saved holiday time
C.	Compensatory time
D.	Leave without pay
Provided, further, however, that an employee who attempts to get to work in such a County declared event, but is unavoidably delayed, shall not have time charged to one (1) of the above categories unless he or she is two (2) or more hours late, in which event all time late will be charged. The provisions of Article 13, “Section II, Right to Compensation for Regularly Scheduled Hours” will apply to instances in which employees report to work to a closed facility, or are otherwise specifically notified by the County that their facility is closed, and the employee is not reassigned.

d.	Joint Committee on 30 Hour Employees
The parties recognize that the current structure for employees who work thirty (30) hours but less than thirty-two (32) hours per week should be reviewed and modified. The parties agree to form a joint labor management committee to review the feasibility of modifying the benefits structure for employees who are regularly scheduled to work thirty (30) hours per week but less than thirty-two (32) hours. The committee is specifically charged with exploring the feasibility of options for cost sharing. In proposing changes, the committee shall give consideration to increased costs to the County, ease of administration, the current contract provisions for premium reimbursement, and consistent treatment of all benefit eligible part-time employees. The Committee shall convene no later than forty-five (45) days following the Board of County Commissioners ratification of this agreement, and shall complete its work and issue a recommendation for changes no later than September 30, 2008. Any changes agreed to as a result of the committee’s recommendations will be implemented through a Memorandum of Agreement between the parties, subject to ratification as required by Union and County requirements.
B.	Changes in Plan Designs During the Term of Agreement.
Local 88 and the County recognize the increase in health care costs to be a major concern. In an effort to collaborate over quality health plans, design changes and increasing costs, the parties agree to establish an eight (8) member team (four (4) for each party) to review and approve carrier or county initiated changes in plan designs, changes in plans offered, or changes in carriers, prior to implementation for the following plan year. Meetings will commence no later than forty-five (45) days after ratification of this agreement to establish initial guidelines for Employee Benefit Team (EBT). For the first year, the EBT shall meet weekly to review the current structure and proposed changes. Changes in plans or plan designs which are mandatory due to carrier changes, and which cannot be resolved by the committee, shall be subject to impact bargaining only. Mandated coverage changes due to Federal or State laws, rules, or regulations shall be presented to the EBT but will be

C.	Premium Calculations
For Kaiser Plans, the premium charges shall be the amount charged by Kaiser to the County. For the ODS plans, the premium charges shall be calculated, using sound actuarial principles, and include projected claim costs based on plan experience as required by state regulations, IBNR expenses, Oregon Medical Insurance Pool assessments, pharmaceutical claim expenses, stop-loss premiums, third-party benefit plan administration costs, and an appropriate trend factor selected to limit County contributions and employee cost shares while providing adequate funding for plan operations.
D.	Employee Contribution
Employee contributions will be made through payroll deductions. Enrollment in a County sponsored medical/vision/prescription plan and associated employee contribution is mandatory for employees who do not “Opt Out” of medical/vision/prescription coverage.
E.	Major Medical Plan Rebates
Full-time employees who elect coverage under the Major Medical Plan will be paid fifty dollars ($50) (gross) per month.
F.	Opt-Out - Waiver of Benefits.
a.	Employees may elect to waive participation (Opt Out of coverage) in the County’s medical/vision/prescription insurance plans by making that election on their Benefit Enrollment form. Employees making such election must provide proof of other group medical/vision/prescription insurance in order to make the Opt Out election. Employees will not be eligible to change their election until the County’s official open enrollment period, unless the employee experiences an IRS recognized family status change event that would allow a mid-year health plan election change.
b.	Full-Time Employees Who Opt Out.
Effective July 1,	2007 employees who Opt Out of
medical/vision/prescription coverage will receive a reimbursement paid by the County of one-hundred and fifty dollars ($150) (gross) per month.
Effective January 1,	2009 employees who Opt Out of
medical/vision/prescription coverage will receive a reimbursement paid by the County of two-hundred and fifty dollars ($250) (gross) per month.

medical/vision/prescription coverage will receive a reimbursement paid by the County of one-hundred-twenty-five dollars ($125) (gross) per month.
G.	Successor Plans and Carriers
In the event that any of the current insurance plans become unavailable, the County agrees to provide to affected employees a substitute plan for the same service delivery type, if available, at substantially the same or better benefit levels. If a plan or carrier is discontinued and no substitute plan is available of the same service delivery type, the employee will be offered the option to enroll in an alternative service delivery plan.
If the County chooses to change from a plan or carrier which is still available, the County agrees that the overall existing level of benefits for each plan will not be reduced.
H.	Premium Reimbursement for Part-time employees
Part-time employees who work full time (at least eight tenths (.8) FTE) for six (6) consecutive pay periods will be reimbursed for the difference between the part-time employee contribution and the full-time employee contribution, as if they were entitled to full-time benefits during that period for their elected County offered medical and/or dental plans. A part-time employee who has elected the Kaiser Maintenance Plan will be reimbursed for the amount of their part-time employee contribution (because this plan does not have a full-time equivalent plan). There is no reimbursement available to employees who have elected the Major Medical Plan or who Opt Out. Any such premium reimbursements made to the employee will be adjusted for appropriate taxes.
“Work” for purposes of this section is defined as regular hours worked, and any paid time such as vacation or sick time. Such payments will be made only upon written request submitted by the employee to the Employee Benefits Office within ninety (90) days of the last payroll period of full-time work.

Meal periods are on unpaid time unless the provisions of “Subsection 3” below apply.
a.	Length of the meal period
Employees will be scheduled for a thirty (30) minute meal period unless they request and management approves a one (1) hour meal period. Management may rescind approval for a one (1) hour meal period, subject to the provisions for changing work schedules in “Section I” above.
b.	Scheduling
i.	The meal period for employees working eight (8) or more hours will be scheduled in the middle of the work day whenever practicable.

subject to the provisions for changing work schedules in “Section I” above.
3.	Paid meal periods:
a.	Continuous duty schedules
Management may assign employees performing duties which do not lend themselves to duty free breaks and meal periods to a continuous duty schedule. Any such assignment shall be in writing with a copy provided to the Union and the Labor Relations Manager. Meal periods for such employees will be on paid time. The scheduling of meal periods and breaks for affected employees will be based solely on management’s judgment of the need for supervision of clients or involvement in other continuous duty, or may be on an “as time is available” basis. Continuous duty employees may not be relieved of duty during their work day, and may have to take their meals and their breaks while supervising clients or attending to other duties. Any meal periods or breaks may be interrupted or missed without additional compensation.
b.	Temporary assignment
If an employee who normally works a non-continuous schedule is assigned to provide relief for a continuous duty post and that assignment includes the time of the relief employee’s normally scheduled meal period, it will be treated as a paid period following the conditions of “Section IV.C.3.a” above.
D.	Clean-Up Time
Employees occupying labor, trades or craft positions, or whenever it is essential for other employees to clean up or change clothes before being presentable upon leaving work, shall be granted not more than a fifteen (15) minute personal clean-up time prior to the end of each shift. The County shall provide the required facilities for the employee's clean-up time. Neither party to this Agreement shall construe "clean-up time" to mean "quit-early time" or "leave-early time".
V.	Flexible Work Schedules
A.	Exceptions to the Requirements of This Article
Greater flexibility in work scheduling than is otherwise provided for in this article, which benefits employees and the County, may be implemented, provided that such schedules are in writing, and are agreed upon by the Union and the Labor Relations Manager. A copy of any such agreed upon schedules shall be provided to all directly affected employees.
B.	Employee Requests for Substitution of Hours Within a Work Week
Employees may request to work fewer hours than scheduled on one (1) day in an FLSA work week and make up for those hours by working an equivalent number of

additional hours on another day or days in the same FLSA work week. Such scheduling is subject to the approval of management, and regardless of any other provisions of this Agreement, will not result in overtime pay.
VI.	Job Sharing
A.	The intent of a job share position is that two (2) employees voluntarily share the duties and responsibilities of one full time position in a single classification. Employees may request to share a position. Approval of job sharing is at the discretion of management. Each employee in the job share position must sign a job share agreement outlining the terms of the job share and be scheduled for forty (40) hours during two (2) work weeks.
B.	The County will develop a personnel rule and model agreement on job sharing in consultation with the Union.
C.	Leave and Holiday Pay
Job sharing employees will be treated as part-time employees for purposes of holiday, leaves, pay, and health and welfare.
D.	Job Share Vacancy.
If one (1) job share employee vacates the position, the County determines whether the position should continue as a job share. The remaining employee has the right to assume the position on a full-time basis. If the position continues as a job share, the vacant half of the position will be filled using the department procedure.
E.	If the position does not continue as a job share, and the remaining employee does not assume the position full time, then the remaining employee may elect to transfer to a vacant position in the same classification or to voluntarily demote to a vacant position for which he/she is qualified. If the above conditions are not available or not acceptable, the employee would be subject to layoff.
VII.	Uniform Time Charging Provisions
A.	Rounding Rule
Time charged for all leaves and compensation for time worked under the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to rounding to the nearest quarter of an hour in accordance with the following rules:
0 - 7 minutes rounds to 0 hours
8 - 15 minutes rounds to 1/4 hour
B.	Applications

Employees who are more than eight (8) minutes late may be charged paid leave for time late or may be allowed to flex time at the manager's discretion. An employee who starts work after their start time is considered to be late. Being late to work can be grounds for discipline up to and including dismissal.
2.	Working over
An employee who works over less than eight (8) minutes shall not be compensated. An employee who works eight (8) to fifteen (15) minutes over shall be compensated one quarter (1/4) of an hour at the appropriate rate of pay in accordance with Article 14, Compensation.
3.	Leaves
Late and early return from leaves shall be subject to the same rounding practice as specified above.
4.	Work day
The above provisions shall not be construed as a right for management to extend the end of the working day beyond the normally scheduled ending time.

III.	Work Outside of Regularly Scheduled Hours/Days
A.	Reporting to Work After Hours/Scheduled Day Off
From time to time, it may be necessary to have employees work outside their regularly scheduled working hours or on a scheduled day off. In order to be respectful of an employee’s schedules and activities outside of work, and to keep County costs down, every effort will be made to (a) give as much advance written notice as possible, (b) limit the employee’s uncompensated break between the end of employee's shift and the callback assignment or between the callback assignment and the beginning of the employee's shift by scheduling as close to their regularly scheduled shifts as possible, and (c) allow for a continuous break of ten (10) or more hours between the end of one shift and the beginning of the next shift. None of the provisions in this section shall violate the provisions of “Article 14.IV” as they apply to part-time employees.
1.	“Call Back” - Less Than Twenty-four (24) Hours Advance Notice
a.	Minimum Compensation
Any employee who returns to work at the direction of management outside his or her regularly scheduled working hours or on a scheduled day off—and there is less than twenty-four (24) hours advance verbal or written notice—shall be compensated for a minimum of four (4) hours—or time worked, whichever is greater—at the appropriate rate according to the provisions of “Article 14.IV”. If applicable, the employee shall have the option of receiving overtime or compensatory time, or they may flex their time at a time approved by their supervisor. This minimum does not apply if (a) an employee elects to accept an overtime assignment prior to the end of their scheduled shift, or (b) the employee was on “Involuntary On-Call” status according to the provisions of “Article 14, Section IX”.
b.	Start of Period and Immediate Callback
If all of these conditions apply: (a) the employee's regularly scheduled shift has already ended and (b) they are required to report back to work immediately (as soon as they can get there) and (c) they report to the work location within one (1) hour, the four (4) hour minimum period commences with the acceptance of the assignment and ends four (4) hours later; otherwise the four (4) hour minimum period commences at the time of reporting to the work location. (For example, if an employee’s regularly scheduled shift ends at five (5:00) p.m. and they are contacted at midnight (12:00) a.m. that night and required to report back to work immediately and they report to the work location within the hour—before one (1:00) a.m.—the four (4) hour

minimum period commences at midnight—with the acceptance of the assignment. If an employee’s regularly scheduled shift ends at five (5:00) p.m. and they are required to report back to work the next morning at six (6:00) a.m., then the four (4) hour minimum period commences at six (6:00) a.m.—at the time of reporting to the work location).
2.	“Schedule Change” or “Mandatory Meeting” - Greater Than or Equal to Twenty-four (24) Hours Advance Written Notice
a.	Compensation
Any employee who is required to report to work at the direction of management outside his or her regularly scheduled working hours or on a scheduled day off—and there is greater than or equal to twenty-four (24) hours and less than ten (10) calendar days advance written notice—shall be compensated for time worked at the appropriate rate according to the provisions of “Article 14.IV”. If there is greater than or equal to ten (10) calendar days advance notice, the employee shall be (a) compensated as above; or (b) notified in writing of the change to their regularly scheduled working hours.
b.	Length of Break Between Shifts
In the event an employee is required to work additional hours between the end of their regularly scheduled shift and the beginning of their next regularly scheduled shift and the break is less than ten (10) hours, the County shall:
1.	allow the employee to flex the beginning time of his/her regularly scheduled shift to allow for a ten (10) hour break, County needs permitting; or
2.	compensate the employee at his/her regular scheduled rate of pay for the difference between ten (10) hours and the actual hours he/she is off between the end of work and the start of his/her shift. For example, if an employee’s regular shift normally ends at ten (10:00) p.m., works until midnight (12:00 a.m.) and then is scheduled to begin work at eight (8:00) a.m., the break is only eight (8) hours, they would be compensated for an additional two (2) hours.
This compensation shall be in addition to his/her rate of pay for actual hours worked. This additional compensation only applies when there is greater than or equal to twenty-four (24) hours advance written notice.
B.	Receiving Work Telephone Calls at Home
Any employee who is called at home or a location other than their job site for work related business during their off-duty time, and is not required to report to a work site, shall receive one (1) hour pay at the appropriate rate according to the provision of Section IV below. Multiple calls with less than twenty (20) minutes between the end of the first (1st) and beginning of

C.	Off Duty Telephone/Computer Work at Home
Any employee directed to perform work from home outside of their regular scheduled hours, will receive one (1) hour pay or the length of work whichever is greater, at the appropriate rate according to the provision of Section IV below.
D.	Cancelled Court Appearance on Day Off
When an employee is required to make a court appearance as a result of their job on his/her regularly scheduled day off, and such court appearance is cancelled and the employee is not notified of the cancellation by or on the employee's last scheduled work day prior to the scheduled court appearance, then the employee shall receive two (2) hours pay according to the provisions of Section IV below even though the court appearance was cancelled.
IV.	Overtime
A.	Time and One-Half
Employees will be compensated at the rate of one and one-half (1 %) times their normal hourly rate of pay for additional time worked as follows:
1.	In excess of eight (8) hours in any work day for a five (5)-day, forty (40)-hour -a-week employee; or
2.	In excess of ten (10) hours in any work day for a four (4)-day, forty (40)-hour -a-week employee; or
3.	In excess of forty (40) hours in any FLSA work week.
B.	Double Time
1.	All work performed on an full-time employee’s scheduled second (2nd) or third (3rd) day of rest will be paid at the rate of two (2) times the employee’s regular rate of pay, provided that an employee who has refused to work a full shift on the employee’s first (1st) scheduled day of rest will be paid at the rate of one-and-one-half (1 %) times his or her normal rate.
2.	The applicable day of rest will be determined by the calendar day the person begins work and will remain in effect until (a) they leave work, or (b) their next regularly scheduled shift begins, whichever happens first. For example, if an employee starts work at ten (10:00) p.m. on their first (1st) day of rest and works until two (2:00) a.m. on the second (2nd) day of rest (and their next regularly scheduled shift has not begun during that entire time period), all

3.	Part-time employees who work in excess of forty-eight (48) hours in an employee’s FLSA work week shall be compensated at the double rate for all such hours in excess of forty-eight (48) hours.
C.	Overtime Administration
1.	Computation of overtime - holidays and leaves
When computing overtime, paid holidays and leaves with pay taken during the work week shall be considered as time worked.
2.	Premium Pay in the Computation of Pay Rates
When computing the overtime rate or vacation or sick leave pay due an employee receiving premium pay, such premium pay must be included when the employee is regularly assigned to premium work.
3.	Equal distribution of overtime work
Overtime work shall be distributed as equally as practicable among employees working within the same job classification within each work unit providing they have indicated in writing a desire to work overtime to their supervisor.
4.	No discrimination
There shall be no discrimination against any employee who declines to work overtime. Overtime work shall normally be voluntary except in cases where the public health, safety and welfare, or critical public interest may be at risk.
5.	Discipline for unauthorized overtime
Employees working unauthorized overtime may be subject to discipline.
6.	No suspending work to avoid overtime
Employees shall not be required to suspend work during regular hours to avoid overtime.
7.	Compensatory time
Compensatory time may be accrued by agreement between the County and the employee with the following limitations. Specifically, in lieu of overtime pay, an employee may with supervisory approval elect to accrue compensatory time off equal to the applicable overtime rate for each hour of overtime worked, provided:
a.	The maximum allowable accumulation of compensatory time off shall be eighty (80) hours.

V.	Shift Differential
A.	Payment of Shift Premiums
1.	Hours and amounts
The County and the Union recognize that a work week may contain three (3) different shifts: day, swing, and graveyard. The County agrees to pay the following shift premium pay in addition to the established wage rate to employees who are scheduled to work eight (8) or more hours in a work day:

Employees assigned to a relief shift schedule are exempt from the provisions of Article 13, “Section I”; however, such employees must be given at least a twenty-four (24) hour notice of shift assignment.
B.	Inclusion of Shift Differentials in Wages

A.	Unauthorized Overpayments
Any employee who receives payments to which he or she is not entitled, including but not limited to premium pay, shift differential, overtime pay, step increases, or any other salary, wage, or reimbursement which is not authorized by this contract or County Personnel Rules, and which the employee knew or reasonably should have known he or she was not entitled to receive, shall reimburse the county for the full amount of the overpayment.
B.	Payments in Error
When an employee receives payments due to a clerical, technical, or computer error, through no fault of the employee and where the employee did not and could not reasonably have known that the error occurred, the employee will only be liable for and the County shall only recover the overpayment for a period of one-hundred and eighty (180) days preceding the date of discovery of the error.

IX.	On-Call Pay
A.	Voluntary On-Call
Employees on a regular work schedule may volunteer to be placed on on-call duty beyond their regularly scheduled work day or work week and may be assigned an answering device for on-call purposes to avail themselves of the opportunity to receive additional pay. Any such employee on voluntary on-call status may refuse to report if called.
B.	Involuntary On-call (FLSA Exempt)
Any employee determined by the Department Human Resources Manager to be FLSA exempt may be placed on involuntary on-call status. Any such employee shall be allowed compensatory time off at the rate of one (1) hour for each eight (8) hour period they are on on-call status. Employees who are assigned on-call duty for less than eight (8) hours shall be allowed compensatory time off on a pro-rated basis at full hour increments.
An employee shall be assigned on-call duty when specifically required to be available for work outside his/her working hours and not subject to restrictions which would prevent the employee from using the time while on-call effectively for the employee’s own purposes.
No employee is eligible for any premium pay compensation while on on-call duty except as expressly stated in this article. On-call duty time shall not be counted as time worked in the computation of overtime hours. An employee shall not be on on-call duty once he/she actually commences performing assigned duties and receives the appropriate rate of pay for time worked.
C.	Involuntary On-Call (FLSA Non-exempt)
Employees shall be paid one (1) hour of pay or compensatory time off subject to Section IV.C.7 at the regular straight time rate for each eight (8) hours of assigned on-call duty.

effect on the relative market standing of many of the classifications in the bargaining unit. The County and the Union recognize the need for a fair and equitable compensation system, and as such, the parties agree to a classification and compensation system review of classifications through a joint labor/management committee.
A.	Joint Labor Management Compensation Committee (the Class Comp Committee)
1.	There shall be established a Joint Labor Management Compensation Committee to review mutually agreed upon classifications for the purpose of compensation adjustments; studies may also include classification reviews for the purpose of updating or revising existing class specifications, establishing new classifications, or abolishing existing classifications. The composition of this committee will include the following but may be supplemented or changed by mutual agreement:
a.	County
Two representatives from Human Resources, one from Labor Relations and two departmental management representatives. The Chief Spokesperson for the County shall be designated by the Director of Human Resources.
b.	Union
The Union Representative and four appointed bargaining unit employees.
2.	The Compensation Committee shall be charged with:
a.	Identifying and agreeing to a list of comparable employers which shall be used in the conduct of classification and compensation studies;
b.	Developing and approving procedures for the conduct of Compensation Committee meetings and business, including but not limited to the process for identifying classifications to be studied, the selection and training of advisory committee members, the processes for informing employees and supervisors of study results, and the procedures for final decisions and implementation of completed studies; and
c.	Identifying the job classifications to be studied each year.
3.	Annual Classification/Compensation Studies
During the first and second quarters of the calendar year, the committee will identify job families or isolated classifications which would appear to be candidates for closer study based on such specifiable factors as recruitment data, internal alignment data or other factors as mutually agreed by the members of the committee. Based on the classifications identified by the committee to be reviewed, a formal salary survey and classification review will be conducted either

by the County classification/compensation staff or by a consultant or vendor contracted by the County, on the classifications identified by the committee. An account of seventy-five-thousand dollars ($75,000) will be set aside each year to cover costs incurred by contracting reviews by a vendor. If there is a balance left at the end of the year, it will be carried over into the following year. An advisory team composed of managers, supervisors and represented employees who are subject matter experts in the job content of classifications under review shall be appointed for each approved study. The data resulting from this survey and the funding limitations provided by “Section B”, below, will lead to a County recommendation for increases effective on the first day of the fiscal year in which the study is conducted, unless the parties mutually agree to a different effective date. The recommendations will be presented to the Union as studies are completed. Unless mutually agreed between the County and Union, all salary range adjustment will be in recommended rates and ranges for the affected classifications based on the Local 88 Compensation Plan. The County Recommendation for approved studies will be implemented unless modified by mutual agreement during the Committee discussion, or unless the Union notifies the County in writing within thirty (30) days of a recommendation that the County Recommendation is rejected, in which case the Default Option cited in “Section C” below will be implemented.
B.	Funding and Amount of Increase
The amount of funding available for each fiscal year shall be one-quarter of one percent (.25%) of the budgeted base for all positions allocated to this bargaining unit as calculated by the Budget Manager from the Adopted Fiscal Budget, except that Fiscal Year July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008 funding will be zero. If there is a balance left over at the end of the fiscal year, it will be carried over into the following year.
C.	Default Option
The Union and the County realize that the existing compensation arrangements are jointly owned as a product of a series of contracts that have been freely entered into. There is also a joint recognition that any process such as the above which is not, and cannot be, precisely specified in advance, must involve a concerted effort of discussion to be successful, and must be disciplined by a default option; therefore:
If the County recommendations are rejected by the Union, the County will give the Union thirty (30) days to appeal the study results, based upon a substantive failure to comply with the mutually agreed upon guideline of the Labor Management Class Comp Committee. If the parties are unable to resolve the appeal, provisions of Article 15.VI.B will apply. If the County recommendations are rejected by the Union and there has been no substantive failure to comply with the mutually agreed upon guidelines, the County may implement the study’s results at its own

expense.
In the event an employee’s rate of pay exceeds the new recommended maximum pay rate as a result of a Classification/Compensation study, he or she will be paid in accordance with Article 15.V.
XI.	Waiver of State Overtime Requirements
To the extent allowable by law, the provisions of this Article and other provisions of this Agreement constitute an express waiver of ORS 279.340 as provided by ORS 279.342 (5)(b). Copies of the above cited statutes are available upon employee request to the Labor Relations Section.
XII.	Bilingual pay
A differential of four percent (4%) over base rate will be paid to employees in positions which specifically require, and who have been directed to translate to and from English to another language (including the use of sign language), as a condition of employment. The proficiency level for interpretation and translation skills will be assigned by management and contained in an employee’s individual position description.

Employees covered by this Agreement shall be compensated in accordance with the Wage Schedule attached to this Agreement as Addendum A, which by this reference is incorporated herein, and as modified by Article 14.
II.	Step Placement and Anniversary Dates
A.	New Employees and Rehires
1.	A rehire is an employee who has terminated permanent employment with the County, and is subsequently selected to occupy a permanent position from a civil service list. (Former employees who return to permanent County employment without being selected from a list are not rehired, but reinstated. See “Section II.G.1” below.)
2.	New employees and rehires will be paid at the minimum rate in the range for their classification unless a higher rate is approved by the Central Human Resources Manager or his or her designee.
3.	The anniversary date for wage increases for new employees will be the date of permanent appointment, and the date for rehires will be the most recent date of permanent appointment. However, the anniversary date for new employees and rehires will be adjusted to reflect any additional job class seniority credit, such as credit for temporary service in the classification, which they receive under the provisions of Article 21.
B.	Step Increases
An employee not at the maximum of his/her pay range shall receive an anniversary step increase upon the completion of one year of service within the job class at the current step. Service within the job class is measured in accordance with Article 2.
C.	Promotion
1.	Definition
A promotion is an appointment to a classification with a higher top step than in the preceding classification.
2.	Pay adjustments upon promotion
a.	The base pay of a newly promoted employee will be at least one step higher than his or her base pay in the lower classification, unless such an increase puts him

or her beyond the top of the higher range. A one step increase is defined as the percentage difference between the final two steps of the lower range.
b.	If the employee’s base pay in the lower range plus one step increase is lower than the first step in the higher range, the employee will be paid at the first step rate.
c.	If the employee’s base pay	in the lower range plus one step
increase	is higher than the top step in the higher range, the	employee will be paid at the top step
rate.
d.	If the employee’s base pay	in the lower range plus one step
increase	falls	within	the higher range, the employee will be paid at the step rate which represents
at least a one step increase, but less than a two step increase in base pay.
e.	The rate of pay upon promotion for lead workers who have received lead pay continuously for a year or more immediately prior to the promotion will be calculated as if the lead pay were part of the base rate.
3.	Anniversary date upon promotion
The employee’s anniversary date for wage increases will be the date of a regular appointment to the higher classification, unless the employee receives additional seniority credit, such as credit for continuous, contiguous temporary service in the higher classification.
4.	Failure to complete probationary period after promotion
a.	When a regular employee is promoted and does not complete the probationary period for that classification, he or she shall be reinstated to a position in the classification and department from which he or she was promoted. Reference to probationary period in this section applies to any Local 88 or non-Local 88 probationary period in Multnomah County. Employees who do not complete promotional probationary period within the first six (6) months, in a Local 88 position and return within the probationary period to their previous position shall treat such time in the higher class as seniority accrual in the lower class. Employees who do not successfully complete promotional probationary period in a non-Local 88 bargaining unit position shall have their time count towards their total length of continuous service within the County.
b.	The employee will be placed at the same step in the old range that he or she would have been on but for the promotion.
c.	The anniversary date for wage increases will revert to the anniversary date in effect prior to the promotion.

demotion, or after a leave of absence, the employee will be placed at the same step he or she was on when he or she left the classification.
b.	A former County employee who is not on a recall list may also be reinstated at the discretion of the Human Resources Manager or designee. If reinstated to the classification most recently held, the employee will be placed at the same step he or she was on when he or she left the classification.
2.	Anniversary dates upon reinstatement
The anniversary dates of reinstated employees will be adjusted so that if the time spent away from the classification exceeds thirty (30) days in duration, none of the time away will count.
III.	Temporary Work in a Higher Classification
A.	Work Out of Class
1.	Definition
An employee works out of class when he or she is assigned in writing by a supervisor to assume the major distinguishing duties of a position in a higher classification and/or to replace another employee in a higher classification, and to perform a majority of the principal duties of that classification.
2.	Compensation for work out of class
An employee working out of class will be compensated according to the promotional policy above. (See “Section II.C”) Note that if the employee’s pay range and the higher range overlap, the policy provides for an increase of approximately one step; if the ranges do not overlap, the policy generally provides for an increase to the first step of the higher range.
3.	Paid leave and work out of class
a.	When an employee works in a higher classification during all hours worked in an FLSA work week or longer period of time, the employee will be paid the out of class rate for all hours in pay status on days in which he or she was on leave for less than half (%) a shift.
b.	An employee using leave while working out of class will be paid at his or her regular rate of pay for all hours in pay status on days in which he or she worked half (%) or less of his or her scheduled hours.
B.	Temporary Appointments
When management anticipates that an employee will be performing the principal duties of a higher classification for a period of more than thirty (30) days, the employee may be given a temporary appointment to a position in the higher classification.

same base hourly rate the employee would have received but for the temporary appointment; and v. The employee will pay Union dues or such alternatives as are provided by Article 5, and will continue to be represented by the Union in accordance with Article 3.
IV.	Reclassification
A.	Definition
A reclassification review is an analysis of an employee’s duties and responsibilities to determine whether he or she is in the correct classification. Individual employees or management may initiate a reclassification review by completing a request form and submitting it to Central Human Resources. Central Human Resources may also initiate studies of positions or groups of positions.
B.	Procedure
1.	Copies of completed request forms will be forwarded to the Union by the Central Human Resources within fifteen (15) days of receipt.
2.	Central Human Resources will notify the Union when it initiates a study.
3.	Central Human Resources will render a decision to affected employees
with a copy to the Union within sixty (60) days of receiving a request or initiating a study.
4.	If the employee is placed in a new classification, the wage range for that classification will be established by the procedures described in “Section V.A” below.
5.	Wage increases resulting from an upward reclassification will be effective retroactively to the date of the reclassification request. However, the Human Resources Manager or his or her designee may authorize retroactivity up to six (6) months prior to the date of the request.
C.	Resolution of Reclassification Disputes
1.	The outcome of a reclassification request may be appealed under Article 18 at Step 3 of the grievance procedure within fifteen (15) days of the date on which notice of the decision from Central Human Resources is received.
2.	If the grievance is advanced to Step 4, the arbitrator will fashion his or her award within the following parameters:
a.	The arbitrator shall be limited to deciding if the employee's principal duties fall within the classification to which his or her position is allocated by the County;
b.	If the arbitrator determines that the position is improperly allocated, the arbitrator shall direct the County to allocate the position to another existing classification. If no appropriate classification exists, the arbitrator shall direct the County to establish such a

classification;
c.	The arbitrator shall have no authority to modify a classification or establish a new classification.
V.	Pay Adjustments
1.	If an employee’s rate of pay is below the minimum for a new salary range, his or her pay will be raised to the minimum rate.
2.	If an employee’s rate of pay is within the new salary range but does not match a step in that range, his or her wage will be raised to the closest step. If the employee’s rate of pay matches a step of the new range, there will be no change in his or her hourly rate.
3.	If an employee’s rate of pay is above the maximum of the new salary range, the rate will not change but will be frozen, and the employee will not receive any increases in base pay, specifically to include general wage increases. However, when the top step of the new range has risen to exceed the frozen rate of pay, the employee will be paid at the top step rate.
4.	When an employee is reclassified, his or her anniversary date for a wage increase will not be changed.
VI.	Establishing Wage Rates for New Classifications
A.	Method of Determining Wage Rates
Wage rates for new and substantially revised classifications will be established by Central Human Resources in the following manner:
1.	Assign a range which is reasonably related to the average mid point of wage ranges collected for comparable classifications within the agreed upon labor market or reasonable comparables.
2.	In the event sufficient market comparable data are not available, Central Human Resources may, at its discretion, use point factor evaluation or internal equity to determine a new wage range for a classification based on comparable levels of complexity found within the County’s structure.
3.	Central Human Resources may, at its discretion, assign rates higher than those indicated in “Subsection 2” above if such rates are indicated by conditions in comparable labor markets for workers in comparable classifications.
4.	Central Human Resources shall notify the Union of the range and its effective date.

2.	If the parties are unable to reach agreement on a wage range, the matter will be resolved under Article 18 at Step 4 of the grievance procedure.
a.	At Step 4 the arbitrator may either affirm that the pay range assigned by the County satisfies the requirements of “Section A” above, or specify the parameters within which a range would satisfy the criteria.
b.	The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding and will be retroactive to the effective date established in the County's notice, per “Section V.A.4” above.
VII.	Market Adjustments
The Central Human Resources Manager, or his or her designee for classification and compensation administration, may notify the Union in writing that market based adjustments to the rates and ranges of certain classifications are warranted. Such adjustments may be implemented upon written approval of the Union.
VIII.	Qualified Arbitrator
Recognizing the technical expertise required to adjudicate disputes relating to classification allocations and the establishment of pay rates, the parties agree to use an arbitrator with such technical expertise during the life of this Agreement.

preceding retirement at or after age fifty-eight (58) years, or
b.	ten (10) years of continuous County service immediately preceding retirement prior to age fifty-eight (58) years.
2.	Payment at 55 or earlier
The County shall pay one half (V) of the monthly medical insurance premium on behalf of a retiree and his or her eligible dependents from the retiree's fifty-fifth (55th) birthday or date of retirement, whichever is later, until the retiree's sixty-fifth (65th) birthday, death, or eligibility for Medicare, whichever is earlier, if the employee had:
a.	Thirty (30) years of continuous service with employers who are members of the Oregon Public Employee Retirement System and twenty (20) or more years of continuous County service immediately preceding retirement; provided, however that employees employed on or before July 1, 1992, who are eligible for PERS regular retirement with thirty (30) years of PERS service and twenty (20) years of County service shall be eligible for County payment of half the medical premium without waiting until age fifty-five (55), or
b.	Ten (10) years of continuous County service immediately preceding retirement in the event of disability retirement.
F.	Eligibility for Medicare
Actual application for Medicare shall not be required for a finding that a retiree is "eligible for Medicare" under “Subsection E" of this section.
G.	Part-Time Pro-rating
Part-time service in a regular budgeted position shall be pro-rated as half for purposes of the service requirements under “Subsection E" of this section. (For example, part-time service for two (2) months would equal one (1) month toward the applicable service requirement.)
H.	Requirement to Continuously Participate
In addition to the other requirements of this section, continued medical plan participation or benefit of County contributions is conditioned on the retiree's continuous participation in the member's medical insurance plan from the time of retirement, and upon the retiree's timely payment of the applicable retiree portion (i.e., fifty percent (50%) or one hundred percent (100%) as applicable) of the monthly premium. Failure to continuously participate or make timely and sufficient payment of the applicable retiree portion of the monthly premium shall terminate the retiree's rights under this section. Payments by retirees of their portion of the monthly premiums under this section shall be timely if the retiree has directed PERS to regularly deduct his or her portion of the monthly premium from his or her

pension check and remit the proceeds to the County's collection agent, or if the retiree has directed the County’s collection agent to invoice or electronically transfer funds (EFT) from his or her account. Central Human Resources shall inform the retiree at the time he or she signs up for continued medical insurance coverage of the identity and address of the County's collection agent and shall thereafter inform the retiree of any change in collection agent at least forty-five (45) days prior to the effective date of such change.
I.	State and Federal Tax Offset
In the event County medical insurance premium payments on behalf of retirees or their dependents are made subject to state or federal taxation, any additional costs to the County shall be directly offset against such payments required under this section. (For example, if the effect on the County of the additional tax is to increase the County's outlay by an amount equivalent to ten percent (10%) of aggregate monthly retiree premium, the County's contribution shall be reduced to forty percent (40%) of premium so that net County costs will remain unchanged.)

I.	Contracting
A.	Limitations on Contracting
The County may contract or subcontract out work performed by employees in this bargaining unit regardless of impact on employees, including but not limited to layoff. In any instance in which such contracting or subcontracting would result in layoff, however, and the County is unable to find suitable or comparable alternative employment for the employees, this contracting or subcontracting will occur only if it was anticipated and considered as a part of the budgeting process and the Union Business Representative and/or President has been notified of the specific plan and its probable impact at least thirty (30) days prior to adoption of the annual budget, referred to as the “Adopted Budget”, or formal Board consideration of budget modifications.
B.	Meeting with the Union
1.	Layoffs.
The County agrees to meet with the Union to discuss the effect of proposed contracting out or subcontracting which would result in layoff prior to the presentation of the proposal to the Board for adoption. The County further agrees to meet with the Union, at its request, to explore the alternative of work force reduction by attrition.
2.	Contract Reviews
Parties agree to meet during the term of this agreement for the purpose of reviewing work that is contracted out, such as custodial work and the feasibility of such work being performed by bargaining unit employees.
3.	Contracting In
The County and the Union also agree to allow the Union the opportunity to bid on work which is being considered for contracting out in accordance with a procedure that is mutually agreed upon by the County and the Union.

This exercise of discretion shall specifically not be bound by the requirements of any Initiative Petition, or law promulgated thereto, which becomes effective subsequent to the execution of this Agreement. II. Intergovernmental Agreements
The County agrees to notify the Local 88 Business Agent and/or President when an Intergovernmental agreement which would affect the transfer of employees to or from the County is placed on the Board agenda. The County also agrees to provide the Union with a specific plan and its probable impact relative to Intergovernmental Agreements involving employee transfer, when such Agreements are anticipated, at least thirty (30) days prior to formal Board consideration of budget modifications or the Board's adoption of the annual budget related to such a transfer.
III.	Rights and Benefits of Employees Involved in Consolidation, Merger, and Acquisition of Positions
A.	The County and the Union recognize the provisions of ORS 236.610 through 236.650 in the event an employee of the County is transferred to another public employer as defined under ORS 236.610(2) for reason of merger, consolidation or cooperation agreement.
B.	All employees acquired by the County as a result of merger, consolidation, cooperation agreement, or acquisition of a facility, shall be entitled to all rights and benefits granted employees under this Agreement and ORS 236.610 through 236.650.
IV.	Volunteers
The County shall have the right to use volunteers at any time for any purpose. If a volunteer program is instituted which the Union reasonably believes may lead to employee layoffs, the County shall at the Union request meet and confer concerning alternatives which would eliminate or mitigate adverse impact on employees.

WORKLOAD AND STANDARDS, TRAINING, PERFORMANCE EVALUATION, AND ORGANIZATIONAL EXCELLENCE
I.	Workloads and Standards
It is the County’s right to establish the workload for employees. In addressing the assigned workload the employee's supervisor may establish reasonable job performance standards, and may, from time to time, revise them. Such standards shall be posted or individually stated to each affected employee, in order to assure advance comprehension and understanding of performance requirements. No employee shall be subject to disciplinary action for failure to meet standards of performance unless such employee has been fully advised of such expected performance standards, in advance of the work period in question.
When changes in functions, size, organization, mission, technology or equipment result in changes to the duties assigned to positions or the classification of positions, and employees occupying those positions do not meet the new required knowledge, skills and abilities, such changes will be brought forward by management or the union to the Employee Relations Committee (ERC). The ERC will review the matter for alternatives that meet the needs of the County with the least amount of impact on the bargaining unit members. This review does not apply to employees who would be subject to layoff based position elimination and/or budget reductions.
II.	Employee Development and Training
A.	Any time an employee is specifically required by management to participate in any development and training program shall be considered time worked for pay purposes, and all tuition, texts, training materials, and other expenses incident to such employee’s participation shall be assumed by the County.
B.	The County may subsidize employee participation in non-mandatory training or education based on relevance to the employee’s job, budgetary limitations, and managerial priorities. Each department’s labor-management committee will create a subcommittee of equal representation to develop a process for distribution of training opportunities. The subcommittee will also develop guidelines for employees to use when requesting training and for supervisors to use when determining appropriate training authorization.
1.	The subsidy may be made in the form of a partial or total reimbursement for

3.	If approved prior to enrollment, reimbursements will be made within thirty (30) days of successful completion of the training or coursework, provided the employee has submitted verification as required under department policy.
III.	Performance Evaluation
A.	The County may implement and maintain performance evaluation processes involving members of the bargaining unit. It is the desired goal of the County and Local 88 for all employees to have their work performance evaluated annually.
B.	Employees will have the right to attach a response to any evaluations in their personnel files.
C.	No evaluations or employee responses will be admissible in any disciplinary or arbitration hearing.
D.	All performance evaluations shall be signed by the employee’s supervisor, who shall bear ultimate responsibility for the content of the evaluation.
E.	County performance evaluation forms will include a section on individual training and career development.
IV.	Organizational Excellence
The parties are committed to the continuation of Labor Management cooperation as represented by the ERC process. To further support this process:

III.	Layoff Rules
The County will notify regular employees affected by layoff of the reason for the action and of their reassignment or layoff, according to the provisions of this section.
A.	Reassignment of Regular Employees During a Layoff
Layoffs will be identified by classification within the affected department and County. Employees holding positions that perform functions to be discontinued will be subject to the following in order of seniority:
1.	Reassignment to a regular position in the same classification and within the employee’s current department, or if the employee does not have enough seniority, then
2.	Reassignment to a regular position County wide, in the following order:
a.	Reassignment to a position in the same classification; or, if the employee does not have enough seniority, then
b.	Reassignment to a position in a lower or equivalent classification previously held, or if the employee does not have enough seniority, then

4.	Layoff.
B.	Voluntary layoff, bumping, or reduction in hours
1.	Lower Bumping Options
An employee may voluntarily choose to take a lower bumping option provided such option is available and does not adversely affect another regular employee who would not have been impacted had the employee bumped in the order specified above, and will not result in increased costs to the County. Such election will be made in writing within three (3) working days and submitted to Central Human Resources. Where more than one option exists,

the employee shall list his or her preference(s) in rank order.
2.	Reduction in Hours
Any employee in a classification affected by layoff may request to be reassigned to a vacant position with fewer assigned hours per week if such reassignment would mitigate the impact of the layoff on other employees and does not result in increased costs to the County.
3.	Voluntary Layoff
Any employee in a classification affected by layoff may request voluntary layoff if such action does not result in increased costs to the County. When management identifies classifications to be laid off, management will first in order of seniority, look for volunteers to be laid off. Employees who agree to a voluntary layoff out of seniority order will have no bumping rights and such employee will be placed on a recall list in accordance with this Article.
C.	Non-Regular Employees during a Layoff
1.	Within an affected classification and department, temporary, non-regular probationary, and other employees who do not have classified status and who are occupying budgeted positions will be terminated before employees with classified status are affected by layoff. Employees without status who are terminated will not be placed on recall lists and do not have bumping rights.
2.	An employee who has not completed a probationary period following promotion to a classified position and is affected by layoff shall be returned to the position previously held.
3.	Probationary employees terminated or demoted in accordance with “Subsection 1” and “Subsection 2” above will be placed on reinstatement lists for one (1) year from the date of their termination or demotion. They may, at the County’s discretion, be reinstated to their former classification if there are no regular employees who are on a recall list for that classification. Probationary employees who are reinstated will be treated as if they have been on a leave of absence for purposes of computing seniority and length of probationary period.
D.	Layoff Processing for Employees on a Leave of Absence Without Pay
1.	Employee notification
Employees who are on a leave of absence without pay which is scheduled to continue after the layoff effective date and whose classifications are expected by the County to be affected by an upcoming layoff process will be notified in writing and given an option to return from leave.

2.	Use of positions during the layoff process
If no response is received by the County within five (5) days of written notification, or if the employee declines to return from leave of absence, or if the employee is unable to return from leave of absence, the position from which the employee is on leave of absence will be treated as a vacant position during the layoff process and will be available to be filled by another employee who is affected by the layoff process, according to the provisions of this article.
3.	Return from family medical leave without pay
After a layoff process affecting the employee’s classification has occurred, employees who are on Family Medical Leave without pay immediately prior to returning to work will return to the position formerly held, and the employee occupying that position will be reassigned according to seniority pursuant to this article.
4.	Return from other leave without pay
After a layoff process affecting the employee’s classification has occurred, employees not on Family Medical Leave without pay immediately prior to returning to work will be reassigned according to seniority pursuant to this article.
5.	Recalculation of seniority after leave of absence without pay
All employees on leave of absence without pay that exceeds thirty (30) days will have their seniority recalculated upon their return from leave so that none of the time on the leave of absence without pay counts toward seniority per “Section II.B.3” of this article.
E.	The Bumping Process
Regular status employees who are affected by layoff are reassigned using the rules listed in Article 21.III.A. In addition, the bumping process is administered with the following considerations:
1.	Budgeted Positions
Vacancies that are created and approved by the Board of County Commissioners to be effective the day following the layoff date shall be treated as vacancies available during a layoff process.
2.	Reassignment to Vacancies and Employee Preferences
Reassignment of employees to vacant positions within the employee’s current department, if available, will always take precedence over their bumping another employee; where multiple vacancies are available within the employee’s current department, the County will take into account the employee’s preferences for shift assignment, part-time or fulltime status, work location, and work assignment to the extent practical prior to reassignment of

the employee to a vacancy. An employee who is offered options must indicate a preference within three (3) working days of receipt of notice of the options in order to exercise that option.
3.	Bumping Less Senior Employees
If bumping is necessary, the least senior employee in the affected classification in the department will be bumped. If there is no employee with less seniority in the classification in the department, then assignment to a vacant position in the County in the affected classification, if no vacant position, then the least senior employee in the affected classification in the County will be bumped.
4.	Previously Held Classifications
If there is no employee in the classification in the County with less seniority then the employee will be bumped to a classification previously held. If the employee held more than one previous classification, order shall be to the previous class held and so forth. Employee bumping rights includes right to bump into a previous classification with a higher maximum salary only if the higher salary rate of the previously held class is due to a salary adjustment for that class resulting from a classification /compensation study and the employee moved from the class as a result of a lateral transfer, promotion or reclass. If an employee bumps to a classification previously held and did not complete the probationary period in the class, employee will be required to complete probation according to the terms of Article 2, Section IX.
5.	Change of Full-Time and Part-Time Status
Full-time employees will be reassigned only to full-time positions and parttime employees will be reassigned only to part-time positions, unless reassignment to the other status is the only available option other than layoff.
6.	Job Share Agreements
a.	Employees who are participating in job share agreements at the time the layoff process is being administered will be treated like part-time employees for the purposes of bumping and reassignment.
b.	If a part-time employee bumps into a position that has an existing job share agreement, the employee must agree to the terms of the existing job share agreement.
7.	Shift Assignment
Shift assignment will not have an effect on the layoff process.
8.	Failure to Accept a Reassignment
Employees who are reassigned to a position pursuant to these provisions and do not accept that position will be deemed to have resigned.

Employees may not be reassigned to positions under this article unless qualified to perform the duties of that position. An accurate job description, including any approved knowledge, skills, or abilities required for the position, must be on file with Central Human Resources prior to issuance of layoff notices. Employees may be denied rights otherwise available under these provisions only if they lack knowledge, skills or abilities required for the position that are not easily learned on the job within ninety (90) days. If an employee is on paid or unpaid leave for more than fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days during the ninety (90) day orientation period, the orientation period will be extended by the amount of the leave. Employees may be required to take and pass qualifying examinations in order to establish their rights to specific positions.
When the County determines that knowledge, skills or abilities (KSAs) in addition to minimum qualifications are required for a position, the Union may appoint a steward or officer familiar with that job classification to participate in discussions about the required KSAs and the content of any qualifying examination used as part of the bumping process. Nothing requires the County to develop an examination at the time the KSAs are approved nor prevents it from modifying an examination at a later date provided the Union is provided an opportunity to participate in discussions regarding the new or revised exam used during bumping.
10.	Request for Leave
Employees who are reassigned or demoted pursuant to these provisions may request up to three (3) days of leave without pay prior to reporting to their new work assignment, consistent with the County’s voluntary furlough program, and subject to approval of the appropriate manager.
11.	Freezing of Personnel Actions
To ensure that data about vacancies and employee work assignments are reliable and that bumping options are accurate, the County HR Director may freeze all personnel transactions as determined appropriate beginning four (4) weeks prior to the date a layoff is implemented and ending the day immediately following the effective date of the layoff.
12.	Evaluation of Layoff Activities
The County will regularly evaluate layoff and bumping activities, including giving affected employees an opportunity to provide feedback to improve layoff and bumping processes.
IV.	Notice and Recall List
A.	Employees who are subject to reassignment, demotion, or layoff pursuant to the provisions of this article shall receive a notice in writing at least fifteen (15) days prior to such

action. The notice shall state the reason for the action and shall further state that the action does not reflect discredit on the employee. The Union will be provided a copy of the notice.
B.	Employees who are laid off, demoted, or reassigned to a lateral classification and/or reassigned between full-time and part-time status will be placed on the recall lists, according to seniority. Employees will be placed on all the recall lists that meet the criteria below. (For example, employees who are demoted and reassigned from full-time to part-time will be placed on the recall lists for full-time appointment in the current classification, for part-time appointment in the higher classification, and for full-time appointment in the higher classification):
1.	Employees who are laid off will be placed on the recall list for the classification held by the employee at the beginning of the layoff process.
2.	Employees who are demoted will be placed on the recall list for all the classifications held by the employee at the beginning of the layoff process to, but not including, the one the employee demoted to.
3.	Employees who are reassigned to a lateral classification or to a classification previously held will be placed on the recall list for the classification held by the employee at the beginning of the layoff process.
4.	Employees who are reassigned from full-time to part-time will be placed on the list for recall to full-time assignment.
5.	Employees who are reassigned from part-time to full-time will be placed on the list for recall to part-time assignment.
C.	Employees who are placed on a recall list pursuant to these provisions will be provided with appropriate information concerning the rights after layoff, and their responsibilities. Information will include, but not be limited to, information concerning the County’s rules on reinstatement, and will offer employees the opportunity to provide alternate contact information for recall notice.
D.	Prior to issuing an open competitive recruitment for a vacancy, hiring managers should review any active recall lists and determine if the vacancy should be announced for internal applications first, in order to allow employees on recall lists in other classifications to have the opportunity to be considered.
E.	Employees who are reassigned to positions in the same classification, resign, or elect to retire will not be placed on recall lists.
F.	Removal from Recall List
Employees will remain on a recall list for twenty-four (24) months from the date of placement on the list. Within that time period, employees will be removed from the recall list only

6.	Disciplinary termination for cause.
G.	Affect of Recall on Seniority
Employees who are laid off and are on recall list(s) and return to permanent County employment for any reason will be treated as if they have been on a leave of absence without pay for the purpose of computing seniority.
V.	Recall
A.	Employees on a recall list will be certified in order of seniority, before applicants who qualify through examination, provided they are qualified to perform the duties of the position. Employees on a recall list shall be offered appointment to vacancies, in order of seniority, except when they lack knowledge, skills or abilities required for the position that are not easily learned on the job within ninety (90) days.
B.	Employees may be required to take and pass qualifying examinations in order to establish their rights to specific positions. The hiring manager is required to state in writing what qualification(s) the employee lacks that the position requires. The employee will remain on the recall list for certification to other vacancies during his or her term of eligibility.
C.	Failure to recall an employee, except as provided above, will be deemed a
dismissal of that employee for cause, and will be reviewed and processed according to the provisions of Article 17, Disciplinary Action.
VI.	Seniority Application
A.	The above terms for determination of seniority shall apply not only to the layoff process, but also to other situations in which seniority is applied, including total service for the purpose of vacation accrual rates.

Lists showing seniority within the County and seniority within classification shall be provided to the Union, posted electronically, and posted on Union bulletin boards in work units where employees do not have readily available computer access, on or about March 1st of each year or anytime an employee or employees are notified that their position(s) is being eliminated. Employees may request a copy of the seniority list from their department human resources unit at any time.
B.	Seniority List Appeals
1.	Employees who have concerns about the calculation of their seniority shall notify Central Human Resources with a copy to the Union. If an employee’s concerns remain unresolved, the Union may file a formal written grievance at Step 3 of the grievance procedure within thirty (30) days of his or her initial consultation with Central Human Resources. If no grievance is filed within the thirty (30) days, the seniority calculation is deemed correct and no grievances may be filed on that issue at a later date. If a Step 3 grievance is filed, and Central Human Resources denies the grievance by upholding the seniority calculation, the Union may exercise its’ right to move the issue to arbitration in accordance with Article 8, Section III. If the Union chooses to not move the issue to arbitration by making such a request within fifteen (15) days of the Step 3 response, the seniority calculation will be deemed correct and no grievances may be filed on the issue again in the future.
2.	Employees may only file grievances over seniority calculations that have been accrued since the effective date of the previous contract. (For example, in the 2007 - 2011 contract, employees may only file grievances over seniority that has been accrued since the July 1, 2004, which is the effective date of the 2004 - 2006 contract.)
3.	Seniority dates will be frozen during the bumping/layoff process consistent with the commencement of the KSA freeze date as defined in Section III.E.9 above.
4.	When a seniority date is changed due to a grievance, the affected employees and the Union shall receive written notification of the new seniority ranking for the affected classification.
VIII.	Seniority of and Bumping by Non-Bargaining Unit Employees and Other Bargaining Units
A.	The only non-bargaining unit employees, confidential employees or members of other bargaining units, who may bump into the bargaining unit are those who are in the Classified service and who have previously been a member of the Bargaining Unit or in a classification which subsequently became part of these units.
B.	Only time served in the bargaining unit shall apply for bumping purposes.

IX.	Special Provisions to Save Employees From Layoff - Project Save
It is recognized by the parties that employees who are to be laid off or involuntarily demoted because of their seniority within a classification within a department face difficult circumstances in being placed in alternative employment within the County. Any such employee who is placed in a classification not previously held shall be subject to a trial service period of ninety (90) days to demonstrate his or her ability to perform or fulfill the requirements of the new classification. Employees who, in the opinion of the County, are unsuccessful during this ninety (90) day trial service period will be removed from their new classification and placed on the appropriate recall list. Such employees shall continue to be eligible for placement under the provisions of this section as long as alternative employment opportunities are being explored by management for affected employees.

D.	In the event no expression of preference exists for a shift or work assignment,
management may fill a vacancy with the qualified employee with the least seniority in the job class in the work unit. Involuntary changes in shift assignment shall require ten (10) days advance written notice to the affected employee.
E.	When a new work assignment with substantially different duties is created, it
shall be posted for ten (10) days to permit employees to indicate their preference for the assignment.

3.	Employees who are promoted after the completion of a training program will be subject to a promotional probationary period in accordance with the provisions in Article 2.X.
F.	Termination of the Training Program
The Department or employee may end the training assignment at any time with ten (10) day written notice to the other party and to the department from which the employee came. The decision to end the training assignment is not subject to the grievance procedure. The employee will be returned to his or her classification and salary held immediately prior to the training position. If there is no vacancy for which the employee is qualified in the classification held by the employee immediately prior to the training program, the employee will be laid off in accordance with Article 21.
VII.	Work Unit and Work Assignment Determination and Specification
A.	Departmental Determination
Each Department, either directly at the Departmental level, or by delegation, shall determine the work units and work assignment structure of its organization and may change this determination from time to time to reflect changes in the organization’s structure and/or needs.

units, and major functions within those sites as work unit assignments, may choose to treat the entire Department as a work unit with the site locations as work assignments. Whenever practicable, to ensure communication with employees and discussion of the implementation process and/or of alternatives, the Department will notify the Union thirty (30) days in advance of any planned change in the determination of work units.
When changes in the Department structure and/or needs result in the need to make changes to employees geographic work locations, shift or days, management will seek qualified volunteers from the affected shift, schedule or geographic work location. Assignments will be made on the basis of seniority, unless the provisions of “Section III” of this article apply. If there are no qualified volunteers for the change, the qualified employee with the least seniority in the job class at that location shall be moved with no less than a fifteen (15) working day notice period.
B.	Listing of Units

SAVINGS CLAUSE AND FUNDING
I.	Savings Clause
Should any article, section, or portion thereof, of this Agreement be held unlawful and unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, or any administrative agency having jurisdiction over the subject matter, such decision shall apply only to the specific article, section, or portion thereof directly specified in the decision. Upon the issuance of any such decision, the parties agree immediately to negotiate a substitute, if possible, for the invalidated article, section, or portion thereof. All other portions of this Agreement, and the Agreement as a whole, shall continue without interruption for the term hereof.
II.	Funding
The parties recognize that revenue needed to fund the wages and benefits and budget related existing conditions provided by the Agreement must be approved annually by established budget procedures. All such wages, benefits, and budget related conditions are, therefore, contingent upon sources of revenue and annual budget certification by the Tax Supervising and Conservation Committee. The County has no intention of cutting the wages, benefits, or budget related existing conditions specified in this Agreement because of budgetary limitations, but cannot and does not guarantee any level of employment in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement.
The Board of County Commissioners agrees to include in its annual budget amounts sufficient to fund the wages, benefits, and budget related existing conditions provided by this Agreement, but makes no guarantee as to the certification of such budget pursuant to established budget procedures under Oregon law.
In the event of a delay in such certification, the County will make every reasonable effort to correct whatever budget deficiencies that exist, if any, in order to obtain certification. Retroactive monetary adjustment shall be made if any scheduled economic improvement is delayed due to a delay in certification, unless otherwise precluded by State or Federal law or administrative regulation.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire existing Agreement between the parties. Except as specifically modified by or treated in this Agreement, all policies, matters, questions and terms affecting unit employees in their employment relationship with the County shall be governed by Article 4, Management Rights, unless such rights are specifically limited by the Multnomah County Code Chapter 9 or its successor and the Personnel Rules. The County and the Union, for the life of the Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and agrees that the other shall not be obliged, to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to or covered by this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either party or both parties at the time that they negotiated and signed this Agreement.
Nothing in this article shall preclude the parties during the term of this Agreement from voluntarily entering into amendments to the Agreement; nor shall the Union and the County Chair or his or her designee(s) for labor relations be precluded from voluntarily entering into Memoranda of Understanding, Interpretation, or Exception concerning matters of contract administration.

ADDENDUM B
LEAD WORKER ASSIGNMENT AND PAY
I.	Duties Defined
A Lead Worker assignment involves certain limited supervisory and administrative duties which are deemed not to warrant a separate classification. These duties include, but are not limited to: laying out the work for other employees, balancing the work, directing the work, reviewing the work and employee conduct for adherence to standards and rules, and making such reports as may be required to supervisory employees. Lead Workers shall_spend a substantial portion of their time (fifty percent (50%) or more) in performing the duties of the base classification. Normally, the employees directed by a Lead Worker are in the same classification, but additional classifications are sometimes involved. An employee assigned to be a Lead Worker will not impose or effectively recommend (as that term is intended in Oregon law) formal discipline, i.e. a letter of reprimand or above. Lead Workers shall not issue oral reprimands. Lead Workers shall not be present when discipline is issued. Lead Workers shall not prepare or issue performance evaluations and any involvement of Lead Workers in performance evaluation shall conform to the restrictions of Article 20, “Section III.D”.
II.	Assignment, Selection, Modification, and Termination
Assignment and selection of Lead Workers shall be at the sole discretion of the County. Lead worker assignments for over sixty (60) continuous days will be posted in the affected work unit for no less than five (5) work days. Employees in the work unit interested in the lead worker assignment shall submit a letter of interest to the unit manager and will be considered for the assignment.
An employee assigned as a Lead Worker for one (1) year or more shall be given ten (10) days notice prior to the termination of such an assignment. A copy of the termination notice will be simultaneously given to the Union. Significant modifications of Lead Worker duties deemed by the County to warrant a modification in the amount of compensation shall also be with ten (10) days notice, with notice to the union of such change. All lead worker assignments will be reviewed for continuation at least annually.
III.	Pay
When in the judgment of the County:
A. A new Lead Worker assignment is necessary; or
ADDENDUM B, LEAD WORKER ASSIGNMENT AND PAY
126
1	B. A substantial modification of an existing Lead Worker assignment warrants a
2	change in compensation, Central Human Resources shall establish a lead pay rate for the new 3 or substantially modified assignment. The current pay rates for the classifications eligible for 4 the Lead Worker premium shall be calculated by increasing the base hourly pay rates by the 5 approved percentages.
6	C. Central Human Resources will post the list of classifications eligible to receive a
7	Lead Worker premium with the approved percentages on the County’s Compensation web 8 page.

violation of the Alcohol and Drug Policy Work Rules above or other violations resulting from the use of alcohol or drugs will be according to the provisions of Article 17, Disciplinary Action.
2.	Employees will be held fully accountable for their behavior. Use of alcohol or drugs, or alcohol or drug dependency, will not mitigate the discipline imposed for rule violations, misconduct, or poor performance except as specifically provided in the section on last chance agreements below.
3.	The Parties acknowledge that, all other things being equal, certain duties imply a higher standard of accountability for compliance with the requirements of this policy than others. These duties include, but are not limited to, the following:

b.	work in the criminal justice system
c.	responsibility for public safety or the safety of co-workers
d.	handling narcotics or other controlled substances
e.	handling hazardous equipment or materials
f.	influencing the behavior of minors
g.	holding a CDL
4.	In instances in which the County determines that an employee’s conduct warrants termination, the County may offer the employee continued employment under the terms of a last chance agreement if there are mitigating circumstances, such as a substance abuse dependency or other good cause. An example of a Last Chance Agreement is included as an attachment to this Addendum.
a.	Any Last Chance Agreement will include but not be limited to, the following:
i.	the requirement that the employee enroll, participate in, and successfully complete a treatment program as recommended by the Substance Abuse Professional;
ii.	the right for the County to administer any number of unannounced follow up drug or alcohol tests at any time during the work day for a period of two (2) years from completion of any required treatment or education program;
iii.	the signatures of the employee’s supervisor, the employee, and the employee’s Union representative.
b.	The offer of a Last Chance Agreement will not set precedent for the discipline of other employees in the future. Any discipline incorporated in a Last Chance Agreement may not be grieved under the provisions of Article 18, Grievance Procedure.

D.	Mandatory Assessment and Treatment
1.	Employees who are disciplined for conduct which is related to the use of alcohol or drugs may be required to undergo assessment and to complete a program of education and/or treatment prescribed by a Substance Abuse Professional selected by the County. Employees who test positive for alcohol or controlled substances will be required to undergo assessment at the earliest opportunity, regardless of whether disciplinary action has been taken.
2.	The County will verify employees’ attendance, and that the assessment and treatment have been completed. This verification and any other information concerning alcohol and drug dependency will be treated as confidential medical information per applicable state and federal law and County Administrative Procedures.
3.	Policy on the use of leave for assessment and treatment will be the same as for any other illness.
E.	Return to Work Testing
Employees who test positive for being “under the influence” of drugs will be required to test negative before returning to work. (Note that Federal law requires CDL holders performing safety sensitive functions to undergo return to work testing after a positive alcohol or drug test.) IV. Testing
A.	Basis for Testing
1.	All employees may be tested:
a.	based on reasonable suspicion of being “under the influence” of alcohol or prohibited drugs;
b.	before returning to work after testing positive for being “under the influence” of alcohol or drugs;
c.	as part of a program of unannounced follow-up testing provided for in a Last Chance Agreement.
2.	An employee applying for a different County position will be subject to testing on the same basis, and using the same procedures and methods, as outside applicants.
3.	Consistent with Federal law, employees in safety sensitive positions, including but not limited to holders of CDL’s and Bridge Operators, shall be subject to the testing requirements of federal law, in addition to the requirements herein which apply to all employees. For example, unlike other employees, employees in safety sensitive positions will

be subject to legally required random testing and testing following certain kinds of accidents.
B.	Establishing Reasonable Suspicion
1.	Definition
“Reasonable suspicion” is a set of objective and specific observations or facts which lead a supervisor to suspect that an employee is under the influence of drugs, controlled substances, or alcohol. Examples include, but are not limited to: slurred speech, alcohol on the breath, loss of balance or coordination, dilated or constricted pupils, apparent hallucinations, high absenteeism or a persistent pattern of unexplained absenteeism, erratic work performance, persistent poor judgment, difficulty concentrating, theft from office or from other persons, unexplained absences during office hours, or employee's admission of use of prohibited substances.
2.	Supervisory training
The County will provide training to all supervisors on establishing reasonable suspicion and the nature of alcohol and drug dependency. Supervisors who have not been trained will not have the authority to direct employees to be tested on the basis of reasonable suspicion of being under the influence.
3.	Lead Workers
Lead workers who oversee day-to-day work activities are “supervisors” for the purposes of establishing reasonable suspicion and directing employees to be tested on that basis. This provision applies to lead workers who supervise or act as lead workers as part of their job description, (such as Corrections Records Supervisors and Maintenance Crew Leaders), as well as to those who receive premium pay under Addendum B, Lead Worker Assignment and Pay.
4.	Additional precautions
Application of the "Reasonable Suspicion" standard to any employee in this bargaining unit shall include the following additional precautions:
a.	The supervisor shall articulate orally a summary of the specific facts which form the basis for believing that the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol; and
b.	The supervisor shall provide upon request within forty-eight (48) hours of the oral determination of "reasonable suspicion" a written specification of the grounds for reasonable suspicion; and
c.	Except in field or shift circumstances which render contact difficult, no supervisor shall refer an employee for a drug or alcohol test based on "reasonable

suspicion" unless the supervisor has consulted with another supervisor or managerial person regarding the grounds for the suspicion.
C.	Testing Methodology
1.	Testing procedures for all employees will be governed by the same standards as apply to CDL drivers under federal law. These standards include, but are not limited to, those governing sample acquisition, the chain of custody, laboratory selection, testing methods and procedures, and verification of test results.
2.	In accordance with CDL standards, the County will contract with a medical doctor trained in toxicology to act as an MRO (Medical Review Officer). He or she will attempt to contact employees to review preliminary positive test results with employees and any relevant health care providers before the results are reported to the County. Based on his or her professional judgment, he or she may change the preliminary test result to negative. The County will not be able to distinguish a test result that is negative by MRO intervention from any other negative result.
3.	In addition to compliance with federal guidelines, the following safeguards will also be applied:
a.	Test results will be issued by the MRO or the testing laboratory only to the County’s Drug and Alcohol Policy Coordinator. The results will be sent by certified mail or hand-delivered to the employee within three (3) working days of receipt of results by the County.
b.	Appeals. If an employee disagrees with the results of the
alcohol or drug test, the employee may request, in writing, within five (5) days of receipt of test results, that the original sample be re-tested at the employee's expense by the testing laboratory. The result of any such retest will be deemed final and binding and not subject to any further test. Failure to make a timely written request for a retest shall be deemed acceptance of the test results. If an employee requests a retest, any disciplinary action shall be stayed pending the results of the re-testing.
c.	Test reports are medical records, and will be handled according to applicable state and federal law and County Administrative Procedures which insure the confidentiality of such records.
V.	Definitions
A.	Alcohol:
Ethyl alcohol and all beverages or liquids containing ethyl alcohol. Levels of alcohol present in the body will be measured using a breathalyzer test.

ADDENDUM I
OFFICE OF THE SHERIFF (MCSO)
I.	Sign-Up
A.	Vacation
The method of vacation selection shall be in accordance with the provisions of
Article 8 and employees shall choose their vacation dates in order of Job Classification Seniority. Vacation selection shall either be made at the time of the annual shift bid or at a later date in a timely manner. Each unit manager shall provide a written policy for determining how many employees may be scheduled for vacation on any given day or shift and notify staff before the vacation sign-up begins.
At their discretion, managers may make necessary modifications during the year to accommodate the needs of their individual units when circumstances beyond their control occur, such as budget cuts, layoffs or unexpected vacancies. Management will grant additional leave requests after the vacation sign-up is completed on a first come, first serve basis within their established written guidelines.
B.	Shift and Vacancy
1.	Programs Unit
Filling a vacancy that occurs as a result of a change in work assignment within the work unit, a change in shift, or as a result of a vacancy (as defined by Article 22.I.A-D) shall be based on job class seniority. Work Assignment is defined as work site location which is a MCSO facility (MCDC, MCIJ, WAPATO). Work Unit is defined as the Programs Unit within the Business Services Division in MCSO. Shift is defined by both the hours and the days worked either on or off (i.e. “C” shift Tuesday- Saturday or “C” shift Sunday/Monday off).
There shall be an annual sign-up for work location, shift and days off by job class seniority as defined by Article 2.XII, for all MCSO Corrections Counselors and separately for all MCSO Corrections Technicians for placement to occur at the beginning of the calendar year. If a vacancy occurs (as defined by Article 22.I) or a need arises to change shifts, days off or work location other than at the beginning of the calendar year, then the provisions of Article 22 .VI.A apply so that management will seek qualified volunteers based on job class seniority. If there are no volunteers, the least senior qualified employee changes work location, shift or days off. Or if a ninety (90)-day or less vacancy occurs, Article 22.II.A applies

iii.	Each employee will have no more than two (2) complete shifts to make their selection of shift and days off. However, the bid shall be given to the next member as soon as possible after signing up to expedite the process. If a member is on his/her days off, the bid will stop and wait for their return.
iv.	Employees who will be gone on a leave of absence, other leave or vacation of three (3) or more days will submit in writing to their manager three (3) choices for shift and days off, numbering them by one (1) being their first choice, two (2) being their second choice and three (3) being their third choice for available shifts and vacation days. Members shall be allowed to call or authorize their manager to call them at home to sign-up if they are gone for more than three (3) days during the shift bid process.
v.	New shifts will be implemented no later than the following February 1st, annually.
vi.	Employees in the Auxiliary Services unit will additionally be afforded an opportunity to express a preference for work assignment and or location; provided however, that final determination in these matters is management’s discretion.
II.	Shift Trades (Time Exchanges)
Shift trades shall be allowable subject to the terms and conditions of Special Order 9917 dated June 1, 1999.
III.	Uniforms
Records Unit employees required to wear uniforms shall receive, upon hire into the unit, a uniform allowance of one hundred dollars ($100) and thereafter all requests for additional uniforms shall be approved by MCSO Records Unit Manager prior to ordering.

ADDENDUM J
SCHOOL BASED EMPLOYEES
I.	The purpose of this Addendum is to set forth certain understandings between the parties concerning terms applicable to the limited duration layoff, summer work and recall of employees in the Health Department and the Department of County Human Services who work in School Based positions.
A.	School based bargaining unit members who verify to the program manager a combination of work and vacation by May 7 to be in a paid status equal to their budgeted FTE throughout the summer, shall not be laid off.
B.	Bargaining unit members who do not have work available in their ten (10) month school based work site or who choose not to work outside of their school based site will be laid off during school closure for the summer.
C.	Bargaining unit members who are laid off may be called back as regular employees as provided in Section H. Summer Work/Effect of Refusal.
D.	Limitation on Bumping and Recall from School Based
1.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, bumping by or recall of bargaining unit members who, for administrative purposes, are inside the County’s school based program shall be limited to positions inside the school based program if the County declares in writing at the time layoff notice is given to the affected employee that the layoff is of limited duration due to summer school closure.
2.	If business needs require the County to reduce a school based position from twelve (12) months to ten (10) months, the County will first look for volunteers among the twelve (12) month employees in the affected classification to determine whether there are any employees willing to have a reduced schedule. If there are no volunteers willing to change to ten (10) month schedule, the twelve (12) month school based employee with the lowest Countywide seniority date in the affected classification will be reduced.
E.	Administrative Purposes Defined
For purposes of this section “administrative purposes” means that the employee ordinarily files his or her payroll time sheet with the school based program.
F.	Deviation from Seniority Order for Layoff or Recall/Effect on Seniority and Insurance Benefits

When implementing limited duration layoff or recall from such layoff the County may deviate from the normal order of seniority layoff or recall otherwise required by the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. Such deviation shall not be for a period exceeding seven (7) calendar days. A more senior employee who would have been retained or recalled but for the departure from normal seniority order of layoff or recall may use vacation or leave without pay for the period between the date he or she would have bumped or been recalled under normal procedures and the effective date of the general school based health summer layoff or recall as determined by the School Based Manager. In addition, such employees will accrue seniority and be eligible for medical and dental insurance coverage as though they were laid off or recalled in accordance with normal layoff or recall procedures.
G.	Probationary Employees
The probationary period of an employee on probation when a limited duration layoff takes effect shall be frozen over the summer and shall resume, if the employee is recalled to work, at the commencement of the next school year. This shall not apply if the County notifies the employee that his or her probationary service has been terminated.
H.	Summer Work/Effect of Refusal
Bargaining unit members in School Based Program who perform bargaining unit work for the County while on limited duration layoff during summer school closure shall be paid at the same wage step they held when the limited duration layoff took effect. They shall also be employed pursuant to the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement and receive all benefits/entitlements specified in the collective bargaining agreement as they do during the regular school year with the exception of “Section IV” of Article 21 and Article 11 Health and Welfare Benefits (see “Section M” of this Addendum for health and welfare benefits coverage). Employees on limited duration layoff who are working are not eligible for lead pay unless working in a lead assignment in school based program. An employee may refuse to accept work that is offered, with the understanding that such refusal may affect eligibility for unemployment compensation.
I.	Layoff or Carryover of Accumulated Vacation
Notwithstanding any other provision of this agreement, an employee subject to limited duration layoff in school based program may request payoff of some or all of his or her accumulated vacation. Such request shall be made in writing to the School Based Manager, the Department’s Human Resource manager and Payroll Supervisor of the Department of County Management within three (3) days after the employee receives notice of limited duration layoff. In the absence of such notice, vacation will be carried on the books over the

summer unless the employee is subsequently terminated or resigns. In such case, normal provisions relating to vacation payoff shall apply.
J.	Considerations in Use of Vacation
Notwithstanding “subsection H” above, the parties acknowledge that although requests to take vacations during the school year may in some cases be granted, the risk that management will deny such a request is significantly greater than in other county operations, due to the need to provide services to students when schools are in session. For that reason, School Based Program Employees are encouraged to continue to select vacation times during Christmas and spring school vacations to the extent approved by management. Further, employees facing limited duration layoff should take into account the limited availability of time off when schools are in session, the vacation accumulation ceilings set forth in this agreement, and the risk of forfeiture of vacation (when accumulation ceilings are reached) when deciding whether to carry their accumulated balance forward.
K.	Alternative Compensation
The Board of County Commissioners may adopt and implement a uniform policy whereby employees who transfer or are newly hired into the school based program are required as a condition of such transfer or hire to sign an agreement accepting the payment of County medical and dental insurance premiums in lieu of government unemployment insurance payments during the period of a limited duration layoff due to summer closure.
L.	Alternative Benefits
If the State of Oregon adopts a law which uniformly disqualifies employees on a limited duration layoff from receiving unemployment insurance, even if they are available for and actively seeking suitable interim employment, the County and Union agree to meet to negotiate over the terms of possible alternative benefits or compensation to cover that period of unemployment. This shall be construed only as contractual authorization for such a policy. This shall not be construed as a purported waiver by the union of individual employee rights under the Oregon unemployment compensation statute.
M.	Insurance Benefits for Summer Work
If the employee’s last regularly scheduled workday in pay status falls on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the calendar month in which the employee begins limited duration layoff, medical/vision and dental benefits toward which the County has contributed will lapse at the end of that month. If such work day falls after the fifteenth (15th) of the calendar month in which the employee begins limited duration layoff, coverage toward which the County has contributed will lapse at the end of the following calendar month.

last day is July 15th: Employee A’s coverage toward which the County has contributed will lapse July 31st. Employee B’s last day is July 16th. Employee B’s coverage toward which the County has contributed will lapse August 31st.) Employees will be treated as a regular employee for purposes of receiving health benefits per Article 11 provided they work a minimum of two (2) shifts from July 16 through July 31.
N.	Supplemental Life and Short Term Disability Insurance. The County agrees to apply for the “teacher’s waiver” so that employees laid off as the result of limited duration layoff who are rehired within ninety (90) days will be reinstated with supplemental life and short term disability insurance that was in force at the time of layoff.
O.	Grievances. Any dispute over the meaning, interpretation or application of this Addendum shall be resolved through the grievance procedure set forth in Article 18.
P.	Holidays
Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 7, members of the bargaining unit regularly assigned to the School Based Program/School Based Mental Health Program who request and are granted time off for any scheduled school closure, including but not limited to the school winter vacation closure, spring vacation closure, teacher in-service days, or any other scheduled school closure, will be permitted, upon advance written request, to use leave without pay without first exhausting paid vacation, Saved Holiday time and/or compensatory time off. Employees who take such period as an authorized, unpaid leave of absence during the winter vacation closure shall receive their Christmas and New Years Holiday pay even though they are not in pay status on the days before and after such holidays. Unscheduled closures, such as those due to weather events, building safety issues, or any other unscheduled closures are not covered by this provision and are subject to the contract provisions and county personnel rules for building or office closures due to inclement weather and .
Q.	Lateral Transfers for DCHS Employees
1.	This subsection applies to all school-based positions within the Department of County Human Services that are classified as Mental Health Consultants and Family Intervention Specialists. The provisions of Article 22 shall apply for employees in these classifications except as follows:
2.	Vacancies which occur during the school year may be filled by temporary or regular new appointments without regard to the Work Assignment process in Article 22. Such positions will be considered vacancies for purposes of the annual transfer process. New employees assigned to those positions during the school year may be

reassigned to other positions for the following school year, pursuant to the provisions of this Addendum.
3.	On an annual basis, a list of all vacancies, including those filled by new or temporary appointments during the school year, will be posted for ten (10) working days, with the first (1st) day of posting occurring on or about May 10 of each year. The posting will include the name of the person to contact, the deadline for consideration, and any other available, relevant information about each vacant position, including school and school district sites served, specific school needs as identified by school personnel, geographic locations of the assignment, etc. Eligibility for consideration will be limited to employees in the Family Intervention classification and the classification of Mental Health Consultant within the School Based Mental Health program.
4.	Employees on the transfer list will also be considered for any vacancies which occur between the end of the May signup period but prior to August 1, provided they have given their summer contact information (email or regular mailing address) to management and respond to a notice of vacancy from management within five (5) working days of the date the notice is sent.
5.	Employees who wish to transfer from their current assignment must submit their name and indicate which vacancies they wish to be considered for prior to the deadline specified in the posting.
6.	Employees who wish to be considered for other vacancies which will result from this transfer process must also submit their names prior to the specified deadline, but are not required to specify which vacancies they are applying for.
7.	Following the sign-up period, all vacancies, including those that result from the initial transfer of employees into posted vacancies, will be filled from the transfer list in accordance with Article 22.III.B and C. Employees not on the transfer list will not be considered for transfer.
8.	Any vacancies not filled through the internal transfer process provided for in this Article will be posted within the designated work unit for lateral transfer. Any remaining vacancies at the conclusion of this process will be filled in accordance with the personnel rules for appointments, including but not limited to, open competitive announcement.
9.	Whenever management determines a need to change the assignments of a position in the School Based Program, management will, whenever practical, provide an opportunity for input from affected staff prior to a final decision.
