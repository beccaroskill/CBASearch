iv.	Employees who change titles or levels before attaining two years of service will be treated in the new title or level as if they had been originally appointed to said title or level on their original hiring date and the lump sum will be prorated to reflect such change(s).
q. “Qualified inactive service” is defined for the purposes of Section 4(p) to include the following Employees:

25
advancement to the indicated title on the effective date of the general increase specified in Section 3 of this Article, such general increase shall not be applied, but the general increase, if any, provided to be effective as of such date for the title formerly occupied shall be applied.

j.	An Employee who refuses to accept a light/limited duty assignment shall have his/her LODI terminated, unless the Employees Health Service (hereinafter "EHS") certifies that the Employee is not physically able to perform the light/limited duty assignment. If there is a disagreement about the (
44
Employee’s ability to perform said assignment between EHS and the Employee’s own physician, EMS shall request the opinion of a specialist in the area of the injury in question to determine whether the employee is capable of performing the assignment.

o.	Clarifying the understanding of what constitutes the re-occurrence of an old LODI-related injury requires additional research by the parties. After the research is completed the parties will negotiate further concerning LODI coverage of a re-occurrence of an old injury and re-injury.
p.	The parties agree to meet with the Workers Compensation Division of the Law Department in an effort to further improve the processing of LODI-related Workers Compensation claims, specifically with regard to the speed with which requests for tests or other medical procedures are approved or disapproved by the Law Department. It is the parties intention to work with the Law Department in order to assure that Employees do not remain on LODI any longer than necessary due to delays which may occur at the Law Department.
q.	EMS and Locals 2507 and 3621 agree to discuss in labor/management meetings what steps can reasonably be taken to prevent or reduce injuries to EMS Employees. In these discussions the parties may call upon outside resources such as experts employed by the Employer and/or experts at the DC 37 Education and Training Fund. The parties to this Agreement agree to meet 18 months from the execution of this agreement to hear a report from the labor/management committee.
r.	EMS and Locals 2507 and 3621 agree to discuss in labor/management meetings options, training programs or re-training programs that are available to EMS Employees who, because of LODI injuries, will no longer be physically able to perform as EMT’s, Paramedics or their supervisors.
