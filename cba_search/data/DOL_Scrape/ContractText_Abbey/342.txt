BASIC PRINCIPLES
The Employer and the Union have a common and sympathetic interest in the shipbuilding industry. The parties, jointly recognizing the highly competitive nature of the industry and the difficult problems facing it, hereby agree that the interests of both the employees and the Company will best be served by attaining maximum efficiency and productivity. Therefore, a working system and harmonious relations are necessary to improve the relationship between the Employer, the Union, and the Public. Progress in industry demands a mutuality of confidence between the Employer and the Union. All will benefit by continuous peace and by adjusting any differences by rational, common sense methods. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual premises and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION
SECTION 1. The Employer recognizes the Union as constituting a proper bargaining agency which is hereby established as the exclusive bargaining agency for all production and maintenance electrical employees of the Employer at its Pascagoula, Mississippi, shipyard as specified in the National Labor Relations Board certification of November 19, 1948. The parties hereby now agree that all the production and maintenance electrical employees at Employer’s facility in Pascagoula (located on the East and West Banks of the Pascagoula River) constitute the appropriate unit for the purpose of this Agreement.

Dues and/or assessments shall not be changed except in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and bylaws of the union, and in such event, the union shall notify the company in writing of such change.
The Union shall indemnify and save the Company harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reasons of action taken or not taken by the Company in reliance upon the certified lists furnished to the Company by the Union in accordance with any of the provisions of this Article.
In the event the Right to Work Act of the State of Mississippi is repealed or modified so as to permit the inclusion in this Agreement, the parties agree to negotiate with respect to inclusion of the Maintenance of membership provisions of the previous Basic Agreement dated February 19, 1953, between the parties hereto or a Union shop; such provisions shall then be included.
SECTION 2.	It will not be considered a violation of this contract and the Company will take no action against any member of this Union if the Union determines that its members should not cross a picket line at the Company’s facilities until the IBEW International Officers have had an opportunity to examine the facts in dispute and so decides. The Company shall be notified immediately when the Union decides on such action. Maintenance Electricians necessary to maintain the plant in a safe manner, and an Electrician for switchboard watch for those main switchboards that have met the prerequisite for lightoff, shall be permitted to work.
SECTION 3.	When such action takes place, the Union or its representatives shall direct the employees at work on the job to carefully put away all tools, material, equipment, and secure the property of the Employer in a safe manner. The
UNION RECOGNITION

Union will be financially responsible for any loss to the Employer for neglect in carrying out this provision, but only when a safe place is provided for these by the Employer.
SECTION 4.	The Business Representative of the Union shall have access to the yard or jobs at any time when workers are employed. On such visits the Business Representative will check through the Plant Protection Office when entering and leaving.
SECTION 5.	The Employer recognizes the rights of the Union to appoint a Job Steward or Stewards sufficient in number to handle grievances and will cooperate with Stewards in the performance of their official duties. This privilege shall not be abused by either the Union or the Company.
Each contract of ships is to consist of a job; therefore, on each contract when overtime is worked and eight (8) or more electrical workers are called in on work other than checkout and phase-out of complex electrical systems, there shall be at least one Steward called in to work on said hulls. In Department 23, the Shop Steward or alternate Steward called in. However, in the application of this provision, the Steward assigned the overtime shall be able to perform the work assigned to the eight (8) or more electrical workers.
If twenty (20) or more electrical workers are called in on checkout and phase-out of complex electrical systems, at least one Steward shall be called in. If the Steward is not called in, he or she will be paid reportin-pay at the applicable rate. However, in the application of this provision the Steward assigned the overtime shall be able to perform the work assigned the twenty (20) or more electrical workers.
SECTION 6.	The Chief Steward shall be notified before any employee is discharged so that he may make a thorough investigation of each case.
The Chief Steward shall have the opportunity to sign all discharge slips before any electrical employee is terminated. If the Chief Steward is not readily available, the Area Steward may be utilized.
SECTION 7.	Stewards shall remain on their assigned work except for the purpose of investigating and resolving grievances. The Chief Steward shall not be hindered from performing his official duties.
SECTION 8.	The Union will keep the Employer supplied with a current list of Job Stewards, and the Employer will make no changes in the job assignment of any Stewards until the Union has had twenty-four (24) hours in which to appoint new Stewards for replacement.
SECTION 9.	The Employer agrees to maintain bulletin boards at each shipway, outfitting dock, and shop for the posting of notices pertaining to official Union business provided that no controversial issue shall be posted.
SECTION 10.
(a)	The Company agrees that when additional employees are required, the appropriate Local Union will be given forty-eight
4
(48)	hours’ notice in advance so that the Union may have a reasonable opportunity to refer applicants for employment. Such notice, including the number and qualifications of employees required, shall be given by Human Resources Department. The Union agrees that it will, upon receipt of a request from the Company, refer journeymen in classifications covered by this Agreement. The Union shall immediately notify the Company when it has no applicants to refer, and the Company may then proceed to recruit from other sources without delay. This does not preclude the right of the Company to transfer between Unions.
(b)	Selections of applicants for referral to jobs by the Union shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis and shall not be based on or in any way affected by union membership, bylaws, rules and regulations, constitutional provisions, or any other aspect of obligation of Union membership, policies, or requirements.
(c)	The Company retains the right to reject, after normal procedures, any job applicant referred by the Union. The Company may discharge any employee for just and sufficient cause as per provisions provided in this Agreement.
(d)	The Union agrees that it will not discriminate against nonunion workers in referring workers to the Company, and the Company agrees that it will not discriminate against Union workers in selecting proper applicants referred to it by the Union.
(e)	A copy of this Article and Section of this Agreement shall be posted at the Employment Office of the Company and at the place where the appropriate Local Union conducts the operations of referring persons for employment under this Agreement.
(f)	In considering applicants for employment, the parties agree that qualified journeymen applicants living in the proximity of the plant shall be given preference for employment wherever possible.
(g)	The Company will continue its current practice of providing the Union with weekly employment reports.
(h)	The Company agrees that it will keep the Union Hall supplied with sufficient copies of the Labor Agreement between the Company and the Union so that each new employee may visit the Union Hall and obtain a copy. The new employee shall be given a
UNION RECOGNITION

referral card to the Union listing the name and address of the business agent.
SECTION 11.
(a) It is recognized that the employer has the primary responsibility to provide a safe and healthful workplace and conditions of employment.
ARTICLE 3	- NONDISCRIMINATION
SECTION 1.	It is the policy of the Company and the Union that the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be applied to all employees without regard to race, sex, age, color, religious creed or national origin.
The Company is an equal opportunity employer and operates under employment practices established by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as amended in 1991; Executive Order 11246 and its applicable amendments; the Age Discrimination Act of 1967; Section 503 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 and its applicable amendments; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and its applicable amendments; and the Family Medical Leave Act.
SECTION 2.	The parties agree that the Special Seniority Agreement negotiated between the Company and the Union on October 8, 1970, shall remain in full force and effect for the duration of this Agreement.
SECTION 3.	Pronouns of the male gender and terms containing the word “men” or “man” are used purely for convenience. These are generic terms of long standing and are intended to include females as well as males. The Company and Union do not prefer one sex over the other in the filling of jobs or making referrals, and no such preference should be inferred or implied.
ARTICLE 4	- HOURS OF EMPLOYMENT
SECTION 1. Eight (8) hours’ work between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., with not more than one-half (^) hour for a lunch period, shall constitute a workday. Forty (40) hours within five (5) days, Monday through Friday inclusive, shall constitute a workweek. Time worked shall be computed on a six (6) minute basis. In the event it becomes necessary, there shall be two (2) or three (3) shifts set up as the regular work periods. In no event will workers be required to work any part of two (2) shifts within the same day for straight time. The starting time may be established one hour earlier during the hot weather months provided the Union is notified and in agreement through mutual written consent in advance of such change. Employees who are assigned to the second and third shift will continue to work those established shift hours.
6
ARTICLE 5	- OVERTIME
SECTION 1.	Work performed in excess of eight (8) hours in any workday, or work performed in excess of twelve (12) consecutive hours in any one or two workdays, or work performed outside of the regular hours or shift shall be considered as overtime. Work performed on Saturday, Sunday, or holidays, shall be considered as overtime, provided the employee has worked forty (40) regular hours in that workweek. Jury duty, military leave, vacation, holidays, rain days (when an employee is not offered work), job related injury, temporary layoff due to lack of work, death in immediate family, or minister presiding over a funeral service shall count as time worked. In considering the assignment of overtime work, the Company will not eliminate employees from consideration because they have achieved forty (40) hours straight time, nor will an employee with less than forty (40) hours be required to work weekends or holidays. Employees who fall into either category will not be penalized for turning down a weekend assignment.
SECTION 2.	Overtime rates based on the employee’s hourly rate including any shift premium, shall be as follows:
(a) All work performed outside of regular workday or shift shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1%) times the regular hourly rate. All work performed on Saturday and the holidays enumerated in Article VI, Section 1, shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1%) times the regular hourly rate, provided the employee has worked forty (40) regular hours in that workweek.
All worked performed on Sunday shall be paid for at the rate of double time, provided the employee has worked forty (40) regular hours in that workweek.
Any employee who works more than twelve (12) hours consecutively shall be paid overtime pay at double the rate for all such consecutive hours over twelve (12).
Overtime pay shall not be duplicated. When overtime is computed and compensated for work performed in excess of the regular workday, Saturday, Sunday or a holiday, such overtime shall not be considered when computing overtime for work performed in excess of the regular workweek.
SECTION 3.	Employees shall not be laid off to offset overtime worked.
SECTION 4.	It shall be the policy of the Company to distribute overtime as equally as possible within reason among qualified employees. Inequities in the assignment of
OVERTIME
7
overtime shall be adjusted by offering appropriate available overtime to affected employees as mutually agreed between the Company and the Union. This policy shall not be administered so as to permit an employee who has completed their regular shift to continue on an overtime basis on a job which was being performed during the regular shift by another employee unless such employee is unable to work overtime. (A list of overtime to be worked shall be made available to the Chief Steward by 10:00 a.m., Friday). An employee transferred to an area after Wednesday noon shall not be eligible to work overtime the following weekend until all qualified members of the new crew have been given the opportunity to work such overtime.

SECTION 6.	When employees requiring Temporary Light Service are assigned to any hull on an overtime basis, the Temporary Light Person assigned to that hull shall also be assigned to work. If not called in, the eligible Temporary Light Person shall be paid reporting pay at the applicable hourly rate. When the number of workers is not sufficient to require full Temporary Light work, the Temporary Light Person may be assigned other work and be on call for Temporary Light Service.

COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT
This contract extension includes a potential COLA in each period of the extension, which would be paid as a lump sum on all hours worked in the previous year, and would be paid in the first pay period of February 2016, 2017 and 2018. The COLA will be based on changes in the annual Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers in the South (CPI-W South), as calculated and published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the entirety of this extension, the percentage change in CPI-W used for calculating COLA will be capped at 3%. This index measures the average change in prices paid in our region for goods and services. A COLA will be calculated as follows: February 2016 COLA
The percentage change from 2014 to 2015 in the Annual CPI-W South will be multiplied by the journeyman rate in effect in the first year of the contract ($24.80/hr) to calculate the CPI Prescribed Wage Increase for year 1 of the CBA (rounded to the nearest 10). To the extent the CPI Prescribed Wage Increase exceeds the contract wage increase for year 1 (600), each employee will be paid the difference for all hours paid for pay periods in 2015 as a lump sum. Payment will be made in
16
the 1st pay period of February 2016. Employees earning less than the journeyman rate will be paid a proportionate increase.
February 2017 COLA
The percentage change from 2015 to 2016 in the Annual CPI-W South will be multiplied by the journeyman rate in effect in the 2nd year of the contract ($25.40/hr) to calculate the CPI Prescribed Wage Increase for year 2 of the CBA (rounded to the nearest 10). To the extent the CPI Prescribed Wage Increase exceeds the contract wage increase for year 2 (600), each employee will be paid the difference for all hours paid for pay periods in 2016 as a lump sum. Payment will be made in the 1st pay period of February 2017. Employees earning less than the journeyman rate will be paid a proportionate increase.
February 2018 COLA
The percentage change from 2016 to 2017 in the Annual CPI-W South will be multiplied by the journeyman rate in effect in the 3rd year of the contract ($26.15/hr) to calculate the CPI Prescribed Wage Increase for year 3 of the CBA (rounded to the nearest 10). To the extent the CPI Prescribed Wage Increase exceeds the contract wage increase for year 3 (750), each employee will be paid the difference for all hours paid for pay periods in 2017 as a lump sum. Payment will be made in the 1st pay period of February 2018. Employees earning less than the journeyman rate will be paid a proportionate increase.

Where no such notice has been given, employees who thereafter report and make themselves available for work will be allowed to clock in, and are eligible for call-in pay or work assignment.
If for reasons beyond the control of the Company, it is not possible to give one hour’s notice of such work suspension, any employee who reports for work shall be entitled to call-in pay, provided such employee is available for such work as may be required by the emergency, taking into account the employee’s work capabilities.

ARTICLE 12 - SENIORITY
SECTION 1.	The negotiation of changes in this Agreement from the prior Agreement shall not infringe upon the seniority status of any employee except as same may be changed, terminated, or modified by the negotiated changes.
22
SECTION 2.	All new employees covered by this Agreement shall be considered to be on probation for the first sixty (60) days of their employment (exclusive of time spent in school). During the probationary period the Company may at its option and without limitations, transfer, lay off or dismiss such employee for an inefficiency, lack of skill, lack of work, or just cause. When an employee satisfactorily completes their probationary period the length of service with the Company for the purpose of determining their seniority status (including seniority for recall) will be computed from the date of actual commencement of work.
If an employee is transferred from production to maintenance or maintenance to production, their seniority shall begin in the new department as of the date of such transfer. The employee shall retain seniority in the old department and in the event of a reduction in force, shall be eligible to return to the original department based on seniority in that department.
Employees who transfer at either their or the Company’s request to a department out of the bargaining unit and who remains in such department for a period of five (5) years shall lose all seniority status and rights held in any department covered by this Agreement. Except, employees with ten years seniority in the bargaining unit shall retain their seniority indefinitely when transferred out of the unit. This shall not be abused by the transfer of employees for the purpose of retaining their seniority. This shall not apply to employees promoted to management of any part of the bargaining unit, and such employee shall retain their seniority.
Continuous service is that part of employment which has not been interrupted by any of the conditions enumerated in a subsequent paragraph of this Article and which describes under what conditions seniority is lost.
In the case of reduction or recall of the working force, seniority shall apply. This shall not restrict the employer in completing contractual commitments. If senior employees cannot perform the specialized duties, then less senior employees may be retained to perform these duties. Upon completion of these duties the less senior employees shall be laid off.
The employer agrees to place senior employees in a compatible percentage with the work force on various types of vessels so that they should be in an advantageous position at the time of reduction of working force.
SENIORITY
23
The policy of the Company shall be to give consideration to seniority in selecting qualified applicants for training programs and opportunities for advancement.
A reduction of the working force for a period of one (1) calendar week or less shall not be considered a layoff. A reduction in force for a period of two (2) calendar weeks for the purpose of ship movement or sea trials on LHD or LPD contracts shall not be considered a layoff, provided no employee shall be affected by more than two 10-day periods within twelve (12) months. This clause shall not be construed so as to permit rotating employees.
It shall be the policy of the Company, to the extent practicable, to make an earnest effort to place on other work employees who are relieved from their regular work by reason of launchings, translation of hulls, commissioning, or sea trials. The Business Representative and Chief Steward of the Union and the Electrical Director will meet and check placement planning to insure an earnest effort has been made. The senior affected employees, if qualified, shall be placed on the work available.
Employees shall lose all seniority privileges for any of the following reasons:
(a)	Voluntary quitting the employ of the Company;
(b)	Discharge;
(c)	Layoff for thirty-six (36) months or more (except as qualified by Section 3);
(d)	Absence from work without explanation for a period of five (5) consecutive workdays. Where there is a good cause established for such unexplained absence, the said employee may retain seniority privileges;
(e)	Failure to return from leave of absence on or before the date specified to return, without obtaining an extension thereof.
SECTION 3.	Any employee who is laid off during the term of this Agreement and is desirous of maintaining their recall rights will be required to notify both the Company and Union by Certified Mail within thirty (30) days of their third-year layoff anniversary. Timely notification will extend the laid-off employee an additional year. No laid-off employee will have their seniority extended more than four years. Failure to notify the Company and Union during the above 30-day notification period will terminate all recall rights and seniority.
SECTION 4.	Laid-off employees shall not be required to undergo a physical examination if recalled within three (3) months from time of layoff. However, they will be required to sign a statement attesting that they have suffered no injury nor incurred any serious illness during the period of layoff.
The Company may temporarily fill any vacancy with workers available locally while waiting for employees with seniority to report to work.
24
Provided qualified personnel are available locally, an employee may waive first recall to work for a period of ninety (90) days from the date he or she is eligible for recall. Such waiver shall be made in writing to the Company and Union before the employee is eligible for recall. Such waiver may be cancelled by written notice to the Company and the Union, in which case the employee will be eligible for recall in line with their seniority when a vacancy occurs. Such waiver shall be cancelled when qualified personnel are no longer available locally.
SECTION 5.	Department 37 (Switchboard and Panel Manufacturing) is recognized as a separate Department, and employees assigned to this Department from Department 35 retain seniority in Department 35, and in cases of layoff from Department 37 are sent back to Department 35 where they are retained, or laid off, depending on their seniority. There shall be no bumping privileges between Department 35 and Department 37. In the event of layoff in Department 35, employees who have been transferred into Department 37 for less than one year shall be laid off in line of their Department 35.
In order to establish an operation that can effectively compete, it is agreed that a rate comparable to the Cable Man rate shall apply to Switchboard Assemblers working in this Department.
This classification shall not be used to deprive Journeymen of work they would ordinarily do. Duties of the Switchboard Assembler shall include such things as bolting up cabinets, helping the electricians install equipment, drilling holes, etc., as a helper to the journeyman. The Switchboard Assembler is not to assemble any electronic equipment and components or any other work requiring trade knowledge.
An effort will be made to use Apprentices in this Department (when practical) for periods of up to six (6) months each; provided, however, that once an Apprentice has been assigned to this Department, for three (3) months, they will not be bumped out due to reduction in force of Apprentices in Department 35.
The ratio of Switchboard Assemblers to Journeyman working on Switchboard and Panel Manufacturing shall not exceed one (1) Assembler to four (4) Journeymen.
SECTION 6.	The Company shall have the right to transfer work and/or assign employees in Pascagoula between East Bank and West Bank when workload or schedule requirements make such actions necessary.
SENIORITY
25
When assigning employees in Pascagoula from one Bank to the other Bank, the Company will give five (5) working days written advance notice to the affected employees so that they can make the necessary adjustments in transportation to the new job site. During this notification period, the Company may transport such employee from one side to the other on Company time, in a safe manner.
SECTION 7.	All Electrical Storerooms will be manned by Department 43 personnel. Employees assigned to this Department from Department 35 retain seniority in Department 35. In case of layoff in Department 43, they will be sent back to Department 35 where they are retained or laid off, depending on their seniority. There shall be no bumping privileges between Department 35 and Department 43.
SECTION 8.	Qualified senior employees will be given the opportunity to fill new or vacant jobs within the jurisdiction of the International Brotherhood Electrical Workers. Promotions to Technicians are not to be construed as being new or vacant jobs.
SECTION 9.	Senior employees shall be given preference in shop assignments provided such employees have notified the Company in writing. Such employees will be considered in the order of their seniority when vacancies occur provided there are sufficient qualified employees available to perform efficiently other work requirements.
ARTICLE 13 - TRANSFER OF WORK AND PERSONNEL
Recognizing the importance to the Company and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 733, to keep employees and our Bargaining Unit employees gainfully employed; the following language, a modification of the “Letter of Understanding” as initially agreed to on May 20, 2002. As in the past workers will be covered under this Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) while offsite and Union stewards will accompany them to police the CBA.
SECTION 1.	The formation of Huntington Ingalls Incorporated is designed to position the Company as a major world-class shipbuilding company with the ability to effectively compete for all non-nuclear shipbuilding opportunities throughout the world. The combination of the Company’s facilities and the synergies among those facilities will bring stability to the entire work force and offer potential advancement throughout the entire organization. The Company reserves the right to move work and/or employees between all facilities within the Company in compliance with the following language. The purposes would customarily be but are not limited to:
•	To avoid layoffs and to stabilize the work force.
•	To provide sufficient numbers of qualified workers.
•	To utilize existing facilities.
•	To minimize subcontract labor
26
SECTION 2.	When employee transfers of this nature to other Company facilities are required the Company will notify the Union and will solicit qualified volunteers among all workers within the department in question possessing those qualifications. “Qualified” means that ability, skills, and experience to efficiently perform the work required by the Company and the employee has or/is currently performing that work. It shall be the Policy of the Company to distribute these temporary assignments as practical within reason among qualified employees. The Union will be provided with a list of all volunteers to be considered for each assignment by department seniority, as has been the practice. Once employees have been assigned for each movement, the Union shall be provided with the final list. When and if adjustments are to be made, the Union shall be notified.
If there are insufficient numbers of qualified volunteers for an assignment/movement, the Company shall require employees hired into the department having the least seniority after May 20, 2002 to accept the assignment. They shall be required to accept the assignment unless the employee asserts that the assignment would impose an undue hardship on the employee.
Both parties recognize that some employees will be faced with hardships. It is therefore agreed that a committee, made up of both management and union, will review each employee hardship request and determine if their assignment to an offsite Company facility would be a valid hardship. Any decision by this committee can be challenged under Grievance Arbitration Procedure, Articles 17 and 18 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Any employee hired after the date of the original Letter of Understanding will be required to accept offsite assignments.
If it is determined that such assignment/movement does cause an undue hardship upon that employee, the Company will by-pass that employee and select the next qualified employee based on inverse seniority.
This does not apply to emergent/unplanned work.
SECTION. 3. When an employee is temporarily assigned to work at another facility which is located 50 miles from his current facility, he will be paid a per diem to cover meals and lodging expenses for each day he works at the facility pursuant to the then applicable DOD Joint Travel Regulations. The Union will be advised of these DOD Regulations as applicable to each assignment. During each period of assignment to such facility the employee will be paid applicable travel expensed to and from the facility and all
TRANSFER OF WORK AND PERSONNEL
27
reasonable allocable business expenses as indicated to the Union in writing, while at the assigned facility. Except in emergencies, employees will be given (5) days notice of the date to report to their new facility and shall report the beginning of the following workweek.
SECTION 4.

ATTENDANCE BONUS
An employee who works 160 consecutive hours without an absence of regularly scheduled straight time work hours shall receive an attendance bonus of $75. After achieving the 160 hours bonus, employees will earn an additional $20 each workweek for which the employee works the entire workweek until the consecutive worked hours are broken. After interruption of consecutive hours worked, the new calculation of consecutive hours will restart at the beginning of the next work week.
The following events will not interrupt the consecutive hours worked in determining eligibility for the bonus: Jury Duty, Military Leave, Vacation, Holidays, Rain Days (when an employee is not offered work), Temporary Layoff, Death in Family (covered by bereavement leave), Minister Presiding over Funeral, and Pallbearer. Except as expressly provided below, an absence of any regularly scheduled straight time work hours shall break the consecutive hours worked for the attendance bonus.
Employees who go out through the Company’s Medical Facility on an industrial medical leave of absence will be considered to have worked an entire workweek for purposes of accrual of the attendance bonus during the week they go out and the week they return to work. The industrial medical leave of absence will not interrupt the consecutive hours previously worked by these employees. These employees do not accrue any hours for purposes of receiving an attendance bonus for the full week absences in between the outgoing and incoming week of an industrial medical leave of absence.
Employees excused for official union business will receive the attendance bonus provided the employee works at least 20 hour during the applicable workweek and the Union submits written notice requesting the leave of absence. The request for a union business leave of absence must indicate the period of time and total number of regularly scheduled work hours the employee should be excused for that purpose. The excused hours and the actual work hours must equal forty (40) total hours for the workweek to remain eligible for the attendance bonus.
Employees who miss time not covered above will begin a new 160-hour period on the first Monday following their return to work.
The bonus will be paid during the second pay period following successful completion of a 160/40 hour period of attendance.

Fire hazards in various areas will, of course, change from time to time due to work progress and changing of material storage. The designation of a No Smoking Area will be solely the function of the Management.
No Smoking Areas, to which others may be added from time to time, will at all times include the following:
(a)	Paint shop and paint storage
(b)	Paint locker rooms
(c)	Oil storage
(d)	Carpenter shop and lumber storage yard

(g)	Mold loft storage
(h)	Refrigerated rooms, all vessels
(i)	Oxygen and fuel gas storage.
Rules permitting smoking on ships are subject to change but will depend, generally, on the following conditions:
44
(a)	Progress of the ship toward completion. The use of tobacco products is no longer permitted aboard any waterborne vessel. The use of tobacco products in all environmentally controlled facilities and offices (including shop offices) is also prohibited. The use of tobacco products is permitted in naturally ventilated open production areas (shops, structural and component manufacturing, unit stacking and outfitting) and aboard ships under construction prior to launch unless specifically prohibited by posted signs. All employees are reminded to ensure the safe and designated disposal of used tobacco products by ensuring they are fully extinguished and make their way into designated waste containers and not on the ground, decks or bulkhead frames.
(b)	Areas on a ship where the fire hazard is great; as an example, during the testing of various items of equipment, such as gasoline pumps, etc.
The mere reprimanding for smoking and other tobacco violations is by no means an indication that the Company is waiving its rights in other cases to discharge an employee. The Company is to be the judge of when an employee is intentionally disobeying the smoking rules, as there may be circumstances which call for more drastic measures in one case than in another. All other smoking violations will be handled in accordance with the Company’s No Smoking policy.
