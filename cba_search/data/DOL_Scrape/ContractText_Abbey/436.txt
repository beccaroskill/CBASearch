TO EMPLOYEES:
The Communications Workers of America is the official bargaining representative for all employees in your collective bargaining unit. This official relationship carries with it serious obligations and responsibilities which the Company and the Union are determined to fulfill. As a sign of good faith between BellSouth Telecommunications, LLC and the Communications Workers of America, a "Responsible Relationship" clause, Article 28, is included in the Agreement, which governs your wages, hours and working conditions.
Simply stated, "mutual respect and responsibility" means an honest regard for equality in the official relationship between Company and Union representatives. It does not allow for a supervisor attempting to "pull rank" on a Union representative nor does it allow for a Union representative attempting to intimidate or "badger" a supervisor merely because there is a difference in point of view. It further means that no Company representative at any level should regard a grievance as merely an irritant, just as it also means that no Union representative should offer "grievances" which are designed only to harass management. Additionally, this clause means that Union and Company representatives must not engage in activities to undercut or belittle each other.
Company representatives, especially the first level of supervision, have the day-to-day responsibility to deal reasonably and in good faith with Union representatives. They have the right, in return, to expect responsibility and respect from the Union's representatives. To insure continually improving relations between the Company and Union, it is the intent of both organizations to deal with one another at all levels in a sincere, honest and businesslike manner. This effort by both parties should insure a better feeling for the needs of the employees.
For the Union:
Richard Honeycutt
Vice President
Sincerely,
For the Company:
Michael Keith
Vice President

C.	If the time worked starts before 7:00 A.M., and falls entirely within the hour which immediately precedes the regularly scheduled starting time, it shall not be considered a call-out.
D.	“Remote” callout is a call to an employee to perform nonscheduled work that may require testing, diagnosing and clearing a trouble in a system or equipment with remote access capability but does not result in an on-site job visit.
1.04 Connecting Work.
Any overtime work which connects with the beginning or end of scheduled time. If the employee requests and receives time off for a relief or meal period between the scheduled time and the overtime period, such break shall not change the connecting nature of such work (see 3.08C).

8
0
appropriate sections of this agreement except for wages. (See Customer Markets Addendum.) All new geographic areas established as WRAs for basic wage rates or all other Agreement purposes are subject to notice and bargaining requirements of Article 15.
1.38	Work Unit.
A work unit shall mean all those employees within a given title and department who have a common place of reporting except that employees within a single title performing distinctly different job duties shall not be grouped together.

ARTICLE 2 WAGES
2.01 Wage Rates.
A.	Full-Time Employees. The rates of pay and progression wage scales for full-time employees shall be those shown in Appendix B, Part I attached hereto and made a part hereof.
B.	Part-Time Employees.
1.	Except for payment for overtime hours worked, all hours worked by a part-time employee in DM/DR (Direct Marketing/Direct Response) Centers and any equivalent retail sales or service centers operation, shall be paid at the
9
Article
equivalent basic hourly rate for a comparable full-time employee working a normal daily tour in the same job title, classification, and work group. Payment to a parttime employee for hours worked in excess of an equivalent normal daily tour or work week for a comparable full-time employee shall be at the applicable overtime rate for a comparable full-time employee based on such part-time employee's basic hourly rate.
2.	Any regular employee who is on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, and who works parttime on or after January 1, 1981, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to be paid on the same basis as was applicable to such a part-time employee on December 31, 1980 as follows:
a.	The rate of pay and amount of increase for a part-time employee shall be prorated by relating his/her hours of work to the normal work week.
b.	A part-time employee shall receive progression increases at the same intervals as a full-time employee.
3.	The classification of a part-time employee is based on the employee's "part-time equivalent work week" which shall be determined prospectively by dividing the employee's total normally scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6 rounded to a "part-time equivalent work week" classification of 16.)
4.	The "part-time equivalent work week" classification of each part-time employee shall be reviewed by the Company on April 1 and October 1 of each year and more often if appropriate. Indicated adjustments, if appropriate, will be on a prospective basis. In determining whether such adjustment is appropriate, the Company will consider the actual average number of hours worked per month during the preceding 6 month period and the likelihood that such number of work hours will continue for a
10
0
reasonably foreseeable period of time except that any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate shall not be counted in computing the average number of hours worked.
5.	For employees who are hired on or after January 1, 1981, and who work as regular part-time employees, payments to a regular part-time employee for sickness disability, accident disability, or death benefits under the short-term disability program, vacations, holidays, anticipated disability leave, sickness absence (not under the short-term disability program) or termination allowance (or its equivalent) shall be prorated based on the relationship of the individual part-time employee's "part-time equivalent work week" to the normal work week of a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification and work group.
6.	Regular employees who are on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, and who work parttime on or after January 1, 1981, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to receive payments for the benefits and other items listed above on the same basis as was applicable to a part-time employee on December 31, 1980.
2.02 Starting Rates.
A.	Except as provided in "B" of this Section, a person engaged to work in one of the titles listed in Appendix A, Part I, shall receive the rate designated "Start" on the progression wage scale for his/her title in the appropriate schedule for his/her location as shown in Appendix B, Part I.
B.	Appropriate allowances for wage experience calling for rates higher than such "Start" rates may be made as outlined in the sub-sections of this paragraph. (CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
1.	Honorably discharged veterans of Armed Forces who were discharged from the Armed Forces within 2 years prior to their employment may be granted wage experience credit
11
Article
for a maximum of 75% of their period of military service, except that this credit shall not exceed 30 months.
2.	Persons without previous telephone experience upon initial employment may be granted wage experience credit for previous experience or special training of value. Normally this credit shall not exceed 50% of such actual experience or training time nor result in an allowable maximum credit of more than 30 months.
3.	An employee formerly employed by the Company, another BellSouth company, or any company as required by applicable law(s), shall have his/her former wage experience credit adjusted in accordance with the following table if re-employed in the same or lower-rated job classification:
For Months Out of Service	Number of Months to be Deducted from Former Wage Length of Service
Less than 6 Months	0 Months
6 but less than 12 Months	2 Months
12 but less than 18 Months	3 Months
18 but less than 24 Months	5 Months
24 but less than 30 Months	7 Months
30 but less than 36 Months	8 Months
36 but less than 42 Months	9 Months
42 but less than 48 Months	10 Months
48 but less than 54 Months	11 Months
Over 54 Months	12 Months
a.	If the employee had experience or training during his/her absence from the Company or another BellSouth company which the Company considers of value, he/she will be given credit for this experience or training in addition to the credit provided above. Normally this credit shall not exceed 50% of such actual experience or training time nor result in an allowable maximum credit of more than 30 months of this outside experience or training.
12
0
b.	Each of a series of successive breaks in service shall be computed in the same manner using the table above.
c.	The above table does not apply to an employee reengaged within 4 years after layoff as provided in Article 7 or employees returning from authorized leaves as provided in Article 6, but he/she will receive credit for the outside experience or training of value under "a" above.
4.	The provisions of "3" above shall also be applicable to such a former employee when re-employed in a higherrated job classification except that his/her wage rate and wage length of service on the higher-rated job shall be established as follows:
a.	The wage rate to be received on the higher-rated job shall be either the same as that calculated by the use of the above table for the lower-rated job at the exchange/WRA to which the employee is re-employed or the starting rate of the higher-rated job, whichever is greater. If the calculated rate is not an exact step on the wage scale for the higher-rated job, the employee shall be paid the nearest higher step rate.
b.	The wage length of service shall be the number of months applicable to the wage rate determined by "a" above.
5.	An employee of another BellSouth entity transferring to this bargaining unit on a higher-rated job classification shall have wage rate and wage length of service computed according to 2.06A. An employee of another BellSouth entity transferring to this bargaining unit in the same or lower-rated job classification will be given credit for the wage experience accrued with the other BellSouth entity. The employee's wage rate will be determined by reading the wage length of service directly into the wage scale being entered.
6.	Upon employment, persons who have previous experience with telecommunications companies shall be given wage
13
Article
experience credit commensurate with such previous training and experience that is of value to the Company, but in no event shall the wage experience credit allowed be more than the employee would have received had such previous training and experience been with this Company or another BellSouth Company as determined under the provisions of 2.02B3 of the Agreement.
C.	This section shall not apply to persons initially engaged for technical assignments, or to persons engaged for typing or stenographic work or other work comparable to the work performed by such persons prior to their engagement by the Company.
2.03 Wage Progression Schedules.
Wage progression increases shall be automatic unless the wage scales specifically state otherwise.
2.04 Effective Date for Progression Increases.
The effective date for progression increases shall be at six (6) month intervals, or at such other intervals as may be specified in the applicable Wage Tables.
2.05 Flexible Starting Rates.
It is agreed that the starting rate specified for any of the wage scales listed in Appendix B for any exchange or in Customer Markets Addendum for any WRA may be increased when the Company determines that the employment situation warrants such action in accordance with the following:
A.	In the event that such action is taken, the progression steps on the wage scale or scales affected at such exchange/WRA or exchanges/WRA’s shall be revised in accordance with the following procedure unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union:
1.	Establish the new starting rate which shall be an increase of not less than $3.00 per week.
14
0
	2.	Establish new progression steps in multiples of 500, but not less than $1.00, to meld the increased starting rate into the existing wage scale. 3.	The new progression steps shall be established at intervals of not less than 3 months nor more than 12 months. B.	On the date the new starting rate is placed in effect, the Company agrees to adjust the wage rates of all employees on the payroll as of that date to the new rates established in accordance with their wage experience. C.	At any time after the above action has been taken, the Company may reinstate the wage rates provided in the related wage scale or scales listed in Appendix B. However, if this is done, no employee on the payroll at that time will have his/her wage rate reduced because of this action. D.	The Company shall notify the Union in all instances where changes in starting rates are to be made. The Union shall have the right within 30 days from receipt of notice by the Company to conduct negotiations concerning such changes.
2.06	Promotional Increases. Employees promoted from one job to another within the bargaining unit will be accorded the following pay treatment: A. Promotional increases will be the higher of the start rate of the job to which promoted or 10% of the same step rate on the promoted-to wage scale added to the current pay, rounded up to the next higher step of the promoted-to wage scale, not to exceed the maximum rate for the promoted-to job. Example: Office Assistant on 24th month of WS 10, is promoted to a Special Assistant on WS 14 Current Pay for WS 10, 24th month = $674.00 WS 14, 24th month $735.00 x 10% = $73.50 (Promotional Increase) $674.00 + $73.50 = $747.50 (Proposed rate of pay)
15
Article
The nearest higher step on WS 14 is the 30th month. The employee will be moved to this step at $784.00 and wage experience adjusted to provide the employee with 30 months wage experience.
B.	For wage experience credit treatment for employees reclassified to a lower-rated job and who are subsequently promoted to a job on their previous wage scale within 5 years, see 8.02D.
C.	Where an employee is transferred to another exchange/WRA pursuant to a promotion, the transfer will first be made under 2.07 as appropriate, then the rate of pay will be calculated as shown in this article.
2.07 Transfers Without Change in Wage Scale to Exchanges/WRAs Having Lower/Higher Wage Zones/Wage Areas.
A.	Employees with 6 months service transferring to a lower wage zone/wage area shall suffer no change in their rate of pay unless their rate of pay is more than the maximum of the new zone/area. If their rate of pay is above the maximum at the new zone/area, the rate shall be reduced to the maximum. For employees with less than 6 months of service, the rate of pay shall be adjusted at the time of transfer to the rate applicable to their wage experience credit on the wage scale for the lower zone/area.
1.	If his/her rate is not above the maximum at the new location he/she shall continue at such rate until his/her wage length of service entitles him/her to an increase on the wage scale in effect at the new location.
B.	When an employee transfers to a higher wage zone/area, his rate of pay shall be adjusted to the same wage length of service for the higher zone/area.
C.	"A" and "B" above do not apply to transfers from other BellSouth companies. (See 2.02B5 for details on how to determine wage rates and wage experience credit for employees transferring from other BellSouth companies.)

	ARTICLE 3 SCHEDULING
3.01	Work Schedules A.	Work schedules for all employees shall be posted officially by 11:00 A.M. on each Thursday to show for each such employee his/her scheduled or assigned tours for the next 2 calendar weeks, except that all holiday schedules shall be posted not later than 11:00 A.M. on Tuesday of the second week preceding the week in which the holiday falls. B.	Work schedules shall stipulate the starting and ending time of such tours, together with the starting and ending time of each session. Intervals between sessions shall not be shifted, at the instance of the Company, except as necessary to meet service requirements. 1.	Lunch or meal periods between sessions which are shifted by the Company shall not be considered as a shift of tours under 3.03G. 2.	"B" above does not require the posting of starting and ending time of sessions for those tours that have no meal period. C.	Where employees work common hours as a group, a statement stating the hours may be posted for the work group. D.	At locations where no management person is assigned to supervise the employee involved, a letter to such employee which meets the requirements of 3.01B may be addressed to him/her advising that until further notice he/she is to work that schedule. At such locations, this shall be considered as complying with 3.01A.
3.02	Choice of Tours. A. Employees shall have the opportunity to exercise their seniority in preference for choice of tours, not less frequently than every 13 weeks (except where an employee enters the work group after assignment of tours have been made as outlined in Article 3). Employees returning from leaves of absence, layoff, employees coming in by transfer or
17
Article
employees who have their service bridged (entitling them to additional seniority), shall be granted choice of tours in accordance with their seniority at the next revision of the schedule. Once the basic schedule is completed on the basis of the above, no change shall be made in basic tour assignments until the next selection period except that the Company finds it necessary for service requirements to revise the basic schedule in less than 13 weeks. With each such revision in a basic schedule, the opportunity to exercise preference for choice of tours will be afforded.
B. Preference for choice of tours as set forth in this section does not contemplate the choice of furlough days (meaning nonscheduled days) which shall be assigned by the Company in such a manner as to arrange for every employee periodically to secure desirable furlough days. Sunday and holiday schedules shall be rotated among the employees within a work group in such a manner as to provide for the approximate equalization of both premium pay work opportunity and the privilege of securing Sundays and holidays as furlough days. Each holiday will be considered separately insofar as practicable in the rotation of holiday schedules. For Operating Room Forces of Operator Services only, Christmas Eve, Mother's Day, New Year's Eve, and Easter shall also be rotated even though they are not considered authorized holidays.
1.	When December 25th and January 1st fall on Sunday, holiday schedules for Operating Room Forces of Operator Services will be rotated for work on Sunday rather than Monday which is considered the holiday under 5.02. For employees who express a preference, choice of tours on such days worked shall nevertheless be assigned in the order of seniority.
2.	Employees on vacation for one or more full weeks will be considered unavailable for rotation of Sunday and holiday schedules beginning with Sunday of the first week and ending with Saturday of the last week except as provided under the provisions of 5.07B4a1.
18

3.03 Scheduling Tours.
A.	Insofar as service requirements permit, the Company shall assign tours in accordance with the preference of employees in the order of their seniority, except that seniority shall not entitle any employee to select a tour assigned by the Company to an Operator having less than six weeks' service. Training tours for Consumer Service Representatives, Sales Associates or Sales Consultant will normally not exceed 8 weeks, but may last up to 12 weeks with discussion with the Local President. Tours will be scheduled and assigned in accordance with 3.04 or 3.06 below.
It is not the intent of this article or any other provision in this Agreement to require the Company to revise a posted work schedule so as to assign an employee entering the work group the tours to which his/her seniority would otherwise entitle him/her.
B.	Tours may fall on any day of the week necessary to meet service requirements, except that the tours and part tours which make up the normal work week may not be spread over more than 6 days of the calendar week.
1.	Scheduled time is comprised of tours and/or part tours, and the scheduled time for any work day shall not exceed the length of a normal tour.
2.	Operating Room Forces week day schedules shall not include part tours that are the equivalent of morningafternoon tours, unless it is necessary to use such part tours because of service requirements.
3.	In the event it becomes necessary to schedule an employee to work more than 5 tours in a calendar week, the sixth and seventh day shall be considered as premium days on the weekly work schedule.
C.	No employee will be scheduled to work more than 13 consecutive days nor be required to work six days per week for more than two consecutive weeks without his/her consent except where acute service conditions develop caused by
19
Article
unanticipated service needs, fire, flood, storm, or other natural disaster. (See Appendix C, Part XIII.)
D.	Insofar as service requirements will permit, a minimum time interval of 12 hours (11 hours for Operating Room Forces) shall elapse between the scheduled ending time of one tour and the scheduled starting time of the next, except when a tour is assigned to an employee with less than the minimum interval between tours because of that employee exercising his/her seniority for the choice of tours. In such case the Company may change the employee’s schedule, at his/her request, pursuant to section 3.03G, to provide for the minimum interval between tours. Such a change will not be made in violation of the seniority rights of any other employee.
E.	Part tours may be scheduled for full-time employees; however, the Company recognizes the undesirability of scheduling such part tours for full-time employees.
F.	Employees shall be either scheduled and excused or scheduled to work on authorized holidays.
1.	Insofar as service requirements permit, employees shall be excused on authorized holidays.
2.	Insofar as service requirements permit, holiday assignments shall be rotated among the employees within a particular work group in accordance with 3.02, 3.04 and 3.06.
G.	Changes from officially posted weekly work schedules may be made, provided such changes do not result in a full-time employee being scheduled for less than a normal week and further provided such changes do not result in the payment by the Company of additional overtime, premium or penalty hours during the week involved, to provide for changes in hours, work days, or off days in accordance with the following:
1.	At the instance of the Company.
2.	At the written request of employees.
20
0
a.	Such requested changes shall be made when no replacement of the employee's schedule is required and when the services of the employee making the request may be profitably used during the hours to which he/she wishes to change.
b.	When a replacement of the employee's schedule is required, the change shall be made provided an agreeable shift can be made in the schedule of another employee and provided such other employee agrees to work the shifted tour at the regular rate.
c.	If the Company contacts an employee in connection with a shift of his/her tour and the employee agrees to the shift, the shift shall not be considered to be made at the request of the employee.
d.	Employees who are normally scheduled for tours ending after 7:00 P.M. will be scheduled for day tours (comparable to day tours worked by other employees in the work group) with starting times as near as possible to the court convening time, (or their schedule changed to such day tours) on the days they are to serve as jurors or witnesses. This will not be considered a shift of tours under 4.01E.
H.	Flexible Scheduling Concepts.
1.	The concepts listed in this section are designed to provide a variety of flexible schedules. The provisions listed in this section apply to all of the concepts, except as specified in 3.03I, J, K, and L. It is mutually agreed that neither party will support efforts to derive incidental or indirect benefits not specifically addressed in the various flexible concepts.
2.	Eligibility:
The flexible concepts may be applied to regular or temporary employees. It is recognized that these concepts may not be applicable for all work groups. Where utilized, the concept(s) will normally be offered to all
21
Article
eligible employees in the work group or administrative work unit which for the purpose of these concepts is defined as one or more supervisory groups of employees in the same title and department who have a common place of reporting and who perform essentially the same type of work. However, there may be situations justifying departure from this rule.
3.	Implementation:
Prior to implementation of a flexible concept, agreement must be reached between the local Union President and the Director of the involved work group concerning specific guidelines which fall within the general parameters for the pertinent concept. These agreements must be concurred in by the CWA State Representative and the Director - Labor Relations prior to implementation. Disputes arising from flexible scheduling concepts not resolved at the local level may be discussed between the CWA State Representative and the Director level of the business unit. Each party reserves the right to discontinue use of a concept with at least 30 days written notice. Disputes arising from implementation or discontinuance not resolved at the local or State Level will be referred to the Executive Level.
4.	Scheduling Tours:
Tours will be scheduled in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 and will incorporate any specific tour requirements necessary for a certain concept. It is recognized that certain conditions, such as attendance in schools, may necessitate the temporary reverting to a normal work schedule. It is not intended that the 30-day notification rule apply in these cases, nor would this be considered a change in schedule.
5.	Absences:
Excused absences (paid home conditions, paid miscellaneous time, paid Union absences, paid illness, etc.) would be paid at the appropriate number of hours for the scheduled day. Full weeks of benefits absence and
22
0
leaves of absence would be calculated based on a normal 5-day schedule.
6.	Overtime:
The overtime provisions outlined in Article 4 apply for overtime worked in excess of the scheduled tour.
7.	Differentials:
No evening or night differentials will be applicable for a person on flexible scheduling concepts unless some or all of the hours he/she works would have fallen within the differential period of 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. had the person not been on a flexible scheduling concept.
I.	Four-Day Work Week - Provision allowing the scheduling of a normal work week over 4 days.
1.	Tour Hours:
For employees normally scheduled 40 hours per week, each tour will be of 10 hours duration except as noted in 2 below. For those normally scheduled 37 1/2 hours per week, the maximum tour length will be 9 1/2 hours and the minimum tour length will be 9 hours. The length of a session will not exceed 5 3/4 hours with one 15-minute relief period assigned or allowed as near to the mid-point of each session as practicable.
2.	Holiday Week:
During a week with a specified holiday or Company Designated Excused Work Day, the employee will be scheduled 7 1/2 or 8 hours, as appropriate, on the holiday. For the remainder of the hours, the Local President and Director may mutually agree to allow the option of reverting to a normal 5-day schedule or scheduling the remaining hours over a 3-day period for any or all employees on a 4-day week. In the latter case the 3 nonholiday tours may be up to 11 hours duration.
3.	Time Off:
23
Article
One week segments of vacation will be scheduled and paid at either 37 1/2 or 40 hours per week as appropriate, based on the employee's normal work week. Vacation days taken in less than a full week segment, excused work days, and optional holidays will be based upon the length of the scheduled day and will be subtracted from the total hours of annual time-off entitlement (See chart below). Where there are insufficient hours remaining in any one category (vacation, EWD or optional holiday) to equate to a full tour, employees may combine hours from any of the three categories up to the length of a full tour. As an exception, a four-day work week employee excused on a Company Designated Excused Work Day will be paid for the entire day regardless of the remaining hours of paid EWD hours to which he/she is entitled. It is not intended that an employee would be forced to report to work in cases where less than a session remains after the exhaustion of vacation/EWD/optional holiday hours; however, if he/she wishes to take the entire session or tour off, he/she would be required to take non-paid time for the remaining hours of the session/tour.

5 Weeks Vacation ...		187.5 ...	... 30			7.5 			 30			255
24
0
4.	Differential:
With the exception of differentials described under 3.03H7, the payment of evening and night differentials shall be based upon tours which fall wholly or partly within the period from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. (For the job titles listed in Paragraph 3.07, evening and night differentials will not be paid for any tour with an ending time earlier than 8:00 p.m.)
J.	Flexible Time Scheduling - Provisions allowing flexibility in starting or ending times for tours.
1.	Eligibility:
Occasional employees are excluded.
2.	Implementation:
This concept does not require concurrence at the State Level.
3.	Tour Hours:
Certain hours will be designated as core hours during the full range of hours which employees in a work group may be required to cover. At least 60% of the group's normal work day should be covered by the core hours. Each employee will be required to be at work during the core hours; however, he/she may vary his/her beginning and ending times within the full range of hours in compliance with scheduling guidelines. Once basic tours are chosen, employees will be considered to be working these stated scheduled hours, even if they are on flextime.
4.	Overtime:
Call-outs which precede and connect to the basic schedule, and connecting overtime which is required prior to the start time of the basic schedule will be calculated based on the basic schedule, not on the flexible start time which an employee may have chosen. Connecting overtime following the completion of the employee's tour will be
25
Article
calculated based on the hours actually worked, not on the scheduled hours.
5.	Reverting to a basic schedule:
Employees on Flexible Time Scheduling may be required to revert to a basic schedule on a specified holiday.
K.	Flexible Length Tour Scheduling - Provision which allows the number of hours which presently constitute a normal work week to be scheduled in various length tours over either 4 or 5 days.
1.	Tour Hours:
There must be a minimum of 1 hour's difference between the shortest and longest tour for the week. No scheduled tour may exceed 10 hours nor be less than 1/2 the length of a normal tour under a 5-day schedule. A tour must be comprised of two sessions with a minimum length of 2 hours and a maximum of 5 hours. Relief periods will be allowed as near the mid-point of the session as practicable. For tours of 6.5 hours or less, one 30-minute relief will be allowed as near the mid-point of the session as practicable.
2.	Time Off:
The provisions of 3.03I3 will also apply to Flexible Length Tour Scheduling.
3.	Holiday Week:
During a week with a specified holiday or Company Designated Excused Work Day, all employees will revert to a normal (7 1/2 or 8 hour) length tour for that day.
L.	30-30-30 Concept - Provisions allowing the normal work day to be broken into four parts, separated by three 30-minute breaks.
1.	Eligibility:
30-30-30 will normally be applied to employees working a four-day work week; however, where mutually agreed, the concept may be applied to 5-day work week employees. Where implemented, 30-30-30 will be offered to all
26
0
members of the affected group unless otherwise agreed upon by the Local President and Director. Employees will be allowed to choose individually whether they wish to be placed on 30-30-30 or a traditional schedule.
2.	Tour Hours:
For the purpose of this concept, a session is considered to be 2 of the 4 parts of the tour, separated by the second 30-minute break. In determining the handling of relief and meal periods, the first 15 minutes of the first break will be considered the first relief period; the last 15 minutes of the last break will be considered the second relief period; all the break time between these 2 relief periods will be considered the meal period.
3.04 Assignment of Tours Other Than Open-End Scheduling.
A.	For all forces, other than employees scheduled in accordance with 3.06 where employees in the work group are not scheduled identical tours or sessions, the following principles and general procedures for the selection of tours will govern with the following exceptions:
1.	In work groups of 3 or less employees, the Company is not required to post the list described in "B2a" and "B2b" below.
2.	An employee assigned to a work group to relieve an absent employee will work the tour assigned to the absent employee.
3.	In the Business Office where an employee is temporarily assigned to a work group other than his/her own during a peak load period, his/her regular lunch period may be changed to meet service requirements during such temporary assignment.
4.	In the Network Department, the provisions of 3.04B7 will apply for tours on Sunday or holidays although separate schedules are not used.
B.	In conformity with Article 13, the following procedures shall be followed in the assigning of tours:
27
Article
1.	Employees will have the privilege of exercising seniority in preference for choice of tours in accordance with their seniority dates posted on the seniority list, and the Company will assign tours as chosen insofar as service requirements will permit.
2.	Not more than 4 weeks prior to the specified effective date of a new basic week day schedule (Monday through Friday or Monday through Saturday, as appropriate) or in the reassignment of an existing basic schedule, the Company will concurrently post:
a.	A copy of the schedule (or a notice) indicating the starting and ending time of tours, together with the starting and ending time of each session and the number of each group of tours.
Example--_____________________________________
Schedule Tours	Number of Tours
8:00 A.M. to 12:00 Noon- 1230 P.M. to 4:00 P.M.	6
8:15 A.M. to 12:15 P.M.- 1:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M.	4
9:30 A.M. to 1:00 P.M.- 5:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M.	3
3:00 P.M. to 7:00 P.M.- 8:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M.	3
The posting shall also show the effective date of the new schedule and the date (not earlier than 3 days following the date of posting) on which the Company will begin contacting employees as provided under "3" below.
b.	A list for each work group indicating the seniority date of each employee as of the effective date of the new schedule. For employees who will have their service bridged in accordance with 1.27A prior to or on the effective date of the new schedule, the seniority date to be indicated will be the new seniority date arrived at
28
0
by such bridging of seniority. No change shall be made in the seniority date shown on the list for an employee after his/her new seniority date has been passed in the assignment of tours. For the purpose of this section, employees temporarily assigned to a different work group in the same exchange/WRA will be considered as members of their regular group.
Employees with "Acting" titles in work groups other than those in which they regularly work will be included on the seniority list for the work group in which the "Acting" title is held, unless it is expected that the employees will return to their regular work group on or before the effective date of the new schedule.
c.	Where it is known prior to contacting for choice of tours that employees are to enter the work group under the provisions of Article 7 on or after the effective date of the new schedule, such employees will be listed on the seniority list referred to in "b" above and contacted for choice of tours under the provisions of "3" below.
3.	The Company will make a reasonable effort to contact employees on the seniority list in the order listed for the purpose of obtaining preferences for choice of tours except for the following: employees on vacation, employees absent from the town of their residence and employees on leave of absence. Since such contacts and the assignment to basic tours or to the relief force will be made in the order of seniority in accordance with the list referred to in "2b" above, the time consumed in attempting to contact each employee will be necessarily limited. Accordingly, it is contemplated that employees will express in advance assignments they prefer if they will not be readily available for such contact. Changes shall not be made in any assignment after an assignment is made to the next person on the list.
a.	Employees on vacation, employees on leave of absence who are expected to return on or before the
29
Article
effective date of schedule, employees absent from the town of their residence, and employees whom the Company was unsuccessful in its efforts to contact, unless they have expressed in advance a preference for a different available tour or an assignment to the relief force, shall be given assignments identical with their present assignments, if available. Employees who have not expressed a preference for an available tour, and for whom an identical assignment is not available, shall be assigned a tour of the same general type (MA, ME, A, etc.) with the nearest ending time to the ending time of their present assignment, or if a tour of the same general type is not available then a tour of a different type with the nearest ending time to the ending time of their present assignment.
b.	Employees on leave of absence who are expected to return on or before the effective date of the schedule who did not work during the present schedule and have not expressed a preference for choice of an available assignment on the new schedule shall be assigned any available tour or to the relief force.
c.	Employees who are assigned to the relief force under this Section may exercise their seniority in preference for choice of tours to be worked by the relief force. If preferred tours are not available, they shall be assigned tours of the same general type with an ending time nearest the ending time of the preferred tour. If tours of the same general type are not available, they shall be assigned tours of a different type with the ending time nearest the ending time of the preferred tour.
4.	After one or more employees with less seniority have been assigned, employees shall be placed on the seniority list described in "B2b" above immediately following the last employee who was assigned and shall have the next preference for choice of the assignments, upon any of the following conditions:
30
0
a.	Employees on leave of absence who were not expected to return before the effective date of the schedule.
b.	Employees reporting into the work group for duty by transfer, engagement, re-engagement, etc.
c.	Where it becomes known during the contacting for choice of tours that employees are to enter the work group under the provisions of Article 7 on or after the effective date of the new schedule.
5.	Employees who enter the work group or who return to work (except those returning from vacation or benefits) after all employees on the seniority list have been assigned shall have no seniority for preference in choice of assignments on this schedule. However, employees (except those re-entering by transfer or re-engagement) who have been given an assignment on the new schedule, who return to the work group during the period the schedule is in effect, shall continue on such assignments for the duration of the schedule.
a.	Where employees enter the work group under the provisions of Article 7 after all assignments have been made, such employees shall exercise full seniority for choice of tours in the relief force and on separate schedules.
b.	Employees mentioned in "5" above, who are considered as having no seniority for choice of assignments, will have no seniority for this purpose; but, where there are 2 or more such employees in the work group, they shall be afforded an opportunity to exercise seniority among themselves in preference for choice of assignments on the weekly work schedule.
6.	Employees having their service bridged after the effective date of the new schedule, thus entitling them to additional seniority, shall have the opportunity to express preference for choice of tours at the next time all employees within the group have an opportunity to express this preference.
31
Article
Until that time the old service date will determine seniority for choice of tours.
7.	Where separate schedules are used for Saturday and/or Sunday, Holidays, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, and on days observed locally as holidays (which affect work loads, but are not observed as Company holidays), the following procedures shall be followed:
a.	Concurrently with the posting of the basic schedule, the Company shall also post copies of separate Saturday schedules, if any, and Sunday schedules (or notices as illustrated in "2a" above).
1)	When changes are made in separate Saturday and/or Sunday schedules, the Company will post the new separate schedule (or a notice) by not later than Monday of the second week preceding the week in which the new schedule becomes effective.
2)	When separate holiday schedules or other separate schedules (as referred to above) are to be used, the Company will post a copy of the schedule (or notice) by not later than Monday of the fourth week preceding the week in which the schedule involved becomes effective. However, the rotation of holiday work, as provided under 3.02B, is to be applied only on holidays observed as authorized Company holidays.
b.	Employees shall have the same seniority for preferences for choice of tours on separate schedules as they have for preference for choice of tours on the basic schedule. Where such separate schedules are used, employees who have different preferences for choice of tours for work on such schedules shall express a preference for choice of tours to be worked on such schedules at the same time they express a preference for choice of tours on the basic schedule. For employees who do not express a different
32
0
preference for choice of tours to be worked on such schedules, their preferences for choice of tours on the basic schedule shall be considered to be their preference for choice of tours on such separate schedules.
c.	Preferences for choice of tours shall continue in effect for the duration of the basic schedule unless changed as provided in "d" below. Employees who are to be assigned to work on Sundays or holidays, under the provisions of 3.02B shall be assigned, in accordance with their seniority, tours of their preference (or the nearest available tours as described in "3a" above), insofar as service requirements permit. Employees who express preferences for choice of tours under "d" below shall be assigned tours of their preference, if available, or the nearest available tour, in the order of seniority, among all those employees who are to be assigned to work on the day or days involved.
d.	Employees who wish to change their preferences for choice of tours on separate Saturday and/or Sunday schedules shall notify their supervisor of their preferences for choice of such tours by not later than noon Monday preceding the Thursday on which the work schedule involved will be posted. Employees who wish to change their preferences for choice of tours on other separate schedules shall notify their supervisor of their preference for choice of such tours by not later than noon Monday of the third week preceding the week in which the other separate schedule is to be worked. Such changes in preferences for choice of tours should specify that the change is for a particular day or for such separate schedules during the remainder of the basic schedule.
8. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article and 3.02, employees entering or returning to the work group who have not been given work assignments in the current weekly work schedule may be assigned any available tours
33
Article
until the assignments on the next posted weekly work schedule are effective.
3.05 Force Movement - Operator Services Department (Operating Room Employees).
A.	The term "force group" as used herein applies to a group of Operating Room employees who may exercise their seniority for choice of tours on the same basic schedule and who report to the same Manager-Operator Services. Any reference to a "work group" in the Working Agreement shall be considered as applying to a "force group" insofar as Operating Room Forces are concerned.
B.	Employees may submit requests in writing to their ManagerOperator Services for reassignment to another force group under the same Manager-Operator Services or to another force group in a different Manager-Operator Services Unit at the same place of reporting. Such requests will be valid for a period of 6 months.
C.	Requests, in order to be actively considered, must meet the following conditions and limitations:
1.	The employee has been a member of his/her present force group for at least 6 months.
2.	The employee feels such reassignment will permit him/her to better exercise his/her seniority for choice of tours in the new force group.
3.	Service requirements will permit the release of the employee from the present force group.
4.	The services of the employee can be utilized in the other force group.
5.	The employee has been trained and is presently qualified to perform the work of the other force group.
D.	Requests which meet the conditions and limitations of "C" above shall be granted in the order of seniority among all employees having a valid request in, and, insofar as practicable, such reassignments shall be made effective as of
34
0
the effective date of the next basic schedule for the force group in which the employees are to be reassigned.
1.	Employees who are to be reassigned to another force group as of the effective date of the new basic schedule shall be included in the order of their seniority on the posted seniority list for such force group prior to the date on which the Company begins contacting employees for choice of tours, even though they will not be reassigned until the effective date of the new schedule.
2.	Employees reassigned to another force group shall have the same seniority for choice of tours on separate schedules as they have for choice of tours on the basic schedule.
E.	Employees entering a force group by reassignment at their request who have not completed their vacation for the vacation year shall make a selection from any of the remaining available vacation periods, if service requirements do not permit them to take the periods previously selected.
F.	Employees who request reassignment from one force group to another at the same place of reporting who are not reassigned because of their failure to meet the conditions of "C5" above will be placed on a training list and shall remain on this list until reassignment is made or the expiration of the 6 months period, whichever comes first.
1.	While the Company does not cross-train solely to provide more desirable tours, cross-training for such employees may, nevertheless, be appropriate. Insofar as service requirements permit, such employees will be given training in the order of seniority before other employees are given training on the work involved.
G.	During periods of light traffic, such as night, Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, one or more force groups or ManagerOperator Services Units may be assigned to handle the work which would otherwise be handled by other force groups and/or Manager-Operator Services Units.
35
Article
	H.	Ordinarily, a Manager-Operator Services Unit should consist of one force group for Operators. However, where there are multi-services provided within a Manager-Operator Services Unit and one force group is not practicable separate force groups (with separate schedules, seniority lists, and relief forces) may be used, provided each force group handles the work assigned to it without regularly relieving Operators in other force groups. I.	When reassignments are to be made at the instance of the Company, consideration shall be given to the wishes of the employees insofar as service requirements permit.
3.06	Assignment of Tours - Open-End Scheduling Procedures will apply for the following: •	Operating Room Forces of Operator Services, •	Centralized Repair Centers, •	Service Evaluation Forces, •	Service Representatives (not applicable for CPE), •	Sales Associate, •	Sales Consultant, •	Collections Representatives, •	and any other administrative work unit as may be agreed to by the Company and the Union at the local level and concurred in at a higher level. A. In conformity with Article 13, the following procedures will be followed in the assigning of tours in 3.06 above. 1.	Where separate schedules are used for Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, and on days observed locally as holidays, the Company will post a copy of the hours of operations by no later than Monday of the third week preceding the week in which the schedule involved becomes effective 2.	Employees will express their preferences for tours by completing and signing a "Choice of Hours" form and submitting it to the immediate supervisor or designated representative. Four separate preferences will be shown as follows: Weekday, Saturday, Sunday, and holidays. Employees will be assigned in accordance with their
36
0
seniority tours for which they have expressed a preference, or, if such tours are not available, another tour of the same type, for Operating Room Forces only, tours (as specified in Table A of 3.07) or, if not available, a tour of a different type with an ending time nearest the ending time of the stated choice insofar as service requirements permit. Preferences recorded on this form will remain in effect until they are changed by the employee as provided below.
a.	Weekday, Saturday or Sunday Schedules -- Any employee may change his/her preference for choice of hours for Weekday, Saturday or Sunday Schedules by submitting a revised "Choice of Hours" form by not later than Tuesday noon of the third week preceding the week he/she desires the change to be effective.
b.	Holiday Schedules -- Any employee may change his/her preference for choice of hours on holiday schedules by submitting a revised "Choice of Hours" form by not later than noon Tuesday of the third week preceding the week in which the holiday schedule is to be worked.
3.	Employees entering the work group (returns from leaves, transfers-in, instances where seniority has bridged, etc.) will, upon their entry, be inserted in the seniority list at the point their seniority dates indicate they should be placed. These employees will have the opportunity to exercise their seniority for choice of tours on the next posted weekly work schedule in accordance with the provisions of "2a" and "2b" above.
a.	For Operating Room Forces, Clerks and Service Assistants who are assigned to work as Operators will be placed on the seniority list below all Operators.
b.	Regardless of any other provisions of this Article, employees entering or returning to the work group who have not been given work assignments in the current weekly work schedule may be assigned any available tours until the assignments on the next posted weekly
37
Article
work schedule are effective in accordance with the provisions of "2a" and "2b" above.
4.	During periods of lower call volume, such as night, Saturday, Sunday and Holidays, one or more units or Manager-Operator Services Units may be assigned to handle the work which would otherwise be handled by other units and/or Manager-Operator Services Units.
5.	Ordinarily, a Manager-Operator Services Unit should consist of one force group for Operators. However, where there are multi-services provided within a ManagerOperator Services Unit and one force group is not practicable, separate force groups (with separate schedules, seniority lists and relief forces) may be used, provided each force group handles the work assigned to it without regularly relieving Operators in other force groups.

1. In case of Operating Room Forces of Operator Services working the Afternoon-Evening Short (6-1/2 hours) and the Evening-Night Short (6 hour) tours, one 30 minute relief period shall be assigned as near the mid-point of the tour as practicable instead of the two 15 minute periods.

It is not the intent of the parties that the practices of the Company in the matter of granting relief periods shall be changed except in those instances where an employee or group of employees abuse or take improper advantage of rights under this Section. C.	In cases of overtime connecting work, as defined in 1.04, when an employee requests time off for a meal period such request will be granted, without pay, if practicable in view of the nature or expected duration of the overtime work.

49
Technician, Systems Specialist Technician, Systems Technician and Testing Technician will be on the following basis:
1.	At 11:00 A.M. on the Friday following the close of each payroll period an overtime report will be posted by each employee's supervisor and made available to others who participate in the allocation of overtime. This list will be used for any overtime assignments made after the 11:00 A.M. posting that are to be worked during the 2-week period beginning at midnight on the Saturday following its posting. A separate report will be prepared for each work unit and will list the employees in order of the number of overtime hours worked during the report period. The overtime hours will include non-scheduled hours worked and scheduled weekly overtime hours worked.
a. The overtime report will show for each employee, his/her name and the cumulative total of overtime hours worked during the elapsed portion of a 12-week period. The 12-week period will begin on the first day of a payroll period and conclude at the end of the twelfth week (sixth payroll period). Such 12-week periods will run consecutively. At the start of each 12-week period the overtime report will begin anew. Employees entering a new work unit (either temporarily or permanently) will be credited with an average of the cumulative hours accrued by the members of that work unit as shown on the current overtime report.
1)	If 2 or more employees in the work unit worked the same number of overtime hours, such employees will be grouped and listed in inverse order of their seniority.
2)	Overtime hours worked during the work day at a temporary location will be recorded on the overtime report for the temporary location as well as the home location.
50
3)	Employees who do not desire overtime must notify their supervisors in writing. This notification will be indicated by an asterisk on the report and will remain in effect until canceled in writing. The initial notification and the subsequent cancellation must be received at least one week prior to the posting of the overtime report.
4)	For situations where there are not enough qualified volunteers, the general manager or their designee and the Local President will meet to discuss alternatives before forcing overtime.
2.	Non-scheduled, non-connecting overtime will be offered to available qualified employees in the work unit, excluding those who do not desire overtime, in the inverse order of overtime hours worked during the previous period. In work units where a stand-by technician has been designated as described in 4.06B8, the stand-by technician(s) will be contacted prior to any other employees on the overtime list.
3.	When an employee declines, after being offered a nonscheduled, non-connecting overtime assignment, the next qualified employee on the overtime report, omitting those who do not desire overtime, will be contacted. This procedure will be followed until someone accepts or all available qualified employees in the unit have been contacted and offered the assignment. Should all available qualified employees in the unit decline, the overtime will be assigned to the employee lowest in seniority and qualified, including those who do not desire overtime, unless the employee has a valid personal reason for not accepting the assignment or unless the employee has already worked 12 hours of overtime in the current week. Network Operations employees will be assigned no more than 10 hours of overtime in a calendar week during 4 months in a calendar year or no more than 12 hours in a
51
calendar week during 8 months in a calendar year. The level of assigned overtime for each month shall be at the sole discretion of the Company. Months with equal levels of assigned overtime need not be contiguous.
4.	When all available qualified employees in a given unit are needed to perform non-scheduled, non-connecting overtime work, such employees, including those who do not desire overtime, will be so advised when they are initially contacted. In this event they will be expected to accept the overtime assignment unless they have a valid personal reason for declining.
5.	When a supervisor fails to offer non-scheduled, nonconnecting overtime to available qualified employees in the inverse order listed on the report and offers the assignment to another employee or employees, the bypassed available qualified employees will be paid a penalty of 4 hours pay at the overtime rate. This penalty pay will be due only if the employee was available and qualified, but was not offered the call-out. The number of employees who are due penalty pay under this section will not exceed the number of employees who erroneously worked the overtime assignment. Penalty payments due under this section are to be reported the next work day following the date the employee, or the Union, and the supervisor agree that penalty pay is due the by-passed employee. Such penalty pay hours will not be included in determining the equivalent of 5 normal tours in computing weekly overtime.
6.	Under this procedure an employee may be offered nonscheduled, non-connecting overtime without regard to his/her position on the overtime report if he/she has been working on such assignment to the extent that it could be completed in an economical manner.
7.	Employees who are on vacation for one or more full weeks will be considered as unavailable beginning with Sunday of the first week and ending with Saturday of the last
52
week. Employees who are on vacation for less than a week will be considered as unavailable on the day(s) they are on vacation.
8.	Stand-by technicians (CPE see Customer Markets Addendum) will be available after normal hours or on non-scheduled days to respond within one hour to a call from the duty supervisor and will be available for contact via telephone or pager at all times during his/her period of duty.
a.	Provided there are enough qualified volunteers, the Company may designate one or more stand-by technicians within a work unit. Designations will be rotated in seniority order among volunteers.
b.	If there are not enough qualified volunteers, the Senior Director and Local President will meet in an attempt to resolve this issue.
c.	Stand-by technicians may be assigned for periods of duty as follows:
-	one-day coverage (holidays only)
-	weekend coverage (2 days - Saturday and Sunday)
-	extended weekend coverage (3 days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday)
-	5-day coverage (Monday - Friday)
-	a full week coverage (7 days - Monday - Sunday)
Designation as stand-by technician may be made for periods not to exceed one week before being rotated to the next available technician. Upon agreement with the Local President(s) and Director, the stand-by technician coverage may be expanded beyond his/her work unit area.
d.	The Company will give the participants and Local President 14 days	advance notice prior to
53
discontinuing the stand-by technician in a work unit. Employees who desire to be removed from the standby technician duties will give written notice 14 days prior to being removed from the list.
Any employee who subsequently wants to be placed on the stand-by technician list should notify his/her immediate supervisor and will be placed at the end of the rotation list. The stand-by technician(s) will be the first called for non-connecting, non-scheduled overtime assignments except in cases of full-day callouts.
e.	When more than one stand-by technician is designated in a work unit, the call-out assignments will be rotated among the designees for that period. Pay provisions for a stand-by technician on call are as follows:
1)	1 hour’s pay per day at the overtime rate for a scheduled work day.
2)	2 1/2 hours’ pay per day at the overtime rate for an unscheduled work day.
f.	Regular call-out payment provisions will apply in addition to “e” above.
C.	Allocation of connecting overtime for employees described in 4.06B will be on the following basis:
1.	Connecting overtime will be offered, insofar as practicable, to qualified employees in the work unit in the inverse order of appearance on the overtime report described in 4.06B1 omitting those who do not desire overtime.
a.	The Company will give employees as much notice as practicable when connecting overtime will be required on any given day.
b.	Employees having valid personal reasons for not working overtime on a particular day should notify their supervisor as far in advance as practicable.
54
c.	When all available qualified employees, including those who do not desire overtime, in a given unit are needed to perform connecting overtime work, such employees will be so advised when they are initially contacted. In this event they will be expected to accept the overtime assignment unless they have a valid personal reason for declining.
2.	The Company will not be required to reassign a work assignment in progress at the end of the employee's tour because of his/her position on the overtime report.
3.	If all available (on duty) qualified employees decline the offered overtime, it will be assigned to the employee lowest in seniority and qualified on the overtime report including those who do not desire overtime unless there is a valid personal reason for not accepting the assignment or unless the employee has already worked 12 hours of overtime in the current week. Network Operations employees will be assigned no more than 10 hours of overtime in a calendar week during 4 months in a calendar year or no more than 12 hours in a calendar week during 8 months in a calendar year. The level of assigned overtime for each month shall be at the sole discretion of the Company. Months with equal levels of assigned overtime need not be contiguous.
4.	The penalty pay provision specified in 4.06B5 will not be applicable, as such, in the resolution of disputes which may arise as to the allocation of connecting overtime.
D.	Scheduled overtime in excess of 5 tours per week for employees described in 4.06B (4 tours for employees on 4-day work week schedules) will be allocated to qualified available employees in the inverse order of appearance on the overtime report in effect.
E.	When an employee in one of the titles listed in 4.06B has worked 12 hours of overtime in a week he/she will have the
55
right to refuse further overtime without giving a reason except when long term service difficulties exist or when substantial service interruptions occur. Network Operations employees will be assigned no more than 10 hours of overtime in a calendar week during 4 months in a calendar year or no more than 12 hours in a calendar week during 8 months in a calendar year. The level of assigned overtime for each month shall be at the sole discretion of the Company. Months with equal levels of assigned overtime need not be contiguous. The parties recognize that service difficulties for an extended period may develop from time to time during which suspension of the above overtime limitations would be appropriate. In the event such service difficulties develop, the Company and the Union will meet to discuss the problem and determine how to best deal with the situation.
F.	Insofar as practicable, the Company will give 2 hours notice prior to assigning connecting overtime.
G.	Nothing in this procedure will require the Company to offer a new overtime assignment to an employee who has already worked 15 hours of overtime in the current week.
H.	All employees have the option of either time off or overtime payments when the employee works overtime. (For CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
1.	The option to take compensatory time off will be voluntary on the part of the employee and must be agreed to by the employee's supervisor and will be granted in accordance with 5.07F.
2.	Compensatory time off must be taken in the same payroll period in which the overtime occurred.
3.	Compensatory time off may only be taken for overtime hours worked at the 1 1/2 times rate. Such compensatory time off will be granted at the rate of 1 1/2 hours for each hour of overtime worked.
56
	4.	For all employees, overtime hours worked and taken as compensatory time off will be considered overtime hours worked. 5.	There is no intent to change the way overtime is offered.
4.07	Differential Payments. A.	Employees shall be paid, in addition to their basic rates, differentials for working tours which fall wholly or partly within the period 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M., in accordance with Table "A" of 3.07 and "B", "C", "D", "E" and "F" below, as appropriate, except, the total number of differentials to be paid for any work between 7:00 P.M. and the following 7:00 A.M. shall not exceed 2. B.	All employees, except those who work in Operator Services and are covered by the provisions of Table A of 3.07, will be paid differentials for those tours which fall wholly or partially within the period 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. in the amount of 10% of their basic wage rate. C.	Where connecting overtime work (see 1.04) extends into a period for which evening or night differentials are payable, compensation for that day shall include a differential payment in the amount of 10% of the basic daily wage rate except that no such differential will be payable for time worked between the hours of 7:00 P.M. and 8:00 P.M. D.	Where overtime of 4 or more hours duration is worked which does not connect with a scheduled tour, and any part of the overtime is between the hours of 7:00 P.M. and 7:00 A.M., compensation for that day shall include the proper proportion of the applicable differential payment. E.	Only one evening or night differential shall be paid for work performed between 7:00 P.M. and the following 7:00 A.M. except in cases where an employee has earned such a differential under "C" or "D" above and starts his/her next scheduled work prior to 7:00 A.M.
57
F.	When an Operator Services employee is temporarily assigned to work on a job on a different wage scale performing duties other than those in Operator Services and works a normal tour for the job to which he/she is loaned, such employee shall be paid applicable evening and night differentials in the amount of 10% of his/her basic rate.
G.	Any employee, except Service Assistants and employees designated as Working Leader, directed by the Company to assist in the training of a group of employees will be paid, in addition to his/her basic rate, differentials for tours so worked in accordance with the following:
1.	Basic Conditions:
a.	Operators leaving their switchboard work to assist in the training of one or more Operators will be regarded as performing the duties of coach, and for such periods as they are so engaged will be entitled to receive the differential set forth in "2" below.
b.	An Operator who handles regular duty at his/her switchboard position and, in addition, gives assistance and directions to an Operator in training in an adjacent position (the Operators' telephone sets of the 2 positions being bridged) will receive the differential set forth in "2" below. When an Operator in training is "plugged in" with another Operator for listening purposes only, and the other Operator is not called on to make explanations or render any assistance to the Operator in training, the other Operator is not entitled to the differential.
c.	A Service Representative who assists in the training of another Service Representative or Communications Assistant who assists in the training of another Communications Assistant, in the manner described in "b" above for Operators, will receive the differential set forth in "2" below.
58
d.	Employees paid on Wage Scales 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 who are designated by the Company to train another employee to qualify for a work assignment, as differentiated from answering questions about his/her work or explaining his/her work duties as a matter of information, will receive the differential set forth in "2" below.
e.	Employees paid on Wage Scales 30, 31 and 32 who are designated by the Company to give initial training to a newly appointed employee who has not received formal training will be paid a differential, as set forth in "2" below, for not more than 10 tours or 20 sessions for each employee so trained.

H.	Supervisory-Relief Differentials.
1.	Rate of Differential. When an employee is designated by the Company to relieve a management employee or to perform supervisory work, he/she shall be paid a supervisory relief differential of 10% above his/her basic hourly rate of pay for such time worked provided he/she performs such work for 2 or more hours during the calendar week.
2.	"Acting" Titles. When an employee is designated to perform temporarily the supervisory duties of a first line or higher supervisor and that designation is expected to run for a period of longer than 5 weeks, he/she shall be reclassified temporarily to the title of "Acting" for the supervisor being relieved. If an employee has been relieving a supervisor on a differential payment basis for a
59
period of 5 weeks he/she shall be reclassified to the title of "Acting" if the relieving assignment is expected to continue for 5 or more additional weeks. Upon the end of an "Acting" designation, the employee shall receive the rate of pay to which his/her wage length of service entitles him/her on the job that he/she thereafter performs.
I.	Working on Higher-Rated Job
1.	An employee working temporarily on a higher-rated job classification within the bargaining unit shall receive a differential of 10% above his/her basic hourly rate of pay for such time worked provided he/she performs such work for 2 or more hours during the calendar week. (See 2.06 for wage computation.) Differentials are limited to those instances in which an employee is substituting in a job carrying a higher top basic weekly rate than the job on which the substituting employee normally works except that an employee in formal training for work on a higherrated job classification within the bargaining unit but who has not been promoted to the higher-rated job classification shall receive differential payment during the period of such training (see 13.03A1).
2.	In no event shall the basic pay of the employee substituting in a higher-rated job plus differentials under "1" above be more for a calendar week than his/her wage experience credit entitles him/her to receive when applied to the higher wage scale for the job on which he/she is temporarily working.
3.	When an employee is designated temporarily to work full time on a higher-rated job classification within the bargaining unit and that designation is expected to run for a period of longer than 4 weeks, he/she shall be reclassified temporarily to the title of "Acting" in the higher-rated job classification and paid in accordance with 2.06. If an employee has been working on a differential payment basis for a period of 4 weeks, he/she shall be reclassified to the title of "Acting" if the relieving
60
assignment is expected to continue for 3 or more additional weeks. Upon the end of such designation, the employee shall receive the rate of pay to which his/her wage length of service entitles him/her on the job that he/she thereafter performs.

1.	An employee will be paid a Central City Differential of $1.00 for each day he/she works after reporting to a qualified location, except that an employee who only works 1/2 the length of a normal tour or less will be paid 500.
2.	Not more than one daily differential of $1.00 will be paid to an employee on any one day.
3.	The Central City Differential will enter into computations of overtime pay required under the terms of the Fair Labor Standards Act but will not be part of the basic rate for any other purpose nor enter into the computations of any payments under the "short-term disability program", the "AT&T Pension Benefit Plan", or any other fringe benefits or differentials.

5.07 Scheduling Vacations, Optional Holidays, Days in lieu of Holidays which Occur During a Scheduled Vacation Week and Excused Work Days
A.	Insofar as service requirements permit, vacations, Optional Holidays, days in lieu of holidays which occur during a scheduled vacation week and Excused Work Days may be taken at any time during the calendar year with as many vacation periods being made available during the desirable periods of the year as is consistent with service requirements. Not later than October 15th of the preceding year, the Company shall post a statement showing the available periods within which these days may be taken for the following year.
B.	Not earlier than November 1st the Company will make a reasonable effort to contact employees, in the order of their seniority, so that they may choose a vacation period, Optional Holidays, days in lieu of holidays which occur during a scheduled vacation week and Excused Work Days from those available except that an employee will not be permitted to select more than 4 weeks during the months of June through September.
1.	Employees who will not be readily available between November 1st and December 15 may express their preference for choices in advance of being contacted, and if available, their choices will be assigned as chosen in accordance with seniority, insofar as service requirements permit.
2.	Employees shall select in the priority herein set forth in seniority order and the selections will be granted insofar as service requirements permit.
3.	Employees not making a selection at the time of contact, employees not expressing advance choices, employees whose advance choice is not available, and employees whom the Company was unable to contact after a reasonable effort to do so shall be passed over but shall
73
have the right to make a selection from the remaining available vacation periods in accordance with their seniority at any subsequent time prior to December 15.
4.	For an employee electing to take his/her vacation in segments, he/she shall be entitled to exercise preference for only one segment until all other employees who have expressed preference for his/her vacation or the first segment has been assigned or has been passed over because their preference was not available.
a.	A segment of vacation is a continuous period of vacation (in full week increments beginning with Sunday of the first week and ending with Saturday of the last week) with no work time between the beginning and end of such vacation period.
1)	When work group size allows, the employee will not be scheduled to work the Saturday preceding a segment of vacation or the Sunday following a segment of vacation.
b.	If the last day of the year falls on any day other than a Sunday, the week in which it falls will be considered as if the entire week were in the calendar year under selection. All vacation days taken during this segment will be from among those vacation days to which the employee is entitled during the calendar year under selection. Furthermore, the vacation day to be selected in lieu of the New Year's Day holiday will be rescheduled under "5" below.
5.	After all vacations have been selected, a canvass will be made in seniority order for the selection of Excused Work Days (paid and non-paid), Optional Holidays and days in lieu of holidays which occur during a scheduled vacation week. Such scheduling will immediately follow the scheduling of vacation weeks and will be completed by December 15. This time will be chosen in seniority order within each vacation group with employees choosing all
74
such time off at one time even though the days selected may not be consecutive.
a.	In the scheduling of Excused Work Days, Optional Holidays, and days in lieu of holidays occurring during scheduled vacation weeks, the Company shall designate the days available and the number of employees to be off at any time during the calendar year under selection. These days will be designated in the same manner as the posting of vacation selection.
b.	No restrictions will be imposed on the number of employees who may select any specific day as an Optional Holiday. However, if an employee selects a day on which no days are available on the lists, the provisions of 5.07D will not apply and the Company will honor these requests in seniority order as service requirements permit. Employees who choose an "unavailable" day as an Optional Holiday and who subsequently must be scheduled to work due to service requirements will be paid in accordance with 5.01B3.
c.	If an employee selects an Optional Holiday on a date which is still available on the schedule, the provisions of 5.07D will be applicable.
6.	Employees who have not made a vacation selection by December 15th, may select from the remaining available periods insofar as service requirements permit.
7.	During the selection period an employee who has made a selection will not be allowed to change that selection. Insofar as service requirements permit, an employee shall be assigned the periods of his/her choice.

B.	The term Military Service includes active duty, active duty for training, initial active duty for training and full-time national guard duty with the Armed Forces of the United States.
C.	Absence from the job to perform military service with the Armed Forces will be categorized as follows:
1.	Military absences less than 31 Days - Granted to employees who are members of a federally recognized Component of any branch of the Armed Forces, who are called out for a training period normally not to exceed 2 weeks or for active emergency service not in excess of 30 days. (If emergency extends beyond one month, a Personal Leave will be granted.) Requests to be excused for military training or duty involving absence of more than two weeks in one year will be considered individually.
2.	Military Leaves of Absence - Granted to an employee entering "active duty", as described in "B" above, covering the period from the date of entry through the date of discharge.
a.	Military Leaves of Absence will be granted to regular and temporary employees. For the purposes of this section, temporary employees will include all temporary employees within the meaning of this
91
Agreement except those who leave a "temporary position" within the meaning of the Act.

Employees who at the expiration of their military leaves of absence are requested to remain on active duty for the convenience of the federal government will have their leave extended in accordance with the Act providing the Company is furnished a copy of the employee's military orders extending the tour of active duty.

E.	Pay Treatment.
1.	"Government Pay" for the purposes of this section will include basic pay, pay for special or hazardous duty and, for those with dependents, the difference between quarters allowances established for members of the uniform services with dependents and those established for members of the uniform services with equal rank without dependents. Government pay is based on 7 calendar days per week when used to determine the differences between Company pay and Government pay.
2.	"Company Pay" for the purposes of this section will be the amount of the employee's basic pay as defined in 1.24 of this Agreement. Company pay is based on the employee's regular weekly pay for the 5 scheduled work days per week prior to the beginning date of the absence for military service when used to determine the difference between Company pay and Government pay.
3.	Employees ordered as members of a Component or Unit to attend a training period, normally not to exceed 2 weeks, or to active emergency service for a period not to exceed 30 days, will be paid the amount, if any, by which their regular Company pay exceeds Government pay. However, it is not the intent of any of the foregoing to provide such payments for more than 10 work days in any one 12 month period unless such payments are made with Department Head level or higher approval.
4.	Employees who are granted leave for military service under this Agreement will, when their Company pay is greater, receive the difference between their Company pay and their Government pay in accordance with the provisions of this section. Moreover, the period during which an employee is eligible for such difference in pay, if
93
any, will be based on the employee's term of service and the type of entry into military service. Such pay determinations will be as follows:
a.	Employees with less than one year of seniority who (1) are drafted or inducted or who are subject to induction and enlist for the minimum period into the military service, or (2) who are members of a Component (including the Reserve and National Guard) and the Unit or employee as an individual is involuntarily ordered or called into active duty will be paid for the first 2 weeks with an additional 3 months if the employee has a spouse and/or dependent children under 18 years of age on the beginning date of the leave for military service.
b.	Employees with one year or more of seniority who (1) are drafted or inducted or who are subject to induction and enlist for the minimum period into military service, or (2) who are members of a Component (including the Reserve and National Guard) and the unit or the employee as an individual is involuntarily ordered or called into active duty will be paid for the first 3 months with an additional 3 months if the employee has a spouse and/or dependent children under 18 years of age on the beginning date of the leave.
c.	Employees who have not previously served on active duty and who voluntarily enlist in a Reserve Component of the Armed Forces which requires the employee as a condition of the enlistment to perform a period of training duty usually for a 6 month period and upon completion of such training returns to Reserve status will be paid in accordance with "a" and "b" above.
d.	Employees not subject to induction but who voluntarily enlist in the Armed Forces for a period of active duty, regardless of seniority, will be paid the
94
0
difference in pay for the first 2 weeks with no dependent pay.
e.	Employees who have dependents other than a spouse or child under 18 years of age at the commencement of the leave will, upon submission of proof of dependency, receive special payments from the Company not to exceed those provided for dependents herein.
F.	Vacation Treatment.
1.	Employees entering the military service, for which a leave has been granted, will be given such vacations to which they are entitled under this Agreement. A lump sum payment in lieu of any unused vacation to which an employee may be entitled at the date on which the leave begins will be made at that time as if he/she had worked the entire calendar year.
2.	Upon being re-employed after returning from leave, employees will receive any vacation to which they are entitled under the provisions of the Agreement then in effect to the extent that such vacation may be taken within the current calendar year. The limitations contained in 5.10 of this Agreement will not be applicable.
3.	Participation in training or emergency duty as outlined herein will not affect the regular vacation to which the employee may be entitled.
G.	Concession Telephone Service.
When an employee is granted a military leave, concession telephone service may be continued during the period the employee is on leave provided the service is being furnished within the Company to the employee or a member of his/her family to whose support he/she contributes.
95
H.	Payroll Deductions.
All payroll deduction authorizations will be canceled as of the date on which the military leave begins.
I.	Application of Pay Treatment Where an Employee Reports for Military Service More Than Once.
1.	If an employee has received payments as outlined above and returns to the employ of the Company and thereafter within 12 months of his/her return is granted another military leave, he/she will receive such pay in connection with such subsequent leave as provided in this section less the total amount of payments made in connection with such previous military service.
2.	The amount of pay as provided above for an employee granted a military leave will be reduced by payments, if any, made (for absences during the 60 days prior to the effective date of the leave) to such employee excused and paid under this section.
J.	Status Under Short Term Disability.
1.	Employees re-employed by the Company under the provisions of 6.06 and in accordance with the Act will be entitled to full seniority for the period of absence in the Armed Forces.
2.	Leaves for military services granted under this section will be with eligibility to death benefits, and with eligibility to short-term disability benefits at the termination of such leave if the employee is then incapacitated, all in accordance with the terms of the short-term disability program.
a. Death benefit payments, where payable in death cases occurring during the period of a leave for military service, will be based upon term of seniority at the time the leave was granted plus the elapsed time on the leave to the date of death and will be computed at the
96
0
	rate of Company pay which the employee was receiving at the time the leave began. b. Short-term disability benefit payments, where payable, will be based upon seniority at the time the leave for military service was granted plus the elapsed time on leave to the termination of the leave and will be computed on the basis of the rate of Company pay in effect at the time of the employee's re-employment. ARTICLE 7 FORCE ADJUSTMENTS
7.01	Reduction in Force. (Also see Appendix A - Family of Skills). A. The Company will determine the necessity, extent and procedures for adjusting forces, subject to the procedural limitations set forth in this Article. 1.	These procedures apply to both technological/operational efficiency and economic surplus except where specified. 2.	The Company will endeavor to keep at a minimum the number of regular, full-time employees within a work group who will become surplus. To this end, the Company will utilize temporary employees as appropriate to supplement affected work groups prior to a known change which will diminish the total number of employees. Notwithstanding 1.33, the Company may hire such employees on a temporary basis for an 24-month period (or less) prior to the scheduled date of a technological change. In the event the actual date of the change exceeds the scheduled date by 6 months, temporary employees will be reclassified to regular employees. Such temporary hiring may take place in the exchange/WRA where the change is to occur and in other exchanges/WRA to which
97
the Company reasonably believes that regular employees affected by the change may desire to transfer.
3.	The Company may extend an upfront Supplemental Income Protection Plan (SIPP) offer to employees prior to adjusting forces and outside of the force adjustment process. Such offers may be made by title, performing essentially the same type work within an exchange/WRA. The number of employees accepting SIPP will not exceed the number of employees determined by the Company. This procedure will be handled in accordance with the following:
a.	SIPP is granted in seniority order to employees performing essentially the same type work, in the organizational unit, in the exchange/WRA.
b.	Employees opting to take SIPP must have at least 1 year of seniority, are not entitled to enter the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank, and do not have recall rights.
c.	Employees will have 10 calendar days from the date of the offer to accept SIPP. After the 10 day period, the SIPP acceptance cannot be revoked.
d.	Upfront SIPP may be combined with a Transitional Leave.
e.	The Company will determine the date the employees will leave the payroll. Neither such determination by the Company nor any other part of 7.01A3 will be subject to arbitration.
4.	A vacancy will not be considered to exist when an employee desires to follow his/her work to another exchange due to reorganization, relocation of existing work or centralization.
a.	If the number of employees performing the work in the current exchange(s)/WRA(s) exceeds the number needed to perform the work in the new exchange/WRA, affected employees will be allowed,
98
0
in seniority order, regardless of their current exchange/WRA, to follow their work to the extent that jobs are available.
b.	Employees may elect to follow their work across state lines.
5.	Surplus declarations will be made effective among regular employees performing essentially the same type of work within the surplus exchange/WRA* and the affected organizational unit. (See 1.17 for definition.) The Company will notify, in writing, by 15th of month preceding surplus quarter the Vice President and appropriate State Director of the Union or their designees all anticipated force reductions prior to the reductions.
* Timeline for notification not applicable for economic surplus declaration within CPE organization.
6.	Except as limited by 7.01C3, employees announced surplus are eligible for Employment Security PARTNERSHIP services as described in Article 24. This program provides guidance to surplus employees on career counseling, training and retraining, job opportunities, etc.
7.	The seniority of employees will be determined as of the date of displacement.
B.	Temporary employees hired under 7.01A2 will be separated first.
In the event it is unnecessary to terminate the services of all such employees, those to be retained will be selected in the order of seniority.
C.	If further force reductions are necessary, the following procedures should be followed.
If there is more than one force adjustment occurring simultaneously or within the same general time frame in the same exchange/WRA, the affected employees should be
99
grouped for the purpose of reclassifying such employees to vacancies for which they qualify. However, subsequent force surpluses announced within the same general time frame will not affect the status of an employee who has previously been notified of assignment to a vacancy under these procedures.
The following employees (regardless of their present organizational unit) will, in order of seniority, receive priority consideration when the Company fills vacancies at and below the employee’s current wage scale (regardless of the organizational unit in which the vacancies exist).
-	- Surplus employees identified in 7.01A5.
-	- Employees on technological or sabbatical leaves whose leaves of absence are expiring in the exchange/WRA.
-	- Employees who have return rights to the title pursuant to 7.01K. (Present title or previous title in original exchange/WRA.)
-	- Employees who are participants in the Job Bank as described under 24.05D4.
-	- Employees described under 12.02F.
-	- Employees displaced from their current jobs because of permanent medical restrictions. (See 8.05B.)
-	- Employees holding part-time jobs in the same title where the vacancy exists, who were displaced into such status. The failure of an employee to accept a full-time status offer relieves the Company of any further obligation to offer that employee full-time status.
The normal sequence for handling this procedure shall be in accordance with the following steps and shall apply to both technological and economical surplus unless excluded in the step(s):
1.	They will be reassigned to equal level vacancies for which they qualify within the Family of Skills in the exchange/WRA or any exchange/WRA within 35 miles.
100
0
THEN
They will be reassigned to equal level vacancies for which they qualify within the Family of Skills table (any organizational unit) in the exchange/WRA or any exchange/WRA within 35 miles.
2.	SIPP:
•	SIPP as described in 8.03, is granted in seniority order to employees performing essentially the same type work, in the organizational unit, first in the exchange/WRA, then in any exchange/WRA within 35 miles of the surplus exchange/WRA.
THEN
•	SIPP is granted in seniority order to employees in title, in the organizational unit, first in the exchange/WRA, then in any exchange/WRA within 35 miles of the surplus exchange/WRA. SIPP in title will not be offered if the employee is not qualified or for whom extensive training in excess of 14 weeks would be required.
•	Employees opting to take SIPP must have at least 1 year of seniority, are not entitled to enter the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank, and do not have recall rights.
3.	Surplus employees may fill available vacancies for which they qualify, first in the exchange/WRA or in an exchange/WRA within 35 miles.
a. Employees who decline an equal level vacancy will forfeit bumping rights and will forfeit termination pay unless equal level vacancy is filled with surplus employee.
4.	Surplus/bumped employees will be provided with information on the current surplus and all their options and will have five (5) calendar days to rank their options:
101
•	Current vacancies within state
•	Supplemental Income Protection Program (SIPP), including ESIPP
•	Transitional Leave of Absence
•	Sabbatical Leave of Absence
•	Technological Displacement Leave of Absence
•	Bumping rights or for bumped employee (remaining choice, if applicable, from the list of the original surplus employee who bumped).
a.	Surplus employees may fill available vacancies for which they qualify anywhere in the state.
b.	The Company will expand the SIPP option (ESIPP) to other employees or groups not affected by force adjustment as an additional method to reduce the surplus. Expanded SIPP will not be offered in order to create placement opportunities for employees who are not qualified or for whom extensive training in excess of 14 weeks would be required.
To be considered for SIPP or ESIPP, all employees other than surplus employees must notify the appropriate Company representative in advance that they will accept such an offer.
Any placement opportunities created by SIPP and ESIPP will be filled in the order of seniority by surplus employees and will not be treated as vacancies under other provisions of the contract relating to the filling of vacancies.
SIPP may also be granted when the return of a regular employee at the expiration of a leave of absence with mandatory return rights will create or add to a surplus. A senior employee performing essentially the same type work in the exchange/WRA or in an exchange/WRA within 35 miles may relieve such a surplus with SIPP. If no such employee has
102
0
volunteered, the employee on leave may choose not to return to work and will be paid a termination allowance computed under 8.04B in lieu of processing. Otherwise, except for a Sabbatical Leave of Absence, the employee on leave will return to active employment and all the provisions of 7.01C will be applied.
c.	Surplus employees who receive no equal level job offer in an exchange within 35 miles may elect to bump junior employees from the following groups:
1)	35-Mile List:
•	Same title in the exchange/WRA and in any exchanges/WRA(s) within 35 miles, same organizational unit, THEN
•	Family of Skills in the exchange/WRA and in any exchanges/WRA(s) within 35 miles, same organizational unit.
2)	State Lists:
•	Same title within the state, same organizational unit, AND
•	Family of Skills, including the surplus title, within the state, same organizational unit.
Jobs that require extensive training (more than 14 weeks) will be excluded except when the surplus is in the same Family of Skills. Refusal of an offer to bump qualifies the employee for termination pay.
d.	Surplus employees who are within 36 months of actual age and/or service requirements for service pension eligibility may take a Transitional Leave of Absence. Both SIPP and ESIPP may be combined with a Transitional Leave.
103
e.	Surplus employees with at least 5 years seniority who have not taken a Sabbatical in the past 5 years may take an unpaid Sabbatical Leave of Absence for nine to 24 months. An expiring Sabbatical may be extended at the employee’s option in increments of at least three months up to the maximum total period of 24 months. At the expiration of a Sabbatical Leave, if no equal level vacancy is available, the employee will be eligible to enter the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank as described in Article 24.
f.	Surplus employees (unless the surplus is economic) may take a Technological Displacement Leave of Absence. An employee who chooses to accept a leave of absence does not thereby forfeit his/her right to accept a transfer to another location to perform the same or related work or to be paid a termination allowance (technological leaves only), provided he/she gives notice that he/she wishes to change his/her option to accept a transfer or the allowance before the expiration of one year following his/her acceptance of the leave. In the event notice of a desire to change his/her option is given:
1)	The employee will be notified, in the order of seniority, of the next job vacancy at the exchange/WRA of his/her preference by letter to his/her last known address; or
2)	He/She will receive a termination allowance computed under 8.04B as of the date of his/her leave of absence.
5. An employee to be laid off who previously declined an opportunity under 7.01A4 may follow his/her work, provided vacancies still exist in the new location. Any such moves will be considered to have been made at the instance of the Company.
104
0
D.	Surplus and bumped employees who cannot be placed under 7.01C are laid off with termination allowance computed under 8.04B. They are eligible for recall under 7.02.
E.	The determination by the Company of the qualifications of an employee under 7.01 will be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in Article 21, and after the exhaustion of such procedure a charge of arbitrary action or bad faith will be subject to the arbitration procedure set forth in Article 23.
F.	In the event the Company proposes, or agrees, to a termination allowance under 8.04A3 within 6 months after an employee has been reclassified under 7.01C and has been given training and has unsuccessfully performed new duties, such employee will be given a termination allowance under 8.04B, or, at the option of the employee, a transfer to an available vacancy for which he/she is qualified. (If the employee elects the termination allowance he is eligible to enter the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank as described in Article 24).
1.	Prior to invoking these provisions, the procedures outlined in 12.02F1 and F2 will be applied.
2.	In the event an employee offers impelling personal reasons for not accepting reassignment within the exchange/WRA, and elects not to accept a transfer to another exchange/WRA, he/she will be entitled to a termination allowance under 8.04B and will have recall rights under 7.02 as if he/she had been laid off from his/her former job.
G.	Employees accepting lower-rated jobs under 7.01C will be treated under the provisions of the Reassignment Pay Protection Plan (8.02B or C, as appropriate).
H.	Employees accepting offers of jobs that are not in the exchange/WRA or in an exchange/WRA within 35 miles under 7.01A4 or 7.01C will receive reasonable transfer and/or moving expenses as described in 9.01B.
105
I.	Any regular employee whose job is affected by a force surplus may refuse reassignment under conditions 1 or 2 below and be paid a termination allowance. Employees whose options fall under condition 3 below and refuse a vacancy WILL NOT BE PAID A TERMINATION ALLOWANCE:
1.	Equal level vacancy to an exchange/WRA over 35 miles away
2.	Lower rate of pay vacancy anywhere in the state
3.	Equal or greater rate of pay vacancy within 35 miles
J.	An employee one step out of the bargaining unit who is notified by the Company that his/her job is declared surplus locally may, if he/she has 5 or more years of seniority, be reassigned to a bargaining unit job within the same organizational unit in a title which he/she formerly held including "acting" titles, or to a job which he/she can satisfactorily perform, provided there are no employees with Article 7.01K rights and further provided such moves will not create a force surplus. The temporary loss of seniority provisions of 12.01G will apply if there is a subsequent force adjustment of any type.
K. Employees transferred (including transfers across state lines) and/or demoted under 7.01A4, 7.01C or 12.04 shall have the right, in order of their seniority, to return within 5 years to service in the exchange/WRA from which they were displaced as jobs become available in the job title they now hold or which they were holding at the time of transfer provided the employee has a valid request on file under 12.01B. The employee may only have one 7.01K request on file. The rejection by the employee of an offer of a job pursuant to the above shall discharge the Company of any further obligation hereunder.
Employees demoted within the exchange/WRA under 7.01C above shall have the right, in order of their seniority, to be reinstated in a vacancy within 5 years, in the exchange/WRA, in the job he/she held at the time of his/her demotion, provided
106
0
he/she has a valid request on file to be reinstated in such job. The rejection of an offer of a job, in the exchange/WRA, in the title held at the time of the demotion shall discharge the Company of any further obligation hereunder.
Employees who were originally displaced in this bargaining unit as a result of a surplus condition and as a result accepted a lower level job in the same exchange/WRA or an equal or lower level job in another exchange/WRA, and who were subsequently transferred at the instance of the Company to another bargaining unit, or voluntarily accept a position to a lower level job in the same exchange/WRA or an equal or lower level job in another exchange/WRA to either AT&T Billing Southeast, LLC or Utility Operations due to being surplus, may be considered under the provisions of 7.01K if there are no surplus employees within this bargaining unit who have rights for these vacancies.
Vacancies that are filled under the provisions of 7.01K by such reinstatements will not be subject to the provisions of Article 12.
L.	The smallest appropriate subdivision which the Company may designate under 7.01 will be the organizational unit in an exchange/WRA. Company Headquarters will be considered as if it were a separate exchange/WRA except that Company Headquarters employees located outside of that exchange/WRA will be considered as being in the organizational unit and exchange/WRA where they are located.
M.	Although the filling of vacancies across entity lines under Article 7 is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures, the Company will consider employees who have been identified as surplus in other entities and may place such employees in equal or lower level vacancies.
107
N.	After all stay-on-payroll options for a surplus employee have been exhausted, the employee may rank a vacancy in another state, equal to their wage scale or below. They will be given consideration after all priority candidates in that state have been considered, but before regular Article 12 candidates.
O.	Employees who are to be laid off as a result of being processed under 7.01 are eligible for participation in the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank as described in Article 24.
P.	Once regular employees have been displaced (separated or transferred) under the Force Adjustment procedures, temporary employees will not be utilized performing essentially the same type work in the same organizational unit, title, and exchange/WRA of the surplus declaration for at least two calendar quarters following the declared displacement date. These provisions will not apply when there are emergency conditions over which the Company has no control or advance notice.
7.02 Recalled After Layoff.
A. Laid off employees will have the right to be recalled as follows:
1.	When a vacancy exists for a regular employee in an exchange/WRA and there are no employees who are to be placed in the vacancy under the procedures described in 7.01C, 7.01M, 12.02F, 12.04, 24.05D4, or employees who have mandatory return rights, any employee(s) who is on layoff from the same Family of Skills in which that vacancy exists and who has requested such job will be offered the equal or lower level vacancy in order of seniority, from the list of laid off employees, provided they are qualified to perform the duties of the vacant job, and provided they were laid off from any exchange/WRA within the same state in which the vacancy exists.
108
0
a. Vacancies that are filled by the recalling of such laid off employees will not be considered as vacancies to be filled by the transfer and upgrade provisions of the Agreement.
2.	When a vacancy exists for a regular employee in an exchange/WRA and there are no employees who are to be placed in the vacancy under the procedures described in 7.01C or employees who have mandatory return rights, any employee who is laid off in an equal or higher level title, who has an Article 12 request on file for the vacant title will be considered for the vacancy along with other active employee requestors under the appropriate provisions of Article 12.
3.	Laid off employees may submit up to 6 requests for equal or lower rated titles, anywhere in the Company. Such requests will remain active for a period of 5 years from the date of layoff.
4.	Any refusal of an offer of a requested equal or lower level job will discharge the Company of all obligations hereunder.
5.	Notification under "A1" and "A2" above, will be sent by certified mail to such employee's last known address. The employee is responsible for keeping the Company advised of any change in address.
6.	A former employee who wishes to accept such offer of reemployment will notify the Company of such intention within 5 work days and will normally return to the employment of the Company within 14 days from the date of such notification, which is conclusively to be presumed to have been given as of the date of the mailing of such notification.
109
a. Where the time periods specified in "A6" above will work an undue hardship on an employee, they may be extended.
7.	No impairment which existed at termination of last preceding period of Company service will be considered as just cause for a denial of re-employment.
8.	Any employee recalled under the provisions of this section within 5 years from the date of his/her layoff will have the continuity of his/her service protected, including seniority, and if his/her layoff was not for more than 6 months duration, he/she will be allowed service and seniority credit for such layoff unless it began within 12 months of a previous layoff.
9.	Laid off employees selected for a lower rated job than the one from which they were laid off will not be eligible for the Reassignment Pay Protection Plan (RPPP), as outlined in 8.02B of the Agreement.
10.	Laid off employees selected for jobs under 7.02A, in other exchanges/WRAs or who are selected for lower level jobs will have return rights as described under 7.01K.
11.	Laid off employees will be recalled based upon their seniority date on the date of layoff.
12.	Laid off employees who are subsequently rehired into a higher rated job and who are unsuccessful within the first six months, shall retain their 7.02 recall from layoff status to their original laid off position.
13.	Decisions regarding the recall and filling of vacancies of employees under the provisions of 7.02 may be discussed between the appropriate CWA and Company representative. Such decisions, however, are not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures.
7.03 Temporary Hiring of Laid Off Employees.
As a general practice the Company will endeavor to offer laid off employees any temporary vacancies for which they are qualified.
110
0
	Acceptance of such vacancies will not affect their status as a laid off employee. ARTICLE 8 EMPLOYMENT SECURITY
8.01	Technology Change Committee. A. The Company and the Union recognize that technological changes in equipment, organization, or methods of operation have a tendency to affect job security and the nature of the work to be performed. The parties, therefore, will attempt to diminish or abolish the detrimental effects of any such technological change by creating a joint committee to be known as the Technology Change Committee to oversee problems and recommend solutions of problems in this area as set forth below. B. The Technology Change Committee will consist of not more than 3 representatives of the Company and not more than 3 representatives of the Union. Such Committee may be convened at the option of either party at mutually agreeable times. C. The purpose of the Committee is to provide for discussion of major technological changes (including changes in equipment, organization, or methods of operation) which may affect employees represented by the Union. The Company will notify the Union at least 3 months in advance of planned major technological changes. Meetings of the Committee will be held as soon thereafter as can be mutually arranged. At such meetings, the Company will advise the Union of its plans with respect to the introduction of such changes and will familiarize the Union with the progress being made. D. The impact and effect of such changes on the employees shall be appropriate matters for discussion. The Company will discuss with the Union:
111
1.	What steps might be taken to offer employment to employees affected:
a.	In the same locality or other localities in jobs which may be available in occupations covered by the collective bargaining agreements between the parties;
b.	In other occupations in the Company not covered by the collective bargaining agreement;
c.	In other BellSouth companies.
2.	The applicability of various Company programs and contract provisions relating to force adjustment plans and procedures, including Supplemental Income Protection Program, Reassignment Pay Protection Plan, termination allowances, retirement, transfer procedures and the like.
3.	The feasibility of the Company providing training for other assignments for the employees affected. (Example: sponsorship of typing training on Company time.)
E. The Committee shall not formulate policy or arrive at binding decisions or agreements, but rather shall be charged with the responsibility to develop facts and recommendations so that the Company can make well informed decisions regarding the matters covered by this provision.
8.02 Transfers to	Lower-Rated	Wage Scales. (Including
Reassignment Pay Protection Plan)
A.	When an employee is involved in an interdepartmental transfer, or a reclassification within his/her department, to a lower-rated job as a result of asserting his/her seniority rights under 7.01J, a transfer under Article 12, or a demotion for misconduct, gross negligence, lack of effort or other such extraordinary circumstances, his/her rate of pay shall be reduced to that applicable to his/her wage length of service on the lower wage scale and he/she shall thereafter progress on such scale.
B.	RPPP (Reassignment Pay Protection Plan). When an employee is reclassified to a lower rated job under 7.01C,
112
0
12.02F, 24.05D4d or as a result of being permanently medically restricted the employee's rate of pay will be reduced over a period of time based on the employee's length of seniority.
The reductions in pay will be effective at periods following reassignment as shown in the following chart and each reduction is based on the difference in the appropriate rates for the old and new jobs:
Economic, Technological Displacements, PMR, 12.02F, 24.05D4d

113
C.	An employee with 15 years or more of seniority who, due to technological changes or as a result of being permanently medically restricted, is assigned to a vacancy with a lower rate of pay than the then current rate of the employee's regular job shall continue to be paid in the lower level job, an amount equivalent to the rate of pay of the higher paid job in effect at the time of the downgrade. Such wage treatment will continue for 36 months following the effective date of the downgrade. Any employee involved in such downgrades shall receive any increases in pay in amounts which are applicable for a comparable employee in the lower-rated job to which downgraded. At the end of the 36 month period following the date of the downgrade, the employee's wages will be reduced on the following scale:
Technological and PMR - more than 15 years
Weeks 1 through 4 ----- No Reduction
Weeks 5 through 8 ----- 1/3 Reduction
Weeks 9 through 12 ---- 2/3 Reduction
Weeks 13 & thereafter -- Full Reduction
D.	An employee who has been reclassified to a lower-rated job and who is subsequently promoted to a job on the wage scale from which he/she was displaced (within 5 years) shall be credited with the wage experience credit he/she had accrued prior to the displacement or as computed under 2.06 (whichever is greater), except that such wage experience credit shall not exceed the maximum number of months on the higher wage scale.
E.	In all other instances in which an employee is involved in an interdepartmental transfer, or a reclassification within his/her department, to a lower-rated job, his/her rate of pay shall be computed as follows:
1.	His/her rate of pay will not be reduced if it is not above the maximum rate for the new job and he/she shall continue at such rate until his/her wage experience credit entitles him/her to an increase on the scale for his/her new job.
114
0
	He/she shall receive initial credit for wage length of service on the new job in an amount equal to the wage length of service credited to him/her in his/her old job, except that if he/she had formerly held a job in the lower classification to which he/she is being reclassified, his/her wage experience credit will be established as the wage experience credit formerly attained in the lower classification plus the time spent on the higher job or jobs, subject to any adjustments as provided in 2.02, when applicable. 2. If his/her rate of pay is above the maximum for his/her new job, his/her rate of pay shall be reduced to that maximum. F. Employees involuntarily transferred under the provisions of 12.04 shall have the right to claim the job from which they were moved if the job should become available within five years after such move as described in 7.01K.
8.03	Supplemental Income Protection Program and Extended Medical Coverage: A. Supplemental Income Protection Program. 1.	If during the term of this Agreement the Company notifies the Union in writing that an employee is unable to remain in his/her current job because of a permanent medical restriction or if a surplus in any job title in a work location will necessitate lay-offs or involuntary permanent reassignments of regular employees to different job titles involving a reduction in pay, employees in the affected job titles and work locations, who have at least 1 year of seniority may elect, in the order of seniority and to the extent necessary to relieve the surplus, to leave the service of the Company and receive Supplemental Income Protection Program (SIPP) benefits described in this Section. The Company will offer Expanded SIPP (ESIPP) as provided in 7.01C for surplus.
115
a.	The Company will determine the job titles and work locations in which a surplus exists, the number of employees in such titles and locations who are considered to be surplus, and the period during which the employee may leave the service of the Company pursuant to this Section. Neither such determination by the Company nor any other part of this Section will be subject to arbitration.
b.	The number of employees who may be considered will not exceed the number of employees determined by the Company to be surplus.
c.	Employees may lock/unlock electronically from the 1st day of the month to the last day of the month, before midnight, Eastern time, preceding the surplus quarter. After this time period, the SIPP acceptance may not be revoked.
1)	Acceptances will be valid for one quarter only. Employees must lock in during the specified time period.
2)	There will be no penalty or Expression of Interest associated with SIPP/ESIPP.
d.	Job titles and locations of employees who have committed to accept ESIPP will be made available to surplus and PMR employees. Placement into equal or lower level jobs created through ESIPP will be made in seniority order among interested, qualified surplus employees.
e.	Surplus employees are allowed to submit two requests for an equal or lower level job title in their Family of Skills, in their organizational unit, in any exchange/WRA in the Company. One request may be in any organizational unit, in their Skill Group, in any exchange/WRA in their home state.

In a surplus situation, SIPP will first be granted in seniority order to any employees with Irrevocable SIPP/ESIPP Acceptance forms on file who are performing essentially the same type work in the surplus exchange/WRA and exchanges/WRA(s) within 35 miles of the surplus exchange/WRA. Then if the surplus is not satisfied, SIPP is granted in seniority order to employees in title, in the organizational unit, first in the exchange/WRA, then in any exchange/WRA within 35 miles of the surplus exchange/WRA. SIPP in title will not be offered if the employee is not qualified or for whom extensive training in excess of 14 weeks would be required. Employees who continue to be surplus after this step will have the opportunity to take SIPP, even though they do not have Irrevocable SIPP/ESIPP Acceptance forms on file in advance.
2.	SIPP/ESIPP payments for employees who leave the service of the Company in accordance with "1" above will begin within one month after such employee has left the service of the Company and continue until payments have been made for 48 months. The employee may elect to receive this payment in one lump sum should he/she so desire or in two equal payments, one paid as the employee leaves the service of the Company and the other paid on February 1 of the year following.
3.	The following SIPP/ESIPP payment table is designed for use with surplus under 7.01 and for permanently medically restricted placement as described in 8.05. Employees who receive either voluntary SIPP or ESIPP will not be entitled to a termination allowance under this article or further processing under Article 7.

2)	Where the duration of the temporary transfer is expected to be 21 days or less but includes 3 full
132
0
week-ends, one visit home would be allowed under this paragraph.
c.	The return home visits may be taken during any nonscheduled periods, provided the total number of visits does not exceed the number specified for the expected duration. Return home visits should not be made during consecutive weeks.
d.	Returning home is optional with the employee. He/She may elect to remain at the temporary location in lieu of returning home. In this event he/she is not entitled to receive the cost of transportation in lieu of returning to his/her home.

9.04 Intercity Transportation.
A.	The Company will provide transportation by Company owned vehicles or commercially rented motor vehicles, or will designate transportation by intercity common carrier (subject to "B" below) for necessary intercity transportation.
1.	When the Company designates transportation by intercity common carrier (and the employee does not elect treatment under "B" below), the cost of necessary and reasonable local transportation incurred at the employee's home location between the local point of departure and the intercity common carrier terminal for the beginning and ending segments of the intercity trip will be handled by reimbursing the employee for such cost upon presentation of properly receipted vouchers from a local commercial common carrier. Such reimbursements, however, will not exceed the cost of transportation between the employee's usual place of reporting and the intercity common carrier terminal. As an alternative, the employee may elect to be paid a local transportation allowance of $5.00 each for either or both the departing and terminating segments at his/her home location.
2.

When an employee not covered by the Personal Vehicle Reimbursement Plan declines to travel by Company designated intercity common carrier and elects to make his/her own transportation arrangements and he/she has principal responsibility (owned, borrowed, leased or rented) for the vehicle used for such travel, the Company will reimburse the employee at the maximum IRS rate per mile based on distance calculations between locations as shown on the most recent official State Highway Department maps for intrastate travel or Rand McNally Atlas for interstate travel. This rate will go into effect as soon as possible after the increase becomes effective and no later than the beginning of the next calendar quarter of the year. In addition, when the Company designated common carrier is an airline, the employee, including those on the Personal Vehicle Reimbursement Plan, will be paid an Optional Travel Allowance as indicated in the table below.

After having declined to travel by Company designated means as described in "A" above, should an employee subsequently elect to travel by intercity common carrier, upon presentation of properly receipted travel vouchers, the employee will be reimbursed for the cost of the intercity common carrier travel utilized up to an amount not in excess of the travel cost that would have been incurred had the employee traveled by Company designated intercity common carrier or subsequently designated Company transportation.
135
Article

C.	Employees on the Personal Vehicle Reimbursement Plan shall use their own vehicle for intercity travel of 100 miles or less. For intercity travel of more than 100 miles, the employee has the option of “A” above.
9.05 Special Commuting Allowance.
A. A special "all in a day's work" commuting allowance may be paid an employee not covered under PVR when a need develops for the employee to work or attend training for one tour or part tour in another exchange/WRA. This special allowance will be paid in accordance with the mileage bands in 9.02A1 for up to 50 miles. For distances over 50 miles in addition to the mileage band payments, an employee will be entitled to the maximum IRS rate per mile for all miles driven over 50 miles each way.
The conditions under which this special allowance is applicable are as follows:
1.	When an employee is needed to work, take training or attend a meeting in another exchange/WRA after his/her tour begins at his/her regular place of reporting, he/she may, with his/her supervisor's approval, use his/her personal vehicle in lieu of public or Company provided transportation and be paid the special allowance. In this event he/she will be paid for all scheduled and nonscheduled time required to travel to and from the distant exchange/WRA.
2.	When an employee is scheduled to work, take training or attend a meeting in another exchange/WRA for one day or part day he/she may, with his/her supervisor's approval, use his/her personal vehicle and be paid the special allowance in lieu of using public or Company provided transportation. In this event he/she will be paid for all
136
0
scheduled and non-scheduled time required in traveling to and from the distant exchange/WRA.
3.	This special allowance is to be paid in "1" and "2" above only if the employee elects to use his/her personal vehicle in lieu of Company provided transportation and the use of same is approved in advance by his/her supervisor. If the employee does not agree to use his/her personal vehicle and receive the allowance and travel pay, the Company will be required to provide transportation for such travel and pay for the time spent traveling to and from the distant location.
9.06 Motor Vehicle Usage.
A.	In the work units where Stand-by Technicians are utilized, the Technician on Stand-by shall be allowed to drive a Company vehicle to and from his/her home in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.
B.	Additionally, the General Manager, or his/her designee and the Local President, or his/her designee, will hold a meeting to mutually agree on plans for Motor Vehicle Usage to be used in special circumstances. Following that agreement, employees may be granted use of a Company vehicle on an individual case.
If the General Manager and Local President (or their designee) cannot come to an agreement, the issue can be escalated to the Network Vice President, or his/her designee, and the State Representative, or his/her designee, for the parties to come to mutual agreement. Following that agreement, employees may be granted use of a Company vehicle on an individual case.
9.07 Personal Vehicle Reimbursement Plan (for Large Business and CPE only).
A.	Service Consultants may participate in the personal vehicle reimbursement plan or elect to opt out.
1.	The employee’s vehicle should be available for business needs at all times during normal business hours.

3.	The vehicle must be in a presentable condition.
B.	Employees must provide insurance coverage at least equal to the minimum liability limits required under their state’s financial responsibility or compulsory liability insurance law. Employees shall provide their supervisor a copy of their insurance policy detailing coverage levels and endorsements equal to or exceeding the standards specified.
C.	Commuting expenses are considered personal expenses and will not be reimbursed. Commuting is defined as “the first and last trip of the day between the employee’s residence and any work location within the general metropolitan area in which the employee normally responds to work.” Should the first or last trip be to or from a location outside the general metropolitan area, then all the mileage is reportable as business.
D.	Reimbursement will include a fixed amount and mileage.
1.	The fixed amount of $25.00 will be per 2 week pay period. This is considered as taxable income and will be reflected on the employee’s W-2.
2.	The mileage reimbursement will be the IRS rate per mile, subject to review and adjustments of the Employee Personal Vehicle Reimbursement Plan. This is not considered as taxable income. A mileage log will be turned in bi-weekly.
ARTICLE 10
TRAVEL TIME AND TRAVEL CONDITIONS
10.01 Place of Reporting.
A. The Company will designate the place at which employees will be required to report for work.
1.	This may be an office, garage, work center or place of motor vehicle storage (or, in the case of Construction cable
138
0
splicing forces who do not operate from a motor vehicle at the job) within the limits of his/her headquarters exchange/WRA. It is further understood that within a Control Center environment, there will be only one place of reporting for an employee within an exchange.
a.	Construction cable splicing forces who do not operate from a motor vehicle and are required to report at the job will be paid $5.00 per tour or part tour worked in lieu of the cost of public transportation.
b.	Nothing in this section will be construed as prohibiting the Company from designating the job or a location en route to the job for any employee when such designation is requested by the employee or the Company and is agreeable to both parties.
c.	An employee whose place of reporting is temporarily changed within his/her headquarters exchange/WRA will be paid a daily allowance of $5.50 provided that the temporary place of reporting lies beyond a radius of one mile from the regular place of reporting.
2.	Consideration will be given in the order of seniority to an employee with a valid request on file for (1) reporting to a work group or work unit at another location within the exchange/WRA, or (2) being reassigned to another work group, work unit, assignment, or shift at the same place of reporting. Employees may request the same or a different type of work in the same or a different department. Such requests will be considered, needs of the business permitting, provided the employee’s services may be profitably utilized in such location, assignment, or shift and further provided that the employee has been at his/her present location, assignment, or shift, and in his/her present title for at least 24 months. The elapsing of the 24 month period will not be affected by a change in place of reporting at the instance of the Company. Requests of this type will be submitted to the staffing system. The request
139
Article
must be on file and the requestor test qualified at the time consideration begins. Employees may have up to 10 requests on file. These may be Article 10 requests, Article 12 requests, or any combination of the two.
a. When a WRA has more than one place of reporting for work groups within a General Manager (or equivalent) organization, doing essentially the same type of work, consideration shall be given in order of seniority to the written request of an employee for reporting to work at another location within the WRA, or being reassigned to another work group, and his/her services may be profitably utilized in such location. Requests of this type shall be submitted in writing to the employee’s General Manager and the receipt will be acknowledged to the requestor within 10 working days.
3.	When permanent changes in place of reporting are to be made to initially staff, in part or whole, a new work group (as distinguished from relocating an existing work group), the following procedure will apply. The Company will designate the work group(s) or work unit(s), whichever is larger at the place of reporting, from which employees will be assigned. Those employees from the designated work group(s)/work unit(s) who desire the assignment and whose services may be profitably utilized at the new location(s) will be assigned in order of seniority. Such assignments will be made, needs of the business permitting, up to the number of employees the Company desires.
If additional employees are still needed, such additional assignment as the Company deems it appropriate to make will be made in inverse order of seniority from the same designated work group(s)/work unit(s) provided the employee's services may be profitably utilized at the new location, needs of the business permitting.
a. When initially staffing a new work group at an existing location, a notice will be adequately posted at that place of reporting. Requests will be limited to those
140
0
received within 7 days from employees in the group(s) from which the assignment will be made. Such requests may be granted at the discretion of the Company.
4.	If under the provision of 10.01A, the Company designates a permanent change in the place of reporting (other than the type described in "3" above) of an employee, such employee will be allowed to exercise his/her seniority to remain at his/her present location, needs of the business permitting, provided a junior qualified employee is available in his/her work group or work unit, whichever is larger at the place of reporting, to fill the vacancy.
10.0	2 Time Considered Worked.
A.	Time during the scheduled or assigned hours of an employee which is spent at the direction of the Company in traveling from one job assignment to another or from one town to another shall be considered as time worked.
B.	Time spent by an employee, at the direction of the Company, in traveling before or after the hours of his/her scheduled or assigned tour, which may be described as "all in a day's work" (see 12.05A1), shall be considered as work time. It is not intended that this provision be applied to travel on a day the employee was not scheduled or assigned to work or to travel which consumes a considerable period of time.
C.	Where a total of travel time required by the Company and time worked on a scheduled tour exceeds the length of a normal tour in one day and the employee spends at least one night away from his/her headquarters exchange/WRA, the employee will be paid for travel time in excess of such hours.
D.	Where an employee is directed to travel continuously for more than a full working day, the time spent traveling during his/her scheduled or assigned tours shall be considered as time worked. The application of this provision shall not result in
141
Article
an employee being paid for a less number of hours than is contained in a normal work week.
E.	An employee required by the Company to travel on a day on which he/she was not scheduled shall be considered as working on such day for the number of traveling hours up to the length of a normal tour.
1.	Insofar as it is practicable the Company will not require employees to travel on Sundays and holidays.
2.	The "established starting and stopping time" for employees who work varied (relief) tours within the week shall be as follows: The tour which has been worked more than any other tour during the preceding 5 tours worked before travel shall be the established starting and stopping time. If no tour has been worked more than another tour, the next 5 preceding tours worked shall be included and this process shall continue until it is determined that one tour has been worked more than any other tour.
F.	Hours of paid travel time under "A", "B", "C", "D", and "E" above shall not exceed the length of a normal tour during any period of continuous travel of 24 or less hours.
G.	The above provisions are not intended to cover every possible condition under which travel time may be properly considered as work time, and all such cases not expressly covered by this Article shall be governed by the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended.
10.0	3 Pay Basis for Travel Time.
When it is to be considered as time worked, travel time will be paid for on the same basis as actual work time.

11.02 Reinstatement.
A.	In the processing of grievances or arbitration (see Article 23.02 Expedited Arbitration), unless the parties at the State or higher level mutually agree to the contrary with respect to the particular grievance or arbitration case, the following will apply: If as a result of such grievance or arbitration procedure it is determined that the employee was discharged, suspended or demoted without just cause, the Company agrees to reinstate the employee and to reimburse him/her according to the following:
1.	In a discharge case, the employee will receive his/her regular pay for the time lost less the amount of any termination pay received from the Company and unemployment compensation received or receivable; and the employee will receive an additional 7% of the remaining amount.
2.	In a suspension case, the employee will receive his/her regular pay for the time lost.
3.	In a demotion case, the employee will be made whole for the difference, if any, between his/her rate on the job from which he/she was demoted and his/her rate on the job to which he/she was demoted for each day he/she remains on the lower-rated job.
B.	An employee reinstated as the result of an arbitration case will also be entitled to the following:
1.	If the employee has paid medical insurance premiums under the BellSouth COBRA plan, he/she will be reimbursed for these premiums for any period covered by backpay, up to the 18 month COBRA limitation.

150
0
for promotion, all other employees who are on leave who have valid requests on file must be considered under the appropriate provisions of 12.01.

5.	Requestors with deficiencies that may affect their chances for being selected will be informed as to the deficiency. (Deficiencies will include, but are not limited to, failure to satisfactorily complete required tests, failure to meet timein-title, time-in-exchange/WRA, and/or time-in-entity requirements.)
6.	When an employee is notified that he/she has been selected to fill a vacancy, all other requests on file in his/her behalf shall be considered as withdrawn unless the employee notifies the Company within 2 business days after selection that he/she wishes to reject the offered vacancy.
7.	When an employee is selected to fill a job vacancy, the employee will be released from his/her present assignment as soon as practicable but normally no later than the sixth Sunday following the date the employee is notified.

In such cases the employee will suffer no loss of higher rated pay due after the sixth Sunday.
8.	If an employee rejects a future requested move, he/she will not be entitled to replace the rejected request for a period of 6 months from the date of rejection. An employee who has rejected a requested move shall not be eligible to submit a future request in the rejected title in the rejected
151
Article

Such grievances will be processed in accordance with Article 21.
12.	When an employee has an active grievance on one or more selections, he/she may continue to grieve on only one of the pending grievances for a job which is higher than one he/she subsequently accepted.
B.	In considering employees for job vacancies within an entity or between entities, the Company shall give consideration to seniority, qualifications, and service requirements, and, if the employee is returning from a leave of absence or a layoff, whether he/she has been guilty of misconduct which would have been proper cause for discharge.
C.	In the selection of employees within an entity or between entities for promotions, seniority shall govern if other necessary qualifications of the individuals are substantially equal.

E.	Except as described in "E1" and "E2" below, the Company may, regardless of other provisions of this section, disqualify an employee from further consideration upon determining that the employee does not meet reasonable threshold requirements for the job to be filled. "Reasonable threshold requirements" shall be construed to be the attainment of recommended minimum test scores on applicable standard BellSouth tests, or their successor tests, or other appropriate tests (e.g., a typing test for a typing job). The Union may challenge through the grievance and arbitration procedure whether the use of a particular test or tests as a threshold requirement for a particular vacancy is reasonable. Such challenges will be filed initially at the Executive Level. The Union may also challenge the Company's decision to disqualify an employee from further consideration (as it relates to threshold requirements) through the grievance procedure, but not through arbitration.
1.	If the attainment of a minimum test score is established by the Company as a prerequisite for receiving Company-sponsored formal training associated with a new job title which is to substantially replace one or more existing titles, the incumbents in the existing title(s) in an affected exchange/WRA shall be given priority consideration over all other employees for staffing the new title in that exchange/WRA, such priority consideration to consist of the following:
a.	Incumbents who have already qualified on the test involved or who are exempted from taking the test based on their experience and/or previous training will be eligible for immediate transfer to the new title upon its implementation.
b.	Incumbents not meeting the description in "a" above shall as soon as practicable be offered the test, and, if
153
Article
they meet the required minimum score will be considered concurrently with those employees described in "a" above.
c.	Incumbents not qualifying under "a", or "b" above because of not meeting minimum test score requirements will be given an opportunity in seniority order to attend appropriate general skills training under PARTNERSHIP.
d.	Incumbents described in "a", "b" and those who complete the training in "c" above who are subsequently transferred to the new title will be sent to appropriate job-specific training as soon as practicable in seniority order.
e.	Incumbents not desiring to be considered further for transfer to the new title under these procedures, and those described in "c" above for whom there are no staffing vacancies available due to all of them being previously filled by those described in "a", "b" and "c" above, may be treated as an "operational efficiency" surplus under the appropriate sections of the Agreement.
f.	Vacancies in the new title which develop subsequent to completion of initial staffing will be handled under the other relevant provisions of Article 12 and/or Article 7.
2.	Surplus employees desiring to continue their career (under Article 12 or PARTNERSHIP) in a different title and work discipline for which the Company has established the attainment of a minimum test score as a prerequisite for receiving Company-sponsored formal training shall be considered for filling a vacancy for the title as follows:
a.	An employee who has already qualified on the test involved or who is exempted from taking the test based on his/her experience and/or previous training will be eligible for transfer to the new title.
154
0
b.	An employee not meeting the description in "a" above shall as soon as practicable be offered the test, and, if he/she meets the required minimum score will be eligible for transfer to the title.
c.	An employee not qualifying under "a" or "b" above because of not meeting minimum test score requirements will be given an opportunity to be retested following his/her completion of appropriate general skills training under PARTNERSHIP. Usual Company-enforced time limits on retesting will be waived with respect to this second test. If the employee fails to pass the test on this second effort, he/she will be provided the assessment and counseling provisions of PARTNERSHIP.
F.	An employee who is transferred or promoted under Article 12 to a new job and who cannot satisfactorily complete training or who cannot perform satisfactorily on the job during the 6 months following the completion of training will be grouped with those employees (if any) under 7.01C for existing vacancies only in equal or lower level jobs for which they are qualified, except as described in F1 below. If no vacancy exists or the employee declines an offer of a job offered under 7.01C which requires a change in residence, the employee will receive termination allowance in accordance with 8.04C, will be eligible to enter the PARTNERSHIP Job Bank as described in Article 24.05D, and will have recall rights under 7.02 as if he/she had been laid off from his/her former job.
1.	If during the first six months following successful completion of training, the employee’s job performance has not reached a satisfactory level, the Company will provide an individualized performance improvement plan of up to 60 days, depending on the nature of the job and the progress of the employee, which identifies specific deficiencies and improvement benchmarks. This plan will be discussed with the employee, and if requested, with a
155
Article
Union representative. The Company will also provide on-the-job assistance as appropriate for the job.
2.	If an employee is having difficulty during initial job specific training, the Company will provide additional assistance for up to 3 days depending on the employee’s progress, the nature of the training and the needs of the business.
12.0	3 Promotional Increase Treatment.
When an employee within the bargaining unit is promoted to a higher-rated job within the bargaining unit, he/she shall receive at the time of promotion the applicable promotional wage treatment as set forth in 2.06.
12.0	4 Transfers at the Instance of the Company.
A.	When the Company decides that a job is to be filled by transfer from one exchange/WRA to another, preference shall be granted in the order of seniority to employees who are willing to accept the transfer provided they meet the requirements of the job to be filled and provided that their transfer can be accomplished without incurring extraordinary expense.
1.	Notice that a job is to be filled under "A" above shall be adequately posted at the place of reporting within the exchange/WRA of all employees within the department holding the title from which the transfer will be made and shall be limited to requests received within 7 days from such employees who are willing to accept the transfer.
B.	When it is necessary to fill a job by transfer from one exchange/WRA to another and no qualified employee within the Department from which the transfer is to be made is willing to accept the transfer on a voluntary basis, the transfer will be made by transferring in the inverse order of seniority the most junior qualified employee in the wage scale within that department from within the exchange/WRA who can meet the requirements of the job to be filled provided there is a qualified replacement available in the title originally posted
156
0
under "A" above and such transfer will not result in a special hardship to such employee or his/her immediate family.
1.	After the transfer has been made under "B" above, the Company may correct any force imbalance in the exchange/WRA that was caused by the transfer by moving the junior qualified employee in the title designated under "A" above into the vacated position.
2.	In those instances where the Company has designated an employee to involuntarily transfer to another exchange/WRA and a qualified employee in the specified exchange/WRA who otherwise would be acceptable subsequently volunteers to transfer rather than the designated employee, the transfer will be considered as being made under 12.04B.
C.	When the Company decides that a job is to be filled by transfer from one job title to another within the same exchange/WRA and no promotion is involved, the job shall be filled by the senior qualified employee, in the title, in the department from which the transfer is to be made who has requested the transfer under 12.01, service requirements permitting. If no such employee has requested the transfer under 12.01, the selection will be made from the employees in the wage scale in the department from which the transfer is to be made in the inverse order of seniority in the exchange/WRA or district, whichever is smaller, who can meet the requirement of the job.
D.	Use of 12.04B for transferring employees to same or other jobs in other exchanges/WRAs shall be limited to those situations in which a force imbalance exists or as directed by the provisions of Article 7. A force imbalance exists when the number of employees performing the required volume of work is proper but is improperly distributed by exchange/WRA. Transfers under force imbalance circumstances shall be confined to exchanges no further than 50 miles from the
157
Article
employee’s present exchange location or 100 miles for a WRA.
E.	When the Company decides that a job would be filled by involuntarily transferring employees from one job to another, within the same exchange/WRA, or outside the exchange/WRA, it will not affect the running of the time-in-title nor the time-in-exchange/WRA referred to in 12.01B4.
12.05 Temporary Transfers. (CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
A.	None of the foregoing provisions of this Article will apply to temporary transfers, which are defined as follows: An employee will be in a temporary transfer status when he/she is assigned to work outside his/her headquarters exchange and is not returned to such exchange on Company time at the conclusion of the day's work.
1.	When an employee is to be assigned to work outside his/her headquarters exchange, the Company will advise the employee whether he/she will be temporarily transferred or be returned to his/her headquarters exchange at the conclusion of each day of work. In the event the employee is returned to his/her headquarters exchange at the conclusion of the day's work, the assignment will be considered as "all in a day's work".
2.	The Company may terminate a temporary transfer by returning the employee to his/her headquarters exchange on Company time and expense. However, temporary transfers will not be terminated on non-scheduled or nonwork days prior to the completion of the employee's temporary assignment except as follows:
a.	When the employee's services are temporarily needed in his/her headquarters exchange for a full tour or more.
b.	When the employee is permitted to take his/her scheduled vacation while on a temporary assignment. In this event, the Company is obligated to return the
158
0
employee to his/her headquarters exchange on Company time and travel expense provided he/she wants to commence his/her vacation from his/her home base. Should the employee elect to commence his/her vacation at his/her temporary location and continue to receive the IRS maximum allowance, he/she may do so, if the IRS maximum allowance cost for the period does not exceed the cost of returning the employee to his/her headquarters exchange on Company time and expense and back to the temporary location.
c.	When the employee requests and is granted an unscheduled vacation day(s), excused time or excused work day(s), etc., and the cost of returning the employee to his/her headquarters exchange and back to the temporary location on Company time and expense would be less than the cost of the IRS maximum allowance.
d.	When the employee becomes ill to the extent that he/she is unable to work, and his/her illness is expected to continue for an extended period. In this event, his/her temporary transfer should be terminated as soon as he/she is able to travel. (An illness that is expected to be of short duration should be handled in accordance with "c" above if the employee is able to return to his/her headquarters exchange.)
3.	When an employee's temporary transfer is terminated under the conditions outlined in 12.05A2b, c and d above, he/she may be placed back on the same temporary assignment provided he/she returns to the temporary location on his/her first scheduled day to work after his/her transfer was terminated. If the employee performs work in his/her headquarters exchange after a temporary transfer has been broken, he/she should not be placed back on temporary transfer except as required or permitted under the selection procedures outlined in 12.05C1 or C2 below.
159
Article
4.	A temporary transfer may be terminated without the employee having to physically return to his/her home base. He/She can be paid for the equivalent time and travel expense that would have been incurred had he/she actually returned. Such time and expense should be based on the means of transportation designated by the Company at the beginning of his/her temporary transfer.
5.	When an employee on a temporary transfer elects to return home or go elsewhere on non-scheduled days on his/her own time and expense, he/she may do so and still be entitled to the IRS maximum allowance expense and travel conditions specified in 9.02B6.
B.	The Company recognizes the undesirability, both from the standpoint of the transferring employees and the resident employees, of temporarily transferring employees to work away from their regular location or of receiving employees from other companies for extended periods and will neither make nor effectuate such transfers except to meet service requirements.
1.	When it does become necessary to temporarily transfer an employee(s), such employee(s) will be given as much advance notice as feasible. Where the temporary transfer is beyond reasonable commuting distance and is expected to last in excess of one week, and the employee(s) was not given as much as 5 days of advance notice, he/she should be given a reasonable amount of time off with pay, if needed, to handle his/her personal business prior to being transferred. Such excused time should not exceed one tour for interstate transfers or one session for intrastate transfers.
C.	The following procedures will be followed in the selection of individual employees for temporary transfers. However, in emergency situations the Company may transfer work groups without applying these procedures.
1.	When it becomes necessary to transfer employees temporarily to an assignment expected to be of more than
160
0
one week duration, the Company will make a determination as to the work unit or units from which it desires to make such transfers. (Work unit for this purpose will be all employees within a given title who have a common place of reporting and who perform the same job duties.) All employees in the unit or units will be notified of the proposed transfer either by personal supervisory contacts or by a notice placed on bulletin boards within the selected unit or units. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, service requirements permitting. If the above procedure does not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, all employees holding the same title and who are performing the same job duties within the exchange (in multi-district exchanges, the district) and department from which the transfers are to be made will be notified of the proposed transfers either by personal supervisory contacts or by notices placed on bulletin boards. Qualified employees volunteering for the assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, service requirements permitting. Should additional employees be needed, selection will be made in the inverse order of seniority from among qualified employees, in the same job title and department who are performing the same duties, within the same exchange (in multi-district exchanges, the district) from which the Company elects to make the transfer, service requirements permitting, provided such transfers will not result in a special hardship to such employees or their immediate families.
2.	When temporary transfers are expected to be of one week duration or less, the Company will make a determination as to the work group in the exchange from which it desires to make such transfers. Where practicable, all employees in the work group will be notified of the proposed transfer either by personal supervisory contact or by a notice
161
Article
placed on the bulletin board within the selected work group. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, service requirements permitting.
If the above procedure does not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, volunteers will be sought using the same procedure from among all employees in the work unit in the exchange from which the Company desires to make such transfers. Those qualified employees volunteering for the temporary assignment will be selected and transferred in order of seniority, service requirements permitting.
If the above procedures do not produce a sufficient number of volunteers, the transfer will be made by transferring in the inverse order of seniority the first qualified employee in the work unit from which the Company has elected to make the transfer, service requirements permitting, provided such transfer will not result in a special hardship to such employee or his/her immediate family.
3.	When temporary transferees under 12.05C are transferred to an exchange, resident employees in that exchange performing the same work as that being performed by the temporary transferees will be offered 6 day work opportunity whenever the temporary transferees are offered 6 days.
D.	Basic pay treatment for temporarily transferred employees will continue in accordance with the wage progression scale in effect for their job classification at their home location. Any evening or night differential payments applicable will be paid in accordance with the schedule for such differentials in effect in the offices in which they are temporarily working.
E.	Transferred employees will be returned to their headquarters exchange on a seniority basis under the following conditions:
1.	When the need for temporary employees diminishes to a point where some employees may be returned.
162
0
2.	When junior employees are available while senior employees from the same exchange (or work unit as appropriate), in the same title, are on temporary duty in other locations, the junior employees will be assigned to relieve the senior employees concurrent with the senior employees' next Company-paid weekend home visit, provided:
a.	The junior employee(s) is qualified to relieve the senior employee(s).
b.	The work being performed by the senior employee(s) can be prudently reassigned.
c.	The senior employee(s) makes a request to return home.
3.	When employees in exchange "A" are selected and temporarily transferred to exchange "B", such employees should not be subsequently moved to another exchange with the following exceptions:
a.	When such employees are to perform work in an exchange within 35 miles of exchange "B", those initially selected may be so utilized.
1)	When it is known in advance that the employees selected are to perform work in another exchange within 35 miles of exchange "B", this information should be made known to the appropriate employees at the time such employees are being canvassed. Also, when the expected duration of such work is known, the employees will be so advised at the time of canvassing. The Company will endeavor to keep such movement within the cluster at a minimum, service requirements permitting.
b.	When employees in exchange "A" are selected and temporarily transferred to exchange "B" and the need for work develops in an exchange more than 35 miles
163
Article
from exchange "B", the selection process specified in 12.05C should be reinstituted and the appropriate employees in exchange "A" should be given the opportunity to volunteer for the assignment.
F.	Temporary transfers for the purpose of training will be excluded from the requirements of 12.05C1, C2, and 12.05E.
G.	In a Control Center (CC) environment, the performance of work assignments involving movement of forces in and out of exchanges is not considered a temporary transfer insofar as the application of 12.05A, C and E is concerned provided such exchanges are not beyond 35 miles of the employee's existing exchange. Such work will, however, be subject to the provisions of 9.02, as appropriate. Exemption from the application of these sections will not apply to such CC forces, however, when they are temporarily transferred away from their home exchange to other CC's or work groups in order to temporarily perform work functions outside of the scope of their home CC's normal area of control.
H.	The movement in and out of exchanges within a State of employees on State payrolls is not a temporary transfer under 12.05.
12.06 Appeal Rights.
The decision of the Company on any of the factors mentioned in 12.01, 12.02, 12.04 and 13.03 will be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in Article 21. After exhaustion of the grievance procedure, a charge of bad faith or arbitrary action will be subject to the arbitration procedure set forth in Article 23. If the Arbitrator finds that the Company acted arbitrarily or in bad faith, the Company will promptly take the necessary steps to correct such action.

APPLICATION OF SENIORITY
13.0	1 Extent and Limitations. (For definition of "Seniority", see 1.27.)
In matters relating to assignment of hours and vacations, layoffs, rehiring after layoffs, voluntary transfers, involuntary transfers and promotions, seniority shall govern to the extent and with the limitations set out in 3.03A, 5.07A, Article 7, 10.01A2, 12.01A1b, 12.01A1c, 12.01E, 12.02, 12.02A2, 12.04 and 12.05C respectively. The provisions of 3.02 and 13.03 shall likewise apply.
13.0	2 The application of the principle of seniority will be on the following basis:
A.	For assignment of tours, the provisions of 1.38 notwithstanding, the "work group" will apply, with the following exceptions:
1.	The Company and the Union may agree at the Operations or higher level to assign tours in some manner other than by work groups.
2.	Except for the conditions and limitations specified in 13.01, Network Operations employees in buildings housing central office equipment, where there is more than one central office or toll supervisor supervising work groups shall have the right to select tours in accordance with their seniority, provided they have the same job classification (title) and work on the same type of equipment. (No. 1 ESS, No. 2 ESS, No. 3 ESS, No. 4 ESS, No. 5 ESS, TSPS, and specialized assignments in Switching Control and Toll Center work groups, such as Field Forces, Trunking, Analyzation & Control, etc. are to be considered as different types of equipment.) On any changes occurring in Control Center (CC) groupings, or the introduction of new CC's, the Company will give prior notification to the appropriate State Director of the Union,
165
Article
or his/her designee, of the purpose of the proposed change, the job titles involved and if applicable, the intended CC area of control. The Company will consider the Union's input before making the change. The action of the Company in proceeding with the change will not prejudice the Union's rights under Article 15, or any other applicable rights under the Agreement.
3.	Construction Forces who hold the same title and report to the same work center shall be grouped together for the choice of tours.
4.	Tours for Operating Room and Centralized Repair Service Attendant Bureau Forces will be assigned in accordance with the provisions of 3.06.
5.	Employees, other than those covered in 13.02A2, A3 and A4 above, who have a common title, a common place of reporting, a common second level supervisor (or higher level in the absence of a second level), and who perform the same type work shall be grouped together for choice of tours. This paragraph will not apply in the Comptrollers Department when the parties at the Director Level or higher level agree to assign tours by a work group. In those instances where tours were assigned by work group in the Comptrollers Department, immediately prior to August 10, 1986, such groups may continue unless the parties at the Director level or higher mutually agree otherwise.
B.	For Vacations, the provisions of 1.38 notwithstanding, the work group with the following exceptions:
1.	The Company and the Union may agree at the Operations or higher level to assign vacations in some manner other than by work groups.
2.	Except for the conditions and limitations specified in 13.01, Network Operations employees in buildings housing central office equipment where there is more than one central office or toll supervisor supervising work groups shall have the right to select vacations in
166
0
accordance with their seniority, provided they have the same job classification (title) and work on the same type of equipment, (No. 1 ESS, No. 2 ESS, No. 3 ESS, No. 4 ESS, No. 5 ESS, TSPS, and specialized assignments in Switching Control and Toll Center work groups, such as Field Forces, Trunking, Analyzation & Control, etc., are to be considered as different types of equipment.) On any changes occurring in Control Center (CC) groupings, or the introduction of new CC's the Company will give prior notification to the appropriate State Director of the Union, or his/her designee, of the purpose of the proposed change, the job titles involved and, if applicable, the intended CC area of control. The Company will consider the Union's input before making the change. The action of the Company in proceeding with the change will not prejudice the Union's rights under Article 15 or any other applicable rights under the Agreement.
3.	Construction forces will be grouped together for the choice of vacations as follows:
a.	All employees holding the same title who report to the same work center will be grouped together when such employees report to different supervisors.
b.	All employees holding the same title or who hold a different title and report to the same or different work centers may be grouped together when such employees all report to the same supervisor provided vacation relief is to be obtained from such employees. The grouping of employees in this manner will only be applicable in small exchanges (see Appendix "A").
4.	Employees, other than those covered in “2” and “3” above, in the same or different titles having the same or a different place of reporting, who work under the same immediate supervisor may be grouped together for vacation selection purposes provided vacation relief is to
167
Article
be obtained from such employees and such employees possess the skills to relieve each other without training.
5.	Employees, other than those covered in 13.02B2, B3 and B4 above who have a common title, a common place of reporting, a common second level supervisor (or higher level in the absence of a second level), and who perform the same type work shall be grouped together for choice of vacations.
13.03 Preference for Training.
A.	When an employee is to be selected for training to equip him/her for some higher-rated work, the matter shall be treated and handled in the same general manner as in 12.02C.
1.	Training includes the selection of employees from within a work group who are regularly scheduled to work part-time or to relieve in another job in accordance with 4.07I, and the principle of 12.02C shall be observed among all the members of the work groups who are grouped together for the purpose of overtime equalization and vacation selections at the same place of reporting.
2.	In the case of an unanticipated need for selecting a person from within a work group to fill in temporarily in another job in accordance with 4.07I, the principle of 12.02C shall be observed if such assignment extends beyond work on 3 consecutive work days.
B.	Opportunity for training will first be offered to employees within the job title and group normally performing the work prior to offering such training to employees in lower rated titles. Seniority shall govern if other necessary qualifications of the individuals are substantially equal.
Opportunity for training will be rotated among the employees within a work group insofar as practicable in keeping with the needs of the business.
C.	If job technology or functions are to be changed within a job title within a work group to the extent that the incumbents will not be able to satisfactorily perform in the job without
168
0
successfully completing additional company-sponsored jobspecific training, and the company has established the attainment of a minimum test score as a prerequisite to taking the training, the company will notify all of the incumbents in all of the work groups affected within an exchange/WRA.
1.	Such incumbents will then be offered an opportunity to take the prerequisite test as soon as practicable following such notification and, if they meet minimum test score requirements, will be considered as qualifying for taking the job-specific training subject to the provisions of 13.03B.
2.	Those incumbents in "1" above who fail to meet the required minimum test score will be advised of the areas in which they appear to be deficient and will be given the opportunity to receive appropriate general skills training under PARTNERSHIP. If they complete such training they will then be considered as qualifying to the same degree as those in "1" above for taking the job-specific training subject to the provisions of 13.03B.
3.	If an incumbent declines to take the prerequisite test at all, or declines the process offered in "2" above, or fails to successfully complete the job-specific company sponsored training, he/she will be assigned to the unchanged functions within the title within the exchange/WRA to the extent such work is available on a full-time basis, so long as such assignment will not adversely affect operations efficiency. If such assignment is not made or at such time such assignment cannot be continued, the employee may be treated as an "operational efficiencies" surplus under Article 7.

ARTICLE 14 JURISDICTION OF WORK
(for CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
14.01 Contract Work.
A.	The Company agrees to use only Company employees on work involving the construction, maintenance, removal and/or repair of the following types of plant:
1.	All aerial outside plant except that on which such work may be performed by unskilled or occasional labor working on the ground rather than aloft.
2.	Underground cable and splicing of buried cable.
3.	Submarine cable except where such work requires the use of boats, barges, water-borne or other special equipment not normally used by the Company.
4.	Local and toll central office, TWX, TLX, private line or station equipment which constitutes any part of a communication circuit except work on such plant done by a connecting company on plant located in its territory.
Notwithstanding the above, the Company will not contract the maintenance or repair of such telephone plant located in the territory of a connecting company where the Company is now doing such work by employees now stationed or may subsequently be stationed in the territory of the connecting company.
5.	Nothing in 14.01 is to be interpreted as restricting the right of the Company to use contractors' labor to perform any work under "2" and "3" above which can be done by unskilled or occasional employees. Neither is it intended to prevent the Company from contracting out the type of work which was normally performed by the Western Electric Company and The Long Lines Department of American Telephone and Telegraph Company prior to the divestiture of the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company and South Central Bell Telephone Company from the American Telephone and Telegraph Company.
170
0
6.	Nothing in 14.01 is to be interpreted as restricting the right of the Company to contract out any work during an emergency or to allow subscribers to remove the instruments from their premises if such removal can be effected without the use of telephone craft skills. Emergency work includes the clearing of trouble and the accompanying repair of any plant located in the territory of a connecting company.
B.	The Company further agrees that in the carrying out of its program of construction, removal, maintenance and/or repair of telephone plant it will not contract any work which would make it necessary to lay off or part-time any regular or temporary employee of the Company.
14.02 Non-Performance of Craft Work by Supervisors.
The Company agrees that it will not as a general practice work supervisory employees who are classed as "Executive" employees under the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, as amended, on work ordinarily performed by non-supervisory employees except for purposes of instruction or to meet emergency conditions. The parties recognize, however, that there are proper exceptions to this general practice, made in the interest of the service or economical operation, and in such cases nothing herein is intended to prohibit the Company from working such supervisory employees on non-supervisory work.
ARTICLE 15
JOB DESCRIPTIONS, TITLES AND CLASSIFICATIONS
15.01 Job Titles and Classifications.
Whenever the Company determines it appropriate to create a new job title or job classification in the bargaining unit or to restructure or redefine an existing one, it shall be handled as follows:
171
Article
A.	The Company shall notify the Union in writing of such job title or classification and shall furnish a job description of the duties and the wage rates and schedules initially determined for such job titles and classifications. Such wage rates and schedules shall be designated as temporary. Following such notice to the Union at the Company bargaining level, the Company may proceed to staff such job title or classification.
B.	The Union shall have the right, within 30 days from receipt of notice from the Company, to initiate negotiations concerning the initial wage rates or schedules established as temporary by the Company.
C.	If negotiations are not so initiated or if agreement is reached between the parties within 60 days following receipt of notice from the Company concerning the wage rates and schedules, the temporary designation shall be removed from the job title or classification.
D.	If negotiations are initiated and the parties are unable to reach agreement within 60 days following receipt of notice from the Company, the Union shall provide the Company in writing a statement of their position containing the wage rate they consider appropriate for the new or restructured job. The issue of an appropriate schedule of wage rates shall then be submitted to a neutral third party (NTP), to be selected as set forth below, for determination of the final schedule of wage rates.
E.	It is expected that agreement on a job description be reached during the negotiation. If such agreement is not reached, a joint job description verification study will be undertaken to ensure that the work components assigned to the job by the Company are accurately described. If, following this verification study and any resulting modifications to the job description, agreement still cannot be reached that the work components are accurately described, grievance and arbitration procedures may be initiated. Such grievances must be filed by the Union at the Executive Level within the 60 day period described in "D" above.
172
0
F.	Once the parties agree the job has been accurately described or the matter has been resolved by arbitration, the Company and the Union will notify the NTP that he/she has been selected and arrange a meeting within the third or fourth week of the first 30 days at a place mutually agreeable with all parties. The NTP will also be informed that each of the parties will send their written rationale for the proposed wage rate of the disputed job to the NTP within 2 weeks. This will include a job description and other agreed upon information.
G.	The Union and Company will meet within 2 weeks and exchange their rationale for their proposed rate. This will normally include comparisons of not more than 2 existing bargained-for jobs that each party feels will justify their position. They will jointly mail the required material to the NTP. This material will include: (1) an agreed upon job description of the disputed job, (2) the job descriptions of existing jobs (not more than 2) that each party feels justifies the rate of the disputed job, and the wage schedule that each party believes should apply, and (3) the parties may include information such as competitive market rates if they so desire.
H. At the meeting, each party may verbally present its position to the NTP. This meeting is for the purpose of providing the NTP with detailed information concerning the duties of the job, the skills required, the training necessary to perform the work and other related information. Similar information for the comparable jobs as detailed in "G" above may be provided so that the NTP can expeditiously render a fair and informed decision determining the wage rate for the disputed job. It is generally expected this informative meeting would be concluded in one day or less and be completed within 30 days of the NTP selection. Each party shall bear the expense of its representatives and witnesses at this meeting.
I.	At the conclusion of this meeting, the NTP must notify the Union and Company if additional information or a job visit is required. The parties will coordinate the provision of additional information or a job visit. If the Union and
173
Article
Company representatives wish to accompany the NTP on the job visit or incumbent interview, they may do so. All of these arrangements must be made so that the decision can be reached within 60 days.
J.	While it is not intended that such third party undertake a full and complete job evaluation study, he/she shall review the job titles and their respective wage schedules as submitted by the Company and the Union for comparison purposes. Also, if necessary, the NTP may make an on-site inspection of the workplace and conduct a reasonable number of interviews of incumbents.
K.	The decision should include a brief rationale for the wage schedule that was selected for the disputed job. The intent is that the NTP will select either the wage schedule submitted by the Company or the Union. In the event the NTP selects the wage schedule submitted by the Union, the new schedule shall be placed in effect retroactively to the date notification was given to the NTP as specified in "F" above up to a maximum of 60 days. If the parties mutually agree to waive the time frames specified in Article 15, the period of retroactivity will be a negotiable item to be addressed in the final evaluation of the issue.
L.	The expense of the NTP will be borne equally by the parties.
M.	The NTP referred to above shall be selected by mutual agreement from a list of 5 individuals compiled by the Company and the Union. Such individuals on the list shall possess acknowledged expertise in the area of job evaluation.
15.0	2 Negotiations Covering Wage Rates for New or Restructured Job Titles or Classifications.
The procedures set forth in 15.01 above shall be the exclusive means by which the Union may contest the schedule of wage rates which the Company sets for any new or restructured job title or classification.
174
0
15.0	3 Negotiations Covering Wage Rates for Exchanges/WRA(s) or Equipment Locations.
A.	The Company shall furnish to the Union, in writing, notice of the acquisition or activation by the Company of additional exchanges/WRA or equipment locations which require the establishment of new jobs or extension of jobs or job titles.
B.	The Union shall have the right within 30 days from receipt of such notice in "A" above to initiate negotiations concerning the appropriate wage zone/wage area applicable to the job titles or job classifications involved.

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
(for CPE see Customer Markets Addendum)
21.01 Grievance Levels.
In the processing of any grievance, the Company will furnish the Union all necessary and relevant data concerning the grievance as determined by the National Labor Relations Act. If the grievance is initiated at the local level, this information will be furnished to the Local President or authorized Union representative upon request. The parties agree that in the handling and adjustment of grievances by the Union the following procedures will be followed:
A.	An employee or group of employees will have the right to present to and adjust with management any grievance as provided in Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations
185
Article
Act, as amended, provided, however, that no adjustment will be made with the employee or group of employees involved which is inconsistent with the terms of any collective bargaining agreement between the parties then in effect, and provided further that the Union has been given an opportunity to be present at such adjustment.
B.	After an employee or employees have presented a grievance to the Union for settlement and a Union representative has informed the Company that the Union represents that employee(s), the Company will not discuss or adjust such grievance with said employee(s) unless the aggrieved employee(s) initiate a request that the Company discuss and adjust such grievance directly with the involved employee(s), but in no event will an adjustment be made unless a Union representative is afforded an opportunity to be present at such adjustment.
C.	Grievances, other than those involving the true intent and meaning (see 21.01C5) of this or any other agreement between the parties or adversely affecting the rights of other employees, will be handled under the procedure set forth below. For each such grievance initiated by the Union under this Paragraph, the steps in the procedure will be those listed below except as provided in 21.06C (Vacancies), and 21.07 (Short Term Disability).
1st Step - The Informal Level (the level where the aggrieved employee is employed)
2nd Step - Panel Process/Formal Level
3rd Step - State Level
4th Step - Executive Level
1.	Informal Level (1st Step).
Before formal grievances involving matters other than discharges and demotions are filed at the 2nd Step, there must have been an Informal Level meeting or conference with the appropriate Union and Company representatives, normally the local steward and the
186
0
immediate supervisor. This meeting may be waived by mutual consent where appropriate. When necessary, the Union may request the presence of an involved grievant(s). This meeting is intended to allow both sides to fully explore the incident, develop the facts, state their contentions, clear up any possible misunderstandings and attempt to informally resolve the dispute. No record will be made at this meeting or conference; no papers, forms or written answers are to be filed. (For pay treatment see 21.03 and 21.04.)
2.	Panel Process/Formal Level (2nd Step).
Each grievance must be presented as a formal grievance at the 2nd Step within 60 days from the date of the last occurrence on which the grievance is based by filing a written request for a formal grievance meeting. This request must be filed with the Director/designee within 14 days following the Informal Level meeting.
At the 2nd Step meeting, the grievance must be reduced to writing on the Record of Grievance Form and presented to the Company by the Union at the conclusion of the meeting(s). (For pay treatment see 21.03 and 21.04.)
Grievance meetings at the 2nd Step will normally be handled as follows:
a.	By a panel composed of 2 CWA and 2 Company representatives designated by the Local President and involved Director, respectively.
1)	Panelists will meet at a mutually agreeable time to hear presentations made by the two parties (normally the steward and supervisor who met at the Informal Level or Company/CWA designee in some instances) and to ask questions as needed.
187
Article
2)	Panelists will then excuse the presenters/ grievant(s) and discuss the issue among themselves until they reach resolution or determine that the grievance will be rejected or appealed.
3)	The decision of the panel will then be relayed to the presenters/grievant(s).
4)	If the panel is unable to reach consensus, the Union will provide the Company a Form 3G3A. Within 7 days, the Company will provide the Union its answer on the Form 3G3A. Within 7 days of receipt, the Union will provide its response on the Form 3G3A. (See “c” and “d” below.)
5)	If a grievance heard by the panel is appealed, a joint brief, outlining both CWA and Company viewpoints, will be prepared by panel members and forwarded to the State Level.
b.	As exceptions, grievances involving true intent and meaning of this contract or other agreements between the parties (see 21.01C and C5) and grievances involving discharges will not be heard by the panel.
The parties may mutually agree to use the following Formal Level grievance procedure in lieu of the panel:
At the Formal Level meeting the grievance must be reduced to writing on the Record of Grievance Form adopted by the parties and presented to the Company by the Union at the conclusion of the meeting(s). (For pay treatment see 21.03 and 21.04.)
1)	Within 14 days from the date of the meeting (or the last adjourned meeting) the management representative with whom the grievance was discussed will inform the Union in writing on 4 copies of the Record of Grievance Form of his/her
188
0
proposed position. If the parties agree on an adjustment, the adjustment will be stated as the proposed disposition on the Record of Grievance Form and both parties will sign 2 copies of the form and each retain one signed copy.
2)	With respect to “1” above, failure of the management representative to submit a written decision within 14 days as described therein, effects an automatic appeal to the next higher Level.
3)	Within 14 days from the date when the Union is advised on the Record of Grievance Form of the proposed disposition by the management representative, the Union will advise the Company on a copy of the Record of Grievance Form whether the proposed disposition is accepted, rejected or appealed. Such advice should be directed to the management representative with whom the Union discussed the grievance. If the grievance is appealed to the 3rd Step, the Union will promptly forward the grievance to the Union’s designated representative who services the area involved. Grievances so appealed may nevertheless be dropped without a meeting and without prejudice to the Union’s contentions regarding the merits of the grievance.
4)	The Union’s rejection of the proposed disposition by the management representative at the 2nd Step will close the grievance without prejudice to the Union’s contentions regarding the merits of the grievance.
5)	If the Union does not return a copy of the Record of Grievance Form indicating their decision within the 14 days specified in “3” above, the Company’s
189
Article
proposed disposition will be considered to have been appealed.
(a) Where agreed to by the Company, a Mediation Hearing may be held for grievances other than true intent at the Company’s expense if the parties fail to resolve the grievance(s). (See 23.03) Refusal of the Company to use mediation will not be subject to escalation or grievance.
c.	Regardless of format chosen, in discipline cases the Company and CWA representatives have the responsibility to meet, discuss the issue(s) and complete the related paperwork within 30 days of the request for a meeting date. On non-discipline grievances, the parties will have 60 days to do so.
d.	Where mutually agreed, the time periods in “c” may be extended, normally not beyond 30 days. It is intended that the time limits specified in 21.01C2a4 above will be included in the time frames outlined in “c” and “d”.
e.	Failure of the parties to carry out their responsibilities within the specified time frames will generate an automatic appeal of the grievance to the State Level. The State Level representatives will determine the action necessary to address the problem and will handle the grievance accordingly.
f.	Grievances involving counseling entries shall not be appealed beyond the 2nd Level of the grievance procedures.
3.	State Level (3rd Step).
On grievances appealed to the 3rd Step, the CWA Staff Representative will request a meeting with the designated Management representative within 30 days of the date of appeal and that meeting will be held within 30 days of such request.
190
0
a.	If mutually agreed, State Level representatives may extend the time frame, normally not beyond 60 days, to meet and discuss the related grievance.
1)	If either party identifies a problem with meeting on grievances within the specified time frames, such would be referred to the Executive Level for review and remedy of the problem.
b.	If the parties agree on a settlement, such will be stated as the proposed disposition on the Record of Grievance Form and both parties will sign 2 copies of the form and each retain one signed copy.
1)	If the grievance is not disposed of otherwise the parties will indicate in writing their respective positions on the Record of Grievance Form. Such positions will be exchanged in accordance with “a” and “b” below. These positions, will include the issue(s) in question, the position taken by the respective parties, their contentions concerning the true facts and offers made at the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Steps, if any, to settle the issue.
(a)	Within 7 days from the date of the meeting (or the last adjourned meeting) the Management representative with whom the grievance was discussed will inform the Union in writing on 2 copies of the Record of Grievance Form of his/her proposed position. Except as otherwise provided for in 21.01C3b1d, failure of the Management representative to submit a written decision within 7 days, effects an automatic appeal to the next higher Level.
(b)	Within 14 days (90 days for discipline related grievances) from the date when the Union is advised on the Record of Grievance Form of the proposed disposition by the Management representative, the Union will advise the
191
Article
Company on a copy of the Form whether the proposed disposition is accepted, rejected or appealed except as otherwise provided for in 21.01C3b1d. If the grievance is appealed to the 4th Step, the Union will promptly forward the grievance to the Union’s designated representative. Grievances so appealed may nevertheless be dropped without a meeting and without prejudice to the Union’s contentions regarding the merits of the grievance.
(c)	Grievances, except those involving benefit and discipline issues, not satisfactorily adjusted at the 3rd Step may then be appealed to the 4th Step. If the Union does not request a conference on an appeal to the next higher level within 30 days of the date of appeal, the grievance will be closed.
(d)	Discipline related grievances not satisfactorily adjusted at the 3rd Step, may then be subject to the arbitration procedures as outlined in Article 23.
4.	Executive Level (4th Step).
Each party will advise the other of the names of its representatives at the 4th Step who are authorized to finally approve settlements made at the 2nd or 3rd Step of the grievance procedure. On grievances appealed to the 4th Step the appropriate Company representative should meet with the Union within 30 days after the Union has requested a conference on such grievance. In the event the appropriate Company representative is unable to meet within that time period, the Company and Union may agree to a 14 day extension for the meeting.
a.	If a meeting is not held by the appropriate Company representative within the greater of 30 days of the Union's request for a conference or the extended time period due to the fault of the Company, the Company
192
0
will have defaulted on that grievance. Upon default by the Company, a remedy of the grievance will be fashioned at the Bargaining Level of the Company. If a remedy cannot be agreed upon at this Level, the appropriate remedy will be determined by arbitration under 23.01.
b.	All appeals to the 4th Step will be based upon the record consisting of the Record of Grievance Form, Joint Minutes (if any) at the 2nd Step, positions under 21.01C3b above and any oral or written statements, affidavits or exhibits that the parties at the 2nd and 3rd Steps incorporated into the record.
5.	Grievances which involve the true intent and meaning of this or any other agreement between the parties or adversely affect the rights of any employee(s) if filed by the Union will be initially presented at the 2nd, 3rd or 4th Step: such grievances and those involving alleged violations of the Agreement by the Union, if filed by the Company, will be filed at the 4th Step of the Company with the District Office of the Union. Each such grievance must be presented, orally or in writing, within 60 days from the date of the last occurrence on which the grievance is based.
a.	When a grievance is filed at the 4th Step of the Company with the District Office of the Union as described in "5" above, such grievance will be accompanied by a written statement of position from the Company representative setting forth the Company's position regarding the grievance. Such written position will include the Company's contentions as to the true facts involved, its allegations as to how the Union has violated the Agreement and, if appropriate, its contentions as to the true intent and meaning or interpretation of any provision of the Agreement. The District Office of the Union will have a period of 14 days in which to reply in writing to the
193
Article
Company's written statement or position and the Union's reply will also set forth its contentions as to the true facts involved, its reply to the Company's allegation, if any, as to how the Union has violated the Agreement and its contentions as to the true intent and meaning of the Agreement provisions if such are involved.
b.	If the grievance is to be arbitrated, the written positions of the parties, or amendments thereto, served on the other party at least 14 days in advance of the arbitration hearing, will be filed with the arbitrator as exhibits. Such exhibits may be assigned such weight as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
6.	When a Union grievance is appealed, the decision of management at the 4th Step will be given to the Union within 7 days after the appeal is discussed at a conference (or last adjourned meeting mutually agreed upon). When the grievance is initiated by the Company under "5" above, the decision of the District Office of the Union will be given to the Company within 7 days after the grievance is discussed at a conference (or last adjourned meeting thereof mutually agreed upon).
7.	Grievance adjustments at the 2nd and 3rd Steps will be final and binding, and will not be used as a precedent by either party, except that an adjustment at the 2nd or 3rd Step may be made subject to Executive Level approval if either party at the 2nd or 3rd Step notifies the other in writing within 60 days from the date the settlement was executed, that a “true intent and meaning” question exists. The parties will not use a local past practice established by a local level settlement to support controversies that develop in other locations. The parties reserve the right to urge that grievances dropped after having been appealed to arbitration may have, or may not have, a precedential effect in accordance with all of the circumstances.
D.	The computation of any period of time prescribed by any Agreement between the parties will begin on the day after the
194
0
occurrence, presentation, appeal, decision, request or demand and continue on a calendar-day basis through the last day of the period. If the last day is a Sunday or holiday, the period will run until the next day not a Sunday or holiday. Any communication required to be in writing will be considered to be made on the date it is postmarked, dated by personal receipted delivery, or by other means mutually agreeable.
E.	The presence of a Union Officer except those certified under 21.01C7 at the adjustment of any grievance presented by an employee(s) under “A” above will not be regarded as an agreement on the part of the Union that the grievance was properly adjusted.

A.	The provisions for arbitration will apply only to the matters made specifically subject to arbitration in "B" below.
B.	If at any time a controversy should arise between the parties regarding the true intent and meaning of any provisions of this or any other agreement between the parties or a controversy as to the performance of an obligation hereunder, which the parties are unable to resolve by use of the grievance procedure, the matter will be arbitrated upon written request of either party to the other.
C.	Such request for arbitration will be made within 90 days from the date of the final decision in writing on the grievance, unless the failure to make such request will be excused by the Arbitrator because of extraordinary circumstances including, but not limited to, newly discovered or previously unavailable material evidence that could not have been discovered or produced by reasonable diligence.
D.	The procedure for arbitration will be as follows:
1.	Within 30 days after the filing of the written request for arbitration, the Vice President of the Union or his/her delegated representative will confer with the Executive Director of Labor Relations of the Company or his/her
199
Article
delegated representative to select an Impartial Arbitrator and a date for the hearing.

23.02 Expedited Arbitration.
A.	In lieu of the procedures specified in 23.01 of this Agreement, any grievance filed on behalf of an employee which involves suspensions or discharges except those which also involve an issue of arbitrability, contract interpretation, or strike activity and those which are also the subject of an administrative charge or court action will be submitted to expedited arbitration within 15 calendar days after the filing of a request for arbitration. In all other grievances involving disciplinary action which are specifically subject to arbitration under 23.01, both parties may, within 15 calendar days after the filing of the request for arbitration, elect to use the expedited arbitration procedure provided. The election will be in writing and, when signed by authorized representatives of the parties, will be irrevocable. If no such election is made within the foregoing time period, the arbitration procedure in 23.01 will be followed.
B.	A panel of at least 10 arbitrators will be selected by the parties. Each arbitrator will serve until the termination of this Agreement unless his/her services are terminated earlier by written notice from either party to the other. The arbitrator will be notified of his/her termination by a joint letter from the parties. The arbitrator will conclude his/her services by settling any grievance previously heard. A successor arbitrator will be selected by the parties. Arbitrators will be assigned cases in rotating order designated by the parties. If an arbitrator is not available for a hearing within 10 working days after receiving an assignment, the case will be passed to the next arbitrator.

C.	The procedure for expedited arbitration will be as follows:
1.	The parties will notify the arbitrator in writing on the day of agreement or date of arbitration demands to settle a
201
Article

3.	The hearing will be informal without formal rules of evidence and without a transcript. However, the arbitrator will be satisfied himself/herself that the evidence submitted is of a type on which he/she can rely, that the hearing is in all respects a fair one, and that all facts necessary to a fair settlement and reasonably obtainable are brought before the arbitrator.
4.	Within 5 working days after the hearing, each party may submit a brief written summary of the issues raised at the hearing and arguments supporting its position. Such summaries are not to exceed 10 pages in cases involving discharge or 5 pages in cases involving suspension. The arbitrator will give his/her settlement within 5 working days after receiving the briefs. He/She will provide the parties a brief written statement of the reasons supporting his/her settlement.
5.	The decision of the arbitrator will settle the grievance; however, it will only apply to the grievance being arbitrated and will not be precedent-setting, unless the settlement or a modification thereof is adopted by the written concurrence of the representatives of each party at the Executive Level of the grievance procedure.
6.	The time limits in "1" and "4" of this Section may be extended by agreement of the parties or at the arbitrator's request, in either case only in emergency situations. Such extensions will not circumvent the purpose of this procedure.
7.	In any grievance arbitrated under the provisions of this Section, the Company will under no circumstances be liable for back pay for more than 9 months (plus any time that the processing of the grievance or arbitration was delayed at the specific request of the Company or time
202
0
between original proposed dates and actual arbitration resulting from the Company’s inability to comply with original dates) after the date of the disciplinary action. In grievances which were scheduled for mediation prior to expedited arbitration, the liability for back pay will be no more than 12 months. Delays requested by the Union in which the Company concurs will not be included in such additional time.
8.	The arbitrator will have no authority to add to, subtract from or modify any provisions of this Agreement.
9.	The decision of the arbitrator will settle the grievance, and the Company and the Union agree to abide by such decision. The compensation and expenses of the arbitrator and the general expenses of the arbitration will be borne by the Company and the Union in equal parts. Each party will bear the expense of its representatives and witnesses. Any expenses incurred because of any cancellation or postponement of an expedited arbitration hearing will be borne by the party requesting such cancellation or postponement.
23.03 Mediation.
A.	Where mutually agreed, grievances may be mediated once at either the 2nd or 3rd Step, with the exception of those dealing with matters of contract interpretation.
1.	Once a grievance has been appealed to arbitration, if the Union at the Executive Level requests mediation and the Company concurs, the grievance will be presented at a mediation hearing.
a. Grievances to be mediated at the 2nd Step are not required to be approved for arbitration prior to mediation.
2.	Within 45 days of the Union's request for arbitration, the parties will schedule and hold a mediation hearing. This hearing will normally be held in the grievant's
203
Article
exchange/WRA and in either a Company or Union facility. Should the availability of a mediator unnecessarily delay the processing of the grievance, either party may request that the mediation step be bypassed and the grievance be scheduled for arbitration.
3.	Spokespersons for the mediation hearing will normally be as follows:
	2nd Step	3rd Step
CWA	Local President/ designee	CWA Staff Rep
Company	Management designee	Director/designee with primary LR responsibility
An attorney will not be used by either party at the mediation hearing. The number of employees who will suffer no loss in pay under 21.03 of the Agreement will be no more than 2. Should additional employees be necessary for the complete discovery of facts at the hearing, the parties will agree in advance to the number of additional employees who will attend the conference and suffer no loss in pay under 21.03.
4.	The mediation hearing will normally be attended by the grievant, the Local President/designee, the grievant's supervisor and the Director/designee. Attendance at the mediation hearing will be limited to those people actually involved.
5.	All written material that is presented to the mediator will be returned to the party presenting the material at the termination of the mediation hearing. The mediator may, however, retain one copy of the written grievance, to be used solely for purposes of statistical analysis.
6.	Proceedings before the mediator will be informal in nature. The presentation of evidence is not limited to that which has been presented in the grievance proceedings;
204
0
however, the issue mediated will be the same as the issue the parties have tried to resolve through the grievance process. The rules of evidence will not apply, and no record of the mediation hearing will be made.
7.	The mediator will have the authority to meet separately with any person or persons, but will not have the authority to compel the resolution of a grievance.
8.	The Company and Union spokesperson at the mediation hearing may accept the resolution proposed by the mediator and such settlement or any other settlement resulting from the conference will not be precedentsetting, unless both parties agree.
9.	If no settlement is reached during the mediation hearing, the mediator will provide the parties with an immediate oral advisory opinion, including the grounds for his/her opinion, unless both parties agree that no opinion will be provided. The grievance is then subject to being scheduled for arbitration.
10.	In the event that a grievance which has been mediated subsequently is arbitrated, no person serving as a mediator between these parties may serve as arbitrator. Nothing said or done by the mediator may be referred to at arbitration. Any settlement proposal made by either party at the mediation hearing will not be referred to at the arbitration hearing.
B.	The parties will share equally the costs associated with mediations held at the 3rd Step.	Costs associated with
mediations at the 2nd Step are outlined in 21.01C2b5a.

The Company will continue to make such payroll deductions for employees who have properly executed dues deduction cards on file. Except as provided below, or as provided in the Memorandum of Understanding between the parties, or as otherwise provided by applicable law, all cards may only be revoked during the 10 day period preceding the expiration date of this Agreement and the same 10 day period each year during the life of this Agreement.

25.02 Dues Requirements.
Each employee who is a member of the Union or who is obligated to tender to the Union amounts equal to periodic dues on the effective date of this Agreement, or who later becomes a member, and all employees entering into the bargaining unit on or after the effective date of this Agreement, shall, as a condition of employment, pay or tender to the Union amounts equal to the periodic dues applicable to members for the period from such effective date or, in the case of employees entering into the bargaining unit after the effective date on or after the thirtieth day of such entrance, whichever of these dates is later, until the termination of this Agreement.

223
Article
ARTICLE 26
ABSENCES FOR UNION DUTIES
26.01 Excused Time for Union Duty.
Subject to limitations expressed below, employees who are elected or appointed to an office or committee in or for the Local, District or National Union and who are certified in writing to the Company by the Vice President or the Executive Board of the Union as having to be absent from their regular Company work for the proper performance of their lawful duties to the Union in connection with such office or committee shall be excused without pay for periods not exceeding, in the total, 120 work days in any calendar year provided that such absences shall not exceed 30 consecutive days in any 1 period. However, for Union officers as identified and limited by 17.01C the 120 work days (150 for Local Presidents) may be increased to a maximum of 150 work days (180 for Local Presidents) upon approval at the Company bargaining level. Except for unforeseen situations, a Local officer shall notify the immediate supervisor of the employee to be released when such absence is to begin and for what period the employee expects to be absent. The status of employees absent for such duties shall be the same, including seniority, as for other employees excused from Company duties for personal reasons not in excess of 30 consecutive days at any one period.
The excusal of employees from Company duty to perform Union duties shall not be followed to the extent of withdrawing adequate protection of telephone service in any department or locality.
26.02 Union Leave of Absence.
Employees whose Union duties require their absence from Company work for a period, or periods, in excess of those set out in 26.01 shall apply to the Company for a leave of absence without pay, and the Company shall grant such leave of absence for a reasonable period not to exceed one year. Employees that exceed the limits set in Article 26.01 and who do not request a formal leave will automatically be placed on an unpaid Union leave of absence. Leaves of absence granted pursuant to this
224
0
Article shall be subject to the conditions hereinafter stated in 26.03.
A.	Requests for leaves of absence shall be made in writing by the employee and the Vice President of the Union or his/her delegated representative, with the request being directed to the Executive Director of Labor Relations of the Company at least 30 days before such leave is to begin.
B.	Requests for such leaves of absence shall be acted upon promptly by the Company.
C.	Employees who exceed the limits of 26.01 and are automatically placed on a Union leave will be notified. These leaves may be retroactive to the date when the time limits specified in 26.01 were exceeded.
26.03 Conditions of Leaves of Absence.
Leaves of absence granted under the terms of 26.02 are subject to these conditions.
A.	The period of an employee's absence on such leave shall be included in determining such employee's seniority with the Company. However, for the purpose of determining the length of service upon which such employee's wage progression is based, such employee shall be given credit for only the first 30 days of the first leave of absence granted such employee. When the employee returns from leave, his/her wage progression, if determined in accordance with an automatic wage scale, shall be accelerated by reducing the normal intervals between increases by one-half until the employee shall have attained his/her position on his/her wage scale commensurate with his/her length of service had he/she not been on leave of absence.
B.	During the period of such employee's leave of absence, such employee's qualified dependent, or dependents shall retain eligibility to Sickness-Death Benefits. The employee may continue coverage under the applicable Company medical plan when employed by CWA or when elected or appointed to
225
Article
a CWA office within a Local Union (coverage elected under any CWA plan will be at CWA's or the employee's expense). The employee may continue his/her own coverage under the AT&T Dental Plan and the AT&T Vision Plan by individual payment of the full amount of appropriate payment.
C.	Employees who return to Company duty at the expiration of such leaves of absence shall be placed on the payroll at the rate received when such absence was granted, adjusted for any changes in wage level made during the period of such leave of absence. In the event such leave of absence has expired and such employee desires to, and is otherwise entitled to, resume employment with the Company, but at the time of such expiration such employee is unable to perform the required Company duties because of sickness, such employee shall nevertheless be re-employed, and in determining the eligibility of such employee to sickness payments the first day of such re-employment shall be considered as such employee's first day of absence because of sickness.
D.	Such leave of absence for an employee shall be terminated at his/her request prior to the expiration of such leave of absence only in case the employee is able to perform on a full-time basis the Company duties required of such employee. The term "full-time basis" as used in the preceding sentence shall not be construed to deny to such employee incidental participation in Union matters without pay if excused by the Company for such purposes. An employee requesting to return from Union leave under this paragraph shall give his/her supervisor reasonable notice.
E.	The termination of this Agreement by either party shall not affect the leave status or re-employment rights of an employee who is on leave of absence granted under 26.02.
F.	Notwithstanding the provisions of 21.02, employees on such leaves of absence shall not be entitled to receive from the Company any pay or compensation for time consumed in meetings with Management, or necessarily consumed in traveling to and from such meetings.
226
0

The Union, through its membership, has a vital role in the overall success of the Company's operations. Consequently, each party shall participate in the open exchange of information to the fullest extent possible. The Company must continually improve efficiency in order to ensure our ability to be competitive in the marketplace and to prosper. The Union must play an essential role in sharing in the achievement of these goals.
Organizational and technological innovations are necessary and inevitable. We believe that every employee has both the ability and responsibility to contribute to the goals of the organization - in return, the Company will treat every employee with dignity and respect.
Both parties have the responsibility to assure this improving relationship exists, is endorsed and communicated throughout all levels of the Company and the Union.

Part III
SUCCESS SHARING PLAN
Based on the Union and Company’s desire to have employees share in the success of AT&T Inc. (AT&T), the parties agree to a Success Sharing Plan (SSP). Eligible employees may receive annual lump sum cash payments, based on AT&T stock price appreciation and AT&T dividend rate.
A. Plan Components
1.	Success Units
Employees will be awarded 150 success units at the beginning of each award year (October 1, 2015, October 3, 2016 and October 2, 2017 and October 1, 2018). Those success units will only be valid for that award year and will not carryover to the next award year. A success unit is only used as a multiplier in the payout calculation and is not a share of stock nor has any other value.
2. Determining Stock Appreciation Award Value
Award Year	Beginning Award Value	Ending Award Value
2016 (October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016)	October 1, 2015 closing AT&T stock price	September 30, 2016 closing AT&T stock price
2017 (October 3, 2016 to September 29, 2017)	October 3, 2016 closing AT&T stock price	September 29, 2017 closing AT&T stock price
2018 (October 2, 2017 to September 28, 2018)	October 2, 2017 closing AT&T stock price	September 28, 2018 closing AT&T stock price
2019 (October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019)	October 1, 2018 closing AT&T stock price	September 30, 2019 closing AT&T stock price
The stock price used in establishing the award value will be the closing AT&T stock price on the New York Stock Exchange.
282
Appendix B
Part III
The award value will be adjusted proportionally to reflect any stock split.
3.	Determining Dividend Rate Value
The dividend rate value will be determined by adding each AT&T declared quarterly dividend during the award year (historically December, March, June, and September) and multiplying this total by 150 success units.
4.	Payout
Employees will receive a total payout based on the difference between the ending award value and the beginning award value for the award year times 150 success units plus the dividend rate value. For example:
Stock Appreciation Value:
Beginning award value - October 1, 2015 closing AT&T stock price $33.00
Ending award value - September 30, 2016 closing AT&T stock price $38.00
Payout - $38 - $33 = $5 x 150 success units = $750.00
Dividend Rate Value:
December 2015 declared dividend	$.47
March 2016 declared dividend	$.47
June 2016 declared dividend	$.47
September 2016 declared dividend	$.47
Total Declared Dividend	$1.88
Dividend Rate Value - $1.88 x 150 success units = $282.00
283
Appendix B
Part III
Total Award
$750.00 stock appreciation value + $282.00 dividend rate value = $1,032.00
The award payment will be made as soon as practicable after the award year and will normally occur the payday of the last full pay period in November.
B.	Eligibility
Employees eligible for payments as described above are those regular, temporary and term employees who are on the payroll on both the beginning and ending dates of the award year and who works for a minimum of three (3) months within the award year in a position covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement. Eligible employees who are on approved leaves of absence, short-term disability absence or partial disability absence and meet the other eligibility requirements on the ending date of the award year shall receive a payment, provided they return to duty on or before December 31 of the year in which the payment is made.
An eligible employee who transfers between AT&T Companies participating in the SSP will be eligible to receive a payout under the terms of the SSP applicable to the employee’s current bargaining unit at the time of a payout, so long as the combined service in both AT&T Companies satisfies the above eligibility provisions.
C.	Part-Time Employees
Eligible part-time employees will receive prorated payments based on their part-time classification (or “part-time equivalent work week”) on the ending date of the award year.
D.	Benefits Treatment
SSP payments will be recognized as eligible compensation under all benefit plans, as applicable.
284
Appendix B
Part III
E.	Taxes, Personal Allotments
Payments are subject to state and local taxes, Federal Income Tax, Social Security Tax, Medicare Tax, and any state disability deductions at the time of payment. Union dues will be deducted. Employees with 401(k) pre-tax elections will not have State or Federal Income Taxes deducted from that portion.
Personal allotments such as United Way contributions will not be made.
F.	Dispute Resolution
Company determination under this plan shall be final and binding. The Union may present grievances relating to matters covered by the SSP, but neither the plan nor its administration shall be subject to arbitration.

Part I
CALL SAMPLING
(Except Large Business, CPE, Consumer Services, Finance, Operator Services and Small Business Services)
Sampling of service, used in the spirit of trust and respect, is a valuable tool to enhance customer service. To assure courteous treatment, accurate information and superior service, customer calls may be monitored to assist in the training, development and evaluation of employees, the identification of customer needs and to evaluate products and service.
Individual Call Sampling
Individual call sampling will not be used to harass an individual or group of employees, nor will it be used to create an atmosphere of pressure in the work environment. In departments where such sampling is conducted, trained Company management observers will perform it. When individual call sampling, defined as sampling which targets or is directed at a specific employee, takes place, employees will be given prior notification the day sampling occurs. Each employee will have the option of side-by-side or remote call sampling. All remote, individual call sampling will be taken from within the general work area, defined as the same building, of the employee being observed and a light turned on when individual, remote call sampling is being conducted.
Feedback of all calls sampled will be provided to the employee by the end of the day in which the calls were observed, unless prevented by employee initiated absence. Such feedback should be constructive, with emphasis on the positive aspects of the employee’s performance. Feedback may be conducted away from the employee’s workstation. Any time the feedback discussion is expected to include information which may require extensive dialog between the observer and the employee, arrangements should be made to conduct the feedback away from the employee’s workstation. In addition, employees may request that feedback be given in a remote location.
286
Appendix C
Part I
Process Call Sampling
Process call sampling, defined as any sampling other than individual call sampling, may be done from remote locations. Since process call sampling is not employee specific, the notification and remote/side-by-side option associated with individual call sampling will not be provided. Employees will not be evaluated or appraised on process call samplings.
Results of process call samples will normally only be provided at the work unit level except for gross customer abuse, fraud, and violation of secrecy of communications. Employees may request individual feedback, if available, by advising their supervisor. The Company shall remove any details which would allow identification of individual employees from official observing reports.
Employees will not be disciplined as a result of process call sampling on the 1st occurrence. If, within 18 months, subsequent incidents of gross customer abuse, fraud, or violation of secrecy of communications are observed and the employee can be identified, it will be formally documented and action taken if warranted.
The Company will continue to comply with any applicable laws regarding service monitoring or observation.
General
Personal calls made on either telephones provided for personal use of employees or at employees’ workstations will not be subject to supervisory observing. This is not to be construed as influencing present or future practices as to the making of such calls from employees’ workstations. Speaker phones will be prohibited. Test calls will be for diagnostic purposes only.
This agreement does not restrict the Union’s right of representation, including the processing of grievances and engaging in arbitration.

EASY TIME
Consumer Services and Consumer Collections in Finance
This agreement between the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and BellSouth Telecommunications (BST) outlines the understanding reached by the parties in regard to the implementation of Easy Time (ET).
This agreement allows the ET plan to cover all Service Representatives, Sales Associates, Sales Consultants and Office Assistants in Consumer and Consumer Collections Representatives and Consumer Collections Office Assistants in Finance.
Purpose of Easy Time:
Provide employees with greater flexibility and control of time off needed as a result of personal and/or family obligations.
Guidelines:
•	Fifteen-minute increments of time, up to two full vacation days,
are available to employees for personal and/or family obligations.
•	Only one vacation day may be utilized as Easy Time during the first quarter of the calendar year.
•	An increment may be taken provided not more than 25% of the work group has already been granted time off. In the event more than 25% of the work group is scheduled off, then the time may be granted consistent with the needs of the business.
•	Employee will advise supervisor or in-charge personnel that ET is needed. No justification is required.
•	Holidays, the day following a Holiday, Saturdays and Mondays are not available for ET use.
291
Appendix C
Part IV
•	ET can be used after the fact, but the employee MUST notify the supervisor or in-charge personnel during the first session of the scheduled tour and the 25% rule will still apply.
•	ET is not an option available for use for the employee’s personal illness.
•	Employees will be required to identify the scheduled vacation day from which ET will be deducted. Once a whole day is broken with ET, that day must be used in its entirety before another day is broken.
•	ET cannot be denied (except for the limits of the 25% rule) and no reason has to be given by the employee for ET. Other time off could be denied due to service requirements, while ET was granted. If other time off is unavailable, the request can be changed to ET and may be granted subject to the 25% rule.
Omission:
The parties have attempted to include all issues associated with the Easy Time (ET) program. To the extent a situation arises that was not contemplated by the parties, it is agreed to initiate discussion at the Executive Level in an effort to resolve such matters.
Duration:
Easy Time will continue for the life of the 2015 Working Agreement.

FLEXIBLE VACATION DAYS
Dear Mr. Fahrenholt:
During bargaining, we had lengthy discussions regarding the need for employees to have more flexibility in taking time off to handle personal obligations. It is the Company’s intent to allow the business units the ability to grant more contractual time to be used flexibly when the business allows.
The business unit will determine the number of vacation days that can be used flexibly each year, above the current contractual provisions, prior to the vacation selection period. Since flextime may be different between business units, an employee leaving a work group shall be permitted to take the remainder of a partial day on the originally scheduled day. The business unit will provide the guidelines to employees for taking the flexible time.

INCENTIVE PLANS
The Company may implement incentive plans linked to sales, service, productivity and/or other business related standards set by lines of business or business units.
The plan is designed and can be implemented for employees within an organization, based on individual or team results.
The payments may be paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually. The incentive compensation is subject to state and local taxes, federal income and social security taxes in effect at the time of payment. Personal allotments will not be made. Deductions for Union dues will be made from incentive payments as authorized by the employee and the Union.
During the development of an incentive plan, the Company will meet with the Union at the Executive Level and provide the Union with an opportunity to have input concerning the terms of the plan. The Company reserves the right to amend, modify or discontinue any incentive plan with 30 days advance notification to the Union at the Executive Level.
The Union may only grieve, or otherwise challenge, general disputes that arise over the Company’s enforcement of the terms of an incentive plan. A general dispute is one that involves a plan enforcement issue that commonly affects all employees (as opposed to individual employees) who participate in the same incentive plan. General disputes may not be brought over differences that may exist in the treatment of employees who participate in different incentive plans.
General disputes will be grieved at the Executive Level. Grievances that are not resolved at the Executive Level may be appealed by the Union to full arbitration.

A.	In no event will any employee’s sales results be used to adversely affect consideration given that employee for possible transfer or promotion to jobs in which selling is not fundamentally involved.
B.	Grievances arising under the provisions of this Appendix will be subject to the full grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the Agreement.
C.	It is recognized that sales results may vary according to sales ability, training, and opportunity, therefore, results secured by employees who do not have selling as a fundamental part of their job duties, will not affect their conditions of employment.

SERVICE OBSERVING
(Consumer Services, Finance and Small Business Services)
Service observing, used in the spirit of trust and respect, is a valuable tool to enhance customer service. To assure courteous treatment, accurate information and superior service, customer calls may be observed to assist in the training and development of employees, the identification of customer needs and to evaluate products and service.
Service observing will be used for non-evaluative purposes. It will not be used to harass an individual or group of employees, nor will it be used to create an atmosphere of pressure in the work environment. Feedback of all calls observed will be provided to the employee by the end of the next business day, unless prevented by employee-initiated absence. Supervisors will provide developmental feedback on no more than twenty-five (25) remote observations monthly for any individual employee. Such feedback will be constructive with emphasis on the positive aspects of the employee’s performance. Feedback may be conducted away from the employee’s workstation. Any time the feedback discussion is expected to include information which may require extensive dialog between the observer and the employee, arrangements should be made to conduct the feedback away from the employee’s workstation.
When service observing uncovers any incident of gross customer abuse, fraud, non-compliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements, or violation of secrecy of communications, action may result. Employees will not be disciplined for customer abuse, noncompliance with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements or violation of secrecy of communications on the first occurrence. If action is taken as a result of remote service observing, appropriate documentation of the incident is necessary to support the action administered.
302
Appendix C
Part XIII
General
The Company will comply with any applicable laws regarding service observing.
Personal calls made on either telephones provided for personal use of employees or at employee’s workstation will not be subject to supervisory observing. This is not to be construed as influencing present or future practices as to the making of such calls from employees’ workstations.
This agreement does not restrict the Union’s right of representation, including the processing of grievances and engaging in arbitration.

SERVICE REQUIREMENTS
Dear Mr. Fahrenholt:
During 2001 bargaining, the CWA expressed concern that some managers continue to use the term "service requirements" in administering various sections of the Working Agreement. The CWA felt that some managers were too restrictive in scheduling and granting time off and were incorrectly using service requirements as the reason. The Company and the CWA also discussed the need to continue to provide our customers with excellent service and are fully aware that good customer service is an important competitive advantage to our Company.
The Company recognizes the need for our managers to exercise "service requirements" in a spirit of good faith. While service to our customers is more important than ever, we must carefully consider the needs of our employees and the economical operation of the business before invoking "service requirements".

TELECOMMUTING
The Company and the Union recognize the challenge that each employee faces as workplace demands, career objectives, family needs and personal goals compete for time and attention. Telecommuting is a possible resource to help meet those challenges as well as addressing environmental concerns. In addition, telecommuting affords the Company the opportunity to demonstrate to its current and potential customers the benefits of adopting new and evolving technologies, including remote worker applications.
Telecommuting is an alternative work arrangement that may provide increased flexibility where work content does not require that a particular job function be done totally at a specific job site. The criteria for telecommuting will be developed by the Company and the Union at the Executive Level prior to implementation.
The selections of employees who volunteer for telecommuting opportunities will be by seniority if all criteria qualifications are equal and the necessary qualifications of the individuals are equal. Employees or the Company may opt out of a telecommuting work arrangement after 30 days or immediately in emergency situations.

DIESEL MAINTENANCE
AIR DRYER MAINTENANCE
During 1992 Bargaining, the Company and the Union discussed the contracting out of diesel maintenance and air dryer maintenance work in the Network organization. The Union stated that this work was performed by bargaining unit employees prior to being contracted out, and that it should again be brought into the bargaining unit.
The Company agrees to discontinue the contracting out of this work, and will begin performing it with bargaining unit employees. The Union recognizes that this will occur over a reasonable transition period.
It is acknowledged that the type of work agreed to is routine maintenance (including preventive maintenance), as opposed to major repair and/or overhaul of the equipment and machinery. Any major repair or overhaul will continue to be contracted out.

Dear Mr. Fahrenholt:
During 1998 Bargaining, the parties agreed to move certain “wire work” functions that were performed by BellSouth Telecommunications (“BST”) WS 31 Services Technicians to the Utility Operations bargaining unit.

Leveraged Compensation
LEVERAGED COMPENSATION
The Company and the Union recognize the importance of linking performance with compensation in today’s competitive marketplace. It is the intent of this document to allow the Company to create leveraged compensation plans, consisting of base pay and incentive pay, to ensure compensation is commensurate with sales results in the Consumer and Business organizations.
To ensure the Company has sufficient time to accurately assess an employee’s performance, an employee on a leveraged compensation plan will be considered probationary until nine (9) months of service has been achieved. If an employee on a leveraged compensation plan with less than nine (9) months of service is suspended or discharged, a charge the suspension or discharge was without just cause will be subject to the full grievance procedure set forth in Article 21, but will not be subject to arbitration.
Compensation
1.	The top rate of the base wages for leveraged compensation plans will be at least 60% of the top rate of current titles performing like functions.
2.	Incentive pay may be based on multiple performance measures and calculated individually or collectively on those measures.
3.	Incentives are paid based on actual attainment of objectives. The objectives will be assigned by management. Incentives may be paid on, but not limited to, one or more of the following components:
-	Sales Performance
-	Customer Satisfaction
-	Customer Retention
-	Productivity
-	Efficiency

4.	Employees will receive 100% of the Target Incentive amount during initial training and the first 4 weeks following initial training.
5.	Prior to the implementation of the leveraged compensation plan, the Company will meet with the Union to review the terms of the plan. In addition, the Company may establish, modify, amend, suspend, or discontinue the leveraged compensation plan at any time. The Company retains the right to set and modify targets, weights, strategic products, and to establish or change other plan terms.
6.	Base wages will have a 36-month wage schedule with 6 month progression increases within the appropriate wage zone.
7.	The target incentive dollar amount will be the same for all wage zones. The dollar basis upon which target incentives are initially created may be adjusted. Annually, the target incentive amount will be increased in accordance with the general wage increases.
8.	Incentive pay plans will be capped at 300% of target incentive. Employees will be eligible for incentive pay once they exceed 50% of their established targets.
9.	Existing temporary and/or term employees performing the same/similar functions as employees on leveraged compensation plans may voluntarily request to move to the leveraged compensation plan at any time during their temporary and/or term assignment; however, they will not be moved involuntarily. If their request is granted, they will be converted to regular full time and placed on a base wage step with no loss of pay, unless their current wage exceeds the new leveraged compensation base wage maximum, in which case, they will be placed at the top of the leveraged compensation plan base wage. Such employees will not be permitted to return to their former compensation plan.
10.	Current regular employees performing like functions within the same work group can elect to move to the leveraged compensation plan, and placed on a base wage step with no loss of pay, unless their current wage exceeds the new leveraged compensation base

In addition, on a onetime basis, and at an employee's request, the Company will return the employee to the former compensation plan within six months of the movement to the leveraged compensation plan.
11.	If a work group contains employees on both leveraged and nonleveraged compensation who perform the same functions and a surplus is declared, the employees will be treated as one for force adjustment purposes.
12.	Employees covered by the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan - Southeast Program who move to a leveraged compensation plan will have their pension calculated using the pension band that would be applicable to other employees performing like functions in the same wage zone.
13.	The Company agrees to meet with the Union and bargain to agreement prior to establishing and implementing a leveraged compensation plan for titles other than those with the same or similar job duties as Sales Associate.
Leveraged Compensation Committee
It is the Company’s intent to communicate to the Union the contents of leveraged compensation plans. It is also the Company’s intent to limit changes in such plans to those required for competitive or business reasons as determined by the Company. While the highly competitive and dynamic nature of the Company’s business does not allow the Company to commit to a limitation in plan changes, it is the Company’s intent that any changes to leveraged compensation plans will be made in a manner that fairly recognizes both the contribution of the employees and the desire of the Company to outperform its competitors. The Company will provide to the Union a copy of the leveraged compensation plans. Further, it is the Company’s intent to provide, whenever practicable, at least one (1) week’s advance notice to the CWA prior to its notice to employees related to any such changes.
356

This committee will consist of no more than two representatives each, unless mutually agreed otherwise. The meeting place and time will be by mutual agreement. Travel expenses will be paid by each party. Normal meeting time should consist of one-day sessions not requiring an overnight stay.

Contracting of Work in the CPE Marketplace
CONTRACTING OF WORK IN THE CPE MARKETPLACE
Dear Mr. Fahrenholt:
There was extensive discussion during bargaining regarding the contracting of work. The CWA expressed strong concern that contracting work would result in the diminution, or at best, no growth of the bargaining unit. Moreover, the Union adhered firmly to their position that corporate communication services for BellSouth Telecommunications be performed by bargaining unit employees.
The Company recognizes these concerns; however, due to various reasons such as the changing CPE market, economic conditions, and business consideration, it is not possible to make specific commitments on contracting out work elements of the business. However, we did agree to continue the language that insures the contracting of any work will not result in the lay-off or part-timing of bargaining unit employees. Furthermore, the Company agreed that during the life of the Agreement it will not contract out corporate communication services in BellSouth Telecommunications facilities.
Finally, it is the Company’s objective in making decisions regarding the contracting of work to carefully consider the interests of customers, the concern of employees as to its effect on them, and other considerations essential to the success of BCS.

Drug Testing - CPE
DRUG TESTING CPE Only
Dear Mr. Fahrenholt:
In today's business environment there is an increasing demand from prospective customers that vendor service employees submit to random drug testing.
During 1998 Bargaining, the Union and the Company had lengthy discussions around this issue. The Union expressed considerable concern as to the impact on the employees that the CWA represents.
Subsequently, it was agreed by the Union and the Company that customer requirements for random drug testing would be followed if the requirements were a condition for all vendors. Additionally, the Company agreed to obtain exception to these customer drug testing requirements whenever possible.

Employee Development - CPE
EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT -- CPE Only
Dear Mr. Fahrenholt:
There was considerable discussion during bargaining regarding the subject of achieving our growth aspirations through a close partnership with the CWA. One of the more critical areas of that partnership is the training and retention of highly skilled data technicians. In today's data-centric marketplace, demand for advanced skills is intense. As BellSouth and CWA partner in our quest to become the industry's foremost data provider, we must be aggressive in our efforts to realize a return on our training investment.
Therefore, to maximize our investment for our Customers, Employees and Shareholders, we have agreed to the following retention provisions:
•	The Company has a modernized data-training curriculum that, upon successful completion, will provide our employees with the certifications and other training required to master the rapidly escalating technology challenges.
•	We will continue a 24-month non-promotional transfer restriction for employees who complete the curriculum. This provision will restrict movement to other Departments and entities for lateral or downward movement only.
•	We will continue an investment-recovery provision that gives the Company the right to recover the data curriculum training expenses, or appropriate prorated portions of the expenses, in the event an employee voluntarily leaves BellSouth within 24 months following successful completion of the curriculum. Such recovery is the sole responsibility of the Company.
The Company and the Union committed to work together on the implementation of the program. Together we can make this critical initiative a success.

Equalization of Premium Pay Work Opportunity.
1.	Overtime shall be assigned to those who desire to work insofar as practicable. Dedicated employees, assigned technicians and back-up technicians, may be offered connecting or non-connecting overtime on their assigned customer accounts without regard to the amount of overtime worked by other members of their work group. The Company will attempt to contact them prior to contacting a stand-by technician or another member of their work group.
2.	The allocation of non-scheduled, non-connecting overtime for: Communications Technician, Repair Service Attendant, Service Representative, Systems Specialist Technician and Systems Technician will be on the following basis:
a. The overtime equalization report for work groups/units will be posted at the same location as the employee’s vacation schedule. This list will be used for any overtime assignments worked during the two (2) week period starting at midnight on the Saturday following the close of each payroll period. The report will run for twelve (12) week periods and then begin anew.
(1)	The overtime report will show for each employee, his/her name and the cumulative total of overtime hours worked during the elapsed portion of a twelve (12) week period. The twelve (12) week period shall begin on the first day of a payroll period and conclude at the end of the twelfth week (sixth payroll period). Such twelve (12) week periods shall run consecutively. At the start of each twelve (12) week period the overtime report will begin anew. Employees entering a new work unit (either temporarily or permanently) will be credited with an average of the cumulative hours accrued by the members of that work unit as shown on the current overtime report.

(a)	If two (2) or more employees in the work unit worked the same number of overtime hours, such employees will be grouped and listed in inverse order of their seniority.
(b)	Overtime hours worked during the work day at a temporary location will be recorded on the overtime report for the temporary location as well as the home location.
(c)	Employees who do not desire overtime must notify their supervisors in writing. This notification shall be indicated by an asterisk on the report and shall remain in effect until canceled in writing. The initial notification and the subsequent cancellation must be received at least one week prior to the posting of the overtime report.
b.	Non-scheduled, non-connecting overtime will be offered to available qualified employees in the work unit, excluding those who do not desire overtime, in the inverse order of overtime hours worked during the previous period. In work units where a stand-by technician has been designated as described in Customer Markets Addendum, Stand-by Technician - CPE, overtime will first be offered to the available qualified employee lowest on the current overtime report, next to the second lowest available qualified employee on the current overtime report, and then to the stand-by technician.
c.	When an employee declines, after being offered a nonscheduled, non-connecting overtime assignment, the next qualified employee on the overtime report, omitting those who do not desire overtime, will be contacted. This procedure will be followed until someone accepts or all available qualified employees in the unit have been contacted and offered the assignment. Should all available qualified employees in the unit decline, the overtime will be assigned to the employee lowest in seniority and qualified, including those who do not

desire overtime, unless the employee has a valid personal reason for not accepting the assignment or unless the employee has already worked twelve (12) hours of overtime in the current week.
d.	When all available qualified employees in a given unit are needed to perform non-scheduled, non-connecting overtime work, such employees, including those who do not desire overtime, will be so advised when they are initially contacted. In this event, they will be expected to accept the overtime assignment unless they have a valid personal reason for declining.
e.	When a supervisor fails to offer non-scheduled, nonconnecting overtime to available qualified employees in the inverse order listed on the report and offers the assignment to another employee or employees, the by-passed available qualified employees will be paid a penalty of four (4) hours pay at the overtime rate. This penalty pay shall be due only if the employee was available and qualified, but was not offered the call-out. The number of employees who are due penalty pay under this section shall not exceed the number of employees who erroneously worked the overtime assignment. Penalty payments due under this section are to be reported the next work day following the date the employee, or the Union, and the supervisor agree that penalty pay is due the by-passed employee. Such penalty pay hours will not be included in determining the equivalent of five (5) normal tours in computing weekly overtime.
f.	Under this procedure an employee may be offered nonscheduled, non-connecting overtime without regard to his/her position on the overtime report if he/she has been working on such assignment to the extent that it could be completed in an economical manner.
