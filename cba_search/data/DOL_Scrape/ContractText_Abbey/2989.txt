3.	If all of the above factors are equal, the date permanent status in County service is achieved shall be determinative.
4.	If all of the above are equal, date of certification for appointment shall be determinative.
5.2.5.	Exceptions
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the appointing authority determines that the public interest will not be served by application of the above criteria, the appointing authority may depart there from on the basis of a clearly demonstrable superiority in performance and/or qualifications. In such case, the appointing authority shall notify the employee to be laid off, in writing, specifying the basis for such determination in detail. The employee, may within five (5) working days thereafter, appeal the determination to the Personnel Commission who shall hold a hearing within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the appeal and who shall thereafter make a decision within five (5) days and that decision shall be final.

2.	Such vote is by secret ballot;
3.	Such vote may be taken at anytime during the term of this agreement, but in no event shall there be more than one vote taken during this period.
4.	All employees holding probationary or regular status in classifications included in the Units, on the last day of the pay period thirty (30) days prior to the holding of the election, shall be eligible to vote in a certification or a decertification election.
5.	The ballot shall reflect a choice with the following wording: "I vote in favor of agency shop/fee"; or "I vote against agency shop/fee".
