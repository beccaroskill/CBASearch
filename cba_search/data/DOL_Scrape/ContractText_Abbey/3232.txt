A.	Faculty Members are responsible for maintaining high professional standards of scholarship and instruction in their field of special competence.

The commitment to academic freedom in the conduct of research does not imply that a Faculty Member's research is not subject to critical review and judgment as to its quality and significance. When speaking and acting as citizens, Faculty Members shall take suitable precaution to assure that personal utterances or actions are not construed as representing the University.
2003-2005 BU7 Agreement
Page 5

B.	Since the performance of teaching duties, research, and service extends beyond classroom responsibilities and includes such activities as preparation, student evaluation, syllabus revision, and review of current literature and research in the subject area, such duties cannot be restricted to a fixed amount of time or points in time.
C.	During the interval between semesters and during the spring recess, Faculty Members normally engage in professional activities. However, Faculty Members who do not have duties requiring their presence on campus may travel for personal reasons at their own expense, provided that upon return they report to the Employer the number of days of such travel and provide service for those days at times during the off-duty period.
ARTICLE VI, LEAVES OF ABSENCE WITH PAY
A. SABBATICAL LEAVES
1.	The purpose of the sabbatical leave is to provide Faculty Members with an opportunity for further professional growth and development so that they may serve more effectively on their campuses and in their field of specialization.
2.	Only tenured Faculty Members at Rank 2 or above may be eligible for a sabbatical leave after six (6) years or twelve (12) semesters of full-time creditable service with the University. Any leave of up to thirty (30) days will not constitute a break in service. Credit toward sabbatical leave is computed in units of not less than a full semester for I and C Faculty Members provided that I and C Faculty Members appointed effective on October 1 or February 1 of the respective semesters shall have such semester count as a full semester. All other classifications shall compute service from the most recent date of hire. Full-time creditable service refers to full-time active duty service at the University.	.....
3.	The term of a sabbatical leave shall be for a period of twelve (12) months (usually an academic year) at half
the pay that would have been received had the leave not been taken or six (6) months (a semester) at the same pay that would have been received had the leave not been taken.

4.	Each Faculty Member who receives a sabbatical leave shall agree to return to the University System for service for a period of not less than the period of the sabbatical leave.
5.	Each Faculty Member who applies for a sabbatical leave shall submit through the Chair to the Dean/Director or Chancellor at the Community Colleges, a description or narrative of the educational program, research, or other professional activity to which the Faculty Member proposes to devote the leave, along with the reasons for undertaking such a program while on leave. The Dean/Director shall note a recommendation on each application and shall forward each to the Chancellor at UH-Manoa, UH-Hilo, or UH-West Oahu.
6.	Applications for sabbatical leaves shall be evaluated on the basis of:
a.	The nature of the educational or professional program to be undertaken.
b.	The effect of the applicant's absence on the work of the department or unit and on the operations of the University.
Applications that were previously approved as to item (a) above, but were denied because of item (b) or as a result of budget constraints, shall be given priority.
2003-2005 BU7 Agreement
Page 7
C.
6.	The Faculty Member must agree to return to the University of Hawaii for at least one (1) year thereafter.
7.	In order to give non-instructional Faculty Members an opportunity to attend professional meetings, visit
research centers, or observe field practices while away from the State on vacation leave, the Employer may grant leaves of absence with pay for the period actually devoted to these activities.

2.	If such Faculty Members render less than a month of service, their vacation allowance for such month shall be computed as follows:	
	Actual Days of Service	Working Days of Leave
	1 to 3	0
	4 to 6	1/2
	7 to 9	3/4
	10 to 12	1 full day
	13 to 15	1-1/4 days
	16 to 18	1-1/2 days
	19 or more	1-3/4 days
3.	Faculty Members on the nine (9) month salary schedule are not eligible to earn vacation leave.
4.	Faculty Members on the eleven (11) month salary schedule in the I classification are not eligible to earn
vacation leave.

3)	During any period of valid suspension.
4)	During any period of unauthorized leave.
5)	During any period the Faculty Member is on sabbatical leave or study leave.

11.	Effect of Transfer to Position in Which Vacation Allowance is Not Eamable.
When a Faculty Member is transferred from or otherwise relinquishes one position in which vacation allowance may be earned, and accepts employment in another position in the service of the University in which vacation allowance may not be earned, the Faculty Member may be deemed for purposes of receiving pay in lieu of vacation, to have terminated the Faculty Member's services. But in the event that the Faculty Member is not eligible under the circumstances to receive pay in lieu of vacation, the acceptance of such new employment shall not of itself have the effect of forfeiting any vacation allowance to which the Faculty Member is then entitled. Pay for lapsed vacation in excess of the maximum allowed may be granted only as permitted by law.
12.	Pay for Vacation Allowance upon Termination.
a.	Whenever a termination of services takes place, the Faculty Member is to be paid, in accordance with law for vacation allowance either in lump sum or in the normal manner.
b.	When payment in lump sum is made, the sum payable for vacation allowance shall be equal to the amount of compensation to which the Faculty Member would be entitled or to which the Faculty Member would be allowed during the vacation period if the Faculty Member were permitted to take vacation in the normal manner.
c.	However, if the Faculty Member is immediately rehired by the Employer, and will continue to earn vacation allowance, such payment shall not be made.
13.	A Faculty Member who, pursuant to Federal statutes, is called or ordered and reports either voluntarily or involuntarily for active military duty with a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces shall be deemed to have terminated service for the purposes of this Article. The Faculty Member's choice of lump sum payment for vacation allowance will not of itself cause the forfeiture of unused sick leave credits.
14.	In the event that a vacation request is denied by the Employer, the Faculty Member may ask to be given the reasons in writing.
15.	Faculty Members whose salaries are paid from other than the general revenues of the State of Hawaii or from funds deemed by the Employer to be assured for an indefinite period of time have vacation leave comparable to other C-l 1-month, R, S, B, and A Faculty.

3.	i Temporary appointments! means Faculty Members on Limited Term Contracts, Visiting Faculty, and Lecturers who are not eligible for tenure.
B.	PROBATIONARY PERIOD
1.	Probationary Service.
a.	The probationary period begins when the Faculty Member first holds a tenure track appointment effective on or after July 1 and prior to October 2 of full-time service.
b.	The probationary period ends by the granting of tenure, the refusal of tenure by the Employer, or the non-renewal of appointment.

A positive assessment does not necessarily assure renewal of appointment.
2.	Procedures
The reappointment recommendation form is initiated by the Department/Division Chair. The form will provide for the assessment by the Department/Division Chair and the Department/Division Personnel Committee of the Faculty Member's performance. The form is passed to the Department/Division Personnel Committee which will include its assessment and recommendation with the form and transmit the material to the Chair who will make an assessment and recommendation.

m.	At UH-Manoa, if a department or program has fewer than five (5) eligible4 tenured Faculty Members, who are available (i.e., not on leave of absence) to serve on the DPC, then the Dean or Director may constitute a Faculty Personnel Committee in consultation with the department chair or program director. This ad hoc Faculty Personnel Committee will be made up of all UH-Manoa tenured Faculty with an appointment of .25 FTE or greater in the department or program, and additional tenured Faculty Members from related disciplines.

CHANCELLOR FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES MEMO
CCCM# 2250 July 2001
SUBJECT:	Teaching Assignment Policy
A.	REFERENCES:
1.	University of Hawaii Board of Regents Policy 9.16- Teaching Assignments for Instructional Faculty.
2.	University of Hawaii Administrative Policy on Teaching Assignments for Instructional Faculty, Office of the President, September 1990.
3.	Board of Regents Policy Chapter 9-1 a, Appointments.
4.	Administrative Procedure, A9.235, Administrative Stipends for Department Chairs, Special Program Directors and Chairs of Academic Subdivisions.
B.	PURPOSE:
This CCCM addresses the Community Colleges! implementation of the University of Hawaii Administrative Policy relating to the Board of Regents policy on Teaching Assignments for Instructional Faculty, to delineate the general duties and responsibilities of division/department chairs, to provide for the general criteria by which chairs are to be compensated, and to provide for the general criteria by which assigned time will be determined for chairs to perform their duties and responsibilities.
C.	DEFINITION:
The University of Hawaii Board of Regents has established a standard teaching assignment for full-time Faculty in the Community Colleges as 30 semester credit hours per year (30 SCH/Yr), or equivalent.
The special mission of the Community Colleges has resulted in the establishment of a diverse group of educational programs which, in turn, has resulted in the establishment of equivalencies to the established BOR policy, expressed in terms of weekly class contact hours and student registrations. Class contact hours are defined as 50-minute periods during which Faculty members instruct or supervise groups of students.
At the present time, the following equivalencies to this 30 SCH/Yr standard teaching assignment are being utilized:
For Faculty members teaching science, business and/or basic academic skills classes which require a combination of lectures and laboratory exercises, 18 weekly class contact hours per academic year is equivalent to the standard teaching assignment.
For Faculty members teaching classes in technical/occupational programs, studio art and health and physical education, and/or basic academic skills classes, which require a different combination of lectures and laboratory or shop activities, 23-25 weekly class contact hours per academic year is equivalent to the standard teaching assignment.
For Faculty members teaching classes in Cooperative Education or Work Practicum where students are learning by working in business or industry, following a prearranged sequence of learning activities, 150 student registrations each academic year is equivalent to the standard teaching assignment.
For Faculty teaching under uniquely special circumstances, other equivalencies are defined on a case-by-case basis.
D.	POLICY:
Faculty Responsibilities. The responsibilities of Faculty generally involve two (2) distinct categories of activities, assigned instructional activities, and non-instructional activities.
2003-2005 BU7 Agreement
Page 55
publications; providing expert testimony; providing expert technical assistance to federal, state, and/or county agencies; and other related activities that serve the public.
Allocation of the Standard Teaching Assignment. The duties and responsibilities of full-time Faculty members consist of a combination of instructional and non-instructional activities designed to conform with established Board of Regents policy. The "mix" of these activities may vary from individual to individual.
When the combination of these activities exceed that which is normally expected of an individual Faculty member, the standard teaching or service assignment (30 SCH/Yr, or equivalent) may be reduced.
Appendix 1 details the normal range of semester credit hour equivalencies on a per semester basis which may be assigned to Faculty members for selected non-instructional activities. If special circumstances arise, the Chancellor may request approval from the Chancellor to make modifications to the established range of semester hour equivalencies.
The reduction in the Standard Teaching Assignment is to provide Faculty who have assumed responsibilities beyond the normal expectation the time necessary to meet both their remaining teaching obligations, and the demands of their additional responsibility. Therefore, except for unusual circumstances, an overload payment will not be made in lieu of the teaching assignment reduction.
The amount of teaching assignment reductions may result in less than a full class reduction. The excess credits may be banked for future teaching assignment reductions. The total of banked teaching assignment reductions may not exceed six SCH during any semester. However, at the request of the Faculty member, any banked credits remaining at the end of the academic year may be paid in overload rather than carried over to the following year.
The list of non-instructional activities identified in Appendix 1 and the range of credit hours to be assigned to each may be modified by the Chancellor.	.....
E.	PROCEDURES:
In implementing reductions to the standard teaching assignment, the following will occur:
1.	In those instances where the reduction is made as a consequence of appointment to department or division chair or other to quasi-administrative positions, selection as committee chair, or other assignments described in the categories indicated above, appropriate Community College Policies and Procedures will be invoked to accomplish the reduction. Appendix 2 details the roles, responsibilities and teaching assignment procedures for department/division chairs and discipline coordinators.
2.	In those instances where the reduction is to be made at the request of the Faculty member:
a.	Prior to the semester in which a teaching assignment reduction is to occur, the Faculty member will submit a request for a reduction in the BOR standard assignment for the coming semester through their division chair to the Dean of Instruction or the Dean of Student Services (depending upon the locus of their assignment). Each campus shall establish internal deadlines for the submission of those requests. The form for submitting the request is contained in Appendix 3.
b.	Written department/division standards of performance for Faculty activity, and the above listed equivalencies, as may be modified, will be consulted to determine the teaching assignment.
c.	At the end of the year, each Faculty member who has received a reduction of teaching assignment will submit a report via the department/division chair to the Dean of Instruction or the Dean of Student Services (depending upon the locus of their assignment) in which the contributions in the prior year, as they relate to the time assigned, are described. The form for submitting that report is contained in Appendix 4.
d.	The Chancellor, or designee, will oversee the assignment reduction policies and procedures which are used in their respective college. Appeals for review of an individual Faculty member's teaching assignment may be made to the Chancellor.
3.	At the end of each year, the Chancellor shall send to the Chancellor a listing of all Faculty who have received assigned time using the form in Appendix 5.
2003-2005 BU7 Agreement
Page 57
V. Other Teaching Load Reductions
A Faculty Member who teaches 15 or more SCH* in the Fall 2003 semester and any semester thereafter shall be granted a minimum three SCH teaching assignment reduction in the following semester for activities such as, but not limited to, the following:
1.	curriculum development
2.	curriculum revisions
3.	program development
4.	program revisions
5.	research and development in teaching pedagogy
6.	development of grant or contract proposals
7.	institutional service	.

9.	community service
10.	student mentoring
11.	professional development
12.	mentoring junior Faculty members
In the semester immediately preceding that in which the course reduction will take place, the eligible Faculty Members shall consult with their department or division chair about the nature of the activity they intend to pursue. The purpose of this consultation is to seek alignment between the proposed activity and college or system needs. Following the meeting,, a brief form shall be filed with the department or division chair documenting the agreedfiupon activities.
The amount of teaching assignment reductions may result in less than a full class reduction. The excess credits may be banked for future teaching assignment reductions. The total of banked teaching assignment reductions may not exceed six SCH (Semester Credit Hours*) during any semester.
*SCH = Semester Credit Hours or equivalent contact hours. Equivalent contact hours are used for Faculty whose teaching assignments are calculated by student contact hours or a combination of both credit and contact hours, e.g., food service, nursing, laboratory, and other vocational programs.

Because it is desirable and expedient for the University of Hawaii to provide uniform rules and procedures for the regulation and administration of intellectual property rights generated by the activities of its Faculty, employees and others associated with the University, the following objectives, policies and procedures are established for the University's administration of the Patent and Copyright Policy.
B.	OBJECTIVES
1.

2.	To encourage broad utilization of the results of University research and to provide a vehicle for the transfer of new technology and ideas from the University to the community at large, by permitting exploitation (both commercial and otherwise) in the public interest and for the public benefit, in a manner consistent with the integrity and objectives of the academic process, including the goal of public dissemination of the results of research.
3.	To stimulate innovative and creative scholarship, research and writing and its recognition, by facilitating where appropriate the receipt of fair economic rewards there for in the form of royalty payments to inventors and authors from licensees (in the case of inventions) and publishers (in the case of written or similar works).
4.	To protect and benefit scholars and researchers in the University by promoting recourse to the patenting and copyright process and by providing information, support and liaison concerning the procedures and problems involved therein.
5.	To encourage and assist scholars and researchers in identifying potentially patentable discoveries, to require prompt and early reporting thereof to the President and to promote scholarly publication concerning such discoveries in a manner that does not prejudice the obtaining of a patent.
6.	To devise and promulgate clear and practicable regulations, procedures and forms for the reporting and disclosure of original works that may be copyrightable, discoveries that may prove patentable and the timely prosecution of patent applications in appropriate cases.
7.	To provide for the patenting or licensing or both of any invention or the copyrighting and licensing or both of
any work, where appropriate, through the President or a patent management organization or publishing entity designated by that Committee.
8.	To protect the rights, as agreed, of any government or private sponsor of research in any invention or work that may be generated by such research, and to ensure compliance with the other terms of any such research grant.
9.	To protect the rights of the University in inventions or other original works which result from the use of University funds or facilities by Faculty, employees, students or trainees.
2003-2005 BU7 Agreement
Page 89
4.10 To do all things necessary to achieve the objects of the Patent and Copyright Policy, without being limited by the specific powers and duties enumerated above.
5. Appeals from Decisions ofPCC:
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the PCC may appeal to the President of the University or his designated representative. Such appeal shall be in writing, shall state the grounds of appeal and shall be submitted to the President or such representative within THIRTY (30) days after notification of the ruling of the Committee. The decision of the President or his designee shall be final and binding.
D. PATENTS
1.	When University has Exclusive Patent Rights:
Subject to the provisions of the Policy with respect to relinquishment of rights and royalty sharing, the University shall have exclusive patent rights and title in and to any invention or discovery which emerges from any research, development or other program funded by the University, or is conceived or developed wholly or partially at the expense of the University or with the aid of its equipment, facilities or personnel.
2.	When Inventor has Exclusive Patent Rights:
