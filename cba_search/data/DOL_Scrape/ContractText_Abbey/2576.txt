ARTICLE 1	RECOGNITION

The Employer recognizes and acknowledges that the Union is the exclusive representative in collective bargaining with the Employer for all its employees in the operating, maintenance, and repair of equipment used at the Employer's Portable Plant crushing sites, in the State of
1
Michigan. It shall be a condition of employment that all employees of the Employer covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union in good standing on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing and those who are not members on the effective date of this Agreement shall, on the seventh (7th) day following the effective date of this Agreement, become and remain members in good standing in the Union. It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after its effective date shall, on the seventh (7th) day following the beginning of such employment become and remain members in good standing in the Union.
The Employer shall not be obligated hereunder to discharge or discriminate against any employee for nonmembership in the Union:
1.	If the Employer has reasonable grounds for believing that such membership was not available to the employee on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members; or
2.	If the Employer has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership; and
2
3.	Unless the Employer shall be furnished with a notice in writing by the Union, signed by the proper officers, setting forth that the employee has refused to join the Union, although he has been offered membership on the same terms as other members, or that the employee's membership in the Union has been terminated for reason of nonpayment of periodic dues or initiation fees, and that the Union requests that said employee be discharged for one of the above reasons.
