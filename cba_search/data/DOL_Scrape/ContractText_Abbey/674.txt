A Special Message from C. James Lowthers, President, UFCWLocal 400
In our union’s negotiation with the management of Giant, we were able to achieve affordable health care and other terms and conditions of employment which are important to our members and
u their families. As we all know, these are very challenging times for all unions because of the high cost of healthcare. This collective bargaining agreement clarifies exactly what you are entitled to as a Giant employee and assures that management will not infringe upon any of your established rights. We are proud of the agreement; as in past contracts we have negotiated, and believe that it will serve the long term interests of our membership.
Keep in mind that when Local 400 negotiates a contract, our members set the priorities. Before bargaining begins, our professional team of negotiators listen to what you want in a new contract; every job classification is heard from. The fact that our bargaining proposals reflect your input is important to management—they know our side of the table is expressing the collective needs and concerns of their employees.
As the largest local union in the nation, Local 400 has the clout and resources to provide our members with expert, experienced representation, both on the job and during
1
contract negotiations. Before we make a proposal, it is extensively researched and documented, to ensure that the contract provision we win is the best obtainable.
The membership of Local 400 at Giant stood together and achieved the best contract possible. As we are challenged in the future, I am sure that we will continue to successfully accomplish our mission to better the lives of our members and their families.
In solidarity,
C/flames Lowthers
ident, UFCW Local 400

Collective Bargaining Agreement — How It Works
When you join a union, you gain the right to have a voice in decisions about your work life — wages, benefits and career. The negotiation process allows your representatives at Local 400 to bring to management the issues that are most important to you.
Bargaining is compromise. Neither the union nor management gets everything they want.
How do union negotiators know what issues are most important to the membership? You tell us! Before bargaining begins, the union surveys all members in the bargaining unit to determine priorities. An employee advisory committee provides a constant check for the bargaining team.
In addition, Local 400 representatives and shop stewards are in the facilities almost every day, speaking to members about grievances, problems and needs. They have a hands-on sense of what the problems are.
Our research department monitors trends in the industries where we bargain, looking at wage and benefit settlements. We have a good idea what is transpiring around the country, which means our negotiators can cite examples elsewhere to support our bargaining goals.
When the give-and-take of contract negotiations is finished, management presents its final
3
offer. The union brings that offer to the mem-
bership. All contracts are approved or rejected by majority vote of those attending the meeting from the bargaining unit.
Benefits
Local 400’s aggressive organizing activities in the Washington Metropolitan area and throughout its jurisdiction have given us the strength to negotiate good salaries for our members. But we know you have concerns that go beyond your weekly paycheck — and that’s why the benefit’s package in this contract is so important to you and your family. This extensive total compensation package, one of the best in the industry, is also made possible by the strength of your union at the bargaining table. A prime example is your health care package, which is mostly funded by Giant.
You’ll also find that your health care package includes some very special benefits that can prove invaluable to you, such as:
Medical/Hospitalization
Optical benefits
Dental Care
4
Prescription drugs at low-cost
Employee Assistance Program for counseling in family problems, retirement planning, stress, obesity, smoking cessation, etc.
In addition to your health care package, this contract provides a paid vacation schedule, paid personal days to attend to family matters, and a life insurance plan.
And keep in mind you are eligible for these benefits as both a full-time and part-time Local 400 member at Giant. (In some instances, eligibility may depend upon individual qualifications under the collective bargaining agreement).
Paid Vacations
A paid vacation is something that is an outright necessity to every worker in America. To assure that your qual

ity of life is continually up to par, you need paid time off to go to the beach, to visit relatives in other parts of the country, or just to break the everyday routine of the workplace. This is exactly why we have negotiated an extensive vacation schedule for every full-time and part-time Local 400
member at Giant. Depending on your seniority with the company, you can be eligible for up to five (5) weeks of paid vacation time per year. (Article 11)
5
Personal Days
Vacation days are of great help, however, for meeting medical appointments and attending to family-related matters, in addition to your regular vacation schedule, we have negotiated a number of “personal days” which you can use for any purpose that you choose. Depending on your status (full time or part time) with the company you are eligible for up to five (5) of these days off a year.
(Article 12.2 and Appendix I)
Holidays
Holidays are perhaps the best means to spend time with your family members and friends. Throughout the year, you will be paid for the following days:
(Article 12.1 and Appendix I)
New Year’s Day
Labor Day
Memorial Day
Thanksgiving Day
Independence Day
Christmas Day
To assure that you do not miss out on a paid holiday, we have made it possible that when a holiday falls during an employee’s va
6
cation, you shall be given another day off during the week or you will receive an additional day’s pay. (Article 11.5)
Funeral Leave
If the unfortunate occurrence arises where you lose an immediate family member, Local 400 has made certain that you will receive time off to grieve and attend the funeral. You will be given up to three (3) days of leave with pay to take care of such matters. (Article 13.2,13.3)
Leaves of Absence
Very often an employee may need to leave the workplace for an extended period of time to attend to personal affairs or health matters. As a Local 400 member at Giant, you are eligible to take a leave of absence without pay if you so choose. If this does occur, we have assured tliat you will NOT lose any of the seniority you have accrued. (Article 13)
Sick Leave Benefits
Times of illness and disability are, needless to say, very unpleasant. Whether you treat your illness at home or in the hospital, Local 400 has arranged for a sick leave plan that will make the experi-j ence as easy as pos-/ sible. (In some in
7
stances, eligibility may depend upon individual qualifications under the collective bargaining agreement.) Under several plans offered through the contract you may be entitled to between 16 and 39 weeks of paid disability. (Article 17, and Plan I and Plan X FELKA and UFCW Health & Welfare booklets)
Retirement Plan
After dedicating yourself to Giant, you deserve a generous compensation plan so that you may spend your latter years in comfort and security. Local 400 has therefore negotiated a valuable retirement plan to fulfill your needs after your departure from the working world. As your seniority advances in your years at Giant, you are credited with an ever-increasing retirement benefit. (Article 18 FELRA and UFCW Pension Plan booklet)
Of special interest to you, in this mobile world of ours where workers move around a lot, is pension portability. Local 400 has arranged for pension reciprocity with other plans in the Washington Metropolitan area, as well as the Atlanta, Philadelphia, and the UFCW International Union-Industry Pension plans.
Life Insurance
To guarantee that you have life insurance as a Local 400 member at Giant, you are eligible for life insurance coverage through the
8
FELRA and UFCW Health & Welfare Fund. (In some instances, eligibility may depend upon individual qualifications under the collective bargaining agreement.) (FELRA and UFCW Health & Welfare plan booklet)
Protections
Providing outstanding wages, vacation time, and insurance are only a part of what Local 400 does for its members. We also have negotiated with the company to guarantee that a certain level of respect, safety, and security are provided for every single one of our members. The guidelines of our contract assure that Giant will provide a safe working environment, a reasonable working schedule, overtime wages, and a seniority system that establishes certain rights for employees. Local 400 realizes that these issues are very important to each and every union member. That is exactly why we have worked to provide a contract that protects the welfare of our members.
Grievances and Arbitration
This contract is a guarantee of rights and benefits the union has negotiated on your behalf. Still, in any workplace situation, events can occur that affect you adversely, and they may be in violation of the contract. Grievances may be filed and you and your representative can meet with management so that your problem can be reviewed and to assure you are treated fairly. Let your union repre
9
sensitive know about it, so that your problem can be reviewed and necessary grievance action be recommended. (Article 21)
Seniority
Local 400 recognizes that loyal, experienced. and long-standing employees are very valuable to a company. We subsequently have bargained for increasingly better benefits, wages, and protection for employees who have the most seniority with Giant. As you accrue more seniority, you become eligible for additional vacation time, a higher salary, and have a greater chance for being promoted within the company. Those who have dedicated their lives to working for Giant deserve to be duly rewarded. Our seniority system assures that this occurs. (Article 5 )
Working Conditions
Without a safe and comfortable work environment, it is virtually impossible for an employee to fulfill his job duties in a productive manner. According to our collective bargaining agreement, Giant has the responsibility to provide working conditions that are in full compliance with requirements set forth in the contract. Experts within our union actively monitor the work site to ensure that all rules and regulations are being followed. If Local 400 observes that your health and safety are in danger, the proper authorities are notified and action is taken. (Article 10)
10
Overtime
In order to spend time with your family and pursue recreational hobbies, you need to maintain a reason-able work schedule, If such a need arises 1 when you are called	HVa »©• ,-S
to work more than 1 raY’j eight (8) hours in a	''
day or forty (40) hours in a week however, J/’ffl you will be paid the ap-propriate overtime rate applicable to your date of hire. If it also becomes necessary for a full-time employee to work past 6.00 p.m. more than three (3) nights in any week, you will be paid overtime wages for hours after 6:00 p.m. on the fourth and following nights. Local 400 has also assured that no employee will have to work split shifts. (Article 6)
Jury Duty
Jury Duty is a responsibility that every American citizen may eventually have to fulfill. Very often court cases run weeks or months at a time and it is likely you will miss a substantial amount of work. Local 400 has made it possible for you to serve your community in this manner without financial penalty. You will be granted time off and paid the difference between the amount of your regular rate of pay and the amount received for your jury duty. (Article 14)
11
Legal Services
Given the ever-increasing costs of legal services, Local 400 has arranged for a legal benefit trust fund for most of our members. These services may be used to provide additional security for you and your family. The benefit is paid for by your employer and the legal services provided are for the most part at no cost Lu you. (Article 17 and UFCW and FELRA Health and Welfare Plan booklet)

AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT, made and entered into this 28th day of March , 2004, between GIANT FOOD LLC (hereinafter referred to as the “Employer”), a participating member of Washington, D.C. Food Employers’ Labor Relations Association (hereinafter referred to as “Employers’ Council”) and the UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION, LOCAL 400 of Washington, D.C. chartered by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, AFL-CIO (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”).
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the Employers’ Council is an employer association of food chains in and about the Washington, D.C. area.
WHEREAS, the Employer and the Union in the performance of this Agreement agree not to discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religious creed, origin, age or sex.
The use of personal pronouns of the male gender is for grammatical purposes only and the contract should apply equally to persons of either gender; and
WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to establish uniform standards and hours of labor, rates of pay, and other conditions under which the employees classified herein shall work for the Employer during the life of this Agreement and
19
thereby promote a relationship between the parties hereto providing for more harmonious and efficient cooperation and mutual benefit.
ARTICLE 1
Successors and Assigns
1.1	This Agreement shall he binding on all signatories hereto, and their successors and as signs, whether such status is created by sale, lease, assignment or any other type of transfer or transaction. In consideration of the Union’s execution of this Agreement, the Employer promises that its operations covered by this Agreement or any part thereof shall not be sold, conveyed or otherwise transferred or assigned to any successor without first securing the Agreement of the successor to assume the Employer’s obligations under this Agreement and to offer employment subject to the terms of this Agreement, to all of the Employer’s then current employees, recognizing their accrued seniority for all purposes. Provided, that the Employer shall not be a guarantor or be held liable for any breach by the successor or assignee of its obligations, and the Union will look exclusively to the successor or assignee for compliance with the terms of this Agreement.
1.2	The foregoing shall be applicable in cases only where the Employer sells or transfers more than ten percent (10%) of the facilities covered under this Agreement, and shall not apply in cases of store closing (30 days or more).
20
ARTICLE 2 Management Authority
2.1	The authority and responsibility for management of the business, including but not limited to the planning, direction and control of the work force shall repose exclusively in the Employer and its appointed representatives except as provided in this Agreement.
2.2	In the event that the Employer contemplates the introduction of major technological changes affecting bargaining unit work within the Grocery Department, advance notice of such changes will be given to the Union. If requested to do so, the Employer will meet with the Union to discuss the implementation of such changes before putting such changes into effect.
2.3	Should the Employer intend to substitute electronic checkout systems for existing equipment in any store, the Employer agrees to notify the Union in advance and to provide the Union a list of all employees regularly assigned to the store on the effective date of the utilization of said systems. Said employees shall not be removed from the Employer’s payroll as a result of the installation of such a system. Employees may continue to be transferred, assigned to other work, or laid off in accordance with the seniority provisions of this Agreement provided the layoff is for reasons other than the installation of such a system.
2.4	The Employer further agrees that all fresh meat products will be cut, packaged, prepared and sold by the employees in the stores, covered by this Agreement.
21
Exceptions may be made provided the Union is notified in advance and given written assurance that no member’s job will be eliminated as a result of such exception. The Union agrees that it will not withhold its Agreement.
For the purpose of this section “notified” shall mean a letter for each individual introduction of a class of product (e.g., boneless sub primal cuts of meat, deveined liver, rolled veal, etc.). “Member" shall mean full time employees on the payroll actively at work on the effective date of this Agreement or who are on leave of absence or who are sick or injured and return to work as elsewhere provided for in this Agreement.. “Eliminated" means removed from payroll or reduced to part time and is not intended to refer to the nature of the work being performed by the employee. Employees may continue to be transferred, assigned to other work, or laid off in accordance with the seniority provisions of this Agreement, provided the layoff is for reasons other than the introduction of new products and/or new methods.
It is not the Union's intention to impede progress in our industry with respect to any new method of cutting and packaging meat, delicatessen and seafood products, and the necessity for change to accommodate a changing society.
The Union reiterates, therefore, its intention with respect to the “products clause,” as follows:
The Employer may introduce new methods and new products, i.e., (make exceptions) provided it does the following:
22
1.	Union must be notified in advance.
2.	The Employer will list all new products or new methods in letter of notification.
3.	The Employer will give written assurance that no member’s job will be eliminated, in accordance with subparagraph 2.4.
4.	The Employer will meet at the Union’s request for the purpose of reviewing complaints and further compliance of this Section and Article.
If 1, 2, 3, & 4 above are complied with, the Union will not withhold its Agreement.

In the event the Employer engages in Department or Discount type stores, then the Employer and the Union shall negotiat e as to the terms for wages, hours and working conditions for employees working in such stores.
3.3	All meat, fish or poultry, fresh, chilled, frozen, cooked or smoked, historically or customarily offered for sale by the Employer in its Retail Meat Departments, will continue to be handled by Meat Department employees.

3.5	All work and services connected with, or incidental to the handling or selling of all merchandise offered for sale to the public in the Employers’ retail establishments covered by this Agreement shall be performed only by employees of the Employer within the unit referred to above, for which the Union is recognized as the collective
24
bargaining agency by the Employer except such work as is currently performed at the point of delivery by driver-salesmen in servicing retail markets with perishable bakery products, beverages, greeting cards, magazines, potato and com chips directly from the delivery vehicle. Further excepting that representatives of a company sponsoring special promotions may erect and stock initial special displays in connection with said special promotions. There shall be a limitation of three (3) times per year for promotional programs using persons other than employees of the Employer, provided, however, that such special promotions must be area-wide promotions. The Employer shall notify the Union in writing prior to the beginning of any promotional program.
The application of this provision shall in no way restrict the work which may be performed by the Store Managers, Co-managers or Assistant Managers.
3.6	The Employer shall notify the Union thirty (30) days prior to a store closing. The Employer shall negotiate the effect on employees of the store scheduled to be.closed.
ARTICLE 4 Union Security
4.1	All employees shall, as a condition of employment, become and remain members of the Union on and after the thirty-first (31st) day following the date of employment, or on and after the thirty-first (31st) day following the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is the later.
25
4.2	Upon failure of any employee to become and remain a member of the Union within the period and under the conditions specified in Paragraph 4.1 above, the Union shall notify the Employer, in writing, of such failure and the Employer shall, within seven (7) days of receipt of such notice, discharge any such employee as provided in the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 as amended.
4.3	The application of Paragraph 4.1 above, is deferred in any jurisdiction where the Union Shop is not permitted by law, except for the purpose of representation, unless and until such law is declared unconstitutional or is repealed or otherwise becomes inoperative as to the operations of the Employer.
4.4	The Employer will notify the Union in writing as soon as possible within twenty-five (25) days from the date of employment, reinstatement, or transfer into the bargaining unit of any employee, of the name of such employee, the home address, place of employment, social security number and job classification (full time or part time), and the date of employment, reinstatement, transfer, termination, or change in status from part time to full time or full time to part time.
ARTICLE 5
Seniority
5.1	Seniority for the purpose of this Agreement shall be calculated by continuous service from the last date of employment (except as oth
26
erwise provided). Separate seniority lists for all full time Grocery, full time Meat Department employees, part time Grocery and part time Meat Department employees shall be set up by the Employer and shall be furnished to the Union upon request. Seniority areas governing this Agreement are outlined in Schedules “G” & “H,” attached hereto and made a part hereof. Seniority shall prevail in the following instances in the manner as listed hereafter.
5.2	The Employer recognizes the principle of seniority as being one in which the movement of an employee from one job to another or from one location to another through promotion, layoff, recall after layoff, or permanent transfer, shall be governed by the length of service of the employee, and in connection with such movement the Employer may take into consideration as to each employee involved his ability to perform the work.
5.3	In connection with lay offs and store closings seniority will first apply to store, then geographic area (as set forth in Schedule “G”) and last the jurisdiction of this Agreement. In connection with promotions and permanent transfers, seniority will apply first to the store then seniority area (as set forth in Schedule “H”).
5.4	In all layoffs the ordinary rules of seniority shall prevail with due consideration being given to the job classification, fitness for the work involved, and the practicability of applying the rules of seniority in the particular case. Employees laid off for periods of less than one (1) year shall have preference to reinstatement in the re
27
verse order. The service record of such reinstated employees shall not be interrupted. Sickness does not count as layoff. A full time employee shall have seniority over a part time employee to the extent that a full time employee who is involuntarily laid off in order of seniority may claim existing part time schedules calling for the least reduction of hours up to a maximum of forty (40) hours per week in the first instance or those schedules providing for the least reduction of hours if forty (40) hours are not available, provided due consideration is given to job classification and to fitness to perform the work involved and further provided that this shall not result in the employee creating premium or overtime pay situations. Part time employees shall have seniority over other part time employees under the same conditions subject to the provisions of Article 6, Section 6.14. However, if the available opening for a part time employee who is recalled is outside of the seniority area, the employee may refuse the opening without prejudice to future recall within the same seniority area.
Before a Journeyman Meat Cutter can be reduced to part time or laid off within the geographical area all apprentices must be laid off within the geographical area. Where the application of this provision creates a hardship or operational problem the Union agrees to discuss and resolve the problem.
5.5	Seniority and the employee’s ability to perform the work shall be given consideration in regard to promotion within the bargaining unit. If the employee fails to qualify within a reasonable
28
time for the upgraded position he or she will be afforded the opportunity to return to his or her former classification without loss of seniority. The Employer will notify the Union of all promotions to Department Head Classification.
