EFFECT OF AGREEMENT
3.1	This Agreement constitutes the entire Agreement of the Trustees and the Union, arrived at as a result of meeting and conferring. The terms and conditions may be altered, changed, added to, deleted from, or modified only through the voluntary and mutual consent of the parties in an expressed written amendment to the Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all previous Agreements, understandings, policies, and prior practices related to matters included within this Agreement,
3.2	The parties acknowledge that, during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to offer proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. Except as provided for in this Agreement, the Employer and the Union, for the life of this Agreement, voluntarily and unqualifiedly waive the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated, to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to or covered by this Agreement, or with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge of or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time that they negotiated or signed this Agreement.
3.3	When the CSU determines that a study to develop new classifications or to revise current classifications is necessary, the CSU shall notify the Union. Within fifteen (15) days of such notification, the Union may request a meeting with the CSU to discuss the classification study. Such a meeting shall be held at the Office of the Chancellor.
Policies
3.4	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 of this Agreement, the Parties agree that certain issues involving the implementation of policies that are within the mandatory scope of representation under HEERA shall be subject to the negotiation and resolution procedures set forth below.
CSU/APC Collective Bargaining Agreement
Page 4
November 8, 2005 - June 30, 2008
Scope of Procedure
A.	Only those issues related to the implementation of or changes in policies that:
1.	affect Unit 4 employees; and
2.	are not addressed in the Agreement; and
3.	are within the mandatory scope of representation under HEERA; and
4.	have not been waived by the Union
shall be subject to this procedure.
B.	Further, only those issues where the CSU has given official notice to APC on or subsequent to September 1, 2004 shall be subject to this procedure. Official notice shall be defined as written notice to the APC President at the Union's Statewide Office.
C.	The terms of this procedure shall not apply to policies that are required to be implemented by law.
Procedure
D.	Upon receipt of the proposed policy, APC will advise the CSU that APC either (1) has no objection to the policy, (2) desires to meet and discuss the proposed policy, or (3) desires to meet and confer regarding the proposed policy.
E.	Bargaining will be required pursuant to this procedure only if the APC has requested in writing to the CSU that it desires to meet and confer on such issue(s) within the time period provided in the notification or within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notification, whichever is longer.
F.	If the conditions set forth in provisions A. and B. above are met, the Parties will meet within thirty (30) days of the Union’s request to meet, unless there is mutual agreement to extend the time period in which to meet, to negotiate over any portions of the policy that are within the mandatory scope of representation under HEERA or, in the case of a change in an existing policy, the portions of the change that are within the mandatory scope of representation under HEERA.
CSU/APC Collective Bargaining Agreement
Page 5
November 8. 2005 - June 30, 2008
G.	If there is a dispute as to whether the conditions set forth in provisions A and B above are met the parties will meet within thirty (30) days of either party notifying the other of this dispute to discuss whether the policy in question is subject to the procedure set forth in this Article. APC retains the right to challenge before PERB any implementation of a policy alleged by the CSU to be required under law if APC believes the CSU failed to honor a duty to bargain under HEERA. APC also retains the right to challenge before PERB any implementation of a policy regarding which the parties did not agree that the policy (1) was within the mandatory scope of representation, (2) was not already addressed in the Agreement or (3) had not been subject to waiver by APC.
Arbitration
H.	After a period of negotiations of no less than sixty (60) days, either Party may request arbitration of any remaining issue(s) in dispute. Upon agreement of the other Party, that request may involve the consolidation of issues dealing with a single issue or type of policy arising on more than one CSU campus.
I.	Upon filing of a dispute for arbitration, the matter shall be set for hearing according to the arbitration procedures under Article 10 of the Agreement.
J.	The arbitrator shall have the authority to resolve any case scheduling disputes that may arise.
K.	The arbitrator may issue a remedy that requires a deletion of the disputed portion(s) of the policy; this decision relative to the disputed portion(s) must be accepted or rejected as a whole. The decision of the arbitrator on disputes presented for resolution under this procedure shall be final and binding on the Parties, unless the CSU decides, after receipt of the decision, not to implement the disputed portion(s) of the policy. If the CSU decides not to implement the policy, the CSU will not bring forward another policy that addresses the same claim or controversy in dispute at that campus or, in the case of system wide policies, another systemwide policy that addresses the same claim or controversy in dispute, until the expiration date of the Agreement. When CSU decides not to implement the policy the CSU shall pay all of the arbitrator's and all of the court reporter's fees when the parties
CSU/APC Collective Bargaining Agreement
Page 6
November 8, 2005 - June 30, 2008
mutually agree to use a court reporter. The arbitrator shall have no power to determine whether the need exists for the implementation of the policy, except that tire arbitrator may issue a remedy that requires a deletion of the disputed portion(s) of the policy.
L.	Except as provided in provision C above, policies brought forward for negotiation and resolution under this procedure shall not be implemented in Unit 4 unless (1) agreed by the parties, (2) ordered by the arbitrator, and in the form ordered by the arbitrator, or (3) AFC does not exercise its right to bargain pursuant to provision E. above.
Duration
M.	Absent an agreement by the parties to the contrary, no cases may be submitted to adjudication under the terms of this procedure after the expiration of this Agreement.
Applicability
N.	Pre-September 1, 2004 disputes are not subject to this procedure. The parties shall resolve or otherwise dispose of all such pre-September 1, 2004 disputes regarding the implementation of CSU policies in accordance with the Side Letter of Agreement dated October 5, 2005 (Appendix L).
ARTICLE 4
SAVINGS CLAUSE
4.1	If the University believes that any provision of this Agreement is contrary to law, the University shall provide sixty (60) days advance notice to the Union that such provision will be of no force or effect, but the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. The notification shall include the specific reasons why the University believes that the provision(s) is contrary to law, including reference to relevant court decisions and/or statutory changes or any other relevant adjudicated rulings by an agency or court of competent jurisdiction.
CSU/APC Collective Bargaining Agreement
Page 7
November 8,2005 - June 30, 2008
4.2	In the event that the Union disagrees with the University's decision to nullify such a provision, the Union reserves the right to contest the University's determination by appealing the decision to Level III, arbitration, pursuant to Article 10, Grievance Procedure. The parties expressly agree that, in such cases, the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine whether the CSU’s decision regarding the application of the law is correct. Either party may seek to vacate an award in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1285, et seq. if the party believes that the arbitrator's award is in violation of the law, provided such petition is filed within 100 days of receipt of the award.

The following provisions shall apply:
A.	An employee, his/her representative or the employee’s family member must request the employee’s participation and provide appropriate verification of illness or injury as determined by the campus President. The President shall then determine the employee's eligibility to receive donations based upon the definition provided above.

CSU/APC Collective Bargaining Agreement
Page 54
November 8, 2005 - June 30, 2008
calculated from the first day of catastrophic leave. The President may approve an additional three-month period in exceptional cases. The leave should not be deemed donated until actually transferred by the campus record keeper to the record of the employee receiving leave credits.
F.	For employees whose appointments have not been renewed, donated time may not be used beyond the employee's appointment expiration date in effect at the beginning of the disability.
G.	Only vacation and sick leave credits may be donated.
H.	Donated leave credits may not be used to receive service credit following a service or disability retirement.
I.	Any CSU union may solicit leave donations from bargaining unit employees for direct transfer to employees eligible to receive such leave credits.

Catastrophic illness or injury may also include an incapacitated member of the employee's immediate family if this results in the employee being required to take time off for an extended period of time in order to care for the family member and the employee has exhausted both all of his/her accrued vacation credits and all of his/her accrued sick leave credits which may be used for family care in accordance with the appropriate collective bargaining agreement. Only donated vacation credits may be used for such family care catastrophic leave. Immediate family member shall be defined in accordance with the definition contained in the sick leave provisions of the collective bargaining agreement covering the recipient employee.
K.	The provisions of this program shall be subject to the grievance procedure contained in the collective bargaining agreement covering the grieving employee.
L.	Pledged leave credits will be formally transferred to the recipient employee only at the end of a pay period, and then in chronological order of the dates actually pledged. This will insure that any unused leave credits are never actually transferred until they can in fact be used by the recipient employee. In the event that an employee is unable to
CSU/APC Collective Bargaining Agreement
Page 55
November 8, 2005 - June 30, 2008
use all pledged credits in a pay period, the most recently donated leave credits which cannot be utilized will then never formally be transferred, thereby guaranteeing that they are in no way lost by an employee who wants to donate them in order to help a co-worker who needs the credits.

28.26
Exempt Employees
The intent of this section 28.26 is to comply with the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
A.	For full-time employees in classifications listed in Appendix C, the workweek shall be a minimum average of forty (40) hours per week during any six (6) consecutive pay periods. This provision shall apply pro rata to less than full-time employees. Authorized work may include performance of specialized professional services, participation in committee assignments and participation in approved professional activities. Work in excess of the minimum average workweek is not compensable in cash or CTO, and shall not be deemed overtime.
B.	Employees shall not be assigned an unreasonable or excessive workload.
C.	Employees who have absences of less than a full day shall receive a full day's salary and shall neither have their salary docked nor be required to use sick leave or vacation for such absences of less than a full day.
D.	CSU employees in exempt classifications are exempt from FLSA which means they are exempt from overtime payment requirements. If exempt employees need to work hours in excess of the normal business week or business day, they do not receive overtime or CTO. Exempt employees are expected to accomplish assigned work without regard for numbers of hours worked. When it is necessary for employees to work extended hours, managers may authorize informal adjustments in work hours. Normally, it is not necessary to keep complex records of hours worked. If a manager feels an employee is not working an appropriate number of hours, the employee should be counseled. If corrective actions are being considered, performance records should be maintained. Any non-disciplinary, corrective action by supervisors should be addressed to failures by the employee to meet job performance standards and requirements. Typically, such cases should usually involve consultation by the supervisor with the campus Human Resources Office. Human Resources is informed of FLSA requirements and is able to obtain advice from the Office of General Counsel as needed.
The provisions of this section 28.26 are subject to the grievance procedure and pursuant to Article 10, grievances may be filed by individual employees,
CSU/APC Collective Bargaining Agreement
Page 89
November 8, 2005 - June 30, 2008
groups of employees or the Union on behalf of a unit employee or group of unit employees.
At the option of APC, in the event that a grievance alleging a violation of this provision is not settled at Level I, APC may submit solely the issue of whether a violation of this provision occurred directly to arbitration no later than thirty (30) days after the Level I response. In considering whether this provision has been violated, the Arbitrator shall not be precluded from reviewing the contract as a whole. Such arbitration hearing shall be held on a mutually agreeable date within forty-five (45) days of the date of the arbitration submission. Any party, its witnesses or the arbitrator may elect to participate in such arbitration hearings via conference telephone call. Such arbitrations concerning this provision shall be conducted without court reporter's transcripts or briefs.
Each individual's case will be decided on its own merits and grievance/arbitration decisions concerning this provision shall not operate as a precedent for other cases. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award but no opinion. With regard to provisions A, B, and D above, the sole and exclusive remedy for the CSVs violation of the terms of this provision shall be limited to a prospective cease and desist order.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETION
USE: The Report of Employee Performance form is to be used for the evaluation of employees in Unit 4, Academic Support. Evaluations are conducted during the employee's probationary period and annually thereafter. The evaluator may wish to evaluate an employee more often than the prescribed intervals. When doing so, mark the box labeled Special. If space is inadequate, the evaluator may attach extra sheets containing comments, or Page 3 of this document provides additional space.
Section A: Check one column for each factor. When a factor is not considered applicable to a particular job or when the evaluator has not been able to observe the behavior, the category may be recorded as Not Applicable (NA). Check marks in Columns "1" and ”2" require specific explanation in Section D. Record the overall performance in the section entitled Overall Evaluation, taking into account all factors and total performance over the period being evaluated. The Overall Evaluation should not be viewed as an average of all areas rated. The value applied to a factor may vary depending on the duties assigned to the position.
Meets. Expectations: Meets all normal requirements of the position in a competent manner.
Exceeds Expectations: Consistently competent performance exceeding normal standards in all critical factors for the position. Outstanding: Total performance is far above normal standards for the position.
Below Expectations: Total performance periodically or regularly falls short of expectations. Specific deficiencies should be noted in Section D or in a signed and dated attachment.
Unacceptable Performance: Performance is clearly inadequate. Employee has demonstrated an inability or unwillingness to improve or meet expectations. Performance is not acceptable for position held. Specific deficiencies should be noted either in Section D or in a signed and dated attachment.
Section B:	Describe outstanding qualities. Provide examples for check marks in Columns ft4*’ and "5." (Attach additional sheets if necessary.)
Section C:	Discuss progress or lack thereof toward achievement of goals during last rating period.
Section D:	Discuss required improvement or correction. Provide examples for check marks in Columns *’ 1 ” and ”2." (Attach additional sheets if necessary.)
Section E:	Record agreed-upon or prescribed performance goals for the next evaluation period.
Section F: Complete this section only if the employee is on probation. At any time during the probationary period, an employee may be rejected from further employment or, if permanent in another class, returned to that class. If the evaluator wishes to recommend rejection during probation, the evaluator must immediately notify the Office of	__ . Consultation will be provided
at that time.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMPLETING THE EVALUATION PROCESS:
1.	Prepare an initial draft of the Report of Employee Performance. Prior to meeting with the employee to discuss the draft Report, the evaluator may request the employee to complete a self-evaluation, which will also be discussed during the performance evaluation interview.
2.	Provide the employee with a draft copy of the Report of Employee Performance prior to a performance evaluation interview and inform the employee of the date, time, place and purpose of the evaluation interview. The employee shall have 14 days to submit a rebuttal (if any) to the evaluator before the evaluation is finalized. During the interview, the evaluator should encourage the employee to discuss his/her opinions and observations regarding the content of the evaluation.
3.	Upon completion of the evaluation interview, the Report of Employee Performance is completed in final form and signed by the evaluator. The Report is then given to the employee for signature. The employee may include comments on the form or may attach written comments, if desired, and return the Report to the evaluator. If the employee refuses or declines to sign the Report, the evaluator must indicate this under EMPLOYEE'S SIGNATURE OR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. If the employee disagrees with the final performance evaluation, the employee may also subsequently submit a rebuttal statement that wall be attached to the final performance evaluation in the employee’s personnel file.
4.	The Report of Employee- Performance is forwarded to the reviewing officer for signature. The reviewing officer is an MPP manager to whom the evaluator reports unless the college or department has designated another manager to act as reviewing officer.
5.	The completed Report of Employee Performance and any attachments must be copied and distributed by the evaluator as follows: ORIGINAL-to the Office of	: COPY-to the employee being evaluated; COPY-to the department.
