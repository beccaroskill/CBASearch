TRADE, OFFICE PROFESSIONAL AND TECHNICAL and GAS AGREEMENT
This Trade, Office, Professional and Technical and Gas Agreement, entered into June 7, 2010, between the Detroit Edison Company, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, Detroit District, and DTE Energy Corporate Services LLC hereinafter referred to as the “Company”, and Local No. 223 of the Utility Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, hereinafter referred to as the “Union”, representing certain employees in the Company, sometimes hereinafter referred to as “employee” or “employees”, superseding and supplanting any and all written or oral collective bargaining agreements heretofore entered into between the parties covering those employees,
WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the Company is engaged in furnishing essential public services which vitally affect the health, safety, comfort, and general wellbeing of the public; and
WHEREAS, the existence of the Company is dependent upon the faithful carrying out of its responsibilities in serving the public; and
WHEREAS, the mutual responsibility of both the employees and the Management of the Company to the public requires that any disputes arising between the employees and the Management be adjusted and settled in an orderly manner without interruption of said service to the public; and
WHEREAS, both parties hereto recognize this mutual responsibility of service to the public; and
WHEREAS, the Company and the Union agree that one of the purposes of this Agreement is to provide a fair day’s work in return for a fair day’s pay; and
WHEREAS, both parties hereto desire to enter into an Agreement which will eliminate any reason for strikes, stoppages of work, or lockouts during the term of this Agreement and during any period while negotiations are in progress between them for any change or renewal of this Agreement,
1
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises and agreements hereinafter contained, it is agreed that:
Article 1
RECOGNITION
Section 1.1	Bargaining Units. a. The Company recognizes the Union, (l) as certified in the following numbered representation cases before the National Labor Relations Board, Region VII, and, (2) as ordered by the same authority in clarification case VII-UC-17, (3) regarding certain employees of the Production Bargaining Unit as defined in Attachment D of the 1995 Agreement (also referenced the 1995 Agreement for identification of the previous individual Power Plant Bargaining Units, the Central Heat Bargaining Unit, the Power Plant Supply Group from the Stores Bargaining Unit and the Maintenance Bargaining Unit which were combined to form the Production Bargaining Unit), and (4) regarding certain employees of the Fermi 2 Bargaining Unit as defined in Attachment D of the 1995 Agreement and (5) classifications listed in Attachment A (OPT Election/Recognition history), and (6) the Gas Bargaining Unit under the Classification of Work and Wages, forming a part hereof, in the Customer Service Department, Distribution Operations, Meter Reading, Metering, Property Operation and Maintenance, Property Maintenance Operations, Field Service Operations, Stock and Transportation Departments or Divisions of its Detroit District, Credit and Collection, Corrosion in Statewide operations and Transmission and Storage Operations Division as the exclusive collective bargaining agent in all matters of wages, hours, working and other conditions of employment for all employees constituting the respective separate bargaining units listed in Section 1 .lb, except as hereinafter provided.
b.	(For The Trade) — This Agreement covers all employees of the Company in the respective separate bargaining units listed below, sometimes hereinafter referred to for convenience as “departments”, excluding in the Facilities Management and Services the employees of the Crane and Elevator Division, and excluding in all such bargaining units all student engineers, training personnel, assistant foremen, foremen, guards, technical, clerical, part-time, temporary, seasonal, and supervisory employees:

c.	(For those listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) Since the original elections and mutual recognitions referenced in Attachment A, the parties have occasionally agreed to change job titles and/or to create new job descriptions from existing classifications. Therefore, the Company also recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative in matters of wages, hours and working and other conditions of employment for all employees in those classifications listed in Attachment B (OPT Wage Rate Schedule) to this Agreement.
Section 1.2.	Consolidation of Agreements. All of the provisions of the agreements between the Company and the Union covering the employees in each of the above listed respective separate bargaining units have been consolidated into this one Agreement for the convenience of the Union and the Company. It is specifically agreed that the consolidation of all of these provisions covering the separate bargaining units into this one Agreement in no way changes the separate status of the separate bargaining units.
Section 1.3.	Application of Provisions. Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, all provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all employees covered by this Agreement. During the 2004 bargaining the parties agreed to combine the Trade, OPT and Gas contract agreements. It is not the intent of the parties to make any changes in this combination of agreements unless, specifically agreed. Therefore if any discrepancies occur during the 2004 agreement, the parties will refer to the 1999 Trade/OPT or 2000 Gas agreement for the appropriate interpretation.
Section 1.4.	Agency Shop. All employees covered by this Agreement, who at the time of signing this Agreement are members of the Union in good standing, or shall hereafter become members of the Union, shall remain members in good standing for the term of this Agreement as a condition of employment, except as otherwise provided herein. After the signing of this Agreement, when employees are first employed in a classification covered by this Agreement they must, as a condition of employment, arrange within their first thirty (30) days of such employment to either (1) become a member of the Union in good standing, or (2) to make payments (hereinafter referred to as substitute payments) to the Union of amounts equal to the uniformly required monthly dues they would have paid if they were members. The term “substitute payments” shall not include initiation fees which are not required of a non-member. The failure of employees to (l) maintain their membership in the Union in good standing or (2) to make
4
substitute payments shall result in their discharge unless membership was terminated for reasons other than failure of the employees to tender initiation fees and periodic dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership. An employee may resign from membership by sending notice thereof in writing to the President of the Local Union by registered mail, return receipt requested.
Section 1.5.	Assignment and Authorization for Deduction of Initiation Fee, Dues, Substitute Payments, COPE & P.A.C. Fund Contributions, and Assessments.
a.	The Company will, hereafter, with respect to each employee who has individually and voluntarily authorized such deduction in writing in a form acceptable to the Company, deduct from the wages due an employee his/her membership dues or substitute payments, including:
(1)	A duly authorized uniform initiation fee assessed by the Union.
(2)	Duly authorized membership dues (including such general assessments as may be a part thereof) levied by the Union.
(3)	Substitute payments.
(4)	Committee on Political Education (COPE) & P.A.C. Fund Contributions.
Any such authorization may be revoked at any time by the employee sending notice to the Paymaster of the Company by registered mail, return receipt requested. The Paymaster will promptly notify the Union of any such revocation by forwarding a copy of the revocation. As a convenience, the Company will continue to deduct dues of an employee transferred to a classification not covered by this Agreement during his/her trial period of six (6) months. The authorization will be automatically canceled when employment in the Company is terminated for any reason, or six (6) months after an employee is so transferred. If such an employee returns to a bargaining unit during the term of this Agreement, he/she must, within thirty (30) days thereafter, again become and remain a member of the Union in good standing.
5
b.	The Company will remit to the Treasurer of the Union by the 10th day of each month the dues, substitute payments, COPE contributions, initiation fees, and general assessments deducted from employees’ wages in the preceding month. If no pay is due an employee, or if for some other reason deductions are not made at the agreed times, the Company will attempt to make the overdue deductions later in the same month, if possible, after which the Company will not be responsible.
c.	Duly authorized and uniform initiation fees, substitute payments, COPE contributions, and dues (including such general assessments as may be a part thereof) shall be in the amounts certified in writing to the Company over the signature of two (2) officers of the Local Union.
Section 1.6.	Successor Agreements.
a.	Successor Clause
(1)	Internal Sale or Transfer — In the event the Company changes ownership of all or a part (i.e., a part employing permanent, full-time bargaining unit employees) of its existing corporate operations by the sale or transfer of such operations to an existing or a newly created subsidiary or corporate affiliate, the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements shall be binding on any such subsidiary or affiliate.
(2)	External Sale or Transfer — In the event the Company sells, or otherwise divests itself of all or a part (i.e., a part employing permanent, fulltime bargaining unit employees) of its corporate operations in any transaction where the collective bargaining agency and the rights of Union represented employees are or may be affected, the transaction will be conditioned on the purchasing entity agreeing to recognition of Local 223 and, at a minimum, assumption of the arbitration, seniority, job retention, wage, benefit and pension provisions of the then existing Collective Bargaining Agreements. Such purchaser and the Union will negotiate to retain and/or modify other existing applicable Agreement provisions, and any other matters appropriate for such negotiations. Any disputes regarding which terms, if any, of such Collective Bargaining Agreements are not applicable must be resolved between the Union and the new or restructured entity by arbitration. It is the intention of the Company and the Union that such disputes be resolved expeditiously. Prior to closing, the Company will furnish
6
Local 223 a minimum of 60 days notice of any transaction covered by the provisions of (1) and (2) above.
(For the Trade and OPT Bargaining Units)
b.	Worker Transition Program — The Company commits to developing jointly with Local 223 an industry worker transition program which shall provide skills upgrades, apprenticeships and training programs, voluntary separation packages consistent with reasonable business priorities, and job banks to coordinate and assist placement of Local 223 members into comparable employment at no less than their current wage rates and current or substantially equivalent fringe benefits. It is the Company’s further intention to seek recovery of the cost of such worker transition programs as a transition cost as permitted by applicable restructuring legislation and MPSC restructuring orders.
c.	Future Employment — In the event the Company, DTE Energy and/or any DTE affiliates, purchases or merges divisions, business units, or generating stations or generating units with any entity in the electric utility business anywhere in the United States, and additional employees are required, the Company shall offer employment to members of Local 223 who are qualified, but have been displaced from employment at Detroit Edison, provided that such employment offer is consistent with any then existing labor agreement covering the acquired or merged facility or business unit. In the event that DTE Energy acquires or merges with an entity where the employees are not represented by a Union, the Company and Local 223 agree to conduct themselves in any Union representation elections pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding between the parties regarding Union representation elections.
d.	Duration of Successor Agreement Selection (For Trade, OPT, and Gas) — This Successor Agreement Clause does not diminish the wages, hours working or other conditions of employment under existing or successor collective bargaining agreements. Also, this Successor Agreement Clause does not alter the rights and responsibilities of the parties in negotiations for successor collective bargaining agreements, except that the pro
7
visions of this clause will continue in effect until January 1, 2014 unless changed by mutual agreement.
Article 2
JOINT RESPONSIBILITIES
Section 2.1.	No Strike - No Lockout. It is agreed by and between the parties hereto that there will be no concerted failure to report to work, cessation or interruption of work, slowdown, strike, picketing, or lockout during the term of this Agreement, or during any period of time while negotiations are in progress between the parties hereto for the continuance or renewal of this Agreement. The Company agrees, as part of the consideration of this Agreement, that neither the National Union, the Local Union, its officers, nor agents shall be liable for damages for unauthorized stoppages, strikes, intentional slowdowns, or suspensions of work in the respective bargaining units covered by this Agreement, if:
a.	The Union gives written notice to the Company as soon as possible, in any event within eight (8) hours after notification by the Company, copies of which notice by the Union shall be posted immediately by the Union on the bulletin boards, that it has not authorized the stoppage, strike, slowdown, or suspension of work; and if
b.	The Union further cooperates with the Company in getting the employees to immediately return and remain at work. It is recognized that the Company has the right to take disciplinary action, including discharge, against any employees who engage in any unauthorized stoppage, strike, intentional slowdown, or suspension of work, subject to the Union’s right to present a grievance on such discipline in accordance with Articles 4, 5, and 6 of this Agreement.
Section 2.2.	No Coercion. Neither the Company nor the Union shall interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees either to join or refrain from joining the Union.
Section 2.3.	Fermi 2. Both the Union and Management recognize that the Company’s ability to meet its obligation to employees, investors, and the general public is directly dependent upon the safe and continuous operation of Fermi 2, the Company’s only nuclear plant. Recognizing this, both Management and Union agree that every effort should be made to assure
8
continued, successful operation of Fermi 2. To accomplish the same, the Union and Management agree that during the period following contract expiration and the effective date of a new contract, the Union will give the Company 48 hours’ advance written “notice of intent to strike” at Fermi 2 except that, from two weeks prior to the start of an outage associated with fuel reload through two weeks following the end of such an outage, or during any other major outage, the Union will give the Company seven days’ advance written “notice of intent to strike” at Fermi 2 and employees will remain at work until properly relieved. If the Company relieves employees during any such notice period, the employees will be paid for all lost time from their regularly scheduled hours from time of relief to the expiration of said notice period. Further, the Union, its officers, agents, and members agree they will not sanction, condone, or participate in any unlawful picketing activity at the Fermi 2 plant. The Union further agrees that all Fermi 2 Local 223 represented employees will cross any picket lines at Fermi 2 until the expiration of the said 48 hour or seven day notice period.
Article 3
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MANAGEMENT
The Company shall have the right to exercise customary and regular functions of Management, including the right to hire, promote, transfer, or to suspend, discharge, or demote employees for just cause; subject, however, to the employee’s right to bring a grievance if any provision of this Agreement is violated by the exercise of such Management functions.
(For the Gas Division) Company’s Responsibilities — The Management of the Company’s operations and the direction of the working force remain the sole and exclusive rights and responsibilities of the Company: including, for example, the authority to hire, promote, suspend and discipline employees; to discharge employees for cause and to discharge probationers as outlined under Gas addendum Article 7.27 (1); to adjust the working force; to determine the extent and schedule of its operations; and to introduce new or improved methods and processes or facilities. The Company agrees that it will notify the Union, for information purposes only, of changes in departmental operations, methods, processes or facilities which permanently increase or decrease the working force or which create the
9
need for skills not covered by the then present classifications, and it will discuss with the Union modifications in classification to include the needed skills. In exercising its Management responsibilities, the Company will comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not discriminate against any member of the Union.
Article 4 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 4.1.	Union and Company Representatives. The Union will furnish the Company with the names of its duly appointed or elected representatives and their alternates, and members of its Grievance Committee in each bargaining unit (and such changes as may occur from time to time in such personnel), within five (5) days of their appointment or election, so that the Company may at all times be advised as to the authority of the individual Union representatives with whom it may be dealing. Likewise, the Director of Human Relations will furnish the Union the names and/or titles of the President’s Delegate by Business Unit and Company officials designated to settle or decide grievances at Steps 1, 2 and 3 as set forth below.
Section 4.2.	Grievances. a. (Step 1) Discussion with Immediate Supervisor. Should any disagreement arise between any employee or employees covered by this Agreement and the Company, it shall be deemed a grievance. It shall be discussed by the employee or employees and his/her or their immediate supervisor, either personally, or with or through his/her or their Union representative. If the grievance cannot be settled by discussion it will be reduced to writing promptly, and in a clear manner. The grievance will be immediately assigned a grievance number. If the written grievance is not so submitted within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of the action of the Company causing the disagreement, it will be considered to no longer exist. (If the disagreement involves the issuance of an Oral Reminder or a Written Reminder, the discussion will also include at least the second line supervisor.) If not resolved at this discussion stage, these disciplinary issues may go directly to Step 3. If a grievance involves allegations of harassment or discrimination it may proceed directly to Step 3. No grievance that has been discussed with or through a Union representative will be adjusted unless a Union representative is present or has been offered the opportunity to be present. The immediate supervisor will have ten (10) days exclusive of
10
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays from the date the grievance is first submitted to provide a written answer to the grievant and/or Union representative. If such an answer is not given within the required ten (10) days, the grievance may be appealed to Step 2 without a written answer from the immediate supervisor. It is understood that all settlements and/or answers at this discussion level are without prejudice or precedent to the Company or the Union and either party may take an entirely different position if the grievance is appealed to Step 2. It is further understood that no employee will leave work for the purpose of discussing a grievance without first obtaining permission from his/her supervisor and being properly relieved. The Company, except as otherwise agreed, will pay not more than one aggrieved employee and one Union representative for time necessarily lost from regular working hours while discussing such grievance with the supervisor.
b.	Step 2. Interest Based Bargaining Meeting (IBB) If the grievance is not settled at Step 1, the Union will have (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) to appeal the grievance to Step 2. If the Union does not appeal within (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) the grievance, will be considered to no longer exist. In addition to the times mutually agreeable by the parties IBB meetings will be scheduled every Thursday.
The Company official so designated to whom the Step 2 grievance is presented, or someone delegated by the Company official with authority to settle or decide the grievance shall, unless otherwise agreed to by the Union, shall convene a Step 2 meeting of the parties within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays) of receipt of the written grievance. Using the Interest Based Bargaining (IBB) process, the parties will make a good faith effort to resolve the grievance at this Step 2 meeting. Labor Relations may facilitate these Step 2 discussions and will record the resolution reached by the parties.
It is understood that, unless otherwise agreed to in writing, all settlements and/or answers at Step 2 are without prejudice or precedent to the Company or the Union and either party may take an entirely different position if the grievance is heard at Step 3.
c.	Step 3. President’s Delegate Hearing. If the resolution is not reached at Step 2, the Secretary or the President of the Local Union may, within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) after the
11
date of the IBB session submit the grievance in writing to the President’s Delegate with full power and authority to settle or decide the grievance. If the grievance is not so submitted to the President’s Delegate within such twenty (20) days, it will be considered to no longer exist. A Step 3 hearing will be scheduled at the earliest mutually agreeable time. Unless otherwise agreed, such a Step 3 hearing will take place within thirty (30) calendar days of the Union’s appeal to Step 3. The President’s Delegate will have five (5) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) from the end of the last Step 3 meeting to mail to the Local Union office and the Bargaining Unit Chairperson, his/her decision in writing, unless the time is waived or extended by the Union. Provided, however, that if a stenographic transcript is made of the Step 3 meeting or meetings, the last meeting will be considered to have been held on the day such transcript is placed in the hands of the President’s Delegate.
Section 4.3.	Arbitration of Grievances. If the Union is not satisfied with the decision of Management at Step 3 of any grievance which concerns the meaning or application of the terms of this Agreement, then the Union may submit such grievance to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 within sixty (60) calendar days after the mailing by the Company to the Local Union office of the decision of the President or the President’s Delegate at Step 3. Any such grievance not so submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) calendar days will be considered to no longer exist. Grievances which do not concern the meaning or application of the terms of this Agreement may not be submitted to arbitration, and will be considered to no longer exist. The question of whether a grievance is subject to arbitration may be arbitrated.
Section 4.4.	Persons Present. Either of the parties may have present at the meetings provided for in the foregoing steps, any person or persons they may consider necessary to the proper consideration and settlement of the grievance. It is understood that, except as otherwise specifically agreed to in writing by the Company, not more than three (3) employees of the Union’s choosing shall be paid by the Company for the time lost from their regular working hours while attending, Step 2 and Step 3 hearings and for one (1) employee while attending arbitration.
Section 4.5.	Step 3 Digital audio recording/Stenographic Transcription. The Company will make an audio recording of each meeting held at Step 3, utilizing a digital audio recording device, and shall provide, at its expense, stenographic transcripts of such meetings in all cases (i) involving a Decision Making Leave (DML) or discharge,
12
(ii) where the Union, by its President, makes a written request to the Director of Human Relations, not to exceed twelve (12) in any calendar year, and (iii) where a case is submitted to arbitration under either Section 4.3 or Article 6 herein. As it pertains to (i), a stenographer shall be present at the Step 3 meeting and prepare a contemporaneous transcription. With respect to (ii) and (iii), transcriptions shall be made from the Step 3 meeting audio recording. The Company shall furnish transcripts to the Union within 30 days, unless otherwise agreed, of either the Step 3 meeting, the Union’s petition for arbitration, or upon the Union’s request, as applicable in (ii) above. When there is a request by the President of the Union for said transcripts, such request must be made within fifteen (15) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sunday and holidays) of the date of President’s Delegates Step 3 decision. In these instances, the sixty (60) calendar days for appeal for arbitration shall commence with the mailing by the Company of the transcript. In all other cases, the Company shall provide the Union a copy of the audio recording within 5 days of the Step 3 meeting.
Article 5 ARBITRATION
Section 5.1.	Submission to Arbitration. Any grievance which may be submitted to arbitration under the provisions of either Section 4.3 or of Article 6 may be so submitted within the time limits therein provided by requesting the American Arbitration Association in writing to select an arbitrator in accordance with its voluntary labor arbitration rules and sending a copy of such request by certified mail or email within such time limits, addressed to the Company to the attention of its Director of Human Relations at One Energy Plaza, Detroit, Michigan 48226.
Section 5.2.	Appointment of Representatives. At the start of the arbitration hearing, each party shall appoint a representative who will be available to meet with the arbitrator after the hearing. Such post arbitration meetings, if any, shall be called at the discretion of the arbitrator and both the Union and Management representative will be present.

Section 5.5.	Expenses of Arbitration. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the stenographic record, and similar incidental arbitration expenses shall be shared equally by the parties hereto.
Article 6
GRIEVANCES IN DISCHARGE, SUSPENSION, DECISION MAKING LEAVE, AND DEMOTION CASES
Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, prior to the discharge, suspension, decision making leave (DML), or demotion for cause of an employee, the Company will conduct a fact finding meeting with the Chairperson of the bargaining unit or, Acting Chairperson, or the Chairperson’s designee. (See also Section 8.31 regarding the Supervisor’s obligation to provide Union representation under other circumstances involving Positive Discipline.) Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, the Company will prepare and submit to the Union minutes of the fact finding meeting. Unless otherwise agreed between the Company and the Union, if an employee is discharged, suspended, given a DML, or demoted for cause, the Union shall be notified of such action promptly in writing by the Company. Notice will be addressed to the Local Union President and a copy mailed to the Chairperson of the bargaining unit in which the employee was working, or in the Chairperson’s absence the Vice Chairperson or Chief Steward. If the employee is not probationary, the employee or the Union may, within twenty (20) days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) of notice to the Union, file a written grievance directly with the President of the Company to protest such action without taking the preliminary steps of the grievance procedure set forth in Section 2 of Article 4. It is recognized that such a grievance should be heard at the earliest possible time and take precedence over grievances of a different nature. Therefore, such employee shall have the right to a prompt hearing on such charges before the President of the Company or the President’s Delegate, with full power and authority to sustain or alter the severity of the discharge, suspension, DML, or demotion, or to otherwise settle the grievance. The President of the Company or the President’s Delegate shall report his/her decision in writing, mailed or delivered to the Local Union office within five (5) cal
14
endar days after the conclusion of such hearing. However, if a stenographic transcript is made of the hearing, the conclusion of the hearing will be considered to be the day such transcript is placed in the hands of the President of the Company or the President’s Delegate. If the Union is not satisfied with the decision of the President or the President’s Delegate, the Union may submit such grievance to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 hereof within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of mailing by the Company to the Local Union office of the decision on such grievance. If not so submitted within such sixty (60) calendar days, the grievance shall be considered to no longer exist. If so submitted to arbitration within sixty (60) calendar days, the power of the arbitrator shall be limited to either upholding the disciplinary action as stated in the decision of the President or the President’s Delegate or vacating such disciplinary action. If the arbitrator vacates a discharge, DML, suspension, or demotion, the arbitrator shall order the employee returned to his/her former job with full seniority and compensation for all time and wages lost. The discharge, suspension, DML, or demotion of a probationary employee shall not be the subject of a grievance or arbitration.
(Gas Division Only) Just Cause for Discharge - Without excluding other causes for discharge, the following shall constitute just cause from which there shall be no appeal except to determine the validity of the charge, to negotiation or arbitration between the Company and the Union; namely drunkenness or illegal use of drugs, dishonesty in conduct involving theft of money or property, failure to obey a direct order, direction of violent verbal abuse or physical attack toward supervisory personnel, and willful damage to Company property and business.
(Gas Division Only) Disciplinary Warnings - When an action by an employee is such as to result in a supervisory warning, which may in the future be used in considering more severe disciplinary action, such warning shall be in writing, and one (1) copy of such written warning shall be given to the employee and two (2) copies of such written warning shall be delivered or mailed to the Union office within twenty (20) calendar days after the Company's first knowledge of the occurrence. One copy of the warning will be noted by the Union Grievance Committee and returned to the Company and a written warning given to an employee after such twenty (20) day period shall be a nullity.

Article 7
SENIORITY
(This article pertains to Trade and OPT only) (For the Gas Division see Article 7 of Gas Addendum)
Section 7.1.	Service Defined. Length of employment in the Company (including the length of all previous periods of employment in the Company) shall be known as “service”. Benefits, such as, CTO pay during absence, pension, and (For those listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) - Voluntary Separation Plan and for Trade-the layoff allowance, are based on service.
Section 7.2.	Seniority Defined. Seniority is the relationship of one employee to other employees on the same seniority list within a bargaining unit or bargaining units. A seniority list establishes the order by which the employees listed thereon will be considered, as provided in this Agreement, for layoffs, rehiring, promotions, and permanent transfers between and within bargaining units covered by this Agreement.
Section 7.3.	Acquiring Seniority. a. Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, an employee acquires seniority in a bargaining unit or bargaining units by working in one or more classifications covered by a single seniority list in that bargaining unit for a continuous period of six (6) months. Seniority, when acquired, dates back to the time when such continuous employment began and accumulates so long as such employment continues.
b. An employee who has not acquired twelve (12) months of service is a probationary employee.
Section 7.4.	Seniority Lists. a. The seniority status of each present employee shall be that which has been determined by the present seniority lists. (For the Trades) - The established practices of occupational groups, divisions, and departments shall continue for the term of this Agreement, unless changed by mutual agreement.
b.	The Company will cooperate with the Union in working out a mutually satisfactory method of showing the seniority status of employees. The Company will furnish each month to the Chairperson of each unit the names of those employees who have acquired seniority in the unit during
16
the month, and send a copy to the President of the Local Union. Seniority lists shall be brought up to date each January 15 and July 15 and posted by the Company, and one (1) copy of each list shall be furnished to the President of the Local Union and at least five (5) copies to the Chairperson of the unit involved. Such seniority lists shall be deemed to be correct as to the seniority of all employees except those who question the same within twenty (20) days after such lists are posted by the Company. Employees who could not see the list at the time of posting because of CTO utilization, work assignment, or similar cause shall have twenty (20) days after their opportunity to see the list to question their position. All such objections shall be considered and processed as grievances.
c.	Employees added to any of the seniority lists in each bargaining unit shall have their seniority determined as provided in this Agreement, except as otherwise agreed by the parties. When two employees start on a seniority list on the same day, the senior employee shall be the one with the longer continuous employment in the occupational group. If this does not break the tie, reference shall be made successively to cumulative time spent in the employee’s respective bargaining unit, then cumulative time spent in Local 223 UWUA, then Company hire date, and finally the employee’s date of birth, with the eldest employee being given preference on the seniority list. In the Production Organization the term occupational group as used in Paragraph c of this Section 7.4 means occupational group within a single bargaining unit.
Section 7.5.	Transfers at Employee’s Request. a. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph c of this Section 7.5, employees who transfer from one seniority list or bargaining unit to another at their own request will continue to accumulate seniority on the seniority list from which they transferred for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer. During this six (6) month period, the employees will be on trial to demonstrate their qualifications and abilities for the work in their new classification. If found not qualified for such work by Management during this period, the employees will be returned to their former bargaining unit and classification without prejudice. At the end of this six (6) month trial period, if retained, their seniority will be established on their new seniority list retroactively to the date of transfer, and the employees’ seniority on their former seniority list
17
will cease to accumulate but will be retained as of the date of transfer and may be exercised only in the event of layoff. (For those listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) The trial period may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties up to six (6) months.
b.	(For those listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) - For hardship reasons or by mutual agreement of the parties, bargaining unit employees who voluntarily transfer to other classifications or other locations, represented or non-represented, employees may voluntarily return to their former seniority list and classification within ninety (90) calendar days of the date of transfer without prejudice.
(For Trade) — Employees may voluntarily return to their former seniority list and classification within sixty (60) calendar days of the date of transfer without prejudice.
c.	(Exception to Paragraph a of this Section 7.5) Both parties recognize that in some instances six (6) months may not be a sufficient period of time in which to adequately judge the qualifications and abilities of an apprentice in training. In the event an apprentice in training does not pass required class-room work, the employee will be permitted one (1) repeat session for each course failed during each term of the training program provided the employee is otherwise progressing satisfactorily. Should a second attempt in any course also result in failure, the apprentice may be dropped from the training program and classification. If such employee, because of classroom work or on-the-job performance, is found not qualified after having been longer than six (6) months in the training program, the employee shall be returned to his/her former classification, if any, and the employee will be credited with an additional six (6) months of seniority in his/her former classification. If such employee has no former classification to which the employee can be returned, the Company will attempt to place the employee on other work which the employee is qualified to perform but, in such event, the employee will not be credited with seniority in the newfound classification.
d.	If an employee transfers to a classification not covered by this Agreement, the employee will continue to accumulate seniority on the seniority list from which the employee transferred for a period of six (6) months from the date of transfer, or longer if mutually agreed. If the employee becomes permanently assigned to the classification, the employee’s seniority will be adjusted so that accumulation stops as of the initial
18
date of the transfer. The terms of Section 1.4 (Agency Shop) apply while seniority is being accumulated. If such an employee wants his/her deduction of dues to continue beyond the period provided by Section 1.5 (Assignment and Authorization for Deduction of Initiation Fee, Dues, and Assessments) the employee must sign a statement to that effect.
Section 7.6.	Transfers by Management. Whenever in the course of changes such as reorganization or transfers of work from one division or department to another, Management shall permanently transfer an employee from one division or department to another, and the transferred employee will be placed in the classification most like his/her previous work. New seniority lists for the classifications in which employees are placed as the result of such transfers will be made up, and all employees on these new lists will have their respective seniorities adjusted to include all service with the Company in the classification and all like classifications, except that where seniority has been terminated, prior service shall not be included unless otherwise agreed.
Section 7.7.	Temporary Assignments. a. An employee who is assigned to a classification on another seniority list on a temporary basis will not accumulate seniority on that list. However, if the assignment is continuous and the vacancy is posted as a permanent vacancy, the employee’s seniority, if the employee is selected to fill the permanent vacancy, will be established on his/her old and new seniority lists as of the date of the temporary assignment.
b. In the Civil and Specialty Trades Occupational Group of Substations and the Maintenance Occupational Group of Fermi 2 or Power Generation, if a shortage of work in the regular classification makes it necessary to assign one or more employees to another classification in their bargaining unit, and such assignment is expected to last ten (10) working days or more, the employees with the least seniority shall be so assigned, provided reasonable qualifications and abilities are not significantly different, and no change in headquarters or work area is required. “Significant difference” shall be “head and shoulders difference”, and such factors as advance licenses or step-up experience shall not of themselves amount to significant differences.
Section 7.8.	Incapacitated Employees. An employee represented by the Union who becomes incapacitated for his/her regular work may be placed at any work the employee can do without regard to the seniority provisions
19
of this Agreement, and upon recuperation shall be returned to his/her former classification or the classification the employee would be entitled to through qualifications and accumulated seniority. The seniority of such an employee will accumulate only on his/her former seniority list.
Section 7.9.	Leave of Absence. An employee on leave of absence will continue to accumulate seniority, and at the termination of the leave the employee will be returned to his/her former classification or, if that classification no longer exists, to the classification the employee is entitled to by qualifications and seniority, provided the employee is able to perform its duties. The terms of Section 1.4 (Agency Shop), apply while seniority is being accumulated.
Section 7.10.	Employees needed to fill Supervisory positions for a short term. In the event the company needs to fill a supervisory position for a short term in any area they may chose to use a senior leader (LU-59).
Section 7.11.	Layoffs or Reductions. a. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the Company finds it necessary to lay off or reduce an employee or employees from a classification or a seniority list, the Company will notify the Local Union President of the matter in writing and will negotiate with the Union to formulate a program for spreading the work, transferring employees, or taking some other appropriate action including but not limited to monetary incentives to allow employees in affected classifications to voluntarily leave the Company, retraining to allow employees to qualify for other jobs, temporary placement into other jobs at other locations including mutual time exchange transfers in accordance with Section 8.19a and temporary placement into special projects. If the parties are unable to agree on such a program within thirty (30) days after the matter is first brought to the attention of the Union, the procedure outlined below shall apply.
b.	If it becomes necessary to reduce the force by laying off employees from any seniority list, the employee with the least seniority on that list shall be laid off first, provided the employee can be replaced with a qualified employee having higher seniority. (For those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) However, employees who are performing below expectations on their overall performance rating are subject to layoff without regard to seniority.
20
c.	Any employee who is being laid off from a seniority list may, at his/her own request, use seniority the employee retains on any other seniority list to displace an employee on such other seniority list whose seniority is less than his/her own thereon; or to displace any probationary employee in his/her bargaining unit, provided, in either case, that the employee is qualified to perform the work available. To maintain the integrity of Fermi 2 and to protect seniority, the parties have agreed that the number of Maintenance Occupational Group employees permitted to bump into Fermi 2 will be limited to a number equaling 10% of the number of Maintenance Occupational Group employees employed at Fermi 2 in any year (365 day period). Management may, at its discretion, accept a number greater than 10%. Any employee who thus transfers and displaces a probationary employee or a junior employee on some other seniority list will retain his/her seniority indefinitely on the seniority list from which the employee was laid off. In case the employee is restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, his/her seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off shall include the time spent on the seniority list or lists to which the employee was transferred during the period of layoff. And, if restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, the employee will be given no seniority credit on the list or lists to which the employee was assigned during the period of layoff.
d.	The Company will attempt to place any employee who is being laid off from his/her seniority list at work he/she is qualified to do in his/her own or other departments before hiring new employees for such work from out-side the Company. If placed, the employee’s seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off will be retained and accumulate in the same manner as if the employee had replaced a junior employee under Paragraph c of this Section 7.11.
e.	If the affected employees have not been placed under Paragraphs a, b, c, or d of this Section 7.11, the employees will be offered work currently being performed by contractors which they can perform or be expected to perform with reasonable training. The parties will identify the training necessary to accomplish the above.
f.	An employee who is laid off from employment in the Company, (for those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history the employee must meet expectations) and is later hired into a lower
21
classification (while the employee still has recall rights) will retain his/her seniority indefinitely on the list from which the employee was laid off. In case the employee is later restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, his/her seniority on the list from which the employee was laid off shall include the time spent on the other seniority list or lists during the period of layoff and, if restored to the seniority list from which the employee was laid off, the employee will be given no seniority credit on the list or lists to which the employee was assigned during the period of layoff, and the employee shall be given no seniority credit anywhere for the period of unemployment from the Company.
g.	An employee is not entitled to reimbursement by the Company for expenses incurred by the employee in accepting work under this Section 7.11.
h.	An employee who is laid off from employment in the Company (in the OPT bargaining unit the employee must meet expectations) will retain his/her seniority on the list from which he/she was laid off and will have recall rights for a period of time equal to his/her seniority on that list, or for five (5) years, whichever is the lesser. If not recalled or hired into a lower classification during this period, the employee’s seniority shall be terminated.
i.	Qualified employees who have been laid off from any seniority list and retain seniority thereon under this Section 7.11, who are able to return to work, will be called back in the reverse order of their layoffs, except that an employee who had been retained outside of seniority order because the employee had been a Union representative who is subsequently laid off will be called back in the order which would have applied to the employee if the employee had not been a Union representative.
j.	Should it become necessary for the Company to reduce for a period which it appears will be six (6) months or more the number of employees in a classification at a work location:
(1)	The employee in that classification with the least seniority on the seniority list covering the classification affected and employed at the work location in question will be displaced first, provided the employee can be replaced, if necessary, with a qualified employee having higher seniority.
22
(2)	Such employee may, if qualified, displace an employee on the same seniority list employed elsewhere in his/her own classification whose seniority is less than his/her own thereon, or such employee may, if qualified, displace an employee in some other lower-rated classification on the same seniority list employed elsewhere or at the same location whose seniority is less than his/her own thereon.
k.	For the purposes of layoffs or involuntary transfers or work assignments when seniority is a factor, an elected or appointed Union representative as listed below will be considered as being at the top of his/her seniority list, provided the pending layoff, involuntary transfer or change in work assignment would interfere with his/her job-related contract administration duties. If this paragraph is applied to prevent the layoff of any employee from his/her classification or seniority list because he/she is an elected or appointed Union representative, and such employee shall thereafter lose his/her status as an elected or appointed Union representative, the following will be done:
(1)	Such former elected or appointed Union representative shall resume his/her proper status on his/her seniority list.
(2)	Employees who have greater seniority on such seniority list than such former elected or appointed Union representative and who (a) were displaced from their classification or from such seniority list while serving as an elected or appointed Union representative and (b) have remained continuously with the Company in some other job classification or have been rehired under Paragraph f of Section 7.11 shall be offered, in descending order of accumulated seniority, from high to low, the opportunity to replace such former elected or appointed Union representative.
(3)	If such employee accepts the offer, the employee lowest on the seniority list as it exists after such offer is accepted shall have the provisions of this Section 7.11, applied.
(4)	If any employee to whom such offer is made declines the same, employee shall lose all rights, except recall rights, to return to the job from which the employee was displaced.
(5)	This Paragraph k of this Section 7.11 shall not apply in such a way as to require Management to offer the above opportunity to any employee
23
other than those covered by Paragraph k (2) of this Section 7.11, and
(6)	This Paragraph k of this Section 7.11 shall not be construed to give any employee who shall hereafter become an elected or appointed Union representative any right to return to any classification or seniority list from which the employee has been laid off or displaced.
(7)	For the purpose of applying this Paragraph k of this Section 7.11, elected or appointed Union representatives shall be ranked at the top of their seniority lists in the following order:
1.	Local Union President
2.	Local Union Vice President
3.	Local Union Secretary
4.	Local Union Treasurer
5.	Union EAP Representatives
6.	Bargaining Unit Chairperson
7.	Bargaining Unit Vice Chairperson
8.	Bargaining Unit Chief Steward
9.	Bargaining Unit Secretary
10.	Bargaining Unit Treasurer
*11. Bargaining Unit Bargaining and Grievance Committee
12. Office Professional & Technical and Power Generation Committee persons/Regional/Area/Plant
*13. Elected Stewards
*14. Elected Safety Committee Members
15. Local Union Safety Director
* If two or more in this category are on the same seniority list, regular seniority will break the tie.
(8) If said layoffs or involuntary transfers reach to the top of said seniority lists the Union representatives in the following Union Offices will not be laid off from nor involuntarily transferred from their respective bargaining units while they hold one of said offices unless all of the employees of the entire bargaining unit are first laid off from or involuntarily transferred from said bargaining unit:
1.	Local Union President
2.	Local Union Vice President
3.	Local Union Secretary
4.	Local Union Treasurer
5.	Bargaining Unit Chairperson
24
l.	An employee with ten (10) years or more of Company service who is being laid off from his/her classification in accordance with the seniority practices of his/her bargaining unit, who cannot be placed under the seniority practices of his/her bargaining unit or Paragraphs c, d, or j of this Section 7.11 may, if the employee meets the qualifications required to enter such job, elect:
(1)	To use his/her bargaining unit seniority to displace an employee with less bargaining unit seniority in another job with the same or a lower pay grade in his/her bargaining unit, even though the employee has no seniority in such job, or, if there is no such employee,
(2)	To use his/her Company service to displace from another job with the same or a lower pay grade an employee represented by the Union in another bargaining unit who has less than six (6) months Company service.
(3)	If an employee has no alternative to being laid off and is laid off following the foregoing application of this Section 7.11, such employee, if qualified, will be given first consideration before new employees are hired into classifications covered by this Agreement. Failure of employees to avail themselves of any such opportunity shall not prejudice their recall rights under Paragraph h of this Section 7.11.
m.	This Section 7.11 does not in any way alter the force and effect of Article 10.8 (For those listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) - (Voluntary Separation Offer). For the Trade -(Layoff Allowance).
Section 7.12.	Termination of Seniority. Seniority will be terminated in cases of (a) resignation, (b) discharge for cause, including absence for three (3) consecutive workdays without notice (unless failure to give notice is beyond the employee’s control), (c) expiration of recall rights, or (d) failure to reply (unless failure to reply is beyond the employee’s control) within five (5) days to a notice of recall to work, sent by registered mail return receipt letter to the last address furnished in writing to the Company by the laid-off employee. If seniority has been terminated, the Company has no further obligation to offer re-employment but, if a former employee without seniority is re-employed, his/her seniority status will be that of a new employee, unless otherwise agreed by the parties hereto.
Section 7.13.	Promotions. (This section pertains to all bargaining units except for those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT
25
Election/Recognition history). In promotion of employees covered by this Agreement to classifications within the same bargaining unit, seniority will govern whenever reasonable qualifications and abilities of the employees being considered are not significantly different. “Significant difference” shall be “head and shoulders difference”, and such factors as advance licenses or step-up experience shall not of themselves amount to significant differences. If the Management proposes to by-pass any employee with greater seniority, the Management will discuss the matter with the chairperson of the bargaining unit involved (at least five (5) days before the by-pass is made effective) in an attempt to reach an agreement thereon before such a by-pass is made. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be processed through the grievance procedure to the President of the Company, or his/her delegate, whose decision shall be controlling, except that the question of whether the by-pass has been arbitrary or discriminatory may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement. If the arbitrator finds the by-pass was arbitrary or discriminatory, the by-pass will be canceled.
Section 7.14.	Trial Period. a. Except as otherwise provided in Paragraph c of this Section 14, every employee who begins employment for the first time in a classification in a bargaining unit shall be on trial for a period of six (6) months from the first day of his/her continuous employment in that classification to demonstrate his/her abilities and qualifications for such work. If the employee shall be found not qualified by Management during this six (6) month period, he/she shall be returned to his/her former bargaining unit and classification, if any, without prejudice. In the event of disagreement concerning the employee’s ability or qualifications, except in the case of a probationary employee, the matter may be processed through the grievance procedure up to the President of the Company, or his/her delegate, whose decision shall be controlling, except that the question of whether the Management’s action has been arbitrary or discriminatory may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement.
b.	In the case of a probationary employee, or one who is rehired into a classification in which he/she has no seniority, termination of employment shall not be the subject of a grievance or arbitration. Otherwise, such an employee shall have the full benefit of the grievance procedure under Articles 4 and 5.
26
c.	(Exception to paragraph a of this Section) Both parties recognize that in some instances six (6) months may not be a sufficient period of time in which to adequately judge the qualifications and abilities of an apprentice in training. In the event an apprentice in training does not pass required classroom work, he/she will be permitted one (1) repeat session for each course failed during each term of the training program provided he/she is otherwise progressing satisfactorily. Should a second attempt in any course also result in failure, the apprentice may be dropped from the training program and classification. If such employee, because of classroom work or on-the-job performance, is found not qualified after having been longer than six (6) months in the training program, he/she shall be returned to his/her former classification, if any, and he/she will be credited with an additional six (6) months of seniority in his/her former classification. If such employee has no former classification to which he/she can be returned, the Company will attempt to place him/her on other work which he/she is qualified to perform; but, in such event, he/she will not be credited with seniority in the newfound classification.
Article 8 WORKING CONDITIONS
Section 8.1. Bulletin Boards — Union Business on Company Time or Property. a. Bulletin boards will be made available to the Union by the Company and such bulletin boards will be erected at designated places agreeable to the Union and the Company for the purpose of posting Union notices relating to meetings, entertainment, health, safety, and other noncontroversial items of interest to the membership.
b. The members of the Union will not discuss strictly Union business to the extent that work is interfered with, nor will they solicit members, nor attempt to influence employees on Company time or property during working hours. This Paragraph b of this Section 8.1 is not to be interpreted as prohibiting solicitations on an employee’s own time, such as lunch and break periods.
(For the Gas Division) — Union Activities — The Union agrees that its officers, representatives, and members will not solicit memberships nor engage in Union activities on Company time, except as provided herein,
27
and that its officers, representatives, and members will not intimidate or coerce employees in any manner at any time.
a) An employee’s departmental representative and the Union Vice Chairperson in charge of grievances or an alternative officer shall be allowed time off, without loss of pay, during their scheduled work hours, for the purpose of investigating the employee’s difference or processing his or her grievance, subject to the following conditions:

(ii)	They shall receive a clearance from the supervisor of the employee whom they plan to contact; and
(iii)	They shall report to their immediate supervisors at the conclusion of such meeting or meetings.
b.	In addition, Union officers, grievance committee members, and departmental representatives shall be allowed time off, without loss of pay, during their scheduled work hours, for the purpose of attending grievance meetings at which their presence is required by the grievance procedure, for the purpose of attending meetings with the Company, and for such other purposes as may be mutually agreed upon. No absence with pay will be permitted under this paragraph for the attendance of funerals or for the visiting of funeral homes.
c)	Except as provided above, no absence with pay will be permitted for Union activities. Absence without pay for Union activities may be permitted subject to the following conditions:
(i)	It will not interfere with the operation of the Company’s business; and
(ii)	With respect to any one (1) absence in excess of ten (10) scheduled working days, reasonable advance written notice is presented by the Union President to the Director of Human Relations prior to the commencement of such absence.
28
Union activities are defined as any activities involving Union officers, grievance committee members or departmental representatives other than those at which an authorized representative of the Company is present.
(For Gas Division T&SO Department) — The Union agrees that its officers, representatives and members will not solicit memberships nor engage in Union activities on Company time, except as provided herein, and that its officers, representatives and members will not intimidate or coerce employees in any manner at any time. Union representatives shall be allowed time off, without loss of pay, during their scheduled work hours for the purpose of investigating differences or processing grievances. Absence without pay for Union activities may be permitted subject to the following conditions:
(a)	It will not interfere with the operation of the Company’s business; and
(b)	With respect to any one (1) absence in excess of ten (10) scheduled working days, reasonable advance written notice is presented by the Union President to the Director of Human Relations prior to the commencement of such absence.
Union activities are defined as any activities involving Union officers or Union representatives other than those at which an authorized representative of the Company is present.
Section 8.2.	Full-Time Employment. (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) The Company agrees that any employee, other than a part-time or seasonal employee, who is scheduled to work on the first day of his/her work week, will be guaranteed pay at straight time for forty (40) hours that week, provided the employee reports for work and is in condition to work. This does not preclude suspensions or discharges for just cause, or layoffs as provided in Section 8.34 hereof. It is understood that in case of a shortage of work in his/her own group the employee will do any work assigned which the employee is capable of performing.
(For the Gas Division) — Normal Scheduled Workweek — The normal scheduled workday shall be eight (8) hours, and the normal scheduled work-week shall be forty (40) hours; provided, however, that in a week in which an idle holiday occurs, the normal scheduled workweek shall be
29
forty (40) hours less the number of hours for which an employee will receive “holiday pay” under Article 9.7 of the Gas Addendum, hereof. No employee will be scheduled to work a holiday as part of their regularly scheduled forty (40) hour workweek. A schedule will be posted on the third (3rd) day preceding the beginning of the workweek, informing employees of their day or days off during the week. (For the T&SO Department, a schedule will be posted on the third day preceding the beginning of the two (2) week work period, informing employees of their day or days off during the two (2) week pay period). The Field Service Operations Department will post a tentative “Holiday Work Schedule” one (1) month in advance of each Company approved holiday. So far as possible, the days off will be alternated so that, if he or she desires, each employee will receive the benefits of Saturday and Sunday off when his or her turn comes.
Section 8.3.	Inclement Weather. This section pertains to the Trade. The Company will not require employees, not so normally engaged, to work outdoors in inclement weather during regularly scheduled work periods, unless such work is necessary to protect life or property, to maintain service, or to prevent impairment of service. In inclement weather, the Company will furnish indoor work, insofar as practicable, to those employees whose outdoor work has been suspended, it being understood that if it is not practicable to furnish work in his/her own group, the employee will do any work assigned which he/she is capable of performing. If unable to do so, the Company will nevertheless fulfill its obligation under Section 8.2 of this Article by paying for such unworked time within the regularly scheduled workweek of forty (40) hours.
(For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) Any employee normally working indoors, but required to work outdoors without sufficient notice to provide his/her own protective clothing, will be provided by the Company such clothing as raincoats, mackinaws, hats, and rubber boots.
(For the Gas Division) — Rain Time — No employee shall be required to lose any scheduled time on account of rain, nor any time when called for planned work outside of the normal workweek schedule. The authority to reassign employees from the work temporarily stopped by rain or other work shall be reserved to the Company. Transportation shall be provided by the Company to and from the location of the reassigned work. Whenever it is imperative to continue work while it is raining, protective clothing shall be provided by the Company.
30
Section 8.4.	Work Sharing. (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) Allocation of work to other groups than those which are regularly assigned to do it shall never be on an arbitrary basis, and the department involved will discuss with the chairperson of the bargaining unit or his/her substitute, as far in advance as possible, any unusual allocation.
Section 8.5.	Outside Contractors. (See Sec. 12.2c) (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) a. If Management proposes to contract work which is regularly and customarily done by the employees in a bargaining unit, and such contracting appears to threaten their security of employment, the chairperson or chief steward of the division will be given prior notice thereof.
b. Work will not be contracted out for the purpose of laying off or reducing in classification employees who regularly and customarily do such work. (Reference: Letter by William G. Meese dated June 19, 1969.)
(For the Gas Division) Contract Work — (See Sec. 12.2 c) The Company agrees that it will not contract any work that its employees can efficiently and expeditiously perform and which is ordinarily and customarily done by its regular employees. The above language does not limit or restrict the Company’s right to contract out work as long as employees normally performing such work are not affected by layoff or a reduction of hours below forty (40) per week.
Section 8.6.	Safety. a. The Company and the Union agree that the safety of the employees and the public is a shared value that requires the commitment and engagement of all employees.
To that end, the Company and the Union agree to share responsibility to:
•	Develop and continuously improve safety programs and processes that reduce injury potentials, reduce workers compensation costs and comply with governmental regulations.
•	Develop and maintain a properly staffed safety organization, comprised of Management and Union personnel working in a cooperative and coordinated manner that will assist Management in their responsibility to provide a safe working environment.
31
•	Support a safety committee structure that works proactively on key safety program elements including OSHA and MIOSHA laws.
•	To cooperate in placing into effect and maintaining safety rules and practices and ensuring that the laws governing health and safety shall be complied with by the Company, the employees, and the Union.
The Company also agrees to provide training to employees, safety committees and safety representatives and funding as necessary to meet this shared responsibility.
b.	In order to meet our shared interests of assuring the health and safety of the workforce, the parties agree to the importance of effective joint health and safety committees and agree such committees will meet on Company time. To achieve and maintain an environment in which joint health and safety committees operate effectively, the parties further agree that Senior Management will continue to provide oversight and guidance for the joint health and safety process provided herein. The DTE Energy Joint Health & Safety Committee will continue to ensure the effectiveness of the safety committee process and assist in the development and implementation of safety and health policies, programs, procedures and processes throughout the organization.
c.	The Company is committed to and will continue to furnish properly fitted safety clothing and equipment as customarily furnished, and as safe and comfortable working conditions as practical under conditions existing at the time will be maintained. The Company shall continue to make sanitary and healthful provisions for the safety of its employees during the hours of employment, and the employees shall comply with all the safety rules established.
d.	The Company commits that its efforts, in full concert with Local 223, to protect the safety of employees will not diminish in any way as to a result of the passage of electric utility restructuring legislation and the issuance of restructuring orders by the MPSC.
e.	In the event the parties cannot reach agreement as provided in marginal paragraph (a) and (b) above the Company may implement their decision and the Union may grieve.
f.	(For the Gas Division) - Should an employee working alone in the field become apprehensive of his or her safety in the course of his or her
32
work, the employee will immediately notify the Dispatch Board of his or her concern and of the reasons therefore. Supervisory personnel will determine whether the employee should attempt to execute the work order or leave the area and defer the work order. In the event supervisory personnel determine that the work order should not be deferred, the employee will be instructed to stand outside of the area and await assistance which will be made available to the employee through his or her immediate supervisor. The supervisor will stand by on the job site until the job is completed if the job cannot be deferred.
Section 8.7.	Minimum Pay Allowance. (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history)
a.	A minimum pay allowance equivalent to four (4) hours at straight time, including such travel time as is allowed herein, will be paid an employee who reports at the Company’s request for work entirely outside and not continuous with his/her regular work period. The continuity of an overtime period with the regular work period or the continuity of an overtime period shall not be considered to be interrupted by time out for eating a meal, even though such time is not paid.
b.	The guarantee of a minimum allowance shall apply only to the first two (2) call-ins on any workday or off day.
(For the Gas Division) Call-In Pay - Employees called in to work and sent home shall receive not less than four (4) hours pay.
Section 8.8.	Moving Expenses. (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) a. If the headquarters of an employee is changed at the Company’s request and it is necessary to change the employee’s residence, the Company will pay the necessary moving expenses upon receiving a receipted moving bill from the employee within one (1) year of the date of change of headquarters (unless the time is specifically extended by Management in writing). When the employee submits his/her receipted moving bill, the employee will be given an additional sum of money to offset other relocation expenses he/she may have incurred. That sum shall be the current per diem allowance (reference Section 8.17) times thirty (30). Such an employee will be given as much notice as practicable to permit the employee to arrange living quarters in the new locality. However, a change of headquarters because an employee
33
applied for a job at a different location or headquarters or upon a job more than thirty (30) days after layoff is not a change at the Company’s request.
b. In the Electrical System Substations when the Company, in lieu of requesting a specific employee to change his/her headquarters, allows employees to bid to fill a job, the Company will pay moving expenses (subject to the foregoing time limits set forth in Paragraph a of this Section 8.8 above) only for the first employee required to change his/her residence in each cycle of bidding.
Section 8.9.	Job Descriptions, Wage Benchmarking, and Pay Rate Negotiations. (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history)
a.	It is understood and agreed that Management reserves the exclusive right to determine the duties of any classification.
b.	Management will furnish the President of the Union with copies of job descriptions (including titles and qualifications such as licenses, degrees, and course requirements) for all classifications covered by this Agreement. Should the Company contemplate (1) implementing a new classification or (2) substantially changing an existing classification, the Company will advise the President of the Union of such changes at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed effective date of such changes. During this thirty (30) day period, the Union and the Company will enter into negotiations in an attempt to reach agreement on such changes, including whether such changes were substantial.
c.	If the Union does not believe a job description for a Union represented classification, either an existing job description or one newly brought under the Agreement, accurately reflects the significant duties and responsibilities of the classification, the President of the Union will so advise the Company’s Director of Human Relations. The Director of Human Relations will arrange a meeting with all the necessary parties to attempt to reach agreement on a revised job description and whether such changes are substantial.
d.	If Management creates a new classification and they want to post and
34
fill such a new classification as soon as possible, the parties will attempt to reach quick agreement on a tentative pay rate and job description for such a classification. If agreement cannot be reached, Management’s proposed pay rate and job description will be put into effect. However, within six months after such a new classification becomes operational, the process in Paragraph e of this Section 8.9 will be followed.
e.	Direct negotiations between the parties will be used to determine the pay rate of any classification covered by this Agreement provided the classification is (1) a new classification, (2) a classification which is brought within the jurisdiction of this Agreement, or (3) a classification already covered by this Agreement, the duties of which have been substantially revised. In direct negotiations, a joint Negotiating Committee will first attempt to reach agreement on slotting the job into existing jobs in the Agreement which have been previously benchmarked through wage surveys. If such agreement cannot be reached, Management will assign a tentative pay rate and the parties will submit the classification to a joint Benchmarking Committee. Unless otherwise agreed, the parties will conduct a wage survey for any new job, substantially changed job, or any classification brought within the jurisdiction of this Agreement at least once during the term of this Agreement. The survey will be conducted using a mutually agreed to third party and follow the basic agreements reached by the parties in completing their extensive 1998 wage survey. The Benchmarking Committee will report their findings to the Negotiating Committee. The parties will then attempt to negotiate a final pay rate. If not resolved through negotiations, the pay rate proposed by Management shall be put into effect, subject to the Union’s right to request mediation of the issue. If not resolved in mediation, the Union has the right to process a grievance through arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision will be confined to the reasonableness of the process used by Management to determine the pay rate.
f.	It is the intent of the parties that all employees be paid within the pay rates established by the above process. However, if a pay rate for a classification is reduced through the above process, an incumbent’s pay will not be reduced. Rather, the incumbents will be brought within the established pay rates through the use of lump sums instead of General Increases being given to others in the same classification who are within the established pay rates.
35
Section 8.10.	Temporary Assignment to a Higher-Rated Classification. (For those listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history)
a.	If there is a need to temporarily fill OPT represented job for 90 calendar days or more, they will be posted and filled following Section 8.38 of this agreement. Unless the parties otherwise mutually agree, such assignments will not exceed the posted duration of the assignment. If there is a need to temporarily fill an OPT represented job for less than 90 calendar days, Management may canvass employees based on their availability, skills and location. Seniority will be considered when selecting volunteers for these assignments. Unless the parties otherwise mutually agree, such assignments will not exceed 90 calendar days.
b.	When temporarily assigned to a higher rated OPT represented job, OPT represented employees will receive daily step-up pay of 5%, not to exceed the maximum rate of the temporary job. No step-up pay will be granted if the selected employee is already above the maximum rate of the temporary job. A higher rated OPT job is defined as one having a higher maximum pay than the employee’s current OPT represented job. While on such temporary assignments, employees will continue to accumulate seniority in their permanent OPT represented classification.
Temporary Assignments for those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history to Non-Represented Classifications. a. Management may canvass employees based on their availability, skills and location. Seniority will be considered when selecting volunteers for these assignments. Employees selected for these assignments will, upon termination of such an assignment, be returned to their permanent OPT represented classification.
b.	When temporarily assigned to a non-represented job, OPT represented employees will receive daily step-up pay of 5%, not to exceed the midpoint of the pay zone of the temporary job. No step-up pay will be granted if the selected employee is already above the midpoint of the Pay Zone of the temporary job. The seniority of such employees will be determined in accordance with Subsection 7.5d of the Agreement. No employee shall be forced to accept a change in role assignment.
(For the Trade Bargaining Units) - If an employee is assigned to a higher-rated classification, (1) the rate for which he/she has previously qualified
36
by working in the classification on either a permanent or temporary basis, (2) the lowest pay rate in the higher-rated classification, or (3) one pay grade over employee’s current pay rate, whichever is highest, provided this shall not exceed the maximum pay rate of the higher classification. This provision does not apply to an employee holding a substitute classification or a dual-rate classification, or an employee assigned for instruction who does not relieve another employee or one whose pay rate is based on relieving a higher classification. If an employee is assigned to a higher-rated classification for less than one (1) full hour in a day, he/she shall receive no increase in pay. When the employee is returned to his/her regular classification, he/she shall also return to his/her regular rate.
b.	If an employee is assigned for four (4) or more hours to a higherrated classification both on the day before and the day after a holiday or other absence for which he/she is excused with pay, the absence will be paid for at the higher rate.
c.	If the reasonable qualifications and abilities of the employees available for temporary assignments to higher-rated classifications are not significantly different, the senior employee will normally be assigned. “Significant difference” shall be “head and shoulders difference”, and such factors as advance licenses or step-up experience shall not of themselves amount to significant differences. This provision shall not require the shifting of employees between crews or work locations for short assignments. A short assignment is defined as thirty (30) working days or less. Said short assignments will be made first to employees at the location and then in sequence to the next nearest locations.
(For the Gas Division with exception of Credit & Collection Department) Advanced Assignment Opportunities- Opportunities for advanced assignment for promotion shall depend upon the need for additional employees in higher classified jobs.
(For Gas Division Credit & Collection Department) Employees temporarily assigned to a higher classification within the Credit & Collection Department will receive $0.75 per hour added to their base pay. Employees temporarily assigned to a non-represented position outside the Bargaining unit will receive $1.00 per hour added to their base pay.
37
Section 8.11.	Temporary Assignment to a Lower-Rated Classification. An employee assigned temporarily to a lower-rated classification shall not be reduced in classification or pay during such assignment.
Section 8.12.	Work Done by Supervisors. (For the Trade) - The primary function of a supervisor is supervision. During regular working hours, supervisors will not do work of employees covered by this Agreement except that customarily done. Outside of regular work periods a supervisor shall not be permitted to do work which will act to reduce the number of employees normally required for the job. This shall not preclude the supervisor working in an emergency. If a layoff occurs in any classification, no supervisor shall be permitted to do work of employees in such classifications.
Work Done by Supervisors. (For those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) - The primary function of a supervisor is supervision. Supervisors will not do work of employees covered by this Agreement except that customarily done. It is not the Company’s intention to use supervisors to displace or replace bargaining unit employees. This shall not preclude the supervisor working in an emergency or occasionally working to meet the customers’ needs.
(For the Gas Division) Supervisory Work - Supervisory, technical or confidential employees may be assigned to the inspection of contract work on new main installations provided that the Company shall also assign one employee from the bargaining unit to the same job or jobs. In addition, supervisory, technical or confidential employees may perform work normally assigned to members of the bargaining unit when it is for the purpose of instructing employees within the bargaining unit, or during periods of emergency, or when the work is associated with such supervisory, technical, or confidential employees’ regular assignments, except that in the latter case, the time involved shall not exceed 20 percent of the workday. It is expressly agreed that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to limit the clerical work which is now performed by the Station Clerks, now employed by the Company, or their successors, nor prohibit the performance of such work by additional Station Clerks who may be assigned to any new station.
38
Section 8.13.	Medical Examinations. (For the Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) -If medical examinations are required by the Company for an employee, they shall be at the Company’s expense. Written reports of such examinations will be given to an employee, upon request from the employee, except where the examination is a routine pre-hire examination for someone new to the Company, or an examination to determine if an employee who has been absent is ready to return to work, or in first-aid situations not requiring medical attention beyond first-aid. If such employee is not satisfied with the conclusions of said examinations required by the Company, when such conclusions affect his/her status as an employee, the employee may, at his/her own expense, submit a report obtained from a doctor of his/her own choosing for consideration by the Company. If the Union believes the action taken by the Management after such consideration is arbitrary, it may process the case through the grievance procedure, including arbitration.
(For the Gas Division) The Company reserves the right to require that an employee returning from a non-occupational disability be examined by the Company doctor on Company time and at Company expense and his/her determination shall govern whether or not the employee is medically able to return to work.
Section 8.14.	Employees’ Cars. (For the Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) - a. Generally, no employee shall be required to use his/her car in the performance of his/her work or when traveling from job to job in the Company. Employees’ cars used for Company business with the Management’s consent shall be paid for at the rates established by the Management on a Company-wide basis. If an employee does not wish to rent his/her own car to the Company, the Company will furnish means of transportation as required. Periodically, Management will review with the Union, if the Union requests such review, the line of reasoning followed in establishing the aforesaid rates.
b.	As an exception to Paragraph a of this Section 8.14, employees in the following classifications are required to own or lease a car and to use such a car in the performance of their job, including traveling from job to job and home to job.

As the needs of the Company necessitate, Management may, after discussing the matter with the involved Bargaining Unit Chairperson, add other classifications to the above list. Also, after discussing the matter with the Union, the Company may for sound business reasons, provide Company vehicles to employees in the above classifications.
Section 8.15.	Reimbursable Expenses. a. If an employee properly notifies the Company of reimbursable expenses incurred by him/her, the employee shall be reimbursed for such expenses not later than twenty (20) calendar days following such notice.
40
b.	The Company will reimburse employees for the required fees to obtain or renew any Company required licenses, except standard driver’s license.

Employees assigned to report to the Operation Resource Center (ORC) will be required to report to the ORC at their regular starting time, with his/her own transportation, with no reimbursement for travel or over-time. If an employee is assigned to report to a Training Center other than the ORC using their personal vehicle the employee would be paid mileage and a travel time allowance equal to the time to travel between his/her home and the ORC or his/her normal work location and the ORC whichever is least.
Travel Within the Company Service Area. (For the Trade, and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history and the Credit and Collection Department within the Gas Division.) a. Except as otherwise specifically stated in this Agreement, if an employee is asked to report at or quit from a location within the Company service area other than the employee’s regular headquarters or work area, the employee will, in each case, be given transportation costs and a travel time allowance equal to the time required to travel between his/her home or regular headquarters or work area and the job, whichever is the least.
If such an employee is authorized to drive his/her car, the actual mileage between the job and home, but not to exceed the distance between the job and the employee’s regular headquarters or work area, will be considered as mileage on Company business.
b.	As an exception to the foregoing Paragraph a of this Section 8.16, if an employee in the Civil and Specialty Trades Occupational Group in Substations or in the Maintenance Occupational Group in Power Generation who is assigned to a regular work area (see Section 8.27) is temporarily assigned to a location within another work area, or to Harbor Beach Power Plant, he/she will report and quit on the job, working the customary eight (8) hours per day, and he/she will be paid for each day when
41
he/she reports to such temporary assignment an expense reimbursement allowance based on the following table, in lieu of any allowance otherwise payable under the foregoing Paragraph a of this Section 8.16:
One-way distance in miles between regular work area	Hours at straight-
and temporary	time pay at pay
reporting point	grade T-10
0 thru 9	1
over 9 & thru 19	2
over 19 & thru 29	3
over 29	4
The foregoing notwithstanding, when such an assignment is to the Harbor Beach Power Plant the employee will also be allowed travel time for one round trip for each assignment, but at least for one round trip per week. Such travel time may be allowed during straight-time hours or outside the regular schedule.
(For the Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history)
c.	When an employee is sent from his/her reporting point to a job at another location within his/her work area during the same workday and when he/she drives to work, the foreman shall decide which of two things shall be done, either:
(1)	The employee shall be paid time and transportation to drive his/her car to the new location and quit from there, if the employee is willing to rent his/her car to the Company (see Section 8.14), or
(2)	The employee shall be transported to the new location and back again on Company time.
d.	In addition to normal overtime pay, an employee who timely reports for an “at-once” overtime assignment will receive the following additional compensation:
(1)	If an employee is called to report, at a location other than the employee’s regular headquarters, for work “at once” on an off-day or entirely outside the employee’s scheduled hours, all time and transportation
42
expense, including that between the employee’s home and the job and back home, shall be at the Company’s expense. The employee is expected to report as soon as possible, unless he/she is instructed to report at a later specified time within two (2) hours. Time shall start with the time of call and shall include the time required to reach home afterward. If the work continues on into the employee’s scheduled hours, only time and transportation expense to the job will be allowed. Work area employees will be treated the same as employees who report to a location other than their regular headquarters.
(2)	If an employee is called at home and accepts an “at-once” overtime assignment requiring the employee to report to his/her regular headquarters, the employee is expected to report as soon as possible. Provided the employee actually reports to work within one (1) hour, the employee will receive a travel time allowance of one (1) hour, at the applicable overtime rate (backed up from the time the employee arrives at his/her regular headquarters), an additional one (1) hour from the job back home, and round trip mileage from his/her home to his/her regular headquarters. However, if the work continues into the employee’s next scheduled work period, only the one (1) hour travel time allowance from the home to the job and only the mileage from the employee’s home to his/her regular headquarters will be paid. Further, all paid time will be considered as worked time, except qualification for rest time (reference Section 9.11) will be based on the actual time the employee is called at home and the actual time required to reach home after the job is completed.
(For the Trade Bargaining Units)
e.	An employee who reports back on one of the days of his/her standard work week for less than eight (8) hours of prearranged work outside of and not continuous with the employee’s regular shift will be reimbursed for the travel expense required by the extra trips between home and the job and back home. This provision does not apply to an employee who receives an area premium during the assignment.
f.	It is the responsibility of the supervisor to tell the employee what means of transportation is authorized and will be paid for under Paragraphs d and e of this Section 8.16.
g.	When the Company provides vehicles to transport employees between jobs, such vehicles will be heated or otherwise suitable to protect
43
the employees from the weather. Employees will not be required to ride in the same compartment with heavy tools or heavy equipment, and the Company shall furnish, in locker rooms, reasonable provisions for drying clothes.
(For those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election / Recognition history) Exempt employees who are called into work entirely outside of and not continuous with their regular work schedules will be paid for all hours worked at the straight-time rate.
Section 8.17. Overnight Lodging and Meals. (For the Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history)
a.	If an employee who regularly works at one location is directed by the Management to report temporarily to another location within the Company service area, which assignment makes it necessary for the employee to remain away from home overnight and to purchase meals, lodging, and transportation, such necessary expense will be paid by the Company upon the approval of the employee’s supervisor, it being understood that an employee who prefers to disburse the necessary expense the employee has the option to do so. Each employee so affected shall be notified of such assignment before being released from work on the previous day, except in emergencies. On such an assignment, travel time and transportation between such temporary headquarters and the employee’s regular headquarters shall be at Company expense once each week. As an alternative to documented expense reimbursement an employee may elect to accept a per diem allowance of $73.10 per day for each day when the employee reports and quits on the job working the customary eight (8) hours per day, said per diem allowance to cover all meals, lodging, travel time and transportation.
b.	As an exception to the foregoing Paragraph a of this Section 8.17 if an employee in the Civil and Specialty Trades Occupational Group in Substations or in the Maintenance Occupational Group in Power Generation who is assigned to a regular work area (see Section 8.27) is directed by Management to report temporarily to a location within another work area, or to Harbor Beach Power Plant, which assignment makes it necessary for the employee to remain away from home overnight and to purchase meals, lodging, and transportation, he/she will report and quit on the job, working the customary eight (8) hours per day, and he/she will be paid for each day when he/she reports to such temporary assignment an
44
expense reimbursement allowance based on the following table, in lieu of any allowance otherwise payable under the foregoing paragraph a:
One-way distance

c.	The most qualified candidate meeting the posted qualifications will be selected. However, if the vacancy is within the bargaining unit and the most qualified represented and non-represented candidates are deemed to be relatively equal, the most senior bargaining unit member will be selected. If the vacancy is outside the bargaining unit and the most qualified represented and non-represented candidates are deemed to be relatively equal, the employee with the most Company service will be selected. (Note: Relatively equal is defined as 0.2 or less differential in the ratings of the employees being compared).
d.	If the posted vacancy is within the bargaining unit, a monitoring panel comprised of two Management members and two bargaining unit members will be formed. The panel, after receiving training on interviewing selection

In the event of disagreement, the matter may be processed through the grievance procedure to the President of the Company, or his/her delegate, whose decision shall be controlling, except that the question of whether the by-pass has been arbitrary or discriminatory may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement.

c.	The parties agree that for new work/new technology the criteria for the selection process for employee(s) testing new work/new technology will be determined by the Union leadership and the Company.

c.	An employee with six (6) months or more service may request a leave of absence because of illness extending beyond the period provided in the Agreement in Sections 10.7and 10.9 for pay during illness. In justifiable cases and upon proper proof presented to the Company, Management will grant such leave of absence without pay, but not for a period of time which is greater than the time for which the employee was paid during illness under Sections 10.7 and 10.9. Management may, at its option, grant a further extension.
Section 8.38.	Posting Notices of Vacancies. (For the Trade) a. If a vacancy occurs in any one of the bargaining units covered by this Agreement and such vacancy is not filled by promotion or transfer within the group, a notice of such vacancy shall be posted for a period of eight (8) calendar days in the bargaining unit in which it occurs. An advanced copy of the posting will be sent to the respective divisional Chairperson, for informational purposes. The company may post one job posting notice with selection priority setout in accordance with this Section 8.38.
b.	If such a vacancy is not filled by a member of the bargaining unit, notice of the vacancy shall be posted in other bargaining units of the same department for a period of eight (8) calendar days. If the reasonable qualifications and abilities of the employees being considered as a result of this posting are not significantly different, total length of service in the Company shall govern. “Significant difference” shall be “head and shoulders difference”, and such factors as advance licenses or step-up experience
61
shall not of themselves amount to “significant differences”.
c.	If such a vacancy occurs in any one of the bargaining units covered by this Agreement, which is not filled by the foregoing procedure, notice of this vacancy will be posted on the bulletin boards company-wide stating that such a vacancy exists. Such vacancies will not be filled, except on a temporary basis, until at least eight (8) calendar days after the posting of such notices, in order that employees in other units may apply. If the reasonable qualifications and abilities of the employees being considered are not significantly different, total length of service with the Company shall govern. “Significant difference” shall be “head and shoulders difference’’, and such factors as advance licenses or step-up experience shall not of themselves amount to “significant differences”. When seniority is not a factor in filling a job vacancy the employee will receive notification and reason of the non-selection.
d.	Failure of employees to avail themselves of opportunities for promotion or voluntary transfer shall not prejudice their future opportunities.
e.	Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is agreed that any person who is hired for or voluntarily transfers to any Union represented classification at Fermi 2 may not bid to any other job in the Company for a period of three (3) years from his/her date of transfer to Fermi 2. As an exception to this rule, a person in a Fermi 2 job may bid on other Fermi 2 jobs. Management may unilaterally waive this three (3) year requirement; however, Management’s failure to grant such a waiver will not be subject to the grievance procedure.
f.	Unless otherwise mutually agreed, employees with less than six (6) months of Company service shall not be considered for any job vacancy out-side of their bargaining unit.
Posting Notices of Vacancies. (For those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) a. If a vacancy occurs in a rep-resented or non-represented classification listed in the Attachment B (The OPT Wage Rate Schedule) in this Agreement, it will be posted for a period of eight (8) calendar days throughout the organization.
b.	The most qualified candidate meeting the posted qualifications will be selected. However, if the vacancy is within the bargaining unit and the most
62
qualified represented and non-represented candidates are deemed to be relatively equal, the most senior bargaining unit member will be selected. If the vacancy is outside the bargaining unit and the most qualified represented and non-represented candidates are deemed to be relatively equal, the employee with the most Company service will be selected. (Note: Relatively equal is defined as 0.2 or less differential in the ratings of the employees being compared.)
c.	If the posted vacancy is within the bargaining unit, a monitoring panel comprised of two Management members and two bargaining unit members will be formed. The panel, after receiving training on interviewing selection skills, will recommend the most qualified candidate for the vacancy. Although not binding, Management will thoroughly review the panel’s recommendations before selecting an applicant to fill the position.
d.	If the posted vacancy is outside the bargaining unit and one or more qualified candidates are represented employees, a represented employee may be asked to serve on the monitoring panel or the Union may review the proposed recommendations before any selection is made to understand the criteria and proposed selection.
e.	Failure of employees to avail themselves of opportunities for promotion or voluntary transfer shall not prejudice his/her future opportunities.
f.	Unless otherwise mutually agreed, employees with less than six (6) months of Company service shall not be considered for any job vacancy outside of their bargaining unit.
g.	If the Management proposes to by-pass any employee with greater seniority or Company service, the Management will discuss the matter with the chairperson of the bargaining unit (at least five (5) days before the bypass is made effective) in an attempt to reach an agreement thereon before such a by-pass is made. In the event of disagreement, the matter may be processed through the grievance procedure to the President of the Company, or his/her delegate, whose decision shall be controlling, except that the question of whether the by-pass has been arbitrary or discriminatory may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement. If the arbitrator finds the by-pass was arbitrary or discriminatory, the by-pass will be canceled.

c.	For the purposes of this Section 8.40, a work period of four (4) or more hours for an employee on a holiday or off-day is considered as a regular work period within the meaning of Paragraphs a and b of this Section 8.40, provided notice of such work is given to the employee before the start of the on-call period preceding the prearranged work.
d.	(For those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) Exempt employees are not eligible for the on-call allowance.

A large and troublesome clinker is defined as an abnormal clinker which requires one hour or more of continuous extended actual poking.
Section 8.44.	Performance Evaluations. (For those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) a. The parties are com

HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
(For the Gas Division see Article 9 of the Gas Addendum)
Section 9.1.	Standard Workday and Work Week. The standard workday shall consist of eight (8) working hours, consecutive except as interrupted by lunch periods. [For those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history the standard workday shall consist of eight (8) working hours, consecutive except as interrupted by lunch periods or altered by departures from schedules], and the standard work week shall consist of five (5) regularly scheduled eight (8) hour work periods on as many work-days. The two (2) remaining days in the pay week of seven (7) consecutive days from Monday through Sunday shall be known as “off-days,” and shall, within the limits of reasonable operating procedure, be scheduled consecutively. (For the Trade) - When an employee is required to delay the start of his/her normal unpaid midshift meal for one (1) hour or more, the normal midshift meal period will be considered as time worked, and he/she may eat on Company time as soon thereafter as is practical.
Section 9.2.	Duration of Workdays and Off-Days. The workday (including holidays) begins at the starting hour of the scheduled work period and extends for twenty-four (24) hours, except on shift change. Any off-day begins at the same starting hour of the previously scheduled work period and extends for twenty-four (24) hours, except on shift change. When workdays or off-days are changed or rotated, workdays or off-days may be longer or shorter than twenty-four (24) hours and, in such cases, the workday following the change begins at the starting hour of the next scheduled shift.
66
Section 9.3.	Change in Work Schedules. No changes in the present work schedules will be made until the matter is discussed with the Bargaining Unit Chairperson or his/her substitute along with one additional Union designated representative and, if agreement on such changes cannot be reached, the schedules proposed by the Company shall be worked subject to the Union’s right to bring a grievance under Article 4, but arbitration under Article 5 shall be limited to the question of whether the schedule proposed by the Company is arbitrary. The arbitrator’s decision will uphold or deny the proposed schedule. The Company will review and discuss with the Union suggestions for improvement in work schedules.
Section 9.4.	Shift Schedules. Where shift schedules are in force, the Company shall make every reasonable effort to equalize Saturday and Sunday work. The shifts shall be known as the night shift (starting about midnight), the day shift (starting around 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.), and the evening shift (starting around 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.). For shift employees, not more than one (1) regular work period shall be scheduled in any twenty-four (24) hour period, except on scheduled changes of shift.
Section 9.5.	Non-Shift Schedules. The regular working hours for nonshift employees will usually be included between approximately 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., except for the customary changes due to light or traffic conditions. Normally, the five (5) regular workdays will be Monday through Friday. However, Saturday may be scheduled as one (1) of the five (5) regular workdays when conditions are such that the work cannot, within the limits of reasonable operating procedure, be covered within the normal Monday through Friday work week. The working schedules of such employees shall be assigned in advance in accordance with Section 9.8.
Section 9.6.	Departures from Schedules. Departures from the regularly scheduled working hours may be made for an employee’s convenience, provided the Company’s service is adequately maintained with no increase in cost.
Section 9.7.	Due Notice - Change of Shift. Due notice of a change from one regular shift to another is defined as follows:
a.	Notice which is given through published work and shift schedules and regular revisions of them; or
67
b.	Notice which is given twenty-four (24) hours before the start of the new shift; except that
c.	For an employee who is currently working a non-shift schedule, due notice of a change of shift which shortens a Sunday off-day by eight (8) hours or more is notice which is given by the end of the shift on Friday of the same pay week; and
(For the Trade) — d. An employee in the Civil and Specialty Trades Occupational Group in Substations or the Maintenance Occupational Group in Power Generation and Fermi 2 Unit will not have his/her shift changed unless it appears that there will be enough work on the new shift to last for five (5) consecutive days; and unless such a shift under this paragraph actually lasts five (5) consecutive days. If such new shift does not continue for five (5) consecutive days, work on that shift shall be considered and paid for as work outside of and in lieu of such employee’s regular shift under Paragraph a of Section 9.l0; and
e.	A CTO Relief employee will work day shifts on days of his/her own choice unless otherwise assigned by Management and when working a day shift on a day of his/her own choice shall have no stated number of hours’ notice for a change of shift; and
f.	When a CTO Relief employee is working other than a day shift on a day of his/her own choice, he/she shall receive the same notice of a change from that shift as any other employee would receive.
Section 9.8.	Due Notice - Change of Off-Days. It is understood that due notice of change of off-days has been given when the changes are:
a.	Normal changes due to shift rotation; or are
b.	Changes in work schedules, notice of which and of the necessity therefore has been given to the Union and the employee by the end of the shift on Thursday of the pay week preceding the change; or are due to
c.	Promotions (excluding temporary promotions for two (2) weeks or less); or result
d.	When the employee is transferred or bids into an occupation with a different schedule of off-days.
68
e.	(For the Trade) - The provisions of this Section do not apply to CTO Relief employees for whom either off-day may be changed on eight (8) hours’ notice.
Section 9.9.	Premium Rates. Hours worked under the following conditions will be compensated at the following premium rates:
a.	Hours worked outside of regular shift hours on any Companyobserved holiday - double time. Hours worked during regular shift hours on a holiday will be paid at time and one-half and, in addition, a holiday allowance of eight (8) hours at the employee’s regular rate will be paid under the conditions provided in Section 9.13 for the regular hours of work.
b.	Hours worked in excess of sixteen (16) in any one (1) workday, off-day, or continuous work period-double time.
c.	Hours worked outside of the hours and days established for any employee by his/her current work schedules will be paid at time and one-half (except as modified by Paragraphs a, b or c of this Section 9.9), provided that hours worked on a shift or an off-day which is changed in accordance with Sections 9.7 and 9.8 will be considered as hours established by the current work schedules.
d.	Hours worked on any off-day in the pay week other than Sunday will be paid at time and one-half.
e.	Hours worked on any Sunday off-day in the pay week will be paid at double time.
f.	For the first period of one (1) week, time and one-half will be paid for hours which do not overlap the regular schedule on an evening or night shift which has been established because of the needs of the service for work which is normally done days. After the first week, hours worked on such shifts will be paid for at an employee’s regular hourly rate, plus a separate shift premium which shall be in the amount provided in Article 11 for each shift. Regular overtime rates shall be paid for hours worked beyond the first eight (8) hours of each workday of the newly scheduled shift. This Paragraph of this Section 9.9 applies only to employees who are in an affected classification as of the date when the evening or night shift is first established. The premium provided by Paragraph f of this Section 9.9 applies
69
only to those of the aforementioned employees who are actually assigned to the evening or night shift sometime within the first fifty-two (52) weeks following the date when that evening or night shift is first established.
g.	When Sunday is scheduled as part of an employee’s standard five (5) day week, if no half-time or full-time premium applies to the time worked, a premium of twenty-five percent (25%) of the employee’s straight-time hourly rate shall be paid for such time worked on Sunday. If the employee is entitled to either an area differential or an afternoon or night shift premium, such premiums will be added after the twenty-five percent (25%) premium has been applied.
h.	Should more than one premium rate apply to the same hours, only the highest premium rate will be paid. The premium rate will be one and one-half (1-1/2) or two (2) times, as the case may be, the hourly rate in effect for the employee at the time the work is performed.
i.	Short Shift Change. If a shift worked with or without due notice begins eight (8) hours or less from the end of the last regular shift worked, time and one-half will be paid for the first four (4) hours of the new shift, then double time up to the starting time of the next workday or off-day, whichever is first. This does not apply when a shift of an employee’s own choice is a contributing factor to a short shift change.
(For those listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history)
j.	Exempt Employees:
(1)	Exempt employees should expect to work some number of hours (casual overtime) outside their regular work schedule without additional pay.
(3)	When Sunday is scheduled as part of an employee’s standard five day week, the employee will be paid straight time.
(4)	When scheduled for overtime (non casual), the employee will be paid straight time.
When working on a holiday, the employee will be paid time and one-half for all hours worked.
70
Section 9.10.	Offsetting Overtime. a. No employee shall be required to take time off during his/her standard work week for overtime, including pre-arranged overtime, worked or to be worked. However, this shall not preclude the scheduling (at premium rates) of an eight (8) hour or longer work period on a regular workday outside of and in lieu of the employee’s regular work period on that day.
b.	If work is not given to an employee who is assigned prearranged overtime work which is not canceled by reasonable notice, the employee will be paid from the prearranged starting time if the employee is available and ready to work.
c.	If an employee is held over for an overtime assignment which is not continuous with his/her shift but begins two (2) hours or less after the employee’s normal quitting time, the Company will not require the employee to take time off without pay between his/her normal quitting time and the start of the overtime work, except for a one-half hour period (or longer if the employee requests it) for a meal.
Section 9.11.	Rest Time. a. When an employee is required to work such hours that all, or nearly all, of the employee’s normal sleeping time is lost, it is the supervisor’s responsibility to release him for a sufficient rest period as soon as the work permits. If an employee works such hours that the employee should be released for rest as soon as the work permits, but the employee prefers to forego his/her rest and work additional hours, the employee should not be permitted to work but should be directed to rest.
b.	If the necessities of the work permit, and sixteen (16) hours or more have been worked in a twenty-four (24) hour period, the rest period should be at least eight (8) hours.
c.	A rest period may be provided either because long hours have been worked or because they are anticipated.
d.	An employee who is released under Paragraphs a, b, or c of this Section 9.11 by his/her supervisor during any hours of the employee’s regularly scheduled forty (40) hour work week will be paid at the employee’s straight-time rate for rest time during such scheduled hours.
e.	When an employee who has been released from his/her regularly scheduled hours for a paid rest period is required to return to work within
71
ten (10) hours of his/her release (but not otherwise), the employee’s paid rest time and the employee’s worked time for the workday shall be added together to determine when double time should begin.
Section 9.12.	Distribution of Overtime. (For the Trade) - a. Such overtime as becomes necessary shall be distributed without favoritism among the qualified employees in their respective overtime work groups with the objective of obtaining equal distribution.
b.	The term “overtime” is defined as time paid for at time and one-half or double time except for such payments for short shift changes, and/or changes of shifts or off-days without due notice, and/or the establishment of an evening or night shift for work normally done days, and/or for work outside of and in lieu of an employee’s regular work period, and/or for travel time. Union and Management representatives in each bargaining unit are not precluded, however, from agreeing to add if they wish certain non-overtime premium payments to the overtime records, provided it is understood that work assignments involving non-overtime premium payments need not be made on the basis of standings on the overtime record.
c.	The respective overtime work groups will be defined in each bargaining unit. If the parties fail to agree on the definition of them, or subsequent revisions in them, Management’s determination will be put into effect. However, the Union may process through the grievance procedure, including arbitration, the question of whether Management’s determination was arbitrary.
d.	For the purpose of accounting for the distribution of overtime, an employee low on the overtime list who is not available when called for an overtime assignment in his/her overtime work group will be charged with the hours the employee would have been paid had he/she worked, except as otherwise agreed between the Union and Management representatives in each bargaining unit. No more than one reasonable attempt to reach anyone is required. An employee who declines an overtime assignment will be charged with the hours the employee would have been paid had the employee worked. Except in an emergency no attempt will be made to reach an employee who is utilizing CTO time or has previously reported absent. For this purpose, the vacation period will be from the time reporting off duty to the time reporting back on duty and the absence period will be from the time of the report of the absence to the time the employee is cleared for
72
duty. Off-duty employees who do not have phones listed with the Company and on this account are not offered certain overtime will be charged as though they had declined the overtime. An employee who declines to furnish his/her own transportation, or is unable to furnish his/her own transportation (for lack of license or any other reason), for an overtime assignment will be determined to have declined the overtime.
e.	When a specific maintenance or construction project is assigned to an employee or employees for completion and casual overtime work rather than another shift is required, the casual overtime will normally be worked by the employee or employees to whom the project was assigned.
f.	When an employee transfers from one overtime work group to another, the employee will be charged with the median overtime hours in his/her new group, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the Union and Management representatives in each bargaining unit.
g.	At the end of each calendar year, accumulated overtime hours of the employee with the lowest number will be reduced to zero, and the hours of the other employees will be correspondingly reduced, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the Union and Management representatives in each bargaining unit.
h.	No grievance will be filed on the distribution of overtime if emergency conditions prevent the orderly scheduling of overtime.
i.	If it is established that the Company incorrectly bypassed an employee for an overtime assignment, the by-passed employee will, within 30 working days, be offered the opportunity to work a makeup overtime assignment consisting of work which would not otherwise be done on overtime. The makeup overtime assignment will be worked on a day or days mutually agreeable to the by-passed employee and his supervisor. If they cannot agree on a mutually agreeable day or days, the employee’s Bargaining Unit Chairperson and the employee’s third-line supervisor will meet to resolve the issue. Such a makeup overtime assignment will provide overtime pay at the same premium and will be for the same number of hours worked as the by-passed employee would have received had he/she worked the missed overtime. When it is determined that makeup overtime cannot be reasonably accomplished, other resolutions (other than additional makeup overtime assignments) will be considered. Reasonably accom
73
plished means that unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties, the makeup overtime must be scheduled within thirty (30) days of the bypass and the makeup assignment must be completed within ninety (90) days. However, employees will not be entitled to meals or meal money allowances for such make-up overtime assignments.
(For those listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) -Distribution of Overtime. a. Such overtime as becomes necessary shall be distributed without favoritism among the qualified employees in their respective overtime work groups with the objective of obtaining equal distribution with the understanding necessary overtime associated with a particular customer will normally be worked by the employee who has been given the assignment to work with that customer.
b. The respective overtime work groups will be defined in the bargaining unit. Questions and/or complaints about the distribution of overtime and/or the definition of work groups will be brought before the C.U.R.B. Committee for resolution. If the C.U.R.B. Committee is unable to agree, Management’s determination will be put into effect. However, the Union may process through the grievance procedure, including arbitration, the question of whether Management’s determination was arbitrary.
Section 9.13. Holidays. The Company recognized holidays are: New Year’s Eve, New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, the day following Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve Day, and Christmas Day. With respect to holidays it is agreed that:
a.	Whenever a holiday occurs, every employee will be given a day off with pay if he/she can be spared from work. If the employee cannot be spared, the employee will be paid as provided in this Agreement for working the holiday. If the day observed as a holiday falls on one of the employee’s scheduled off-days or another scheduled holiday, another day in the same pay week or the pay week preceding or following will be designated as his/her holiday in lieu of the normally observed holiday. This day will be consecutive with the employee’s off-days. Once a day has been designated as a holiday, this designated day will not be changed unless changed by Thursday of the pay week before the week in which the designated day falls. If required to work on either his/her off-day or the day designated as his/her holiday, the regular rules for time worked on such days will be applied.
74
b.	An employee who is excused with pay on a holiday, or day designated as such, and is later required to work during his/her regularly scheduled hours will receive a minimum of twelve (12) hours’ pay for the day.
c.	Holiday pay will not be allowed an employee when the employee:
(1)	Is scheduled to work, but without good reason fails to report.
(2)	Is absent without permission on any part of the workday before or the workday after the holiday, unless it is evident that the employee was not intentionally lengthening the holiday period.
(3)	Is absent without pay the entire week in which a holiday occurs.
d.	Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, when one of the above holidays falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on the following Monday, and when one of the above holidays falls on a Saturday, it will be observed on the preceding Friday, except that when Christmas Eve Day falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on Tuesday, December 26th and, when New Year’s Eve Day falls on a Sunday, it will be observed on Tuesday, January 2nd. However, when Christmas Eve Day, New Year’s Eve Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day fall on Saturday, such holiday will be observed on Saturday by an employee who is scheduled to work such Saturday as part of his/her standard five-day week, and when Christmas Eve Day, New Year’s Eve Day, Independence Day, Christmas Day and New Year’s Day fall on Sunday, such holiday will be observed on Sunday by an employee who is scheduled to work such Sunday as part of his/her standard five-day week.
Article 10
WAGE COLLATERALS
Section 10.1.	Committee to Study Benefits. The Management agrees to meet with a Union Committee to study and to consider any reasonable change in practices of the Company as to group life, hospitalization and surgical insurance, pensions, and leave with pay for such reasons as illness, injury, and jury duty. Any mutual recommendation to change an existing practice shall become the basis for the reopening of the Agreement by either party on the subject of such practice. (See attached Joint Benefits Committee Letter)
75
Section 10.2.	Employees' Retirement Plan. These provisions apply to all Trade and OPT employees, and to benefits accrued on or after January 1, 2005 by Gas Division employees. Additionally, these provisions, except as otherwise modified in Article 10.6 of the Gas Addendum.
(Note: For Gas Division retirement benefits prior to January 1, 2005 (or January 1, 2003 for employees hired prior to January 1, 1995), see Article 10.6 of the Gas Addendum)
Provisions of the “Employees’ Retirement Plan,” together with all amendments thereto made by the Company up to the date of this Agreement, have been given to the Union. Those provisions shall be extended to the employees represented by the Union and continued for those employees for the term of this Agreement without further change, except such as the parties may mutually agree upon or those which shall be mandated by law. A general description of the Employees’ Retirement Plan is found in the Retirement Section of the Employees Handbook which has also been given to the Union. However, the actual “Employees’ Retirement Plan” will be the document used to resolve any filed claims. The plan is of the type generally referred to as a funded, trusted plan. A brief description of the major provisions of the plan follows.
a.	Employees Retiring After Age 60 or After Age 58 with 30 or More Years of Service — Eligible employees who retire at age 60 or older or after age 58 with 30 or more years of service effective May 1, 2004 will have their retirement allowance calculated by the following normal retirement formula:
Average high	Years of	Yearly
260 Weeks X 1.5% X Benefit Service = Retirement
of Pay	Allowance
Effective January 1, 2011, the basis for the determining average 260 weeks of pay for determining final average compensation is the highest non-consecutive 260 weeks over the employee’s last 10 years. This definition of final average compensation will continue to be based on “normal compensation” for the employee’s standard work week (base pay, step-up pay for termporary promotions, premium pay shifts, work area differential, Sunday work premium, and cost-of-living allowance
76
paid to certain employees), but it does not include any bonuses, overtime or other special pay. This definition of final average compensation will, however, include any lump sums paid in lieu of general increases from June 5, 1995 to June 7, 1999 and the 1% lump sum payments paid on June 3, 2003, June 3, 2002 and June 2, 2001. Lump sums paid in lieu of general increases after June 6, 2010, are included only if paid during the highest non-conseuctive 260 weeks of eligible earnings during the last 10 years of credited service. With this change, the employee’s benefit will not be less than the employee’s accrued benefit as of December 31, 2010 calculated using the highest 260 weeks of pay over the employee’s career.
If the eligible employee has less than 15 years of benefit service, the yearly retirement allowance begins at age 65.
b.	Employees Retiring Between Ages 45 and 60 Without 30 Years of Service or Between Ages 45 and 58 With 30 or More Years of Service — Eligible employees who retire between ages 45 and 60 without 30 years of service or between ages 45 and 58 with 30 or more years of service and who do not wish to defer their retirement allowance will have their retirement allowance calculated as follows:
Total yearly Retirement allowance as calculated in paragraph (a)	X
immediately above
Percentage factor from the below applicable early retirement reduction table
If the eligible employee has less than 15 years of benefit service, the yearly retirement allowance begins at age 65.

*	The allowance will be divided proportionately for ages that fall between those listed.
*	* The percentages are applied to the amount calculated by the normal retirement formula.
c.	Retirement Options — When applying for a retirement allowance, an employee must choose one of the following three options which will determine whether and how an employee’s beneficiary will receive an allowance after the employee dies:
(1)	Option III (Single Life Annuity) — This option provides an unreduced retirement allowance (as calculated in paragraph (a) or, if applicable Paragraph b of this Section 10.2) for as long as the employee lives but with no further payments to anyone after the employee dies.
78
(2)	Option II (50% Joint and Survivor Annuity) — This option provides a reduced retirement allowance during the employee’s lifetime. When the employee dies, the employee’s beneficiary will be paid one-half of that allowance for the rest of the designated beneficiary’s life. The employee may not name a new beneficiary, even if the employee remarries.
The amount received under this option is 90% of the employee’s Option III retirement allowance if the employee and his/her beneficiary are the same age. However, if the beneficiary is younger, this percentage will be reduced by 1% for each 12 full months of difference in ages. If the beneficiary is older, the percentage will be increased by 1% for each 12 full months of difference in ages up to a maximum of 100%.
If the employee is married, federal law requires that this option will apply unless the employee specifically chooses otherwise in writing. If such an employee names someone other than his/her spouse as a beneficiary (under Option II or I), the employee must have written permission from the involved spouse to do so.
If employees choose this Option II and their designated beneficiary predeceases them, the employee’s retirement allowance will, effective the first of the month after the death of the designated beneficiary, revert back to what it would have been had the employee retired under Option III.
(3)	Option IV (75% Joint & Survivor Annuity) — Effective January 1, 2009, a 75% Joint & Survivor Annuity payment option is addded from which a married participant may select. Under the optional 75% Joint & Survivor Annuity payment option, the surviving spouse will receive 75% of the reduced pension the participant was receiving prior to the participant’s death. The optional 75% Joint and Survivor Annuity will be the actuarial equivalent to the life annuity option; will not include a pop-up feature; and will have no impact on the active death benefit.
(4)	Option I (100% Joint and Survivor Annuity) — This option provides a reduced retirement allowance during the employee’s lifetime. When the employee dies, that same amount will continue to be paid to the employee’s
79
beneficiary for the rest of the beneficiary’s life. The employee may not name a new beneficiary, even if the employee remarries.
The amount received under Option I is 76.5% of the Option III retirement allowance if the employee and the employee’s beneficiary are the same age. If the beneficiary is younger, this percentage will be reduced by 1.2% for each 12 full months of difference in ages. If the beneficiary is older, the percentage will be increased by 1.2% for each 12 full months of difference in ages up to a maximum of 100%.
If employees choose this Option I and their designated beneficiary predeceases them, the employee’s retirement allowance will, effective the first of the month after the death of the designated beneficiary, revert back to what it would have been had the employee retired under Option III.
d.	Spouse’s Benefit — The plan recognizes that an employee could die before he/she starts to receive a retirement allowance. If such an employee has been married for at least one year and is vested, the plan provides for an immediate or future monthly payment to the eligible spouse for the rest of the spouse’s life. Effective January 1, 2011, the requirement that the employee has been married for at least one year in order to be eligible for a spouse’s traditional plan death benefit is eliminated. If the surviving spouse is the same age as the employee, the monthly payment will be the amount the employee’s spouse would have received under Option II (see Paragraph c (2) of this Section 10.2) had the employee left the Company on the day of death. If an employee dies after having reached age 45 and if the employee has 15 or more years of benefit service, the eligible surviving spouse will be eligible for an immediate monthly allowance. When other eligible surviving spouses qualify for future monthly allowances depends on the employee’s age and benefit years of service at the time of death.
e.	Supplemental Early Retirement Allowance — The Company will give eligible employees a Supplemental Early Retirement Allowance in addition to the employee’s normal retirement allowance. Details are as follows:
(1)	Eligibility — Employees age 55 through 61 with at least 20 years of benefit service. (2) Duration — This additional payment takes effect the day the employee’s retirement allowance begins and ends the month after the
80
employee reaches age 62 or when the employee dies, whichever comes first. The plan contains no provision to pay any portion of this supplemental amount to a surviving spouse or any other beneficiary.
(3)	Amount of Allowance — The base amount effective 7/20/04 is $2,200 per month reduced by:
The employee’s regular monthly early retirement allowance determined as if the employee had selected retirement with Option III (no payments to a survivor after employee’s death).
Twenty dollars per month for every year or partial year of Company service less than 30.
Any payment received from the Company or other sources to which the Company contributes including:
•	Social Security disability benefits for which the employee is or may become eligible for during the period that the employee is paid the Supplemental Early Retirement Allowance.
•	Workers’ Disability Compensation.
•	By the amount of any other Detroit Edison Company-provided or government plan (other than military).
Note: Total amount may be prorated for Gas Division and T&SO employees to reflect the pre-2005 benefit.
f.	Deferral of Retirement Allowance — Effective January 1, 1996, an employee who is age 45 or older with at least 15 years of benefit service or the surviving spouse of an active employee age 45 with at least 15 years of benefit service may retire and elect to defer his/her retirement allowance to any age prior to age 65.
The following rules apply to such deferrals:
(1)	Deferral of the retirement allowance will not add years of benefit service beyond what the employees had when they ceased their active employment with the Company.
81
(2)	If employees are under age 60 or under age 58 with 30 or more years of service when they elect to start collecting their deferred retirement allowance, their retirement allowance will be calculated based on their actual age at the time their deferred retirement allowance begins and the applicable Early Retirement Reduction Table. If surviving spouses elect to defer their Option II retirement allowance, they may request to start receiving the allowance at any time in the future. When they elect to start collecting their retirement allowance, it will be calculated on the age which the deceased employee would have been at the time the deferred retirement allowance begins and the applicable Early Retirement Reduction Table.
(3)	If employees are eligible for a Supplemental Early Retirement Allowance (SERA), the amount of SERA will be calculated as if such employees were not deferring their retirement allowance and, upon ceasing their active employment, employees will begin receiving their SERA. When such an employee starts receiving his/her retirement allowance, his/her SERA will not be readjusted.
g.	Breaks in Service — Effective January 1, 2011, if an employee temporarily leaves the Company, he or she may have a break in service. This will happen if an employee completes less than 501 Hours of Service in any 12 month period beginning on the employee’s employment commencement date or any anniversary thereof. If an employee has a break in service, the employee may lose credit for the Years of Credited Service and the Years of Service for Vesting that was accumulated before the break.
If an employee was vested in the Plan benefit before the break in service began and the break in service is for more than the longer of (A) five years or (B) the Years of Service completed before the break in service, the employee will lose credit for those previous years. The employee will then begin accumulating Years of Credited Service and Years of Service for Vesting as though he or she is a new employee.
If the employee was vested in the Plan benefit before the break in service began or if the employee was not vested and the break in service is for less than the longer of (A) five years or (B) the employee’s pre
82
vious Years of Credited Service, the employee will receive back credit for previous years of service after the employee’s return to the Company and completion of one more Year of Credited Service. Restoration of back credit for previous years of service shall be determined as follows: If an employee incurs a break in service and is reemployed before a one year break, the employee’s prior years of vesting service and credited service will be immediately restored. If the employee has a one year break in service and returns to work for the Company, the service the employee earned before the break will be restored when the employee completes at least 1,000 hours of service in any anniversary year following reemployment.
h.	Pension Offset for Rehired Retirees — Effective January 1, 2011, the pension benefit for an employee who is rehired after he or she has already begun to receive a pension benefit will be recalculated upon subsequent termination. The pension benefit that such employee will ultimately be eligible to receive will be the greater of the following:
(1)	The pension benefit based on the Retirement Plan provisions in effect at his or her subsequent retirement or termination date using all pay and aggregated service reduced by the actuarial equivalent of any pension benefits previously paid; or
(2)	The pension benefit which he or she was receiving at his or her initial retirement or termination date.
i.	New Hire Choice of Cash Balance or Traditional Pension Plan — An employee first hired into a position represented by Local 223 on or after January 1, 2011, who has never been previously employed with a DTE Energy enterprise company, will be offered a choice of the traditional defined benefit pension plan as described above or the New Horizon Cash Balance Plan. The New Horizon Cash Balance Plan is a hypothetical account in the defined benefit pension plan that increases annually with Company contributions equal to 7% of eligible earnings at the end of each year for each year the employee has less than 30 years of credited service plus 7.5% of eligible earnings at the end of
83
each year for each year the employee has 30 or more years of credited service, plus interest credits based on 30-year Treasury rates for September of the prior year. Interest on each year’s January 1 benefit is added the following December 31 or benefit commencement date, if earlier. (The interest credit does not apply to the current year’s contribution). Participants are 100% vested in the New Horizon Cash Balance Plan following the completion of three years of vesting service with the Company. For those new employees hired under the Gas provisions of this Agreement who elect the New Horizon Cash Balance Plan, it is understood that the provisions of Article 10 of the Gas Addendum (Total and Permanent Disability) shall not apply. Such employees shall instead be eligible for the provisons of Article 10 Section 15 (Long Term Disability).
Section 10.3.	Worker’s Compensation. The Company will provide all benefits as required by the State Workers’ Compensation Bureau including wage differential for those employees who are returned to work at a limited capacity. Wage Differential will be calculated based on the State Workers’ Compensation formula.
The Company normally grants certain benefits in addition to those allowed by law in compensation cases. These benefits include supplemental wage continuation when medically justified for a period of up to 52 weeks. This supplemental benefit will be cumulative for each injury date but is restorable as follows: for every eight (8) hours an employee uses he/she must work eight (8) straight time hours to restore the supplemental wage continuation benefit. The restored supplemental benefits will be immediately available for use.
The Workers’ Compensation due benefits, under current law paid to employees are not taxed, however, the supplemental wage is taxable. The taxable portion of the compensation will be subject to a calculated rate so as to not allow for compensation greater than the compensation the employee would normally be entitled to for a regular 40 hour workweek.
If there is a disputed claim for wage loss benefits under the Michigan Worker’s Disability Compensation Act that is later accepted as compensa
84
ble by the Company or found to be compensable by the worker’s compensation bureau, then to the extent that the employee utilized CTO time to cover such absence, such benefits will be restored to the extent that they are still available.
(For the Gas Division) If a Gas Division employee continues to remain disabled after the depletion of the supplemental benefit (2080) and the prognosis is that the employee will be able to return to their regular job duties within 2080 hours, then the employee will continue to receive the supplemental benefits, for up to an additional 2080 hours. Further, if the employee has over 20 years of service and the prognosis is that the employee will be able to return to their regular duties within an additional 2080 hours, then they will continue to receive supplemental benefits for up to an additional 2080 hours.
Should a doctor of the employee’s choice dispute the Company doctor’s opinion of the recovery or expected recovery time, the employee shall be examined by a health care provider who has been mutually agreed upon and such provider shall make the final determination of the employee’s recovery and ability to resume their current position. The cost of the examination by such medical staff and transportation costs to and from such hospital for these exams shall be born by the Company.
Gas Division employees who hire on or after June 7, 2004 will be governed by the Worker’s Compensation provisions of the Trade and OPT agreement.
Section 10.4	Funeral Time. An employee will be paid regular straighttime hourly rate of pay when absent during scheduled work hours because of the death of a member of that employee’s immediate family: spouse, child, father, mother, sister, brother, father-in-law, mother in-law, grandfather, grandmother, or grandchild provided:
(i)	Absence does not exceed three (3) days; and
(ii)	Absence does not extend past the funeral day; except when the deceased is a spouse, child or parent, the employee will be allowed the three (3) days of absence, even though the time off extends past the funeral day.
85
Exceptions:
If the burial is out of town beyond 200 miles, an extra one (1) day will be allowed for travel.
If an immediate family member dies while an employee is on scheduled CTO, the employee is eligible to receive these benefits instead of using CTO time, provided the employee:
Notifies the Company prior to the funeral
Attends the funeral
If the deceased is a stepchild, the employee will be allowed only one (1) day of absence. If the stepchild resides with the employee, three (3) days of absence will be allowed.
Section 10.5.	Jury Duty. (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition History. For Gas Division see Article 10 of the Gas Addendum) a. An employee absent because of jury duty shall be allowed straight-time pay not to exceed forty (40) hours in any one (1) week for hours the employee would have otherwise worked. Time absent for jury duty shall be reported as such, but not deducted from days allowable for other reasons. Employees shall report for work whenever they are not actually on jury duty during their scheduled work periods unless otherwise instructed by their supervisors.
b. Employees who are notified that they may have to serve jury duty while scheduled to work the evening or night shift may request to have their work schedules changed from evenings or nights to days. Unless emergency conditions exist, if such employees present their supervisor with their Summons to serve jury duty within five (5) days of their receipt of such a Summons (but no less than one (1) week prior to having to serve such possible jury duty), such requests will be granted.
Section 10.6.	Life Insurance. (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition History. For Gas Division see Article 10 of the Gas Addendum) a. Coverage for Active Employees. Upon full-time employment an employee will receive group term life insurance at no cost to the employee. The terms and conditions under which such benefits may be payable are set forth in the group term life insurance contract. The coverage hereinafter discussed is illustrative of some of the more
86
important provisions of said group term life insurance. The amount of the life insurance will equal two (2) times the annual base pay, raised to the next higher even multiple of $1,000. The amount so obtained may hereafter also be referred to as the “Base Amount”. Should two (2) times the employee’s annual base pay produce an even thousand figure, the insurance coverage will go to the next higher even multiple of $1,000. As an exception to the foregoing, if an employee is over 65 years of age (but under 70), the base amount of insurance will equal two (2) times the annual base pay times 75 percent, raised to the next higher even multiple of $1,000, and if this 75 percent computation should provide an even thousand figure the insurance coverage will go to the next higher even multiple of $1,000. Effective January 1, 2008, employees will have the option to purchase increased life insurance. Employees have the option to purchase up to two times annual base pay without certification during the first year of the contract, and up to one time annual base pay without certification for the remainder of the contract duration.
Base pay for this purpose does not include premium pay for overtime, shift work, or work area differentials.
If part-time employees should ever become represented by the Union, such part-time employees must be scheduled to work at least twenty (20) hours per week to qualify for this insurance. The part-time employee’s annual base pay will be figured on the basis of fifty-two (52) twenty-hour weeks, in arriving at the amount of coverage.
If temporary employees should ever become represented by the Union, such temporary employees must complete six (6) months’ continuous service to be included in the plan.
b. Coverage for Retired Employees.
(1)	Normal retirement at age 65. Life insurance will be continued on a reduced basis at Company expense after an employee retires under the Company retirement plan at age 65. The amount of coverage for the employee at that time will be 50 percent of the base amounts.
87
Thereafter it will be adjusted on succeeding retirement anniversary dates as follows:
Adjustment Date
% of
Base Amount
(a)	Two (2) years after retirement
(b)	Four (4) years after retirement
(c)	Six (6) years after retirement
(d)	Eight (8) years after retirement
(e)	Ten (10) years after retirement
45
40
35
30
25
The minimum amount will never be below $25,000 for full time employees retiring under this contract.
(2)	Retirement before age 65. If the employee retires after age 55 but before age 65 and has had fifteen (15) or more years of service, the employee’s coverage will continue on a reduced basis from the date of retirement as described above for normal retirements. By making monthly premium contributions, however, an early retiree can keep his/her insurance at the level of 75 percent of his/her base amount for up to five (5) years or until age 65, whichever occurs first, at which time the bi-annual reductions will begin. Such monthly contributions would be in an amount arrived at by taking 600 per thousand dollars of insurance times 75 percent of his/her base amount less $1,000.
(3)	Retirement after age 65. If the employee retires after age 65, the amount of life insurance coverage will be reduced immediately to the amount the employee would have if retirement had occurred at age 65. Employees who are retiring may replace any of the coverage that is reduced or discontinued by converting to an individual policy (not term insurance). c. Miscellaneous Plan Provisions.
(1)	The employee may name as beneficiary any person or persons, his/her estate, or any organization.
(2)	The proceeds of the insurance will be made available promptly to the
88
beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the group term life insurance contract.
(3)	The employee or his/her beneficiary may elect to have the proceeds of his/her life insurance paid either in a lump sum or in monthly installments over any period of one (1) to twenty (20) years.
(4)	If an active employee becomes permanently and totally disabled by sickness or accident prior to age 60 and is unable to engage in any occupation or employment for remuneration or profit, the base amount shall be in force during the continuance of the disability. To keep this coverage in effect the employee must furnish the Company with proof, as required, of the continuance of the disability. At age 65 the insurance amount will be reduced to 50 percent.
If the employee ceases to be totally disabled or fails to furnish due proof of the continuance of such permanent total disability as required, the insurance shall automatically terminate thirty-one (31) days after the date of termination of such disability or proof of such disability unless the employee returns to active employment with the employer or is entitled to insurance in accordance with Paragraph b(1) or b(2) of this Section 10.6
(5)	If the employee leaves the Company, the employee’s insurance under the plan will cease. However, the employee can transfer all or part of this insurance to an individual policy (not term insurance). This must be done within thirty-one (31) days of termination of employment. No medical examination will be required.
(6)	During a Company approved leave of absence, including a military leave, the full amount of insurance will be continued in force for the employee at Company expense.
d. Coverage for Dependents
The Company will provide dependent life insurance. The following is illustrative of the more important provisions of said insurance. The specific terms and conditions under which benefits may be payable are set forth in
89
the insurance contract. The insurance will be in the amount of $20,000 coverage on the life of the legal spouse of, and $10,000 coverage on the life of each dependent child of, each active employee, and each retired employee who retires at age 55 or later with at least 15 years of service, with coverage stopping when said active employee (beneficiary) or said retired employee (beneficiary) dies. Ex-spouses are not covered; spouse coverage applies only on the legal spouse of the employee or retiree. Dependent children must be 14 or more days old and not yet beyond the end of the year in which they reach age 19 (this can be extended to not yet beyond the end of the year in which they reach 23 if the employee or retiree is providing more than 50 percent toward their support). No other persons are considered for coverage.
Section 10.7. Comprehensive Time Off (CTO). (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition History and Gas Division [see section 10.7H(i) for details on CTO accrual, scheduling, buy and sell provision]) To the end that an employee may have uninterrupted weekly income, notwithstanding certain unavoidable interferences with the employee’s ability to work, pay at regular straight-time rate will be allowed through a CTO program. CTO was negotiated to allow an employee to take time from his/her standard work week for the following reasons:
(1)	Vacation (see CTO scheduling rules below)
(2)	Personal sickness or non-occupational injury, or medical treatment when appointment outside of working hours in not practicable
(3)	Injury or illness of a near relative living in the employee’s immediate household of such serious nature whether it is FMLA or otherwise that the presence of the employee himself/herself is required. Pay allowed for this reason will not exceed five (5) days in any calendar year, except that Management, under unusual circumstances, may allow more. These five (5) days also include medical treatment as identified in paragraph 4 below.
(4)	Medical treatment for immediate family when appointment outside working hours is not practicable and employee must be present.
(5)	In addition to the foregoing, an employee may be allowed pay for absence due to necessary important personal business, which cannot be taken care of outside an employee’s regular working hours.
90
It is understood that an employee may be required to furnish reasonable proof of the disability for which pay during sick absence is to be allowed.
The Company’s CTO is based on the principle that CTO pay is earned in the calendar year preceding the year in which CTO is taken.
CTO Accrual, Scheduling and Plan Provisions for Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition History Employees (provisions will be noted when applicable for Gas Division employees)
A. Length of CTO.
(1)	All employees (with the exception of new hires, see Section 2 below) who, on December 31 of any calendar year, have completed at least one (1) year of continuous employment (since their most recent hiring date) are entitled to CTO with pay, to be taken in the following year as stated below.
(2)	New employees and former employees who have been reemployed are granted 10 days of CTO to be used during the 1st year of hire. On the new hires anniversary date, the Company will buy back up to five (5) days of unused time and any remaining CTO will be forfeited. After the 1st year of employment, employees will be entitled to CTO as shown on chart below (applies to Gas Division employees)
Example:
Hire July 1	10 days	CTO
1	year anniversary July 1	17 days	CTO
January = Chart
Former employees who have been reemployed are entitled to a vacation after one (1) year of continuous employment and are otherwise subject to the same practices applying to new employees hired on or after January 1, 1992. The most recent date of reemployment will be used to determine the employee’s level of accrued CTO benefit. However, the length of the employee’s CTO will be determined by cumulative employment.
91
3) Days of Paid CTO Allowed:
(a) Employees hired before January 1, 1992:
Years of cumulative employment as of December 31 of any year	CTO entitlement for the following calendar year
1 to 6 years	22
7 to 14 years	27
15 to 23 years	32
24 or more years	37
(b) Employees hired on or after January 1, 1992:
Years of cumulative employment as of December 31 of any year	CTO entitlement for the following calendar year
1 to 4 years	17
5 to 14 years	22
15 to 24 years	27
25 to 29 years	32
30 or more	37
(4)	In computing cumulative employment under Subparagraph A (3) of this Section 10.7, leaves of absence shall be included but periods of nonemployment shall be excluded.
(5)	The terms “continuous employment” and “cumulative employment”, as used in this Section 10.7, shall include periods of creditable employment with Pennsalt Chemicals Corporation, or Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation, or Port Huron Paper Company, as well as with The Detroit Edison Company, MichCon, and Corporate Services, LLC.
92
(6)	If a Company-observed holiday falls on a day on which the employee would have worked, or would have been excused from work with pay if he/she had not been on CTO, an additional day of CTO with pay shall be allowed. If the department’s work permits, the additional day may be scheduled continuous with the CTO period.
(7)	CTO days accrue and shall be taken in the calendar year in which the employee completes the service required to qualify for CTO days. CTO days and CTO pay shall not accumulate from one calendar year to another. However, if the work of the department permits, an employee may be allowed to take part or all of his/her CTO for one year in the year following, provided it is completed during the calendar week in which April 15 of that year falls. If the Company shall request an employee to forego his/her scheduled CTO, such employee shall be given pay in lieu of the scheduled CTO.
B.	Effect of Leave of Absence on CTO.
(1)	The CTO bank for which an employee normally qualifies, in any year will be reduced by 1/12 for each full month of absence (excluding personal disability absences) in the previous calendar year. A fraction of a day which is part of the total reduced CTO will be counted as follows: 1/2 day or less, as 1/2 day; over 1/2 day, as one (1) full day. It should be noted that CTO in two (2) consecutive calendar years following an absence may be reduced if that absence extended from one calendar year into the other.
(2)	A CTO day may be scheduled immediately before or after an extended absence. However, if the absence is expected to extend into the following calendar year, the CTO day should be scheduled before the absence. If this cannot be arranged, an allowance in lieu of CTO time may be paid at any time selected by the employee before the end of the year. An employee will be eligible for CTO in the calendar year of his/her return to work from a leave of absence if he/she worked any of the preceding calendar year. The length of the employee’s CTO will be reduced by any absence in the previous calendar year as provided in the preceding paragraph.
93
C.	In computing CTO pay, one (1) week’s allowance shall be equal to forty (40) hours’ straight time pay at the employee’s current rate.
D.	Termination CTO Pay.
(1)	When employment is terminated for any reason (except as provided in the following paragraphs), an employee who has completed one or more years of continuous employment will be paid an allowance for CTO time earned but not previously taken. This allowance will be computed as follows:
The full CTO pay to which the employee was entitled on December 31 of the previous calendar year (adjusted for absences as provided in Paragraph B (Leave of Absence) of this Section 10.7).
plus
1/12 of full CTO pay for each full month elapsed since the anniversary date of employment in the current calendar year (applies only when an employee’s employment is terminated following his anniversary date in the current calendar year).
less
Any CTO allowance paid in the current calendar year.
less
1/12 of the full CTO pay for each full month of continuous absence (excluding personal disability absences of less than twelve (12) full months) since the anniversary date in the year employment is terminated (applies only when an employee’s employment is terminated following his/her anniversary date in the current calendar year).
(a) For an employee with a break in employment, the anniversary date to be used in calculating termination pay will be the anniversary date of the most recent reemployment.
(2)	Employees who have not completed one (1) year of continuous employment on December 31 of the preceding calendar year but who have completed at least one (1) year at the time employment is terminated will be paid a termination CTO allowance. The allowance will amount to 1/12 of the employee’s full CTO pay for each full month of continuous employment since the employee’s date of
94
employment in the previous year, less any CTO allowance which has been paid, and less 1/12 of full CTO pay for each full month of nondisability absence since his/her date of employment.
E.	Early Layoff.
A termination CTO allowance will be paid to an employee who is laid off from employment in the Company in a reduction of the work force before completing one (1) year of continuous employment, provided the employee has been employed for at least six (6) months. The allowance will be 1/12 of full CTO pay for each full month since the employee’s date of employment, less any CTO allowance which has been paid, and less 1/12 of full CTO pay for each full month of non-disability absence since his date of employment.
F.	CTO Scheduled Time Off.
(1)	An employee desirous of splitting his/her CTO scheduled time shall have only one first choice by seniority or Company service (as determined by the involved bargaining unit) when the schedule is made up, and a second choice only after all other employees in the employee’s group have had one first choice. Each choice of a scheduled CTO period shall be for a group of at least five (5) consecutive days or the number of days remaining in an employee’s CTO bank if less than five (5) days.
(2)	Each department shall canvass its CTO-eligible employees for their preferred planned CTO periods and shall establish workable planned CTO schedules as soon as possible thereafter. At an appropriate time each year, the department will obtain from employees entitled to vacations, their preferences as to vacation periods, and shall as soon thereafter as possible, establish workable vacation schedules. In establishing such schedules, the Company will respect the wishes of employees as to the time of taking their CTO insofar as the needs of the service will permit, but subject to the provisions of Paragraph A(7) of this Section 10.7. Present methods as established in various departments shall determine the order of choice of CTOs. An
95
employee who is ill when the CTO schedule is being made up and is unable or unwilling to indicate a choice at that time will forfeit his/her order of choice.
(3)	Sickness or Non-occupational Injury or Death of Near Relative During CTO.
Should an employee be off because of a death of a near relative as defined in Section 10.4 during the employee’s scheduled CTO time, the employee may be permitted to change his/her CTO (or that part remaining) to a subsequent date which will not conflict with another employee’s CTO. Should an employee be off sick or off because of a non-occupational injury during the employee’s scheduled CTO time, the employee may be permitted to change his/her CTO (or that part remaining) to a sick CTO code. Consideration of such requests is contingent upon prompt notice. Reasonable proof of illness or non-occu-pational injury or death of a near relative may be required by the employee’s immediate supervisor (applies to Gas Division employees).

Note that it is the responsibility of the employee to maintain his/her correct address of record and contact information with the Company.
103
Grandfathered Extended Disability hours (formerly referred to as Absence Bank hours) will be carried over and paid at 100%. These hours shall be and used prior to the ED bank and may not be used to satisfy the wait period. Once that bank is exhausted, the employee is eligible for an ED Bank (paid at 90%) as described below:
(1)	For each disabling non-occupational injury beginning with the first 1/2 day of each such injury (if available, CTO will be used to bridge this wait period).

In each such case, if available, CTO will be used to bridge this wait period.
NOTE: If hospitalized for three (3) full days, the three (3) day wait period (or 1/2 day for non-occupational injury) will be retroactively paid from ED time if available. The five and seven day wait periods will not apply to life threatening disabilities (defined as entirely new illness from the prior disability) which involve inpatient care in a hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) or hospice. Employees who qualify for this provision will be retroactively paid from the ED time if available.
(3)	For Trade and OPT only, the Company agrees to add five (5) days at the beginning of the Extended Disability Bank to be paid at a compensation rate of 100 percent, such days will expire at the end of each year and will be renewed annually at the beginning of each year. These days are to be used only for sickness related absences and are to be used prior to Grandfathered Extended Disability (formerly referred to as Absence Bank hours) carryover days after application of the required waiting period.
(4)	Each employee who qualifies for ED pay under subsection (a) of this Section 10.9 shall have their ED Bank determined by the following table:
104
Years of Service	Maximum number of weeks allowable, paid at 90%

35 & over	44 weeks (1760 hrs)
Employees who have Recognition Banks remaining from the previous pay program will be allowed to keep what they have in their Recognition Bank to be utilized after exhaustion of their ED. These days will be paid at 80% of current base wage rate (or salary if applicable).
The term “years of service”, as used in this section, shall include periods of creditable employment with the Pennsalt Chemicals Corporation, or Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation, or Port Huron Paper Company, as well as with The Detroit Edison Company and MichCon, and Corporate Services, LLC
Effective December 20, 2010, the time period to fully replenish an employee’s extended disability bank shall be 90 calendar days after returning to work, regardless if the next absence is for a new disability or the same disability. Disability related absences that occur within the 90 calendar days from a prior ED will continue use of the remainder of the former ED bank, if available, and then shall be unpaid. Note that the 90 calendar day period to replenish will start over again if an employee interrupts the 90 calendar day replenishment period with an ED absence.
If a holiday occurs during a period for which pay during extended disability is allowed, such holiday shall be paid as a holiday and shall not be deducted from the number of days allowable under this Section 10.9.
105
b.	Independent Medical Examination — While an employee is receiving ED payments, the Company may require the employee to undergo an Independent Medical Examination (IME) to determine their continuing eligibility for ED.
The IME will be given by a medical provider chosen from a list of IME physicians that is jointly agreed upon by the Union and the Company. The Company and the Union agree to meet annually to review the jointly agreed upon IME physicians.
The Company’s disability case management function (DCM) will provide the employee with a choice of IME physicians available on the mutually agreed upon list. DCM will determine which specialty is appropriate.
The employee may select an IME physician from the list provided by DCM.

DCM will schedule the employee for an appointment with the physician selected and will notify the employee of the date, time and location of the appointment at least three (3) days prior to the appointment.
If the employee fails to notify DCM of a selection within three (3) days from receipt of the list, DCM will select a physician from the list, schedule the employee for an appointment with the physician selected and notify the employee of the date, time and location of the appointment at least three (3) days prior to the appointment.
The Company will pay for the cost of the IME; however, if the employee cancels or fails to attend the first scheduled appointment, DCM will schedule a second appointment with the physician selected and will notify the employee of the date, time and location of the appointment at least 24 hours prior to the appointment. If the employee cancels or fails to attend the second scheduled appointment, the Employee’s ED payments will be terminated and the ED claim closed.
If the IME determines that the employee is no longer disabled from work because of disabilities resulting from personal sickenss or non-
106
occupational injury, ED payments will terminate and the ED claim will close. DCM will notify the employee of the termination of the employee’s ED claim.
The results of an IME will not determine the employee’s eligibility, if any, for leave pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Second Opinion and Third Opinion medical examinations to determine eligibility for FMLA leave will be conducted separately and pursuant to FMLA regulations.

In any such case, the Company shall attempt to place an employee at other work the employee can satisfactorily perform in the Company in a job classification having a pay rate as close as possible to that of his/her regular job. Such a job search will be conducted for a period of twenty (20) working days prior to terminating an employee due to incapacitation. Said job search shall include all approved open and unfilled position requisitions (posted jobs, approved unfilled requisitions and those positions open to the public). If another job is not found within these twenty (20) working days, the matter will be reviewed with the Manager of Employee and Labor Relations or the Director of Human Relations before termination. The placement of such an employee will be discussed in advance with a committee appointed by the Union, and the seniority and bidding provisions of this Agreement shall be waived in order to carry out the purposes of this Section 10.13. The seniority of such an employee shall continue to accumulate in his/her regular job, unless otherwise agreed.
b.	Pay Rate of an Incapacitated Employee. If an incapacitated employee who has service with the Company according to the table set forth below is placed in a lower-rated job because of ill health or an incapacity arising out of and in the course of his/her employment, the employee shall be paid a rate determined as follows, or the rate of the job in which the employee is placed, whichever is higher:

former classification
.........85% of the pay rate of employee’s
former classification
25 years or over
......................90%	of the pay rate of the employee’s former classification
If implementation of the above table results in a downward pay adjustment of more than $1.00 an hour, the employee’s pay will be reduced 30c an hour upon placement, and an additional 30c an hour every 3 months until the appropriate pay rate in the above table is reached. Such an employee will be expected to perform any of the duties of his/her former classification which the employee is capable of performing.
c.	Such an employee will be provided the opportunity set forth above only with full approval of the Management in respect to the employee’s ability to perform any of the jobs in question. The question of whether the Management’s decision in any case was arbitrary will be subject to the grievance procedure, including arbitration.
d.	An employee who has been placed in a lower classification in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.13 might prefer, because of personal reasons, to terminate his/her employment with the Company. If so, the Company will consider making a separation allowance or supplemental retirement allowance of equivalent cost, based on the merits of each individual case.

Section 10.15.	Long-term Disability Insurance. (For Trade and those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition History) For Gas Division see Article 10 of the Gas Addendum) This is a plan to pay disability benefits to employees who become totally disabled after the effective date of this plan through sickness or accident, and the disability extends beyond the period covered by the Company sick-pay plan, but for at least five months. The Long Term Disability Section of the Handbook for Employees is the Summary Plan Description for the Long Term Disability Plan. The Official Plan Document for Long Term Disability is on file in Benefits Plan Administration. The amount of the benefit is 50% of base pay (excluding work area premium, overtime, etc.). The maximum duration of this benefit for most ailments, after payments under the Company sick-pay plan ceases, is until disability ceases or normally the attainment of age 65, whichever comes first. However, if an eligible employee becomes totally disabled on or after age 62, duration of benefits will be in accordance with the table below:
125
Attained Age at Disablement 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69-74

1-1/4
1
1/2

1.	Sick pay under the present Company plan,
2.	Worker’s Compensation benefits,
3.	Benefits available under the Federal Social Security Act (Primary Benefit only),
4.	Pension Plan Benefits. However, if disability benefits begin prior to age 62, Pension Plan Benefits, at the employee’s option, may be deferred until age 65,
5.	Other employer-sponsored or government plan providing disability benefits.
Regardless of these offsets, the minimum benefit under this plan would be the lesser of $100 per month or 10% of base pay.
“Totally Disabled” means, during the first 24 months of benefits under this plan, complete inability to perform the normal duties of the employee’s regular job or any other Edison job for which the employee might be considered. After said 24 months, it means complete inability to perform the duties associated with any job, for which the employee is or becomes reasonably qualified by training, education or experience.

CLASSIFICATIONS AND WAGES
Section 12.1.	For the Trade — Wage Rates. a. The job classifications of the employees covered by this Agreement and the base wage rates to be paid for such classifications are set forth in Schedule 1, and are part of this Agreement.
b.	Where automatic progression between classifications or within the pay rate range of a classification is provided by this Agreement, it is understood that an employee must qualify for the advancement in order to receive it, and must normally wait six (6) months at the maximum rate of the lower classification before being promoted to the higher classification. Should a question arise as to qualifications of an employee on such a progression, the Management will take the matter up with the Union and disagreement between the parties shall be subject to the grievance procedure, including arbitration, but arbitration shall be limited to the question of whether the Company’s decision was arbitrary or discriminatory. Should an employee be stopped in a progression, the employee’s status will be reviewed semiannually.
129
c.	Rate progressions starting at Grade 5 are based on the assumption that the employee has previously attained the Grade 4 rate in other employment in the Company. The starting rate of an employee who has not had such experience will be one or two grades lower.
Wage Rates. (For those classifications listed in attachment “A” OPT Election/Recognition history) a. The job classifications of the employees covered by this Agreement and the base wage minimum and maximum rates to be paid for such classifications are set forth in Attachment B (OPT Wage Rate Schedule) and are part of this Agreement.

The Company and the Union agree that it is the objective of the Company to provide good service to its customers at the lowest cost consistent with its obligation to provide fair wages and good working conditions to all of its employees and its duty to provide a fair return to its investors. To achieve that objective requires the united efforts of the Management, the employees, and the Union.
130
b.	Job Security. Changes in organization, methods, materials, and job classifications have been necessary to assure the continued success of the Company, and security and opportunity for its employees. These changes have been planned in a manner which has permitted the transfer of the employees affected to other work, reasonably comparable in nature, classification, and pay, without unnecessary hardship to any such employee and consistent with the Company’s obligation to its customers and investors. The Management of the Company intends, general business conditions permitting, to use the same careful planning and consideration for the affected employees in introducing any further changes it may find necessary. This statement of policy does not change or alter any of the terms of this Agreement between the Company and the Union.
Long Range Workforce Planning. The Company and the Union recognize that due to the rapidly changing business environment of an emergent competitive utility industry, there is a necessity to jointly develop work-force strategies for becoming best in that business environment.

Former employees who have been reemployed are entitled to CTO as defined below for new employees hired on or after January 1, 1992.

Should an employee be off sick or off because of a non-occupational injury during the employee’s scheduled CTO time, the employee may be permitted to change his/her CTO (or that part remaining) to a CTO code that would satisfy the ED wait period.

Time due to the death of a near relative will not exceed 36 hours except under unusual circumstances.
(4)	The work permitting, employees may, with Supervisory permission, schedule CTO in two (2) hour increments.
(5)	Employees may schedule two (2) CTO days in the same manner and under the same provisions as the previous personal days.
Section 10.8, Layoff Allowance, will have the following new Subsection 8f added:
f. For employees on 12 hour shift schedules, the “straight-time weekly (40 hours) pay” in this section will be determined by multiplying forty (40) hours times the employee’s straight-time hourly pay rate.
Section 10.9. Pay During Extended Disability (ED)
a. An employee with one (1) year or more years of cumulative employment who is absent from work because of disabilities resulting from personal sickness or non-occupational injury will be allowed additional pay up to the number of weeks set forth in subsection b of this Section 10.9. In order to be eligible for ED the wait period must be coded as either CTO
154
sick-self-FML CTO sick-self non-FML or unpaid sick-self (FML or non-FML). Absences of 41 consecutive work hours or more (including the wait period) require the employee to furnish the Company with medical documentation signed by the attending doctor and with such other satisfactory evidence of disability as may be required. Note that it is the responsibility of the employee to maintain his/her correct address of record and contact information with the Company.
Grandfathered Extended Disability hours (formerly referred to as Absence Bank hours) will be carried over and paid at 100%. These hours shall be used prior to the ED bank and may not be used to satisfy the 3-day wait period. In addition, at the beginning of each year, five (5) days paid at 100% compensation will be available to the employee prior to utilization of the Grandfathered Extended Disability hours. These days are to be used only for sickness related absences after application of the required waiting period, (1/2 or 3-day) and will expire at the end of each year. Once that bank is exhausted, the employee will be eligible for an ED Bank (paid at 90%) as described below:
(1)	For each disabling non-occupational injury beginning with the first 1/2 day of each such injury (if available, CTO will be used to bridge this wait period).
(2)	Effective December 20, 2010 for the first disabling personal sickness of the payroll year after the first three (3) days of each such period of sickness; or for the second disabling personal sickness within the payroll year after the first five (5) days of such period of sickness; or for the third or any subsequent disabling personal sickness within the payroll year after the first seven (7) days of such period of sickness. In each such case, (if available, CTO will be used to bridge this wait period).
NOTE: If hospitalized for three (3) full days, the 3-day wait period (or 1/2 day for non-occupational injury) will be retroactively paid from ED time if available. The five and seven day wait periods will not apply to life threatening disabilities (defined as entirely new illness from the prior disability) which involve inpatient care in a hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Cardiac Care Unit (CCU) or hospice. Employees who qualify for this provision will be retroactively paid from the ED time if available.
155
(3)	Each employee who qualifies for ED pay under subsection (a) of this Section 10.9 shall have their ED Bank determined by the following table:
Years of Service	AB Carryover from 2005, 2006 & 2007 Paid at 100% (to be used prior to 90% Bank)	Maximum number of hours allowable, paid at 90%
1-4	Up to 240 hrs	280 hrs
5-9	Up to 240 hrs	400 hrs
10-14	Up to 240 hrs	520 hrs
15-19	Up to 240 hrs	720 hrs
20-24	Up to 240 hrs	920 hrs
25-29	Up to 240 hrs	1120 hrs
30-34	Up to 240 hrs	1440 hrs
35 & over	Up to 240 hrs	1760 hrs
Employees who have Recognition Banks remaining from the previous pay program will be allowed to keep what they have in their Recognition Bank to be utilized after exhaustion of the ED Bank described in this subsection. These days will be paid at 80% of base pay.
The term “years of service”, as used in this section, shall include periods of creditable employment with the Pennsalt Chemicals Corporation, or Wyandotte Chemicals Corporation, or Port Huron Paper Company, as well as with The Detroit Edison Company, MichCon, and Corporate Services, LLC.
Effective December 20, 2010, the time period to fully replenish an employee’s extended disability bank shall be 90 calendar days after returning to work, regardless if the next absence is for a new disability or the same disability. Disability related absences that occur within the 90 calendar days from a prior ED will continue use of the remainder of the former ED bank, if available, and then shall be unpaid. Note that the 90 calendar day period to replenish will start over again if an employee interrupts the 90 calendar day replenishment period with an ED absence.
156
If a holiday occurs during a period for which pay during extended disability is allowed, such holiday shall be paid as a holiday and shall not be deducted from the number of days allowable under this Section 10.9.
c. Pay for extended disability will be made only for the scheduled straighttime hours in the employee’s schedule, i.e. thirty-six (36) or forty (40) hours. However, if it appears the illness or injury will result in an absence of more than two full pay weeks, Management will, as soon as is practicable, change the employee’s schedule to a standard work week consisting of five (5) regularly scheduled eight (8) hour work periods on as many work days.
Section 11.1, Shift Premiums, will read:
a. Unless otherwise agreed, in addition to the straight-time classification rate, shift premium of $2.00 per hour shall be paid as a separate item for each hour worked by an employee between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:29 a.m.
Paragraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of Section 11.1 will not apply and will be considered vacant.
2.	The current 12-hour Shift Overtime Rules will be applied to those represented employees on 12-hour shift schedules.
3.	In all other respects, the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
4.	The terms of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be effective on June 7, 2010 at 6:00 A.M. for St. Clair Fuel Supply and Operations, Conners Creek Operations, and Greenwood Operation; at 7:00 A.M. for Belle River, Monroe, and Trenton Channel Operators and Monroe Fuel Supply; and at 7:30 A.M. for River Rouge, unless otherwise agreed to between the parties.

PAY RATE SCHEDULES
Schedule 2
PROGRESSION SCHEDULES FOR TRADES AND OPERATING CLASSIFICATIONS WITHIN THE RECOGNIZED BARGAINING
UNITS
As has occurred in most previous negotiations, the Parties have agreed to remove several classifications from this Schedule 2. Many of these changes have been due to the combining of two or more classifications into one; others were removed due to reductions in classifications or layoffs from seniority lists; still others were due to the fact that the work which was previously performed by the classification is no longer performed by Detroit Edison employees. It is agreed that, if any time in the future, the Company decides to again employ Detroit Edison employees to perform the work of a classification which has been removed from this Schedule 2 or to implement a new classification which is equivalent to a removed classification, such work will be reestablished as work represented by Local 223.

If and when the employee is found so qualified, he or she shall be returned to the active payroll and such employee shall start to accumulate departmental seniority and shall start to accrue, on the basis of his or her length of continuous employment with the Company, uninterrupted by an event that would cause a loss of seniority and CTO time as of the first day of the month in which the employee returns to work. Further, such employee shall be
24
entitled to all departmental seniority previously accumulated and all CTO time previously accrued and not used;
(vi)	An employee on a leave of absence shall notify the Company of his or her intentions regarding his or her return to work at least seven (7) days prior to the termination date of such leave. Failure to report on the day following the termination date of such leave shall constitute just cause for discharge. A leave of absence shall not be granted to permit an employee to accept employment elsewhere or to engage in any other business activity, and if an employee accepts employment elsewhere or engages in any other business activity during the employee’s leave of absence without the consent of the Company, this action shall constitute just cause for discharge.
7.	Advanced Assignment Opportunities — Opportunities for advanced assignment for promotion shall depend upon the need for additional employees in higher classified jobs.
• Upgrades in Field Service and Distribution - Any employee who goes to school at the training center for an upgrading in the Field Service Operations or Distribution Operations Departments will be placed on advanced assignment except the employees who are on loan for the entry level position in said department.
8.	Job Vacancy Location List — When the Company finds that such need exists, it shall furnish the Union a list showing the location of such job vacancy, the employees in the classification from which advancements will be made, and the departmental seniority of such employees. See Filling Vacancies, Article 7; also see Letter of Agreements.
9.	Filling a Job Vacancy by Movement — When a vacancy and a surplus need occur concurrently, the provisions of Article 8 shall be applied before the provisions of Article 7. No vacancy, at any location, shall be filled by advanced assignment until the employees in the same classification and department who are performing, or who have satisfactorily performed, work which is similar in nature to the work to be performed where the vacancy exists, and who have the highest departmental seniority, are given the opportunity to move to the location or shift where the vacancy exists. Employees in the Distribution, Metering, Property Operation and Maintenance, Property Maintenance Operations, Stock, Transportation, Field Service Operations, Corrosion Control and Meter Reading Departments may submit
25
their choice(s) in order of preference for moving laterally from one location to another within their department. The employee’s choice(s) can be amended at any time prior to a vacancy being posted provided that no change in preference will be permitted with respect to a declared vacancy once the vacancy is posted. Any employee not submitting his or her choice(s) for lateral moves will not be considered for such moves. No more than one (1) employee will be moved as a result of one (1) original vacancy.
10.	Semi-Annual Ratings — All employees covered by this Agreement shall be rated by the Company semi-annually as qualified or not qualified by reason of knowledge, training, ability, skill and efficiency on the work they are currently performing in their job classification. In the event an employee is rated as not qualified, the reason therefore shall be given to the employee. A list of the ratings of employees in each department shall be forwarded to the Union office.
11.	Filling a Job Vacancy by Advanced Assignment — After such movement as provided in Article 8.9, the vacancy shall be filled by advanced assignment in accordance with the following:
a)	Only those employees shall be eligible for advanced assignment who are in the next lower classification group and who have been rated by the Company (on semi-annual ratings) as qualified and who are satisfactorily performing, or have satisfactorily performed at a group level immediately below the group in which the job opening exists, work of a nature similar to the work to be performed in such higher classified job. If no employee in the next lower classification bids for said job opening, the Company will continue to canvass employees in the next lower classifications who have been rated by the Company (on semiannual ratings) as qualified and who are satisfactorily performing at a group level, below the group in which the job openings exist, work of a nature similar to the work to be performed in such higher classified job.
b)	Employees not eligible for advanced assignment because they have been rated as not qualified, but who have sufficient departmental seniority shall be rated again before any selection for advanced assignment is made. In the event an employee is again rated as not qualified, the reason therefore shall be given to the employee. Employees
26
remaining not qualified upon such re-rating, and therefore not advanced, shall have recourse to the grievance procedure.
c)	Among employees so eligible, selection of those to be offered advance assignment will be made on the basis of departmental seniority. Employees in the Field Distribution Operations, Metering, Property Operation and Maintenance, Property Maintenance Operations, Transportation, Field Service Operations Corrosion Control, and Field Meter Reading Departments, desiring advanced assignment opportunities, shall submit their choice(s) in order of preference with respect to the position(s) and location(s) where they would accept an advanced assignment opportunity. The employee’s choice(s) can be amended at any time prior to a vacancy being posted, provided that no change in preference will be permitted with respect to a declared vacancy once the vacancy is posted. Any employee not submitting his or her choice(s) with respect to advanced assignment opportunities will not be considered for such opportunities. If special skills are necessary to perform the higher classified job, only those employees will be selected who possess such special skills. If physical fitness is a factor, determination of the employee’s qualification shall be made by the Company doctor.
d)	Prerequisite skill qualifications, where required in certain classifications, shall be described in the Classification of Work and Wages. To be eligible for assignment to such a classification, an employee must possess and satisfactorily demonstrate such prerequisite skill qualifications in the manner specified in the classification prior to advanced assignment. Where licenses are a prerequisite skill,
•	The employee must exhibit possession of such license before placement on advanced assignment.
•	If an employee fails to qualify for an upgrading, they will have to wait six (6) months before they will be given another opportunity for the same upgrading.
12.	Written Details of Movements and Advance Assignments — The Company will furnish the Union written details of all movements of employees and advanced assignments made in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
27
13.	Removal of an Ineligible Employee From Advanced Assignment If an employee has been placed on advanced assignment and it is deter-mined within the qualifying period thereafter that another eligible and qualified employee was entitled to such assignment because of his or her depart-mental seniority, the Company will forthwith terminate the assignment made and place the employee having the greater departmental seniority on such assignment. The qualification of the eligible employee will remain dependent upon his actual work in the higher classification for the specified time. The time worked will remain to the credit of the employee whose assignment is terminated in the event he or she is later placed on the same advanced assignment.
14.	Credits Accumulated on Temporary Assignment — In the event the Company shall request an employee to perform the duties of a higher classification without placing him or her on advanced assignment in accordance with the provisions hereof, for a period sufficient to qualify the employee for promotion to the higher classification, it shall be conclusively presumed that a job vacancy in such higher classification exists. In such event, the provisions hereto relating to the filling of job vacancies by movement of employees and by advanced assignments shall govern the filling of such vacancy. If, under such provisions, the employee who has performed the duties of the higher classification is entitled to such promotion, the employee entitled thereto will be placed on advanced assignment for the higher classification and will be paid the rate for the higher classification; provided, however, that he or she must serve the normal qualifying period specified for the higher classification and meet all other requirements for such classification prior to being promoted thereto. The employee who has performed the duties of the higher classification and has not been promoted shall receive no credit toward qualifying for the higher classification despite any other provision herein contained to the contrary.
15.	Failure to Meet Requirements of Higher Classification — In the event any employee who is placed on advanced assignment for promotion to a higher classification fails to meet the requirements for that classification during the qualifying period specified therein, the Company shall have the right to terminate his or her assignment. Any employee who is placed on advanced assignment for promotion to a higher classification also shall have the right to terminate such assignment during the qualifying period, provided the employee shall not be entitled to credits for time spent on advanced assignment and the higher rate of pay received during the advanced assignment period, when a employee returns to his or her former classification.
28
ARTICLE 9: HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
1.	Distribution of Overtime — Both parties recognize that in cases of emergencies and seasonal changes in demand, employees may be required to work in excess of their scheduled hours. Such work shall be distributed equitably, in a systematic manner within each department, among employees qualified to do the work.
2.	Work Hour Limitation — No employee will be required to work more than sixteen (16) consecutive hours (exclusive of non-paid eating time) unless agreed to by the employee.
3.	Make-Up Time — Whenever possible, and whenever there is work to be done in his or her department and location, an opportunity will be given an employee, upon request, within the current workweek, to make up time lost due to justifiable absence, provided that supervision has approved the intended absence, and if the work is normally performed under direct supervision, such supervision is in attendance. In such case, pay for that time will be at regular straight-time hourly rates.
4.	Work Shifts — It is mutually agreed that, although work shifts should be held to a minimum number, it is the Company’s responsibility to determine the need for shift work based on the function of a department or departmental activity and the requirements of the Company’s customers. However, prior to any change in shift time or the creating of a new shift by the Company, the need therefore shall be discussed in detail with the Union. If the Union does not agree as to the need for any change in shift time or the creation of a new shift, the matter may be made subject to the grievance procedure hereinafter set forth, provided that the Company may effect such change in shift time or create a new shift pending and subject to the outcome of the grievance procedure.
5.	Premium Pay — Except as provided in Article 9.5 (c) below and Article 9.3, time and one-half (1-1/2) the employee’s regular straight-time hourly rate of pay shall be paid for:
a.	Work performed by an employee outside of his or her scheduled work hours;
29
b.	Work performed by an employee required to start on Martin Luther King’s Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, the Day after Thanksgiving;
c.	Work performed by an employee scheduled to be started on Saturdays or Sundays, when these days fall within the employee’s forty (40) hour work week, employee will be paid at one and one-quarter (11/4) the employee’s regular straight-time hourly rate of pay.
d.	Double time shall be paid for Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Years Eve and New Years Day. Double time will only be paid on the actual day of the holiday and not on the date on which the Company celebrates the above holidays as defined in Article 9.7. In no case will premium compensation be duplicated or pyramided.
e.	Hours worked in excess of sixteen (16) in any one (1) workday, off-day, or continuous work period-double time.
6.	Paid Eating Time — When an employee works two (2) hours past the end of his or her first eight (8) hours and must continue working, he or she shall be allowed a one-half (1/2) hour lunch period with no loss of pay. For each additional consecutive four (4) hours, he or she shall be allowed another one-half (1/2) hour lunch period without loss of pay, providing the work must continue.
7.	Paid Holidays — With the exception of part-time employees, summer employees and employees with less than ninety (90) days of service, each employee will receive, in addition to any compensation provided for in Article 9 hereof for time worked, eight (8) hours straight-time pay for each of the following days: New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King’s Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, the Day after Thanksgiving, December 24, Christmas Day, and December 31. Part-time employees will receive that part of eight (8) hours straight-time pay in the proportion of their normal scheduled workweek bears to a forty (40) hour workweek. Summer employees are not eligible to receive holiday pay. Whenever possible, and if consistent with safe plant operations, employees shall not be required to work on holidays. No employee required to work on a holiday shall be scheduled to take corresponding time off because of having worked on such day. New employees with less than ninety (90) days of service will not be eligible to receive pay for the first two (2) holidays.
30
Holiday Considerations
When the Fourth of July falls on a Saturday, Friday will be considered the holiday. When the Fourth of July falls on a Sunday, Monday will be considered the holiday. When Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day fall on a Friday and Saturday, Saturday and Sunday or Sunday and Monday, the Company will celebrate said holidays as follows:
ACTUAL DAY OF HOLIDAY
Friday and Saturday
Saturday and Sunday
Sunday and Monday
COMPANY CELEBRATES
Thursday and Friday Friday and Monday Monday and Tuesday
However, on said Thursday and Tuesday, Field Service Operations will schedule at least 30% of its employees off.
8.	Rest Time — a. When an employee is required to work such hours that all, or nearly all, of the employee’s normal sleeping time is lost, it is the supervisor’s responsibility to release him for a sufficient rest period as soon as the work permits. If an employee works such hours that the employee should be released for rest as soon as the work permits, but the employee prefers to forego his/her rest and work additional hours, the employee should not be permitted to work but should be directed to rest.
b.	If the necessities of the work permit, and sixteen (16) hours or more have been worked in a twenty-four (24) hour period, the rest period should be at least eight (8) hours.
c.	A rest period may be provided either because long hours have been worked or because they are anticipated.
d.	An employee who is released under Paragraphs a, b, or c of this Section 9.8 by his/her supervisor during any hours of the employee’s regularly scheduled forty (40) hour work week will be paid at the employee’s straight-time rate for rest time during such scheduled hours.
e.	When an employee who has been released from his/her regularly scheduled hours for a paid rest period is required to return to work within
31
ten (10) hours of his/her release (but not otherwise), the employee’s paid rest time and the employee’s worked time for the workday shall be added together to determine when double time should begin.
f.	The provisions of Article 9.8 will supersede any provisions in regards to “Continuous Overtime” or “Relieving Overtime Crews” in all separate overtime write-ups within the Local 223 Gas Division.
32
ARTICLE 10: WAGE COLLATERALS
1.	Funeral Leave — (See Section 10.4 in the Collective Bargaining Agreement)
2.	Jury Duty — When any full-time employee is required to serve on a jury or as a subpoenaed witness, that employee will be excused from his or her regular duties on the days such employee is required to appear in court. Employees will be paid eight (8) hour’s pay at their regular straight-time rate. Effective December 4, 1988, employees will retain the check issued for jury service and/or serving as a subpoenaed witness.
3.	Gas Division Paid Sick Time Transition Table:
In order to recognize the amount of banked time that an employee may have under the prior Accident and Sickness Plan the following transition process will convert sick banks, prior to applying the Accident and Sickness replenishing rules, into banks to be used in conjunction with the sick pay program in Article 10.4 and 10.9.
Transition Table for Current Gas Division Employees (Prior to replenishing rules)
80% Bank	Convert to Prior Year 1, Prior 2 and Prior 3
90% Bank	10% credited to the Recognition Bank
(160 hour cap applies)
Once all the banks have been converted (Prior 1, 2 & 3) and the Recognition Bank) any excess hours will be transferred into a grandfathered bank that will be paid at 80% of the employees base salary. Once this bank is used it will not be replenished.
4.	Utilization of Benefits for Total and Permanent Disability — The Company reserves the right to retire an employee under the Permanent and Total Disability provisions of the Retirement Plan prior to the expiration of benefits under the Extended Disability (ED) benefit.
Employees who have a non-occupational disability after six consecutive months shall be examined by the Company doctor. If in the opinion of the Company doctor the employee will recover and be able to resume his/her current position, the employee shall be allowed to continue to use their ED benefits, if any, or be placed on a medical leave of absence for up to fifty-
33
two weeks. After this initial examination, the Company reserves the right to have the Company doctor periodically examine the employee to confirm whether or not the employee is still likely to recover and be able to resume his/her current position.
If after the initial six month exam, or any subsequent examination by the Company doctor, the Company doctor determines that the employee will not recover and be able to resume his/her current position, the employee shall be allowed to continue to use the employee’s ED benefits, if any for up to a total period of six months and/or in the event the employee’s ED benefits have expired, he/she shall be placed on a medical leave of absence for up to a total of six months, from the date the results of the Company doctor exam are provided to the Company, in order to give the employee time to try and identify a position within the Company for which he/she is qualified to perform and for which the employee is selected to fill by the Company.
Upon completion of the additional six month period, if the employee has not been selected to fill a position for which they have been determined qualified by the Company, the employee shall be retired under the Permanent and Total Disability provisions of the Retirement Plan if he/she is eligible in accordance with the provisions of the Retirement Plan. If said employee is not eligible for retirement under the Permanent and Total Disability provisions of the Retirement Plan, he/she shall be terminated and receive a Termination Payment. Employees who still have a non-occupational disability after the expiration of his/her benefits, and who have not been retired under the Permanent and Total Disability provisions of the Retirement Plan or been terminated in accordance with the provision of Termination Payments, as defined under this provision an employee shall be placed on a medical leave of absence.
Length of
Continuous Employment 6 months to 1 year 1 but less than 2 years 2 but less than 3 years 3 but less than 4 years 4 but less than 5 years 5 but less than 6 years 6 but less than 7 years
Number of Hours For Termination
174

34
An employee shall not receive any compensation while on medical leave of absence and shall be paid in full for any and all unused, earned and accrued CTO credits due to him/her before being placed on such leave. While an employee is on a medical leave of absence and upon termination thereof, his/her rights under the Retirement Plan, Group Life Insurance Plan, Medical Plan or HMO, Group Dental Plan, Prescription Drug, and Surviving Spouse Annuity Benefit shall be governed by the provisions of such plans.
Should a doctor of the employee’s choice dispute the Company doctor’s opinion of the recovery or expected recovery time, the employee shall be examined by a health care provider who has been mutually agreed upon and such provider shall make the final determination of the employee’s recovery and ability to resume their current position. The cost of examination by such medical staff and transportation costs to and from such hospital for these examinations shall be borne by the Company.
5.	Income Protection Preamble — The parties agree that unit employees will be provided with a retirement (pension) benefit plan (which includes, in part, a surviving spouse annuity benefit), an investment benefit plan, a group life insurance benefit plan, and a group accidental death and dismemberment plan. The benefits are, in broad terms, as set forth below. The provisions of this article, however, are merely to provide for the stated benefits, to memorialize the parties’ agreements in the negotiation of the instant collective bargaining agreement, and to highlight some of the provisions of the benefits provided. The actual, specific provisions of each of the benefits are not set forth herein, but are contained in the plan documents for each benefit, which are incorporated herein by reference. Such plan documents are available to unit employees, upon request, from Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (Company). Reference must be made to plan documents regarding any issue of construction or application for each benefit’s terms and options.
The benefits are as follows: (1) Detroit Edison Company Savings & Stock Ownership Plan for Employees Represented by Local 223 of the Utility Workers Union of America (Retirement Plan), as amended (including a surviving spouse annuity benefit), (2) Detroit Edison Company Savings & Stock Ownership Plan for Employees Represented by Local 223 of the Utility Workers Union of America (Investment Plan), as amended, (3) Group Life Insurance Plan, and (4) Group Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plan.
35
With regards to the Retirement Plan, see paragraph (1) below, unit employees are eligible for coverage under this plan if they are a Union employee of the Company, are at least 18 years old, and have completed at least 1,000 hours of service during any 12-month period that begins on the employee’s first day of employment with the Company or any anniversary thereof.
If any employee who is retired because of total and permanent disability becomes able to work, he or she may, at the option of the Company, be removed from retirement and offered re-employment with the Company. If he or she is removed from retirement and offered re-employment, that employee shall be given the job he or she held at retirement if that job is in existence and such employee has the capacity to perform that job. If the job is not in existence or the employee does not have the capacity to perform that job, he or she shall be offered another position without loss of pay. If he or she refuses to accept the job which is offered, that employee shall lose his or her eligibility for subsequent benefits as a total and permanent retiree. In such event, his or her rights under the Retirement Plan shall be the same as those of an employee who voluntarily resigns, less benefits received as of the date of such termination. No employee who is retired under total and permanent disability shall lose any rights under the Retirement Plan by virtue of earnings because of employment as long as such earnings are not sufficient to constitute a forfeiture of total and permanent disability benefits under Social Security.
Employees who retire under the 30-and-out provision of the Retirement Plan may seek employment elsewhere without suffering any reduction in his or her 30-and-out pension supplement.
With regard to the Detroit Edison Company Savings & Stock Ownership Plan for Employees Represented by Local 223 of the Utility Workers Union of America, see paragraph (2) below, the Company has made provision for its full-time employees who have reached the age of twenty-one (21) and completed one (1) year of service to enroll in the Investment Plan. The Company reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Investment and Stock Ownership Plan, as set forth in the Plan Document.
Effective January 1, 2008, the Company shall provide for automatic plan enrollment for all employees hired on or after January 1, 2008. The default
36
deferral rate will be 4% with contributions being invested in a lifecycle fund based on the participant’s age. Automatic enrollment will commence 30 days after the date of hire unless the employee has contacted Fidelity to opt out of automatic enrollment of the plan, to increase or decrease the deferral rate or to invest in a fund other than the lifecycle fund based on the participant’s age.
With regard to the Group Life Insurance Plan, see paragraph (3) below, benefit entitlement for life insurance shall become effective the first of the month in which a new employee’s ninetieth (90th) day of employment occurs. Life insurance shall also be provided for retirees, as set forth below.
With regard to the Group Accidental Death and Dismemberment Plan, see paragraph (4) below, new employees will be eligible for this benefit on the first of the month following the employee’s date of hire.
The parties have in this agreement eliminated much of the language set forth in Article VIII of previous contracts, for purposes of ease and clarity of reference, and have incorporated the various plan documents by reference. Such elimination and incorporation, however, are not intended to diminish or otherwise affect, except as specifically agreed in the parties’ negotiation of the present collective bargaining agreement, the terms, conditions and benefits afforded under the prior contract, and associated language, including pertinent plan documents. To the extent of any conflict adverse to the rights and interests of unit employees, the terms and conditions of the prior agreement and/or plan documents shall prevail. The parties agree that the options and benefits stated herein shall not be changed during the term of this agreement, except as specifically allowed. The parties agree that any change in any benefit plan, or the terms, conditions, and benefits of same, except as specifically permitted herein, must be noticed to the Union, and are subject to its rights under the National Labor Relations Act, and, as may be applicable, the collective bargaining agreement.
6.	Retirement Plan — Listed below is a brief description of Michigan Consolidated Gas Company Retirement Plan for Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements (Retirement Plan) benefits as agreed to by the Company and Local 223 Gas Division, which includes the Local 223 Transmission and Storage Operations department. The benefits described herein, apply to employees hired prior to January 1, 2005. The Company has
37
the right to amend, withdraw, or terminate the Retirement Plan as provided in the Plan Document. The official terms of the Retirement Plan will govern in the event of any interpretation, discrepancy, application and/or decision in specific circumstances.
(a)	Pension benefit calculations and plan provisions for Local 223 Gas Division employees hired prior to January 1, 2005 will be provided as follows:
i.	credited service prior to January 1, 2005 will be governed by the plan provisions listed below. If hired prior to January 1, 1995 this benefit is eligible for a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA). If hired on or after January 1, 1995 this benefit would not be eligible for COLA.
ii.	credited service after December 31, 2004 will be governed by the Local 223 Trade and OPT pension plan provisions as outlined in Article 10 beginning January 1, 2005, except that the Disability Provision, as described in this section, will apply to all credited service. This benefit is not eligible for a COLA. However, Local 223 Gas Division employees hired prior to January 1, 1995, will have credited service for 2003 and 2004 calculated under the Local 223 Trade and OPT pension plan provisions and this service would include COLA and lump sum and ten year certain payment provisions.
(b)	Pension benefit calculations and plan provisions for Local 223 Gas Division employees hired after December 31, 2004 will be provided as follows:
i. all credited service will be governed by the Local 223 Trade and OPT pension plan provisions as outlined in Article 10. This benefit will not be eligible for COLA.
Detailed below are the provisions that will apply to all credited service earned prior to January 1, 2005. The only exception would be the service credited in 2003 and 2004 for employees hired prior to 1995, which would be eligible for COLA, lump sum and ten year certain payment provisions, and calculated based on the pension plan provisions in Article 10 of Trade and OPT. All credited service earned after December 31, 2004 will be governed by the Article 10 of Trade and OPT pension plan provisions.
38
The rules for calculating the pension, determining eligibility, vesting, social security supplements, distribution of benefits, reduction factors, payment options and active death benefits will be governed by the plan documents for each plan.
Retirement Plan Notice — Employees who elect to retire with less than four months but at least thirty days prior notification may use their earned or accrued CTO time during the period between notice of and actual retirement.
Retirement Plan Performance — The Company agrees to meet with the Local 223 Gas Division officers annually in order to inform the Union Officers about the investment performance of the MichCon Master Trust Employee Retirement Plan during the previous year. In addition, the Company will provide the officers of Local 223 Gas Division with a quarterly pension report.
Retirement Plan Supplement — If an employee retires prior to his/her Social Security normal retirement age, with at least 30 years of credited service, he/she may receive an early retirement supplement. For retirements on or after January 1, 2003, the total minimum monthly pension benefit payable to age 62, including the “supplement,” will be $2,200. Union members between the ages of 62 and Social Security normal retirement age may elect to continue his/her Company pension supplement until Social Security normal retirement age or begin drawing on any Social Security benefits prior to that date. Members may elect either option but not both. Each member will be required to sign a Social Security Release form and Pension Withholding Authorization form allowing recovery of overpayments should the retiree begin receipt of Social Security benefits and not advise the Company. If an employee retires with 30 years of credited service before age 55, the minimum monthly pension benefit shown above will be reduced to reflect the number of additional years the minimum monthly pension benefit will be received and may be prorated to reflect the pre-2005 benefit. For instance, all eligible service with the Company will be combined for the purpose of determining eligibility for early retirement and for SERA and 130 and Out supplements. For example, if a member hired in 1984 and has 20 years of service under the MichCon plan, 13 years of service under the new plan, and retires at age 58, the member is treated as having 33 years of service for the purpose of determining early retirement eligibility and eligibility for any supplement. Therefore, at age 58 and 33 years of service, the mem
39
ber is eligible for an unreduced pension benefit under the new plan, an age 58 reduced benefit under the MichCon plan, and a pro-rated supplement under both the new plan equal to 13/33 of the full supplement and under the MichCon plan equal to 20/33 of the full supplement. Additionally, since the member in this example hired prior to 1995, the member will receive COLA on his pre-2005 accrued benefit. All new hires into the Local 223 Gas Division beginning January 1, 2005 would participate under the Local 223 Trade and OPT pension plan provisions.
Early Retirement Reduction Factor — The Company subsidizes the reduction factor used to determine pensions for employees who retire under age 62. Employees retiring between 55 and 62 will have their pension reduced by 5% per year. True actuarial reduction factors will be used for retirements prior to age 55 and combined with the subsidized rate to form a blended rate.
Early Retirement Date — You may retire anytime after your 55th birthday, provided your age (as of your last birthday) plus your Years of Credited Service (as of the last anniversary of your employment commencement date) total at least 70. If you want to retire at age 60, you must have at least 10 Years of Credited Service. You may retire earlier than your 55th birthday if you have at least 30 Years of Credited Service. If you retire early, you may choose to have your pension payments begin immediately on your 65th birthday or on the first of any month between these dates. If you choose to have payments begin at age 62 or later, you will receive a benefit figured the same way as the normal retirement benefit based on your Years of Credited Service and final average monthly earnings as of the day you retired. Payments will be smaller than if you had worked until your normal retirement date.
Normal Retirement Date — Your Normal Retirement Age under the Retirement Plan is 65. You will be eligible for a Normal Retirement Benefit on your Normal Retirement Date - the first of the month that falls on or follows your 65th birthday.
Normal Retirement Benefit — Under the Retirement Plan, the amount you will receive each month as a Normal Retirement Benefit depends on several factors: (1) your Final Average Monthly Earnings, or FAME (see below). Note that FAME includes shift premiums and sales commissions, but not overtime or premium pay; (2) your Years of Credited Service; (3) the
40
Covered Compensation limit - each year the IRS determines the maximum amount of earnings on which Social Security taxes and benefits are paid. This is called the taxable wage base. Covered compensation is the average of taxable wage bases for the 35-year period ending with the year you reach your Social Security normal retirement age. The average changes each year; and (4) your monthly annuity benefit, if any, under any other pension plan of the Company. Your monthly normal retirement benefit is calculated according to the following formula:
Step 1.	1.33% X Final Average
Monthly Earnings X Years of Credited Service
(Final Average Monthly Earnings (FAME) is the highest average of your monthly earnings for the best 60 consecutive months in the last 15 years prior to your retirement or termination date. Normally, this is your last 60 months of work.)
Step 2.	PLUS 0.5% X (Final Average Monthly Earnings - Covered Compensation) X Years of Credited Service (up to a maximum of 35 years)
Step 3.	PLUS The amount of your monthly benefit, if any, payable under any other pension plan of the Company or an affiliated company.
The normal retirement benefit described above is the amount you would receive under a Single Life Annuity - that is, monthly payments for life that end when you die, with no payments to a beneficiary after your death. If you are married, or if you choose some other way to receive your benefits, the amount you will receive will be somewhat less, to account for payments after your death to your spouse or other beneficiary.

(i) Standard Forms (Automatic unless you elect otherwise, with spousal consent, if applicable)
41
(a)	Single Life Annuity: If you are not married at the time you retire, you will receive a pension for the rest of your lifetime only, with no survivor payments at death.
(b)	50% Joint and Survivor Annuity: If you are married when you retire, you will receive a 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity. You will receive a reduced monthly pension as long as you and your spouse both live. If your spouse dies, your benefit increases to the unreduced amount. If you die, your spouse receives 50% of your reduced monthly pension. Reductions are based on your age and your spouse’s age at the time of your retirement.
(ii)	Alternate Forms (Spousal consent required if married)
(a)	Single Life: Monthly payments for the rest of your lifetime with no survivor benefits at death.
(b)	Life Annuity with 10 Years Certain: You will receive reduced monthly benefits for your lifetime. If you die prior to receiving 120 payments, payment will continue to named beneficiary until 120 payments are made.
(c)	Joint and Survivor Annuity {50% or 100%}: You will receive adjusted monthly benefits for life. If your spouse is your beneficiary and predeceases you, your benefit will increase to the Single Life annuity amount. When you die, 100% or 50% of your benefit amount will be continued to your beneficiary for life.
(d)	Joint and Survivor Annuity with 10 Years Certain {50% or 100%}: You will receive adjusted monthly benefits for life. If your spouse is your beneficiary and predeceases you, your benefit increases to the Single Life annuity amount. When you die, 100% or 50% of your benefit amount will be continued to your beneficiary for life. If both you and your spouse die before 120 payments are made, monthly benefits will continue to the next named beneficiary until 120 payments are made.
42
(e)	Effective January 1, 2009, an optional 75% Joint & Survivor Annuity payment option is added from which a married participant may select. Under the optional 75% Joint & Survivor Annuity payment option, the surviving spouse will receive 75% of the reduced pension the participant was receiving prior to the participant’s death. The optional 75% Joint and Survivor Annuity will be the actuarial equivalent to the life annuity option; will not include a pop-up feature; and will have no impact on the active death benefit.
(f)	Lump Sum: Retirees can elect to receive up to 70%, in 10% increments, of their pension benefit in a lump sum payment. The minimum amount of any lump sum is 10%.
Minimum Pension Annuity — Effective January 1, 2001, all existing retirees who retired with 30 years of credited service or more will receive a minimum total pension benefit of $450 per month.
Lifetime Annuity — Employees who were at least age 55 on December 4, 1988 and who attained at least 30 years of credited service before December 1, 1991 will receive a lifetime annuity of $50.00 per month starting at age 62 if the employee retires prior to age 62, or at the time of retirement if the employee retires after age 62.
Termination Before Retirement — Employees terminating the Company with a vested pension benefit may elect to receive either an immediate 100% lump sum payment, immediate monthly annuity payments or a deferred monthly annuity.
G.A.T.T. Rates
Termination Before Retirement — Effective January 1, 2000, if you leave the Company after you become vested in the Retirement Plan and choose to receive your pension in the form of a 100% immediate lump sum payment, the actuarial equivalence factors used to determine lump sum payments will be based on the G.A.T.T. (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, part of the Retirement Protection Act of 1994) rates in effect for that plan year. Prior to January 1, 2000, PBGC rates will be used.
43
Normal and Early Retirements — This will confirm that we have agreed that for retirements effective January 1, 2000 and thereafter, the lump sum (10%-70%) calculation will be based upon the terms of the Retirement Protection Act of 1994 (Uruguay Round Agreements Act, Public Law 103, 405 G.A.T.T.) and the G.A.T.T. rates in effect for that plan year. Prior to January 1, 2000, PBGC rates will be used.
Cost of Living Increases — Regular full-time and regular part-time employees on the active payroll as of December 31, 1994 are eligible to receive annual cost of living adjustments on their pension benefits earned through December 31, 2004. Employees hired on or after January 1, 1995 are not eligible for cost of living adjustments on their pension benefits.
Years of Credited Service — The amount you will receive each month after you retire is based in part on the Years of Credited Service you complete with the Company. Except as set forth below, before January 1, 1975 your Years of Credited Service were counted as your total years of employment with the Company. Until July 1,1963, participation in the plan was voluntary. If you started working for the Company before that time and you chose not to join the plan on the earliest date that you were eligible to do so, then you are credited only with one Year of Credited Service for the period between your first day of work and the day you did join the plan. Since January 1, 1975, you are credited with a Year of Credited Service for each 12 month period (beginning on your first day of work) during which you completed at least 2,080 Hours of Service. If you complete at least 1,000 but less than 2,080 Hours of Service in any 12 month period (beginning on your first day of work), you will get credit for a partial Year of Credited Service. The partial year is based on a fraction equal to (Your Hours of Service) (2,080). Normally, you will get a partial Year of Credited Service only if you work part-time or you leave the Company.
Years of Service for Vesting — Your Years of Credited Service also help determine when you become vested in your benefit - that is, when you will have a right to a pension whether or not you stay with the Company until you retire. Since January 1, 1975, your Years of Service for Vesting have been figured differently from your Years of Credited Service for determining the amount of your pension. To earn a Year of Service for Vesting, you must complete at least 1,000 hours of service during any 12 month period
44
that begins on your first day of employment with the Company or any anniversary thereof. You are 100% vested in the Retirement Plan after completion of five Years of Vesting Service.
Break in Service — Under the Retirement Plan, if you temporarily leave the Company before you have completed at least five Years of Service, you may have a break in service. This will happen if you complete less than 501 Hours of Service in any 12-month period beginning on your employment commencement date or any anniversary thereof. If you have a break in service, you may lose credit for the Years of Credited Service and the Years of Service for Vesting you built up before the Break. If the Break is for more than five years and is longer than the Years of Service you completed before the Break, you will lose credit for those previous years. You will have to begin building up Years of Credited Service and Years of Service for Vesting as though you were a new employee. If your Break is for less than five years or is shorter than your previous Years of Credited Service, you will be able to get back credit for your previous years after you return to the Company and complete one more Year of Credited Service.
NOTE: Layoff, sick leave, authorized leave of absence, other authorized absence that lasts 30 days or less, and military service during periods of national emergency are not considered termination of your employment. You keep all benefits under the Retirement Plan if you return to work from these leaves within a specified period of time.
Disability Provision — If you become disabled, you may be eligible for a special retirement benefit under the Retirement Plan. You will be eligible if you become totally and permanently non-occupationally disabled before the age of 65 and you have at least 5 Years of Service when you become disabled. If you have an occupational disability (one caused by your employment with the Company), you will be eligible for this benefit even if you have not completed 5 Years of Service. Your Disability Retirement Benefit is figured according to a special formula based on, among other factors, your Years of Service and Final Average Monthly Earnings at the time you become disabled. For an occupational disability, there is a minimum amount you will receive at least 20% of your average total monthly earnings in the five years before your disability began. If you have less than five Years of Service, your average total monthly earnings while you were employed will be used. Your Disability Retirement payments will continue until you die,
45
reach age 65, or recover, whichever occurs first. At age 65, your pension will be changed to a Normal Retirement Benefit for total and permanent disability under the Retirement Plan. Note: These Disability Provisions are applicable to all credited service, both pre and post 2005.
Surviving Spouse Annuity Benefit — The Company has adopted a Surviving Spouse Annuity benefit applicable to all active employees. An eligible widow or widower will receive a lifetime monthly annuity equal to 20% of the deceased employee’s Primary Monthly Earnings at death.
Additionally, effective January 1, 1998, each dependent child, to a maximum of four children, will receive a monthly annuity equal to 5% of the deceased employee’s Primary Monthly Earnings, payable until the attainment of age 23 for each dependent child. This benefit is only available if the employee has satisfied the eligibility requirements for participation in the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company Retirement Plan for Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements. The Company has the right to amend, alter, or discontinue the Surviving Spouse Annuity benefit without the consent of the Union, provided that such amendment, alteration or discontinuance shall not operate to reduce the benefit level.
Cost of Living Increases — Surviving Spouses — Surviving spouses of regular full-time and regular part-time employees on the active payroll as of December 31, 1994 will be eligible to receive cost of living adjustments on their pension benefits, for benefits earned prior to January 1, 2005, on an annual basis in accordance with the terms of the Michigan Consolidated Gas Company Retirement Plan for Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements. Surviving spouses of employees hired on or after January 1, 1995 are not eligible for cost of living adjustments on their pension benefit.

described above for normal retirements. By making monthly premium contributions, however, an early retiree can keep his/her insurance at the level of 75 percent of his/her base amount for up to five (5) years or until age 65, whichever occurs first, at which time the bi-annual reductions will begin. Such monthly contributions would be in an amount arrived at by taking 600 per thousand dollars of insurance times 75 percent of his/her base amount less $1,000.
(3)	Retirement after age 65. If the employee retires after age 65, the amount of life insurance coverage will be reduced immediately to the amount the employee would have if retirement had occurred at age 65. Employees who are retiring may replace any of the coverage that is reduced or discontinued by converting to an individual policy (not term insurance).

3.	Meter Reading Department Letter —
Performance Standards
All Service Consumption Technicians will be required to meet a minimum of 10% of the station average for two of the three standards every month.
•	Percent of Meters Read
•	Percent of CGI (can’t get in)
•	Reads per Man Day (Read Average)
Meter Readers must maintain two out of three metrics to achieve minimum performance.
Meter Readers must complete their route or work until the end of their shift before leaving the route and returning to the station (excludes driving time to the station).
Critical Success Factors
High agreement is obtained on the Performance Management metrics.
Performance is measured consistently for the entire Meter Reading organization.
Consistent methods are used to coach.
Routes are optimized.
Reporting is unified (standard) and process goals are defined.
Exception Guidelines
In the case of un-optimized routes, individual Performance Management metrics will be based on work assigned.
When less than a full day is worked, metrics will be based on time worked and the percent of meters read will be adjusted accordingly:
8 hrs.	100%
4 hrs.	50%
2 hrs.	25%
55
•	Lost routes in the Handheld System will not be counted toward percentages
Percent of Meters Read
Percent of meters read is calculated by dividing total reads obtained by total reads assigned.
•	The required level of performance, on a monthly basis, is to maintain a Percent of Meters Read no less than 10% below the station average.
CGI (Can’t Get In)
Percent CGI is calculated by dividing the number of reads not obtained by the number of reads attempted.
•	The required level of performance, on a monthly basis, is to maintain a Read Average no less than 10% below the station average.
Reads Per Man Day
Reads Per Man Day or Read Average is calculated by dividing the number of production meters obtained by the number of full or half days worked.
•	The required level of performance, on a monthly basis, is to maintain a Read Average no less than 10% below the station average.
Performance Management Actions for Poor Performers
Review the route, conditions, etc.
Discuss all issues, concerns with employee supervisor and Union Representative.
Identify causes and reasons.
Make necessary corrections.
56
Poor performing Meter Readers will be expected to improve performance to meet our standards within thirty days or they will be placed on a performance improvement plan.
The Performance Improvement Plan outlined in the Company Employment Standards will be followed.

The following basic conditions of classification control shall be recognized as applying throughout the classifications:
1.	Physical Conditions: Employees may be transferred to other work involving a reclassification if they are physically qualified, or they become physically unable to perform their present duties.
2.	Change in Classification: A change in the employee’s classification which requires a change in duties will be made only when there is a need and when the employee has given evidence of qualifying for the work.
3.	Listed Duties: It is not practical to list in detail all of the duties normally assigned to each group, but those listed are typical, showing the general types of jobs, and it shall be understood that any allied duties are included.
4.	Assignment of Duties: When the need arises, employees may be used on other types of work than that they are classified without affecting their classifications, unless, or until, the change becomes permanent.
5.	Transfers: When an employee transferred is temporarily from one department to another, no change in classification will be made. When permanent transfers are made, the reclassification will be made at the time of the transfer.
6.	Date of Change: Except as specifically provided in this Foreword with respect to Probationers and New Employees, classification changes will become effective on the beginning of the pay period following the completion of the qualifying period. When the employee is officially placed on advanced assignment to a higher classification, he or she will receive the rate of pay of the higher classification.
7.	Regularly Engaged: The phrase Regularly Engaged shall be understood to mean that an employee normally is given work listed under the employee’s classification when and if such work is required.
61
8.	Qualifications: All employees shall possess a mechanical aptitude, clerical ability or such educational training as the needs for their particular jobs dictate and shall have those personal characteristics which will facilitate the satisfactory handling of the work. When employees are to be used on duties requiring a geographical knowledge of the city, their knowledge shall be considered a requisite for the classification. Only those employees who have demonstrated their ability to make contacts with the public favorable to the Company will be assigned to this class of work. Only those employees will be assigned to work requiring the operation of a motor vehicle who have demonstrated that they are competent and careful drivers and, if the work requires, able to qualify for a chauffeur’s and/or commercial drivers (CDL) license. Employees shall be as neat and clean of person as the job will permit.
