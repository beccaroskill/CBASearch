In order to qualify for pay for an unworked holiday an employee, otherwise eligible for such pay under the terms of this Article, must work his regularly scheduled day immediately preceding the holiday, the holiday if scheduled and his regularly scheduled day immediately following the holiday unless he has been previously excused from such work by the Employer or unless he was prevented from so working due to a bona fide illness. No employee on leave of absence shall be eligible for holiday pay.
An unworked holiday, even though paid for under the terms of this Article, shall not be counted as a day worked for the purpose of computing overtime pay in a holiday workweek.
Section 47. For employees hired on or before March 5, 2005, when a holiday is worked, the employee shall be paid one and one-half (1%) times his/her normal hourly rate of pay, in addition to the holiday pay provided herein. For employees hired on or after March 6, 2005, when a holiday (as defined above for such employee) is worked, the employee shall be paid one dollar ($1.00) per hour worked.
Section 48. Holiday scheduling. No later than the second Wednesday prior to the beginning of the week in which a holiday observed hereunder occurs (exclusive of personal holidays), the Employer shall post in each store a holiday volunteer work list. An employee desirous of working the upcoming holiday, in the job assignment which he normally performs, shall sign such list no later than the Tuesday prior to the holiday week. Signing of another employee's name on such list shall be cause for disciplinary action.
The Employer will not reschedule the hours of work in the workweek immediately prior to the workweek in which the holidays occur in order to defeat the purpose of this Agreement.
The Employer will select the necessary employees from this list in accordance with seniority and ability, within each store and department, and provided the employee normally performs the work required. Should the Employer not be able to staff his schedule requirements through this procedure, qualified employees shall be assigned to the remaining available schedules by reverse seniority and ability within their respective classifications within each department and store. Nothing herein shall be construed to require pay for time not worked.

All regular full-time employees, and all part-time employees, who were hired on or after March 6, 2005 and who have worked one thousand forty (1,040) or more hours in their anniversary year, covered by this agreement, shall receive one (1) week’s paid vacation after one (1) year’s service, two (2) weeks’ paid vacation after three (3) years’ service and three (3) weeks’ paid vacation after eight (8) years’ continuous service.
Such vacation shall be paid at straight-time rates. The number of hours for which such employees shall be paid for a vacation week shall be the average number of weekly hours worked during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the employee’s anniversary date of employment, not to exceed 40 hours pay for each week of vacation. Hours paid for vacations, holidays and sick leave shall be considered as hours worked for the purpose of computing vacation amounts. No pro-rata vacation will be paid at termination.
Section 50.	Effective the first Sunday following execution of this Agreement, the Employer will convert the employees' weekly vacation allotment to a daily vacation allotment by multiplying the number of weeks of vacation due by five (5). The hours paid for each day of vacation will be based on the average weekly hours of vacation, as calculated in Section 49, divided by five (5). Employees may be allowed to take vacation one day at a time, subject to approval by the Employer and based on the following requirements:
1.	Daily vacation may not be scheduled through the annual sign-up procedure.
2.	Daily vacation must be requested of the store manager in writing by Tuesday prior to
the posting of the schedule for the week in which time off is requested.
3.	Employees may not receive more than five (5) days vacation pay in any calendar week.

16
If one of the holidays listed elsewhere herein falls during an employee's vacation, the employee shall receive an extra day of vacation pay because of it. In the event a regular full-time employee covered by this Agreement, who has been employed for two (2) years or longer, voluntarily quits or is discharged for reasons other than dishonesty or drunkenness or being under the influence of illegal narcotics, such employee shall be paid pro rata vacation pay earned up to the time the employment relationship is severed.
Section 51.	The Employer shall pay the employee the vacation pay accrued during the employee's anniversary year prior to the taking of the vacation (if requested in writing at least two (2) weeks in advance of vacation).
Section 52.	Vacation Scheduling. The employer retains the right to determine the number of employees who may be on vacation at any given time, but the Employer will not block out any week(s) during the year and the Employer agrees that it will permit the maximum number of employee vacations each week, consistent with the staffing levels in the vacation relief/floater pool and business volume. If a dispute develops between employees as to vacation preference, seniority shall govern within the department, the classification and store. Any vacation weeks that become available after the posting of such roster shall be offered by seniority within the classification and store.
The Employer will post a notice December 1 of the prior calendar year, and the employees will sign the roster as to their choice of vacation. This list will remain posted for selection until January 31 of each calendar year.
Any employee who fails to sign such roster prior to January 31 will be permitted to take vacation at a time that will not interfere with the other employees’ established vacation period(s).
When the vacation dates have been established, they will not be changed unless mutually agreeable between the employee and Employer.
Notwithstanding the above, employees who voluntarily transfer to another store or department after their vacation has been selected are subject to having their vacation rescheduled.
On a basis agreeable to both the Employer and employee, employees shall be allowed to schedule vacations from mid-week to mid-week. For purposes of this provision, mid-week shall be defined as a vacation starting and stopping Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday. An employee shall be considered to have met the minimum scheduling requirements of this Article if the total of the hours worked and paid for vacation (and unworked holiday if applicable) for the two workweeks involved is equal to eighty (80) for a full-time employee, forty (40) or more for a part-time employee.

17
for that particular workweek except where the change is predicted on circumstances beyond the control of Management such as, but not limited to, sickness, injury, wide fluctuations in volume, Acts of God. Such up-to-date work schedules are to be posted weekly. This clause shall not be construed as preventing Management from calling in employees for extra work outside of the posted schedule, from requiring overtime work outside of the posted schedule or from bringing in additional employees where it appears advisable in the opinion of Management.
Any changes in the work schedule will be reflected on the posted schedule at the time the change is made.

a.	Voluntary quitting.

Section 67.	Definition of Full-Time Employee. A regular full-time employee is defined as an employee who has been hired as such or works forty (40) or more hours per week for at least four (4) consecutive weeks, in his home store, except for assignment to a forty (40) hour per week schedule as a result of the employee receiving any hours caused by other employees’ absence for any reason. Scheduled hours of work voluntarily vacated by an employee (such as trading of hours) shall not be used for purpose of advancing an employee to full-time status. An employee who fails to maintain full-time status as a result of working less than forty (40) hours per week for reasons other than absence due to an approved leave of absence, or a reduced schedule resulting from an on-the-job injury for twelve (12) consecutive weeks shall be designated as a part-time employee.
BARGAINING NOTE: It is understood that for purposes of this provision, the definition of “absence" shall include such things as absence from work due to vacation, holiday, vacated shift, unexcused absence, funeral leave, jury duty, leave of absence and illness.
Section 68.	Voluntary Reduction to Part-Time. A Full-Time employee who has requested and has been assigned a Part-Time schedule shall immediately be classified as Part-Time.
20
Section 69.	Promotions. The Employer agrees to make promotions to nonmanagement jobs to the most senior qualified employee. The employee shall make such desire known to the Employer in writing and shall state the stores to which the employee would be willing to be promoted. Seniority shall prevail throughout the entire number of stores of the Employer in the area covered by this Agreement.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the Employer from hiring into a Journeyman or top rate position should the Employer deem it necessary.
1.	A promotion is an assignment to a classification which has a higher top rate than the classification being vacated.
2.	If the promotion list is exhausted for the opening in question, the Employer will post a notice of the opening within the store where the opening exists for seventy-two (72) hours and will offer the promotion to the senior qualified employee of the store in the bargaining unit who signs the notice, before hiring off the street.
Section 70.	Probationary Period for Promotions. When any employee is promoted to a higher classification, he shall be on probation for a period of thirty (30) days. An employee disqualified during the probationary period shall be returned to his old classification.
Section 71.	Demotions for Just Cause. Except under the layoff provisions, no employee shall be demoted from a higher classification within the bargaining unit without just cause, which includes business need.
Whenever a member of the bargaining unit is demoted, whether voluntary or involuntary, such employee may be returned to the classification and status (i.e., full-time/part-time) held when he/she accepted the current classification being vacated, or the employee may exercise his/her seniority to claim a position in accordance with the current Full-Time or Promotion Request lists.
ARTICLE 28
AVAILABLE HOURS
Section 72.	The scheduling of part-time employees or full-time employees working reduced hours shall be by seniority within their department and store schedules up to eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week. The Employer shall maximize the straight-time daily and weekly work schedules (including Sunday) of each employee based on the hours as determined and scheduled by management, so long as such schedules would not reduce any employee's schedule below the daily or weekly minimum, except to zero. If an employee is zeroed out, he shall have the right to exercise lay off options; however, any bump to another store shall be delayed for one (1) week. The only exception to this would be when a more senior part-time employee has requested to work less hours than their seniority entitles them. This request must be submitted to the department manager in writing. The average of all meat department part-time employees by store and classification shall not be less than twenty (20) scheduled work hours per week (including paid holidays, sick pay, jury pay and funeral pay) exclusive of part-time employees whose availability temporarily limits them to less than the
21
minimum hours as provided above. It is understood that the twenty (20) hours average shall apply only to markets employing two (2) or more part-time employees in any classification.
Section 73.	Full-time scheduled vacancies shall be filled as defined elsewhere in this Agreement.
Section 74.	The Employer agrees not to schedule two (2) part-time employees in the same classification back to back each day in their weekly schedules within an individual market or delicatessen where it is possible to combine their total posted weekly schedules so that one (1) full-time employee can be used.
Section 75.	Employees who have requested additional hours or full-time status, in writing, as set forth above, shall have until noon on the Saturday following posting of the schedule to take issue with that schedule or his right to take issue shall be waived. Should he raise such issue in timely fashion and should it not be resolved, it shall be subject to the grievance procedure set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of each employee to make himself aware of the schedule and any changes made therein.
Section 76.	In the event of errors in the making of schedules, scheduling of additional hours or reductions in hours, the employee must call the error to the attention of management by noon Saturday following the posting of the schedule. Failure by the employee to point out the violation by noon Saturday will limit the remedy to scheduling the affected employee, on the next week's schedule, the number of hours lost. These hours shall not have any effect on the normal schedule for that week.
FLOATERS: See Letter of Understanding
Section 77.	Additional Hours. Additional hours are those created by increased schedules, terminations or transfers within the classification which the Employer deems necessary to fill.
When it is necessary to work additional hours, the additional hours shall be assigned to employees in the same classification in the store who are scheduled for less than forty (40) hours in the week, in the order of seniority, provided the employee possesses the ability and skill to perform the work required and provided the employee is available to work the necessary hours and has notified the Department Head in writing of his desire for additional hours. Such written notification shall be furnished to the Department Head no later than the close of business on Wednesday to be implemented on the following week's schedule. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the scheduling of additional hours for any employee which will provide him more than forty (40) hours in a week, or five (5) days of work.
The employee being assigned the additional hours shall not have the right to accept such hours in part, but shall be obliged to accept the entire weekly schedule as written. It is understood, however, each employee who has made written request for additional hours may revoke such request by written notice to the Department Head no later than the close of business on Wednesday of the week preceding the week involved.
Written requests shall remain in effect until forty (40) hours is achieved or such request is revoked. Written requests are not transferable from store to store.
22
It is understood and agreed the Employer retains the right to require hours of work even though an employee has not requested additional hours.
Section 78.	The Employer will send the Union a copy of the "full-time request" list, no later than March 1st and September 1st of each calendar year.
Section 79.	Assignment to Full-time Status. When a full-time vacancy, other than a four (4) week at forty (40) hour opening defined in Section 69, occurs and the Employer determines that such vacancy shall be filled by a full-time employee, the job vacancy for nonmanagement positions shall be filled by the assignment of the most senior qualified employee of the classification who has signed the current full-time request list as provided for in this Agreement. Should management be unable to fill such vacancy from the list, then such vacancy shall be posted within the affected store for seventy-two (72) hours and management shall offer the full-time assignment to the senior qualified employee of the store and classification who signed the posting before hiring off-the-street.
Four (4) week at forty (40) hour openings shall be filled by the most senior employee within the store and affected classification who has signed the full-time request list as set forth in this Agreement. Should management be unable to fill such vacancy from the list, then such vacancy shall be posted within the affected store for seventy-two (72) hours and management shall offer the full-time assignment to the senior qualified employee of the store and classification who signed the posting before hiring off-the-street.
Notwithstanding the above, the Employer may transfer a full-time employee from another store to fill a vacancy in lieu of advancing an employee to full-time status under this Article.
Employees with three (3) or more years of service may sign the full-time request list during the first fifteen (15) days of January and the first fifteen (15) days of July to be considered for advancement to full-time effective with the first workweek in February and August respectively. Such request shall state the specific store(s) in the bargaining unit the employee desires assignment to. The Employer will send the Union a copy of the new full-time request list.
If an employee is offered assignment to full-time status and accepts or declines the same, his/her request shall be voided.
The Employer shall not make assignments of full-time status to a probationary employee or to an employee on leave of absence.
ARTICLE 29
SCHEDULING OF SHIFTS
Section 80.	Each week, the Employer will alternate the schedules within a classification within each store after 6:00 p.m., so that such work may be evenly divided as far as it may be practical. The above shall not apply to employees who, of their own volition, want to work the hours after 6:00 p.m.
23
Section 81,	Sunday Work. Sunday Scheduling shall be on a voluntary basis. Should the Employer be unable to obtain enough volunteers, employees in the reverse order of seniority within the job assignment shall be required to work.
ARTICLE 30
UNSCHEDULED OVERTIME
Section 82. Unscheduled Overtime Hours. Daily overtime not previously scheduled shall be offered in seniority order within the department, the classification, and the store to the employees present when the need for overtime arises. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the scheduling of overtime when another employee's scheduled hours can be extended, or part-time employees may be called in without overtime penalty. Hours unclaimed under this procedure may be assigned in reverse order of seniority among those employees within the department within the classification within the store present when the need for overtime arises.
Overtime assignments of four (4) hours or more may be filled by calling in employees, in seniority order, within the classification and the department on their non-scheduled day without violating this Section.
ARTICLE 31
REDUCTION OF HOURS
Section 83. Full-time employees: Management shall not write a schedule of shifts that would result in a full-time employee being unable to work a forty (40) hour schedule (thirty-two (32) hours in a holiday week) unless the average scheduled hours (including hours scheduled and paid for vacation, unworked holiday, jury, sick, and funeral pay) of all part-time employees within the classification and department is twenty-four (24) hours or less for the involved workweek. A full-time employee who is not scheduled a forty (40) hours schedule, shall in their second consecutive week of such reduced hours, be allowed to exercise his/her seniority to claim the schedule of the least senior full-time employee in the classification within the bargaining unit who is working a forty (40) hour schedule. It is understood that the employee may exercise his/her seniority to bump any time between the second and eleventh week of reduction. The employee whose schedule is claimed under this procedure shall immediately be assigned the schedule of the claiming employee, or be allowed to step-down to part-time status and displace the least senior part-time employee in their store.
The parties agree that no employee assigned as full-time on May 11, 1996, shall have his hours reduced to less than forty (40) hours as the result of this provision, unless all part-time employees in the classification have had their scheduled hours reduced to twenty-four (24) hours or less. Such full-time employee shall have his hours reduced to twenty-four (24) or less before any other full-time employee protected under this paragraph is reduced.
Full-time employees-Competitive openings: During the first sixty (60) days following a competitive opening, management may elect, in lieu of reducing hours as provided above, to layoff full-time employees to maintain the same proportion of full-time employees to part-time employees the store averaged in the month prior to the competitive opening. In the event of a layoff, the displaced employee shall be given the following options:
24
1.	Displace the least senior full-time employee in the bargaining unit, or
2.	Step-down to part-time and displace the least senior part-time employee within the classification and store.
Employees displaced by the full-time reduction under this procedure shall be given their layoff options pursuant to the layoff language of this Agreement.
It is understood that the provisions of this section shall apply only to those classifications impacted by a competitive opening.
ARTICLE 32
LAYOFFS
Section 84.	Layoff Procedure. When a reduction in the work force is necessary, as opposed to a reduction in hours, the following procedure shall be used:
1.	A regular full-time employee being laid off may displace the shortest service regular full-time employee within his classification within the bargaining unit. The regular full-time employee so displaced may displace the shortest service part-time employee in the same classification in the bargaining unit. In the event there is no less senior employee performing work in the same classification, this displaced employee may displace the least senior employee in a lower classification in which he previously performed three (3) months of service in the classification for the Employer.
2.	A part-time employee being laid off may displace the shortest service part-time employee within his classification within the bargaining unit.
3.	Any employee with displacement rights under the procedures above shall be allowed to take a layoff in lieu of displacing any employee.
4.	In lieu of displacing as provided in subparagraph (1) or (2) above, an employee shall also be allowed the option of displacing the least senior employee within the same classification and status (full-time or part-time) within the employee’s home store quadrant, if the affected employee is qualified for such position. For the purpose of this provision, the Denver bargaining unit shall be divided into 4 quadrants using Alameda and Broadway as the lines for establishing the quadrants.
5.	It is understood that, in any event, only a more senior employee can displace another employee under the procedure.
6.	No retail store employee shall displace any employee in the meat plant unless such employee has at least six (6) months experience in that meat plant classification with King Soopers.
7.	It is understood that seafood and specialty meat employees subject to the layoff procedures, as set forth in Section(s) one (1) through five (5) above may exercise their seniority rights only within their department, unless such employee is assigned to a
25
combination department in which event such employee may exercise his seniority over the least senior employee within the butcher block classification.
Laid off employees, and employees who accept a job in a lower classification in lieu of layoff, shall be recalled as needed, in order of seniority, to jobs they are qualified to perform. The Employer shall not hire a new employee or promote an existing employee into a position for which a laid off employee or employee who accepts a job in a lower classification is qualified and available to perform. Journeymen and apprentice meat cutters will be considered one classification for the purpose of layoff.
An employee accepting a layoff rather than accepting a job in a lower classification may inform the Employer in writing at the time of the layoff of his desire to be recalled to a lower classification which was not available at the time of his layoff, and such notification shall be honored when a vacancy occurs. The notice shall specify the lower classification to which the employee desires recall. It is understood that any employee on layoff from the classification where the vacancy occurs shall have preferential rights to such vacancy.
Section 85.	Recall Procedure. Laid off employees shall be recalled as needed, in the order of seniority, to jobs in the classification from which they were laid off. The Employer shall not hire a new employee into a classification in which there are laid off employees at that time. The Employer shall offer recall to a job in the classification from which an employee was laid off prior to promoting another employee into that classification.
A full-time employee accepting recall to a part-time position shall immediately be reclassified to part-time status. Similarly, a part-time employee recalled to a full-time position shall be reclassified to full-time status.
ARTICLE 33
TRANSFER FROM STORE TO STORE
Section 86. Transfers from store to store shall not be made or denied for capricious, arbitrary or discriminatory reasons. Full-time employees desiring a transfer to another store within the bargaining unit in order to be nearer their residence may indicate their desire for transfer in writing to the person designated by the Employer. Such transfer requests will be considered at the time an opening occurs within their classification and status.
ARTICLE 34
NEW STORE OPENING
Section 87. In the event of the opening of a new store within the bargaining unit (not a replacement of an existing store) the following procedure shall apply:
1.	At least four (4) weeks prior to the opening of a new store, the Employer will post a sheet in each location for interested employees to sign if desirous of a transfer to the new location. The sheet shall remain posted for at least ten (10) days.
26
2.	Job openings either at the new store or created by transferring employees at their former store shall first be filled by employees on layoff in the classification of the vacancy before any new employees are hired or current employees are promoted.
3.	Employees who have signed the new store transfer request sheet shall be given consideration based on their qualifications and the requirements of the store. It is understood that the Employer may move employees from its own competitive stores which may be impacted by the new store opening before consideration of other employee desires.
4.	In the event the Employer opens new stores within the geographical area of this Agreement, as set forth in Article 1, not less than sixty (60) percent of the initial staffing of the new store shall be made by employees covered by this bargaining agreement, if available.
ARTICLE 35

Section 90.	Military Leave. All seniority granted employees under the terms of this Agreement shall be subject to the rights granted by law to the employees volunteering, called or conscripted for active military service under the National Guard Act of 1940 and the Selective Service Act of 1942, and any additions or amendments thereto, or rulings and interpretations thereof by any authorized court or agency.
Section 91.	Union Leave. Leaves of absence without pay for Union business not to exceed six (6) months may be granted by the Employer to employees who have completed one (1) year of service.

•	Quality education campaign for all participants
•	Superior participant communications, including robust web tools
•	Superior participant information tools
35
•	Analytics measuring participation, compliance, and results
•	Very strong comprehensiveness of programs
•	High levels of integration

An HRQ must be completed each year during enrollment to be eligible to receive the HRQ incentive for each year. During the term of this Agreement, the Trustees may, by mutual agreement, reallocate the HRQ incentive amounts provided above.
2.	Establish 24-hour nurse call-in line and/or medical decision support.
3.	Develop a medical management program that targets high-risk participants with chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, asthma and cardiovascular disease. In order to encourage participant engagement in such programs and to enhance the goal of improving health status a series of incentives must be developed.
There is recognition that incentives may take various forms and will likely evolve and change over time based on program experience with a goal of maximizing program effectiveness and reducing health costs and medical trend. The initial focus will be a thorough educational campaign in connection with program roll out.
4.	Establish free and/or reduced cost educational programs such as:
a.	Weight management
b.	Smoking cessation

6.	Complex/Catastrophic Care Management to provide case management of the entire health care and treatment for participants with high-risk health conditions.
7. Preventive health care at medically appropriate times (see below)

Long Term Funding Policy
1.	The parties recommend to the trustees that a Minimum Reserve Requirement be established equal to IBNR reserves plus a lag month reserve. The Fund consultants shall calculate the IBNR and lag month reserve requirement at least once every twelve months beginning on (date) and report these amounts to the Trustees at their next regularly scheduled meeting. Any withdrawing employer shall reimburse the Fund for their participants claims run off.
2.	If the market value of the assets at any twelve-month review point is ever below the calculated minimum reserve requirement level as calculated by the Fund consultants, then the Fund consultants shall prepare recommendations for benefit plan redesign and/or employee co-premium contributions such that the dollar amount of any such deficiency will be fully recovered by the end of the 12-month period beginning after the trustee meeting in which the deficiency is first projected.
3.	No changes are permitted that would violate any contractual agreement between the Fund and any third party vendor.
4.	If the Fund consultants cannot agree on a recommended plan of benefit redesign and/or employee co-premium contributions, and the Trustees cannot agree to a corrective action plan, by virtue of deadlock motions, then the trustees must act to adopt the recommended corrective action plan that has the least adverse impact on plan participants, however, one set of Trustees may exercise the Fund’s dispute resolution procedure on an expedited basis to determine if other corrective actions must be taken.
37
5.	The minimum reserve target defined above is solely meant to be a “floor”. It is not also a “ceiling”. That is, no Trustee action is required or expected in the event that reserve levels are above the minimum reserve target.
6.	The Long-Term Funding Policy provisions of this Article are suspended for the period of May 11, 2012 through and including September 12, 2015.
Extended Benefits. An employee who has been eligible for benefits for six (6) months or more immediately prior to becoming physically disabled and thereby unable to work, shall continue to be eligible for benefits during his continuing period of disability, up to a maximum of six (6) months.

For all employees hired after March 5, 2005, contributions shall be at a rate of forty-eight cents ($0.48) per hour for all hours worked at straight time (including hours worked on Sunday, vacation and holiday hours paid).
38
The Trustees agree to re-bid the Fund Administrator. In the event the Trustees deadlock over a replacement Administrator, the Trustees agree to submit such dispute to expedited arbitration within 60 days following the deadlock. Such arbitrator will be limited to giving a bench decision in the case.
Effective January 1, 2010 (December hours) for all employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall pay eighty nine cents ($0.89) per hour for all hours worked at straight time (including hours worked on Sunday, vacation and holiday hours paid) into the Denver Area Meatcutters UFCW Unions and Employers Pension Plan, which shall be jointly administered by the Union and the Employer by an equal number of trustees as provided in an agreement establishing such Pension Fund.
In the event the New Hire Benefit goes into effect as provided herein, then effective with hours worked after the adoption of such Benefit, the Employer shall pay an additional ten cents ($0.10) per hour for all hours worked at straight time (including hours worked on Sunday, vacation and holiday hours paid) to fund the benefit.
Funding Policy. Long-Term Funding Policy.
1.	The trustees shall, no later than April 1, 2005, adopt the following Long Term Funding Policy. Such Long Term Funding Policy shall be applicable for plan year 2005 and subsequent plan years. Effective with the January 2005 contribution payment, the employers will increase the hourly contribution by $0.15 per hour from $1.36 to $1.51 for employees hired before ratification.
This $0.15 per hour increase in contribution is a “supplemental” contribution dedicated solely to improving the funding of the pension plan, will not be used to increase benefits and will be discontinued at the times set forth in paragraph 2.
2.	This supplemental contribution shall continue to be made until the earlier of such time the Plan reaches a financial state whereby either: (i) the funding ratio of the Plant (actuarial value of assets over actuarial liability) is at least 100%; or any contribution of the employers would not be deductible for federal income tax purposes in the year in which it is required to be made. However, unless changes are needed to support contribution deductibility, no changes shall be made when the Plan has withdrawal liability.
Effective January 1, 2010 (December hours) the supplemental contribution provided above in subsections 1 and 2 shall no longer apply and shall be replaced by any supplemental contribution that may be provided in the Pension Protection Act section of this agreement.
3.	If as of any valuation date commencing with the 01/01/06 valuation, a funding deficiency is projected to occur in less than 5 years, the Trustees will reduce benefits such that a projected funding deficiency will not occur within any of the 8 years following the valuation date. The parties agree to apply for section 412(e) relief if available before the benefit reductions are enacted. It is understood that application for section 412(e) requires the parties to reduce benefits as a condition of the application. Such section 412(e) application, if approved, must cure the funding deficiency as prescribed above.
If the section 412(e) application is not approved, or not acted on, within 18 months of the valuation date (for example 01/01/06 valuation), then the Trustees
39
will immediately enact benefit reductions to cure the funding deficiency as prescribed above.
4.	In no event will benefit reductions be delayed to or beyond a time that would expose the employers to liability beyond the supplemental contribution including but not limited to liability for the payment of excise taxes or additional contributions. Any deadlocked issue over the enactment of benefit reductions and/or the application of this policy shall be submitted to expedited arbitration ahead of any other matter pending arbitration. Such expedited arbitration shall occur within 60 days of the request for arbitration and the arbitrator shall render his decision within 60 days following the close of the hearing in the matter.
5.	The parties authorize and direct the Trustees of the Plan to develop Maintenance of Equity Policy for employers that do not adopt this agreement upon renewal of the collective bargaining agreement (or for new agreements).
6.	If the Plan experiences a minimum funding deficiency, any excise tax that is levied against the employers will be allocated amongst such employers in a way that first makes all employers not contributing the full amount of the supplemental contribution responsible for fully paying any accumulated missed supplemental contributions with interest. Thereafter, the balance of any excise tax remaining will be allocated to all employers in proportion to their non-supplemental contribution rate. Finally, for any employer not adopting this agreement, future benefits will be based on the assumption that $0.15 of the current rate being contributed is deemed to be supplemental.
7.	The parties recognize there is a possibility of merger of the Denver Area Meatcutters Pension Fund with the Rocky Mountain LIFCW Union and Employers Pension Plan and give full authority to effectuate such merger to the Board of Trustees of the two pension plans without further approval of the parties of this Agreement.
New Hire Benefit:
If the Trustees adopt the Alternate Schedule described above, and such Schedule becomes fully effective, the Trustees are authorized to amend the Plan (if they believe it is appropriate to do so) in order to provide the following Benefit for those participants whose employers have adopted the Alternate Schedule above. Newly hired employees hired on or after March 6, 2005 shall be eligible to receive an accrual rate per month for each year of credited service earned by such employees, commencing on January 1, 2010 (i.e., for service on or after January 1, 2010) subject to the following terms, conditions and limitations:
•	Funding through an employer supplemental contribution of ten cents ($0.10) per hour;

Section 104.	Said Pension Fund shall be used to provide benefit pensions for eligible employees of the Employer as provided in a Pension Plan, the terms and provisions of which are to be agreed upon by the parties hereto; said Pension Plan shall, among other things, provide that all benefits under the Plan and costs, charges and expenses of administering the Plan and all taxes levied or assessed upon or in respect of said Plan or Trust or any income there from shall be paid out of the Pension Fund.
Section 105.	Said Pension Plan and the Trust Agreement establishing the Pension Fund have been submitted to the United States Treasury Department and the United States Department of Labor for the approval and rulings satisfactory to the Employer, that said Plan is qualified under I.R.C. Section 401, et seq. and that no part of such payments shall be included in the regular rate of pay of any employee.
Section 106.	If for any reason, the United States Treasury Department and the United States Department of Labor withholds approval and rulings satisfactory to the Employer, the parties to this Agreement hereto agree to negotiate other fringe benefits or wage increases in the amount equal to the cents per hour provided for in this Article for all hours worked at straight-time in lieu of payments into the Pension Fund.
Section 107.	The Employer shall be represented by its employees, or some other representative on the Board of Trustees administering such Pension Plan. A copy of the Trust Agreement and any amendments thereto shall be made a part hereto as if herein at length set forth, when adopted.
Section 108.	Pension Protection Act
The bargaining parties agree and understand that the Employer may be obligated to make pension contributions in addition to the base contribution rate specified in the Employer Contributions Section. The amount of any such supplemental contribution shall be determined as follows:
i.	Alternate Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule attached hereto as Appendix C, the Employer shall pay the contribution rate required in the Alternate Schedule (modified only as provided herein) of one dollar and fifty one cents ($1.51) per hour effective January 1, 2010 (on December hours) which includes the rate of eighty nine cents ($0.89) per hour described in the Employer Contribution section above and a supplemental contribution of sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour. In the event the New Hire Benefit goes into effect as provided herein, then effective with hours worked after the adoption of such Benefit, the Employer shall
41
pay a total contribution rate of one dollar and sixty one cents ($1.61) per hour, which reflects the sum of the contribution rate required in the Employer Contribution section, the supplemental contribution rate of this section and the new hire benefit contribution rate provided herein.
ii.	Default Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan do not adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule, but instead adopt a legally valid “Default Schedule” within the meaning of the PPA, the Employer shall pay the contribution rate required under the Default Schedule effective January 1, 2010 (on December hours); provided that in no event shall such contribution rate be payable prior to the effective date of all of the benefit adjustments required under the Default Schedule. For example, if the Default Schedule benefit adjustments do not become effective until the start of the Rehabilitation Period under the PPA, the Employer shall not be required to pay the Default Schedule contribution rates until that time.
If any required Default Schedule contribution rate exceeds the rate provided for under subsection (i) above, then each annual increase in the top pay rate provided for in this contract shall be permanently reduced by fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour, and ten cents ($0.10) per hour in the case of Courtesy Clerks, effective with the next scheduled pay rate increase following the implementation of the Default Schedule contribution rate. The permanent reductions provided for herein shall continue year after year. It is understood that each annual top rate increase will be reduced until either sufficient reductions have occurred so as to equal the amount of the increase to the supplemental contribution rate of subsection (i) caused by the implementation of the default schedule or until the date on which the employer implements contribution rates which are reduced to, or below, the contribution rates under subsection (i) above and in accordance with subsection (vii) below, whichever occurs first, but in no event shall any such wage reductions made be restored.
iii.	Long-Term Funding Policy Contribution Rates: In the event the Alternate Schedule in subsection (i) above and the Default Schedule in subsection (ii) above are not applicable during the term of this agreement, but the Long-Term Funding Policy is implemented, the Employer shall not be obligated to pay a supplemental contribution under any other provision of this Agreement, but shall continue to pay the base contribution specified in the Employer Contribution Section plus a supplemental contribution under this subsection (iii) that shall not exceed sixty-two cents ($0.62) per hour. This supplemental contribution shall be a contribution amount which has the same proportionate value relative to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy as the value of the supplemental contribution of sixty-two cents ($0.62) per hour under subsection (i) has to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Alternate Schedule. This approach shall be accomplished by utilizing the following formula: a) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy, divided by b) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternative Schedule, multiplied by c) the supplemental contribution of sixty-two cents ($0.62) per hour under subsection (i). These calculations shall be made by the employer consultants, and shall be final and binding on all parties.
For example: If $5M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long
42
Term Funding Policy and if $10M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternative Schedule and sixty-two cents ($0.62) per hour is the supplemental contribution under subsection (i), then the supplemental contribution under this subsection (iii) is sixty-two cents ($0.62) times $5M divided by $10M, or thirty-one cents ($0.31) per hour.
iv.	It is understood and agreed that the Employer may reduce the amount of any of the above supplemental contributions due the Trust (but not below zero) by the amount of any surcharge, deficiency or excise tax required to be paid by the Employer any time after entering Critical Status. The supplemental contribution provided for herein shall be dedicated solely to improving the funding of the Plan, and shall not be used to increase or improve benefits, and will be reduced or discontinued upon determination by the Plan's Trustees, based on projections provided by the Plan’s actuaries, that such supplemental contribution are no longer needed to support the level of benefits provided for under the Plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection (vii) below.
v.	As a result of the Plans having been certified as being in critical status for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2009, the Trustees are authorized to adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule attached as Appendix C hereto (if they believe it is appropriate to do so). If the Alternate Schedule is adopted by the Trustees, it is hereby deemed approved by the bargaining parties and automatically incorporated into this Agreement.
vi.	In no event shall any contribution increases be required during the term of this Agreement as a result of any annual updates or other changes to the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule or, if applicable, to any Default Schedule.
vii. In the event the Trustees determine, based on projections provided by the actuaries for the Plan, that, at any time during the term of this Agreement, an Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule with lesser contribution rates and/or benefit reductions would be sufficient to reasonably enable the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, the Trustees may amend the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule in a manner that, to the extent possible, would restore reduced benefits and would reduce the Employer’s supplemental contribution in an equal manner and amount, based on actuarial equivalence, provided that such modifications to the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule would still allow the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, taking into account to the extent legally permitted any relief available under IRC Section 431(d). In the event the Trustees amend the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule as provided in this subsection (vii), then the parties agree to adjust the supplemental contribution rates provided above to reflect the lower rates in the amended Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the effective date of any benefit cuts specified in the Alternate Schedule or the Default Schedule, the Trustees determine that (a) such benefit cuts are no longer required to avoid critical status or to have a valid Rehabilitation Plan, and (b) the supplemental contribution could be reduced or eliminated, then the Employer supplemental contribution shall be reduced or eliminated accordingly, and the Employer shall be further entitled to recoup the value of any supplemental contribution paid prior to the effective date of the benefit reductions
43
set forth in the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. This provision shall apply regardless of the reason for the Trustees’ determination, including a change in the law (e.q., a further extension of the Plan’s green status) and/or improved investment returns. The value of the contributions shall be recouped via a suspension of contributions in an amount equal to the amount of the supplemental contribution paid.
viii. The Board of Trustees is authorized to take all reasonable measures to cooperate and assist in achieving the objectives set forth in this Section.

Rehabilitation Period___________________
January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2022.
Plan to Emerge from the Red Zone and Annual Benchmarks to Assess Progress Toward Emergence_______________________________________________
The Plan’s actuaries certify that the Contribution and Benefit Adjustments shown above are sufficient for the Plan to emerge from the Red Zone at the end of the Rehabilitation Period based on the funded status of the Plan as of January 1,2009 before the addition of any New Hire benefits. In the event that the New Hire benefits are implemented, the Plan’s actuaries certify that with the
45
additional contributions specifically designated to fund the New Hire benefits, the plan is still reasonably expected to emerge from Critical Status after such benefit increases, as shown in the annual benchmarks including the New Hire benefits. These schedules will be updated as needed throughout the Rehabilitation Period. Progress toward emergence from the Red Zone will be measured by the Plan’s Funding Standard Account Credit (Deficiency) Balance being greater than (less than) the amounts in the following projections. These projections have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 including:
•	Contribution rates in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement effective for hours worked in December 2009 payable in January 2010.
•	An assumption of the same number of contributable hours as reported for the actuarial valuation as of 1/1/2008. The reasonableness of this assumption has been verified by the Trustees.
•	No market related investment gains or losses from 9/30/2009 forward and no other actuarial gains or losses from 1/1/2009 forward.

50
Step 3D.

COST OF LIVING
Section 128. Effective May 4, 1986, there shall be a cost of living allowance based on the increase in the revised Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical workers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor (1967 = 100) between March, 1985 and March, 1986. For hourly rated employees covered by this Agreement, there shall be a one cent (10) per hour adjustment for every full .4 point increase in that index which exceeds an increase of 5.5% in the Index during the period between March, 1985 and March, 1986. It is understood that if the rates of pay for the classification are less than the Journeyman Meat Cutter rate, such classification shall receive the same percentage increase in the cost of living as the Journeyman Meat Cutter.
56
APPENDIX “A”
ALL KING SOOPERS MEAT BARGAINING UNITS
The minimum hourly rate of pay for the indicated classifications shall be as set forth below on the dates indicated. The Employer may hire any employee at any rate in the progression schedule at its sole discretion.
Rate determination
Employees hired before March 6, 2005 who remain in their classification after commencement of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the “hired and assigned in the bargaining unit prior to March 6, 2005” wage schedule while they remain in that classification.
Demotions, Step Downs and layoffs: An employee who is demoted, steps down, or who is laid off in accordance with this Agreement, shall be placed back into the same wage schedule in which the employee was working immediately prior to their assignment into management or promotion into the classification from which they are being demoted, stepping down or laid off. In determining the proper progression level for an employee demoted, stepping down, or laid off from a classification with a higher “thereafter” hourly rate to a classification with a lower “thereafter” hourly rate, such affected employee shall be placed in the appropriate progression level in the rate schedule referenced in this paragraph based on their experience in the newly assigned classification, regardless of whether such assigned rate results in a reduction in hourly rate. In determining prior experience hereunder, the Employer will give recognition to the verified number of hours of actual work experience in the same classification which said employee may have performed for the Employer and the verified number of hours actual work experience on a comparable job which said employee may have performed within the previous five (5) years for any other employer in a similar retail grocery operation.
Rate Determination - Promotions, new hires and new entrants into the bargaining unit: Employees hired into, or assigned to, or promoted to a different classification, the bargaining unit on or after March 5, 2005 shall be assigned to the “employees hired into THE BARGAINING UNIT OR ASSIGNED OR PROMOTED ON OR AFTER MARCH 6, 2005” wage scale. Employees who are promoted to a different classification after March 5, 2005 shall not receive a reduction in their hourly rate of pay if when promoted to such classification they are being paid an hourly rate of pay greater than the minimum, unless they are above the “thereafter” hourly rate in which case they will immediately be paid the “thereafter” hourly rate. When such employee is paid less than the “thereafter” hourly rate, prior to receiving an increase in their hourly rate of pay, they must work 1,040 hours at their current rate before promotion to the hourly rate in the new classification that would give them an increase in their hourly rate of pay.

POSTING OFFICIAL UNION NOTICE ARBITRATION. DATED 5/14/84

Re: UFCW - 7 v. King Soopers (Posting Official Union Notice Arbitration)
Dear Mike:
This letter will confirm that we have orally reached an agreement to settle this case on Thursday, May 10. Enclosed with this letter is a draft of the language which we have discussed over the telephone which is part of the settlement.
Outside of the settlement, we have made some other agreements or exchanged ideas. First, it is agreed that the August 29, 1983 notice which caused this grievance to be filed, would be considered proper under the attached language. Second, with respect to management reviewing the notice, we have agreed that such a review cannot unreasonably interfere with the timing of the notice i.e., if it is important that the notice be posted immediately because its content needs to be known before a date arising in the immediate future, it would not be proper for Kings to unreasonably insist that a particular individual review the notice who is not then available. If, however, there is no particular time crunch involved, there is a fair amount of flexibility in terms of who reviews the notice and when.
Finally, with respect to the word inflammatory which is included in the settlement, we discussed two different sets of circumstances, one of which we would agree is inflammatory and one of which we would agree is not inflammatory. We recognize that there may be a fine line between the two and hope that all parties will act reasonably in interpreting the language in the facts of each case. With respect to what is inflammatory, it would be improper for the union in a notice to encourage members to file numerous and multiple grievances in an effort to harass King Soopers. It would not be inflammatory for the union to explain rights and to inform the employees that if they have problems or beliefs that these rights are being violated to discuss the matter with their steward or business agent.
I believe that this settlement is fair and reasonable for all sides and that the problem probably arose because of the heat of the moment. To my knowledge, there had never been any problems in the past with posting of notices and it is my firm hope that there will be none in the future. I appreciate your cooperation in helping reach a prompt and reasonable resolution to this matter. If you have any questions about the language, please feel free to call.

SICK PAY. DATED 12/22/87
The United Food & Commercial Workers’ Local No. 7 (hereinafter “the Union”) and King Soopers, Inc. (hereinafter “the Employer”) hereby agree to resolve the grievance in Case No. 52-84 as follows:
1.	The Employer may require employees to complete its sick pay request forms in accordance with the following:
a.	Part I of the form must be completed for all absences for which the employee is requesting sick pay.
b.	Part IV of the form may be required to be completed for absences of three or more scheduled work days.
c.	Completion of Part IV of the form may be requested prior to three scheduled work days if there are suspicious circumstance indicating malingering by the involved employee. Additionally, the Employer may require completion of Part IV where the employee’s absenteeism record is excessive. Under the above circumstances, the employee will be notified by a Company representative, while still absent, that the employee will be required to have Part IV completed.
d.	In lieu of completing Part IV, where necessary, the employee may submit the following, which shall constitute “other authoritative verification”, only if date of disability and diagnosis are indicated.
(1)	Hospital bills
(2)	Worker Compensation Information
(3)	Health and Welfare trust fund information
2.	The Employer will make every reasonable effort to insure that payments will be received in a timely manner.
3.	The Employer will not refuse to allow employees returning from sick leave to report for work because the employee has not completed the sick pay request form or provided other verification of illness. The only exception would be where the employee does not appear physically capable of performing the work or where the illness could remain contagious and therefore dangerous to either product, customers or employees. Where the request for sick leave is denied, the Union may grieve and pursue the same.
67
4.
For absences of one calendar week or more, employees will be required to request a leave of absence in writing.
5. Completion of the sick pay request form will not be required by employees who are not eligible for, or are not requesting sick pay.

In response to our most recent discussion of the above referenced grievance, the Company will accept the Union’s offer to resolve the grievance on the following basis:
That during the first two weeks of employment for any employee of the meat plant, the company shall retain the right to restrict the employee from exercising his seniority to move to another job, or prohibit another employee from bumping the newly hired employee out of his position. It is further understood, that during this two week period senior employees may be forced to take work assignments in another area of the plant as a result of this agreement.
As we discussed, in the event that at the end of the probationary period management desires to extend an employee’s probationary period that such extension will be considered by the union as provided in the collective bargaining agreement.
If this resolution reflects our understanding, please execute both copies of this letter and return one to me.

Re: Retail Meat Floater Pool
WHEREAS, during the negotiations for the current meat contract, the parties agreed to language establishing a floater pool for the retail meat department; and

3.	If a full-time opening becomes available as set forth in Article 27, Section 67, or Article 28, Section 79, and the most senior, eligible employee is an apprentice, and if such appointment would violate the ratio required under Article 7, Section 15, then the eligible apprentice would be transferred and bump the least senior, full-time meatcutter in the district who would then be placed into the original full-time opening.

RE: Personal Beepers/Pagers; Union Case No. 858-91
Dear Ms. Meader and Mr. Bowen:
This letter sets forth the terms of the settlement which was agreed to between the parties in relation to the above referenced grievance during the Med/Arb session conducted on February 13, 1992, at Mountain States Employers Council.
The parties agree that bargaining unit employees may carry beepers/pagers on their persons on Company premises during working hours, but only if all of the following conditions are met:
1.	The employee notifies the Store Manager in writing that they have a personal beeper/pager and that they may be carrying it with them on Company premises during working hours.
2.	The beeper/pager must be set so that it does not emit any audible signal. In other words, it must not “beep”. It may be set so that is signals the owner of an incoming call by vibrating.
3.	The beeper/pager must remain hidden from the view of customers at all times. In other words, it should be kept in a pocket out of sight or worn under a smock or other covering garment whenever an employee is in an area where any customers are.
4.	Service to customers is not to be interrupted. The employee may not look at the beeper/pager at any time while they are on the sales floor and they may only return calls while they are on authorized break periods.
The parties also agree that any violation of the above conditions by any employee may result in progressive discipline up to and including possible discharge in appropriate cases.
75
Finally, it is expressly understood that the Company may apply different rules in the case of any employee that it wants to wear a beeper/pager during working hours for its own business reasons. In other words, the four conditions set forth above apply only to bargaining unit employees who carry beepers/pagers for their own personal reasons.
As usual, it was a pleasure to work with the parties on this case and, if I can be of any further assistance in the future, please feel free to give me a call.

King Soopers and UFCW Local No. 7 hereby agree to the following Letter of Understanding for Meat Bargaining Units in the State of Colorado. This letter shall remain in full force and effect unless the parties mutually agree to suspend its provisions and return to the current Agreement.
1) This letter is limited to employees of the Delicatessen Department. The following provisions shall supersede and replace the existing provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement as such provisions apply to Delicatessen Department employees.
Delete Article 11 (Section 34), 16 (Section 48), 18, 19, 20, 28 (Sections 74, 75, 76, and 77) and 29. Re-write Article 28, Sections 72 to read:
Section 72. Work Schedules and hours. Management retains the right to determine the number of hours, and start and stop time of each shift, to be worked within each department and store. Daily scheduled shifts shall not be less than four (4) hours or more than eight (8) hours at straight-time. Not later than ten (10) days prior to the start of any workweek, management shall post a list of shifts for each department. Non-Management, employees shall be allowed to select their schedule from the posted list of shifts for which they are qualified to perform, in seniority order, within their department. Full-Time employees shall select first, followed by Part-Time employees. No employee shall be allowed to select a schedule that will result in overtime or other penalty provision, unless expressly authorized by management. The employee’s selection shall be recorded on a master work schedule. Employees shall not be permitted to select a portion of a shift. Prior to the start of the selection process, management shall identify approved vacation requests on the schedule. Employees may request, subject to availability, to take not more than one (1) of their personal holidays per calendar year on a specific day to be scheduled prior to the selection of shifts by other employees.
Management may allow employees of one department to select shifts in another department. In this event, the employee must be qualified as defined herein, to perform the work of the other department. In addition, management reserves the right to assign, at its discretion, employees to, and designate the starting time of, any ordering shift.
Employees must immediately make their shift selections at the time directed by management. If an employee fails to promptly select, management shall select on behalf of the employee based on the employee’s last written scheduling preference request. In this event, the employee waives all rights to grieve management’s scheduling selection.
Unless otherwise approved, or as the result of a reduction in hours, no Full-Time employee shall select less than forty (40) hours and no Part-Time employee shall select less than twenty (20) hours per week. Management may require junior employees to select a specific number of shifts so as to facilitate the selection of all shifts from the list. In the event an employee is left with less than minimum hours, but has not been zeroed out, management may pull shifts in reverse seniority order from senior employees to get such employee to minimum hours, or management may elect to zero such employee out and assign any remaining hours in Seniority order to senior employees
98
The Master schedule must be completed and posted by 9:00 am on Friday prior to the start of the next workweek. Such schedule shall not be changed by management for that particular workweek except where such change is predicated on circumstances beyond the control of management such as sickness, injury, leaves of absence, vacations, jury duty, funeral leave, significant fluctuations in sales volume, utility failure or Acts of God. Nothing in this section should be construed as preventing management from calling in employees for extra work outside of the posted schedule, from requiring overtime work outside of the posted schedule, or from bringing in additional employees where it appears advisable in the opinion of management If the schedule is changed pursuant to this section, and hours are reduced, then the master schedule shall be re-bid downward, from the point of the schedule change. If hours are added, such hours shall be assigned as provided in the additional hours section of this Agreement.
For purposes of this Article; non- management positions are defined as those below the level of Assistant Deli Manager. Time spent by employees selecting shifts shall not be considered compensable work. Time, but, notwithstanding, management may permit employees to select shifts on Company time. To be considered qualified, the employee must have been previously classified as, trained for and have worked the job assignment for a minimum of six (6) months within the last two (2) years. Training hours, as designated by management, shall not be subject to selection by employees.
Additional Hours: Management shall post a weekly additional hours request list. Employees interested in working additional hours must sign and designate the days they are interested in working additional hours on such list by midnight of the Saturday prior to the start of the applicable workweek. When additional hours become available, management shall contact, in seniority order, employees who have requested to work on the day indicated on the request list and offer them the hours. If the hours cannot be assigned to the employees requesting them, then management may fill the hours at its discretion. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require management to assign hours at overtime or to employees who have not made a request to work additional hours.
Section numbers referenced above have been modified over the years to currently note the proper sections.
