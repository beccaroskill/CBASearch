a.	Any regular County employee, other than employees assigned to the Division of Voter Registration and Elections, may apply for paid leave from County employment to serve as a volunteer poll worker in a polling place in Sacramento County trough the County Employees as Volunteer Poll Worker Program when the’election day oad/or required poll worker training fall within the employee’s regularly scheduled . workday.
b.	Subject to the sole discretion of his or her appointing authority to . rant or deny the request based on the needs of the service, a regular employee is qualified for approval as follows:	.
55
(1)	In order to preserve the 80% concept, the Table of Allowances
will be reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, on an annual basis. Reviews will cover the annual period October 1 to and including September 30, and revisions will be effective the first of each calendar year thereafter.
(2)	The County may make necessary and appropriate adjustments to individual allowances for each procedure in order to preserve the 80% concept, except adjustments shall not be permitted below the first-year base.
(3)	If it is determined, after an annual review, that the County's dental plan paid less than 79% of the overall average dental charges to persons utilizing the Sacramento.County Dental Plan, the revised Table of Allowances shall contain a penalty factor which would increase the Table of Allowances to reflect the same percentage
• points over 80% in direct proportion to the percentage points Under 80% rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, if the plan paid 74% for the period October 1 to and including September 30, the penalty factor would increase the revised Table of allowances, effective January 1 of the following calendar year, to 86%. In the event the revised Table of Allowances did not reflect an .	86% benefit as determined by the next annual review, the penalty
factor would.be adjusted in the next Table of Allowances to reflect the miscalculation, rounded to the nearest whole number. As an example, if the next annual review indicated the plan paid 83% rather than 86%, the next Table of Allowances would continue the penalty factor of 3% so that the plan would be designed to pay 83%. The penalty factor would continue in this manner until it is within 1% of the 80% concept. In no event will the penalty factor be used to reduce the Table of Allowances below 80%.

60
(4)	Effective January 1, 1999, the per-patient calendar year maximum shall be $1,750, and the orthodontic lifetime maximum shall be $875. Effective January 1,2000, the per-patient calendar year maximum shall be $2,000, and the per-patient orthodontic lifetime maximum shall be $1,000.
g. The plan document was designed after the Valley Clerks Trust Dental Care Program.
h Upon request, the County will make available to recognized employee organizations for inspection the actual dental claims experience used in the annual review or other pertinent periodic tabulations.
i.	Dental benefits will be coordinated with dental benefits provided by any other plan under which the patient is insured, in accordance with the usual established rules covering coordination of benefits as outlined by the California State Insurance Commissioner.
j.	' It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that this section is a continuation of the pre-existing dental plan and that under the said pre- * .	existing Dental plan a penalty factor of 0% was in effect for the calendar

COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO CALIFORNIA
For Agenda of: February 5, 2002
To:
Board of Supervisors
From:	Director of Labor Relations
Subject: ADDENDA TO LABOR AGREEMENTS - DOMESTIC PARTNERS
Contact: Steve Lakich, Director of Labor Relations, 874-7095
Overview
These addenda will bring the labor agreements into compliance with Assembly Bill 25 by including the domestic partner of an employee and the domestic partner’s child in the family sick leave provisions.	* *.
Recommendation
i Approve the attached resolution authorizing implementation of the attached । addenda.
i F’scal Impact
• ' None
Background:	' -	.
Effective January 1, 2002, Assembly Bill 25 (AB25) expanded the rights and privileges of California domestic partners in several areas. The right to use sick leave to attend to the illness of a domestic partner or the domestic partner’s child is the one area that impacts operations for all departments. AB25 defines domestic partners as partnerships of the same sex, or persons of the opposite sex if one is at least 62 years old and eligible for “c?ld age” Social Security benefits.	z ,
Discussion:
in compliance with AB25, the proposed addenda revise the family sick leave*provisions of the labor agreements to include the domestic partner of an employee and the domestic partner’s child. Family sick leave will be applied to these individuals in the same manner as family sick leave has been applied in the past. Proof of registration of the partnership will not be required.
Addenda to Labor Agreements - Domestic Partners
February 5, 2002
Page 2
As stated in current and previous legislation, the amount of family sick leave an employee can use is to be not less than the sick leave that would be accrued during six months at the employee’s rate of entitlement. Based upon that requirement, the minimum amount would be approximately 7.5 days annually for the County. However, the appointing authority has the discretion to decide the amount of accumulated sick leave an employee could use, on a case-by-case basis, which may be greater than 7.5 days annually.
