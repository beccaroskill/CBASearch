DEDUCTIONS FROM WAGES
6.1	The Company agrees to deduct from the wages or disability benefit payments of such of its employees as shall so request in writing all service charges and dues hereafter becoming due from such employees to the Union as certified by the Union, not to exceed, however, the sum of Two Hundred Dollars ($200.00) per month and an initiation fee when required not to exceed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00), and to transmit the money so deducted to the Union as hereinafter provided.
6.1.1	Any employee desiring to have the initiation fee, Union dues or service charge deducted shall sign a proper assignment form, in either one of the two forms which are attached hereto and made a part hereof marked Exhibit A and Exhibit B requesting such deduction from the employee's pay and such request for deduction will, if voluntarily made, upon filing with the Company, be honored in accordance with its terms, provided, however, that such assignment shall be automatically canceled when the employee is no longer in the collective bargaining unit represented by the Union.
6.1.2	The Company shall provide the Union a monthly report that
4
identifies changes in status of all hourly employees, new hires, transfers to/from management, temporary to regular or other changes requiring dues adjustments. The report shall include name, SSN, date effective, status change (from/to) by classification, pay rate, seniority date and inter-island/inter-company transfers.
6.2	In the event rates of Union membership dues are increased during the term of this Agreement, such increase will not be deducted from wages and paid over to the Union unless the Union furnishes the Company a certificate by an appropriate officer or officers of the Union certifying to the fact that the provisions of Section 101 (a) (3) of the LaborManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 have been complied with.
6.3	Such deductions shall not be made more often than once a month. In case any employee does not have the total amount of any deduction, or more, due on any payroll from which deductions are made, dues arrearages shall be collected on insurance pay periods. If collection cannot be made on a particular insurance pay period, collection will be made on the next succeeding insurance pay period upon which such employee has the total amount, or more, due provided, however, that if the amount of earnings is still insufficient to allow for full deduction of dues, then no further responsibility rests with the Company with respect to the collection of such dues.
6.3.1	It is agreed that authorized deductions for government taxes and for the purpose of paying indebtedness to the Company, Retirement System, Credit Union loans, any applicable health insurance premiums or dues, garnishments and deductions required by law to be made by the Company shall have priority over deductions for Union dues and initiation fees.
6.4	The total amount of any such deduction shall be promptly transmitted by the Company to the Union by check drawn to the order of LOCAL UNION 1357, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS. Upon the issue of such check and transmission of same to the financial secretary of said Union, all responsibility on the part of the Company shall cease with respect to any amount so deducted. The Company shall not be bound in any manner to see the application of the proceeds of any such check, nor to investigate the authority of any designated officer of said Union to sign any request, to accept any such check, or to collect the same. The Union hereby undertakes to indemnify and hold blameless the Company from any claim that may be made upon it for or on account of any such deduction from the wages or disability benefit payments of any employee.
6.5	In addition to deduction for Union dues, the Company agrees to deduct from the wages of such of its employees as shall so request in writing premiums for the Union's group life and/or disability income protection plan as certified by the Union but not to exceed One Hundred Dollars
5
($100.00) per month. Any employee desiring to have insurance premiums deducted shall sign the proper assignment form, in the form attached hereto and made a part hereof marked Exhibit C and such request will, upon filing with the Company, be honored in accordance with its terms. Such deduction shall be made not oftener than once a month and the amounts so deducted shall be transmitted to the bank designated on the assignment form. In case any employee does not have the total amount of any deduction, or more, due on any payroll from which deductions are made, insurance arrearages shall be collected on dues pay periods. If collection cannot be made on a particular pay period, collection will be made on the next succeeding dues pay period upon which such employee has the total amount, or more, due provided, however, that if the amount of earnings is still insufficient to allow for full deduction of premiums, then no further responsibility rests with the Company with respect to the collection of such premiums. The Union hereby undertakes to indemnify and hold blameless the Company from any claim that may be made upon it for or on account of any such deduction from the wages of disability benefit payments of any employee.
6.6 The Company agrees to deduct from the wages of its employees as
shall so request in writing, premiums for the Union's Supplemental Life Insurance Plan. Any employee desiring to have insurance premiums deducted shall sign the proper assignment, in the form attached hereto and made a part hereof marked Exhibit E and such request will, upon filing with the Company, be honored in accordance with its terms. Such deductions shall be made twice per month in equal amounts from employees' pay and the amounts so deducted shall be transmitted to the Hawaiian Life Insurance Company, Ltd. each month. In case any employee does not have the total amount of any deduction due on any payroll from which deductions are made, the Company shall have no responsibility for the collection of such premiums. The Union hereby undertakes to indemnify and hold blameless the Company from any claim that may be made upon it for or on account of any such deduction from the wages or disability benefit payments of any employee.
ARTICLE 7
NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUTS
7.1
The parties hereto agree that during the term of this Agreement any
past, existing, or future custom or practice of the Company or the Union to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be no lockout by the Company, nor any strike, sitdown, refusal to work, stoppage of work, slow-down, retardation of production or picketing of the Company on the part of the Union or its representatives or on the part of any employee covered by the terms of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 8
SUPERVISION AND DISCIPLINE
8.1	The supervision and control of all operations and the direction of all working forces, which shall include, but not be limited to, the right to hire, to establish work schedules, to suspend or discharge for proper cause, to promote or transfer employees, to relieve employees from duty because of lack of work, or for other legitimate reasons, shall be vested exclusively in the Company, except as otherwise covered in this Agreement.

In addition, an employee or the Union shall have recourse to the grievance procedure if, in the judgment of either, a letter of reprimand containing a warning of more severe penalty for future improper action is not justified.

36.3	An employee who is promoted to the position of a Leader or Leader Material Handler shall receive on the date of promotion the rate which is 10 cents per hour more than the top rate, as set forth in Article 36, of the highest classification among the employees supervised, or the nearest rate of pay on the new schedule which is at least 3% higher than the employee's present wage rate, whichever is higher.
36.3.1	An employee promoted under 36.3 to a job formerly held on a regular basis, within four (4) years since leaving the former job, shall receive an additional increase of two (2) steps for each full year the former job was held. No employee, however, shall receive a rate higher than which the employee would receive if the employee remained in the former job.
36.3.2	An employee promoted under 36.3 to a job formerly held on a regular basis, within four (4) to eight (8) years since leaving the former job, shall receive an additional increase of one (1) step for each full year the former job was held.

36.4	The wage rate of an employee who is promoted to any job other than those set forth in Section 36.3 after attaining the minimum qualifying score in accordance with the procedures contained in Article 12 shall be increased on the date of promotion to the nearest rate of pay on the new schedule which is at least 3% higher than the employee's present rate.
36.4.1	An employee promoted under 36.4 to a job formerly held on a regular basis, within four (4) years since leaving the former job, shall receive an additional increase of two (2) steps for each full year the former job was held.

No employee, however, shall receive a rate higher than which the employee would receive if the employee remained in the former job.
49
36.5	The wage rate of an employee who is promoted to any job other than those set forth in Section 36.3 even though the employee did not attain the minimum qualifying score in accordance with the procedures contained in Article 12 shall be increased to the next higher rate of pay on the new schedule, provided it is less than 3% higher than the employee's rate prior to the promotion; if it is greater than 3% the employee shall not receive any increase except that no employee shall receive a rate lower than the start rate for the job classification.
36.5.1	Such an employee will be given another opportunity to attain the qualifying score in accordance with the procedures contained in Article 12. If, six months after the transfer, the employee has not applied for retesting the employee will be eligible for a progression increase to the next higher rate in the wage schedule if the employee's work is satisfactory. If the employee attains the minimum qualifying score upon retesting, the rate of pay will be adjusted, effective on the date of retesting, to the rate the employee would have been receiving had the employee qualified previously.
36.6	The wage rate of an employee who is transferred to another job in the same wage schedule shall remain unchanged. The employee will be reviewed for the next progression increase after working six months from the date of the last progression increase.
36.7	The wage rate of an employee who is demoted to a job of a lower classification shall be reduced to the nearest rate of pay on the new schedule which is lower than the employee's present rate, except as set forth in Sections 36.7.1 and 36.7.2.
36.7.1	The wage rate of an employee who is affected by a reduction in force shall be reduced as provided in Section 36.7 or to the rate the employee would be receiving if the employee had remained in the job to which the employee is reduced, whichever is higher.

36.8	The work record of an employee promoted in accordance with Section 36.3 or 36.4 will be reviewed six months from the date of the last progression increase and, if the employee is making satisfactory progress, be eligible for a progression increase to the next higher rate in the wage schedule.
36.9	An employee may be granted an additional increase to the next higher hourly rate as shown in the wage progression schedule during each service year, as long as such increase does not result in the employee being paid more per hour than the top rate for the classification, if in the judgment of the Company the employee is outstanding in the
50
performance of duties.
36.9.1	The selection of employees who shall be granted such a merit increase during their service year, as provided above, shall be made by the Company on the basis of merit and the decision of the Company on such merit increases shall be final.
36.9.2	In the application of the above provisions the term "merit" shall include, but not be limited to, ability, cooperation, effort, quality and quantity of work, and attendance record.
36.10	Whenever a new job is created or the job content of an existing job is changed the Company will submit a job description to the Union. If the rate for the job classification does not appear in Article 36 of the Agreement, it shall be determined jointly by the Company and the Union. If the job classification appears in Article 36 but the Union feels that the classification or rate for the new or amended job is not proper, it shall be determined jointly by the Company and the Union. In the event that a joint agreement on a job classification cannot be reached within forty-five (45) days, the Company and the Union agree to begin Expedited Labor Arbitration Procedures in accordance with the American Arbitration Association rules within five (5) working days. It is the understanding that only one (1) staff member from the Union and one (1) staff member from Human Resources will be involved in the hearing conducted by the arbitrator.
36.11	Assigning Titles: The assignment of a particular title to an employee does not mean that the employee shall perform only the kind of work coming under the title classification, nor that certain kinds of work shall be performed exclusively by certain classifications of employees.
36.11.1	An employee who is regularly assigned to more than one class of work covered by the titles listed shall be classified under the title which covers the work on which the employee is engaged for the greater part of the time.
36.12	When, as a result of a medical examination made pursuant to the provisions of Article 30, an employee is determined to be unable to perform the work required by the employee's job classification because of ill health or infirmity, and the Company is of the opinion that the employee is capable of performing work in another job classification in which there is an opening, then the Company may transfer the employee to the other job classification rather than retire the employee.
36.13	When an employee is transferred to a new job classification pursuant to the provisions of Section 36.12 above, the wage rate will be determined on the following basis:
36.13.1	If the top rate of the classification to which the employee is transferred is higher than the rate the employee is receiving at the time of transfer, the employee will continue at the current rate for six months after which the employee will be eligible for a progression increase to the next higher rate in the wage schedule, if work is satisfactory.
51
36.13.2	If the top rate of the classification to which the employee is transferred is lower than the rate the employee is receiving at the time of transfer, the rate will be determined as follows: 36.13.2.1 If the employee has at least ten (10) years of service, the rate of pay will be reduced to a rate equal to the top rate of the classification to which the employee is transferred, plus a percentage, according to the length of service, of the difference between the employee's current rate of pay and the top rate of the classification to which the employee is transferred. The employee shall continue at this rate until the rate of the job classification to which the employee is reduced meets or exceeds the rate of pay the employee is receiving, at which time the employee's wage rate shall be determined in accordance with other appropriate provisions of the Agreement.
(Schedule follows)
Years of Service	Percentage
10 but less than 11	50
11 but less than 12	55
12 but less than 13	60

15 but less than 16	75
16 but less than 17	80
17 but less than 18	85
18 but less than 19	90
19 but less than 20	95
20 and over	100
36.14
36.15
36.13.2.2 The employee's rate, if the employee has less than ten (10) years' service, will be determined in accordance with Section 36.7.
When changes in operating procedures cause the elimination of a job, and the Company is of the opinion that the affected employee is capable of performing work in another classification in which there is an opening, then the Company and Union may mutually agree to transfer the employee to the other job classification, providing it does not result in a promotion.
An employee may be temporarily assigned to perform work in another job classification in the same or lower wage schedule without payment of a differential or loss of pay.

Both the management and the employees should be aware that not only the actual performance of the Company will be watched, but also that the perception of the relationship between the Company and Union representing its employees will influence the customers view of the quality of service provided and received.
To this end, both the Company and the Union pledge that all negative activities which are visible to the public will cease immediately and that all future disputes and disagreements between them will be handled internally through the process outlined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
In recognition that the financial success of HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. is equally important to all of its employees, the parties pledge to work together to ensure that actions of the Public Utilities Commission and the various legislative bodies will serve the best interests of HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. and its employees.
To facilitate this process the parties agree to establish a Joint Legislative Action Committee, whose purpose will be to meet on a regular basis to discuss pending legislative and PUC issues and to work toward resolving any differences between them in this forum so that whenever possible they may present a united front. This should include joint appearances and lobbying efforts; and when different agendas are required each party should plead its own case in such a way that the common objective of the success of HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. is not compromised.
Both the Company and the Union recognize their responsibility to use their resources to demonstrate their place in the community, and in the past each has
70
made efforts to fulfill this obligation. As a means of further demonstration to the public of their collective concern for the community which is made up of their customers, the Company and the Union will jointly seek opportunities and develop ways in which they can cooperate in these activities.
The parties will establish a Local Common Interest Forum (LCIF). The intent of this committee is to meet quarterly for the purpose of sharing information and/or addressing problem areas and issues of common interest concerning industry, Company and Union activities that affect the well being of employees and all parties. The committee will work in partnership on programs and concerns that may include but are not limited to addressing job and employment security issues, enhancing employee commitment, identifying "hot spots", seeking resolution to problems which may interfere with the relationship, United Way, He’e, Cross Functional Team, community involvement, joint lobbying, competitive cost positioning, personal holiday scheduling, health care cost containment, 24-hour Service Center midnight scheduling, future new business venture opportunities and other employee interests and concerns.
The LCIF will address issues included in the following Memorandum of Agreements: Alternative Dispute Resolution, Education and Life-Long Learning, 4-10 Work Schedule, Home Dispatch, Pending Disputes, Sickness Disability Administration Review Committee and Split Shifts.
In the event either party feels that there is a need, the Union or Company may request a special meeting be scheduled.
If the Union is to share responsibility with the Company for the success of HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC., it must be informed about company plans and objectives. The LCIF will be the forum for the exchange of such information, and provide the process by which the Union's input is received.
No one questions the value of the employee's knowledge and understanding of the best and right way to perform the work that must be done to ensure continuous, low cost service and customer satisfaction. Two problems exist in providing the means of taking advantage of this expertise. First, is an effective way of gathering the information and acting on it in such a way that the employees know that they not only can make a difference, but that their ideas are as important and warrant the same attention and consideration as management's.
The second, and at this time most difficult, impediment is a feeling by some employees that they have become "disconnected" from the Company other than doing their job and taking home their pay. A way around this dilemma is for both the Company and the Union to behave in a way that demonstrates that they recognize the importance of the customer and are committed to service excellence and that because "we are all in this together," everyone is important to our success and everyone's input is not only necessary but also is acknowledged.
71
The Local Common Interest Forum (LCIF) will be responsible for these efforts and will take action to address any concerns that may run contrary to this objective.
This committee will be comprised of an equal number of the following Union and Company representatives: Vice President-Human Resources & Labor Relations, Senior Vice President-Network Services, Senior Vice PresidentSales, Union’s Business Manager, Assistant Business Manager and Senior and Local Union representatives.
A second forum is through communications to the Union’s Shop Stewards. In order to achieve this objective, the Company agrees to have the Union meet with its stewards on company time as mutually agreed to by the Company’s Vice President-Human Resources & Labor Relations and the Union’s Business Manager.
This Memorandum of Agreement is effective September 13, 2008 and shall not survive the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
between
HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC.
and
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357
DRUG AND ALCOHOL POLICY
HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. and INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357 agree to maintain a safe, healthful and efficient working environment for all employees of the company and to provide a work place that complies with federal, state and local laws. Therefore, Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. does not sanction the abuse of legal drugs or alcohol on or off company premises and prohibits the manufacture, possession, use, sale or solicitation, and/or distribution of any illegal drug by any Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. employee. Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. recognizes that drug and alcohol abuse may be treatable illnesses and the preferable response would be education, treatment and rehabilitation.
The following activities are expressly prohibited:
•	The use of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances (except medications obtained in conformity with the law or prescribed and used under the specific directions of a physician or dentist to the user) during a tour of duty.
•	The abuse of legal drugs, alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances resulting in impaired job performance.
•	Any use of illegal drugs or controlled substances is prohibited if the use results in the presence of the substance in an employee's body or body fluids while on duty or impairs the employee's job performance.
•	Being under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs, or controlled substances during a tour of duty.
•	Possession of illegal drugs or unauthorized possession of alcohol during a tour of duty or while on company premises.
•	Operation of a company vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances.
The following terms used in this Memorandum of Agreement are defined:
Illegal Drugs - all forms of narcotics, hallucinogens, controlled substances (including cannabis), depressants, stimulants and other drugs whose use, possession, or transfer is restricted or prohibited by law. Drugs prescribed by
82
physicians, dentists or other authorized health professionals, and used in accordance with their instructions, are not subject to the restrictions of this policy. Legal drugs that are not used as prescribed, or which negatively affect job performance or safety, shall be considered controlled substances within the intent of this Memorandum of Agreement.
Legal Drugs - includes prescribed drugs and over-the-counter drugs which have been obtained and are being used for the purpose for which they were prescribed or manufactured.
Tour of Duty - all work hours, including any extension of the work hours, and all relief, lunch, or dinner breaks after which the employee returns to normal work activities.
Employees who violate the policies contained herein will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination and will have recourse through the Grievance and Arbitration procedures of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. It is understood that a decision to discipline as a result of a violation of this Policy or a positive test would depend on all circumstances surrounding the particular situation and would be based on established just cause standards. The Company acknowledges that employees will have the right to union representation, as provided by the Weingarten decision. The Company has not agreed to representation that is beyond that provided in Weingarten.
Drug and Alcohol Testing
The Company will guarantee forensic quality chain of custody procedures will be followed for all drug screens. Any break in the chain of custody will result in the test being ruled invalid. The Company will use NIDA established cutoff levels where available. Only NIDA certified labs will be used. At the time the specimen is collected for a drug screen that is not required by law, the employee will be provided the opportunity to provide two specimens in separate containers. The second specimen will be properly sealed and maintained so as to be available for retest at the request of the employee and/or the Union as described below. The Company agrees that the employee who tests positive on both the screen and the confirmation test will have the option to request the additional specimen be released to a certified lab to be retested. If there is no second specimen, a portion of the remaining specimen will be made available for retest. It is also understood that in some small percentage of the cases it is possible that there may not be enough of the specimen remaining to retest. The Company's responsibility for the chain of custody ends when the specimen is released at the direction of the second testing lab. This request must be made by the Union or the employee within ten (10) working days from the date the original test result is provided to the employee. It is understood that the employee and/or the Union is responsible to arrange for the test at the same or another NIDA certified lab and be responsible for all associated additional cost. The results of this retest will be forwarded to the Company within ten (10) working days from the date the results are available for consideration by the Company. In the event the second test is negative and, if after review, the Director-Health Services concurs with the negative test result, the
83
employee may request reimbursement from the Company for any additional costs incurred.
Drug and alcohol screening will also be conducted in the following situation:
•	Reasonable cause - observed behavior that can be attributed to substance abuse. The indicators shall be recognized as accepted symptoms of intoxication or impairment caused by drugs or alcohol.
Guidelines for screening employees when there is "reasonable cause" are as follows:
•	It is the supervisor's responsibility to make a good faith determination that an employee is fit for duty. Such determination is a result of the supervisor's objective observation of an employee's ability to perform job duties in a safe and efficient manner. Supervisors observing one or more indicators of intoxication or impairment, should ask at least one other responsible person, such as another supervisor, if reasonable available, to observe the employee for corroboration. After consultation, the immediate supervisor should contact the Director-Health Services.
•	The Company will require that the observations that result in the requirement for drug and/or alcohol screening will be documented in writing by the management employee(s) who makes the observation.
•	It is not the intent of the policy to require a drug/alcohol screen as a result of a performance problem(s), in and of itself, without the presence of indicators that would cause a "reasonable person" to conclude that the individual could be under the influence of a drug or alcohol. This is to say that a single indicator that could be the result of many different conditions would not be the sole factor that would result in a requirement for a drug/alcohol screening.
•	Employees may be required to submit to drug and/or alcohol screening (with concurrence of local Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. Health Services Director or his/her designee and Director-Human Resources or his/her designee) if they exhibit signs of:
-	impairment or intoxication
-	performance deficiencies
-	behavior patterns inconsistent with their normal behavior
•	The employee will be offered an opportunity to give an explanation to management of the employee's condition, such as reaction to a prescribed drug, fatigue, lack of sleep, exposure to noxious fumes, reaction to over-the-counter medication or illness.
•	Employees requested to submit to a screening test are required to sign a consent/release form authorizing the physician to perform the test and release the results to the company. If an employee refuses to sign a consent/release form and/or submit to a screening test, the employee's refusal will be considered the same as a confirmed positive.
84
•	Employees who say they are unable to give urine samples (for a urinalysis test) immediately upon request, will be given up to three hours to provide that sample. If they fail to provide the sample within that time, they will be subject to the same action as those employees who refuse to submit to testing and/or sign a consent/release form.
•	Employees whose test results are confirmed positive for drugs and/or alcohol will be contacted by the Director-Health Services prior to disciplinary action which may include termination and will have recourse through the Grievance and Arbitration procedures of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Post Treatment
After an employee has been referred to a treatment facility for drug and/or alcohol rehabilitation in lieu of, or as part of, disciplinary action, Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. may require:
•	The treatment facility test the employee for the presence of any type of drug or controlled substance and/or the presence of alcohol prior to the employee's return to work at Hawaiian Telcom, Inc.
•	The employee undergo periodic, announced testing for such drugs and/or alcohol for up to two years after the completion of rehabilitative treatment. Such tests may be performed by the treatment facility and/or a company designated medical facility.
Prior to starting such a medical evaluation, the employee is required to complete and sign a consent form, and the signature is to be witnessed.
Post Accident
If an employee is directly involved in a personal injury or general liability accident during their tour of duty, while on or off company premises, or while operating a company vehicle or a mobile tool, the employee will be required to submit to a drug and/or alcohol screening test if either of the conditions listed below are met:
•	Fatality of an employee or member of the public.
•	The employee exhibits signs of impairment and/or behavioral patterns inconsistent with his/her normal behavior. However, it is not the intent of the policy to require drug or alcohol screening after an accident (in which no death occurs) as a result of behavior that can clearly be attributed to the accident alone.
This test should occur as soon after the accident as practicable, but in no case later than 32 hours after the accident. Medical treatment of any injury resulting from the accident takes precedence over the screening test.
Body fluid samples for testing include urine and/or blood (when appropriate). Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. physicians will interpret and report test results. If an
85
employee refuses to sign a consent/release form and/or submit to a screening test, the employee's refusal will be considered the same as a confirmed positive test, and the employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination and will have recourse through the Grievance and Arbitration procedures of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Alcohol Use
Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. restricts the use of alcohol by its employees as follows:
•	No alcohol is to be consumed during a tour of duty.
•	No employee is to be "under the influence" of alcohol during a tour of duty.
•	No employee may operate a company vehicle while "under the influence" of alcohol, illegal drugs or controlled substances.
“Under the influence" shall mean having a quantity of alcohol in one's body sufficient to:
•	Interfere with one's ability to perform assigned duties in a productive manner.
•	Cause one to be exposed to an increased safety risk.
•	Create an increased risk to the safety or property of others.
•	Create an increased risk of damage to company property.
Violating any of the above listed restriction is a serious breach of company policy and will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination and the employee shall have recourse through the Grievance and Arbitration procedures of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Drug Awareness Training
The Company shall provide written notice of its Drug and Alcohol Policy to all employees and provide initial and periodic follow up training.
A major thrust of our concern is to educate both management and hourly employees. Employees are to learn:
•	Hawaiian Telcom, Inc.'s position on drug and alcohol use and abuse.
•	Dangers involved in drug and alcohol use and abuse.
•	The importance of rehabilitation in the overall policy.
This ongoing education addresses the problem of drug and alcohol abuse from three perspectives:
•	As an educational measure for prevention.
•	To alert supervisors to drug/alcohol policies and the existence of help for troubled employees.
•	In a rehabilitative mode--where needs have been identified and treatment is
86
indicated.
The training includes the following components:
•	Employee awareness activities/training.
•	Supervisory training.
•	Employee Assistance Program (EAP).
Each component is detailed in the following paragraphs.
Awareness activities and training for all employees include the following:
•	Distribution of brochures, pamphlets, posters, etc., about drugs and alcohol and how to seek help from the EAP and/or community resources.
•	Recognition of warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse.
•	Employee awareness sessions, lunchtime workshops, and other appropriate means to educate employees about drug and alcohol and this policy.
All supervisors are to be trained to assist in identifying and addressing the illegal use of drugs and the use/abuse of alcohol by employees. Training for supervisors includes, but is not limited to, the following:
•	Recognizing signs of being "under the influence" and signs of impairment that may be linked to a drug or alcohol problem.
•	Accessing the Employee Assistance Program (EAP).
•	General education and awareness programs about drug or alcohol addiction including information on how to seek help.
•	Using related written and audiovisual materials.
Employee Assistance Program
The Company makes available an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to all employees and their families. Along with other services, the EAP offers confidential assistance to those involved in drug and/or alcohol abuse.
Employees are encouraged to voluntarily seek help through EAP.
EAP's role includes:
•	Providing help in resolving substance abuse problems.
•	Making appropriate referrals to resources for treatment.
•	Monitoring progress in treatment.
•	Designing a follow-up program when necessary.
Managers and supervisors may refer employees to the EAP to receive appropriate assistance. Employee's self-referrals and their individual interactions with EAP are
87
confidential and no record of an employee's interactions with the EAP is included in the employee's personnel file. Employee's interactions with the EAP are shared with supervisors or others only with the permission of the employee.
Note: Exceptions to the policy of confidentiality are the following:
•	The individual is a danger to him/herself.
•	The individual is a danger to others.
•	When child abuse is involved.
The services of Hawaiian Telcom, Inc.'s Employee Assistance Program can be accessed by:
•	Self-referral
Employees who recognize the need to use the services of the EAP are encouraged to do so before their job performance is affected. If self referral is done on the basis of a substance abuse or alcohol related problem, it will not be treated as a first offense. Self referral cannot occur to avoid disciplinary action, or prior to a Company imposed drug test. Family members are encouraged to seek the services of the EAP as well.
•	Supervisor Referral
Supervisors with employees who have job performance or behavioral problems are encouraged to consult and/or refer to the EAP. Referrals of employees will not be a defense against disciplinary action.
After a referral of an employee to the EAP, a comprehensive assessment will be completed. If the assessment identifies a substance abuse problem, an appropriate treatment plan will be coordinated through EAP.
•	It is agreed that an employee who tests positive on the first occasion will not normally be terminated as a result of this first test, unless surrounding the incident that resulted in the requirement for the test there are other performance or behavior problems that warrant discharge. Also, active participation in a recommended EAP referral program will not normally jeopardize an employee's continued employment with the Company provided job performance and on-the-job behavior is satisfactory. However, participation will not prevent disciplinary action for a violation of Company policy and/or procedures of unsatisfactory job performance.
•	Employee Relations/Labor Relations Referral
With Employee Relations/Labor Relations approval, employees in the discipline process who are thought to have a substance abuse-related problem may be referred to the EAP for an assessment. After the
88
assessment is completed, and with the employee's consent, the EAP will give feedback to Employee Relations/Labor Relations and provide a professional opinion as to the treatability of the employee's behavior problem.
Based on this input, Employee Relations/Labor Relations will make the decision whether or not to offer treatment as part of the discipline process. If treatment is determined to be appropriate, the employee will be informed of his/her alternatives.
Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. further agrees to hold harmless, and indemnify, IBEW Local Union 1357 from any liability as a result of actions of the Company relating to this policy.

EDUCATION AND LIFE-LONG LEARNING
HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. and INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357 agree to continue joint efforts (including the 100% tuition reimbursement and the 100% prepaid feature), which allow employees, who have completed their probationary period, additional opportunities to learn and enhance their knowledge of the jobs being performed. On an “as needed” basis as determined jointly by the parties, a joint study team, consisting of management and union officials, identified by the LCIF of the Cooperative Efforts MOA will be created to explore opportunities for joint educational programs.

•	The level of employee awareness of the Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. tuition assistance program.
•	The role of education assistance in the attraction and retention of bargaining unit employees.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE (FMLA)
1.	HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. and INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357 agree to the provisions concerning Family and Medical Leaves of Absence under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement.
2.	The purpose of the leave shall be as follows:
a.	for the birth and care of a newborn child of the employee, or the placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care.
b.	to care for a spouse, domestic partner, biological or adoptive parent, or person who has acted in role as parent with day-to-day responsibility, or child (biological, adopted, foster or stepchild or legal ward or child for whom the employee has day-to-day parental responsibility) who has a "serious health condition".
c.	for a serious health condition of the employee which makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the position of such employee. As with any absence for a serious health condition, employees will be required to provide a "fitness for duty" certification to return to work after such leave.
3.	The total period of this leave will be up to twelve (12) work weeks within a twelve (12) month period, calculated on a twelve (12) calendar months basis. Any leave or absence provided for in the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), whether paid or without pay, that are qualified under the Family Medical Leave Act, shall run concurrently with the Family Medical Leave.
4.	Employees who have completed at least twelve (12) months of accredited service at the beginning of the leave and worked at least 1,250 hours during such period may be eligible for leave.
5.	The FMLA excludes employees where there are less than fifty (50) employees within seventy-five (75) miles of the employee's work site. The
93
Company will attempt to accommodate requests for FMLA leave for employees at remote locations, however, such requests may be denied based on business necessity.
6.	Leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis for reasons specified in paragraphs 2.b and 2.c if determined to be "medically necessary" as defined in the Department of Labor Regulations 29 CFR Part 825. It may not be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule basis for reasons specified in paragraph 2.a unless approved by the Company.
7.	If an employee is granted intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the Company may require such employee to transfer temporarily to an available alternative, equivalent position that better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular position.
8.	Employees shall be required to present, to the satisfaction of the Company's Human Resources Services Department, documentation concerning the basis for the requested leave of absence. Failure to provide medical certification within twenty-five (25) days of the request for leave may result in denial of leave.
9.	Employees shall provide the Company with at least thirty (30) days advance notice of intent to take leave when foreseeable.
10.	In cases where both spouses are employed by the Company, and both spouses are eligible for FMLA leave, they will be permitted to take a total of 12 weeks of FMLA leave during the applicable 12-month period for any one qualifying circumstance. Where the husband and wife both use a portion of the total 12 week FMLA leave entitlement for one qualifying circumstance, the husband and wife would each be entitled to the difference between the amount he or she took individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for a different purpose.
11.	While on FMLA leave, eligible employees shall continue to receive company-paid life insurance and medical/dental benefits to the extent provided to active employees.
12.	Upon return to work, employees granted FMLA leave shall receive accredited service for the period of the leave. There is no break in service for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate in pension plans and other types of benefits and seniority.
13.	Subject to Item 15 below, at the end of the approved leave (or each segment of the leave, as applicable), employees shall be guaranteed reinstatement to the same or equivalent job.
94
14.	Reinstatement is subject to any contractual provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement which cover adjustments to the workforce that may have occurred during the leave of affected employees.
15.	Employees who wish to change their projected return date, may request the change and the Company will endeavor to accommodate such requests.
16.	Employees, while on leave, shall be considered to have terminated employment if they accept employment with another employer, engage in business for profit, and/or apply for unemployment insurance benefits.
17.	The provisions of this Memorandum of Agreement are not subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement except for the application for reinstatement by employees on leave.
18.	All terms herein shall be defined as set forth in the Department of Labor Regulations, 29 CFR 825.
19.	The Company has the right to act in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and to comply with the regulations provided by the Department of Labor.
20.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on September 13, 2008 and shall expire on September 12, 2011. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also terminate on September 12, 2011 and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

HOURLY SAVINGS PLAN (HSP)
1.	HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. and INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357 will make the Hourly Savings Plan (HSP) available to regular full time hourly employees of the Company who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement.
2.	The Company reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, by action of the Board of Directors, to modify or amend in whole or part, any or all of the provisions of the HSP, but no such amendment or modification shall have the effect of reducing the accrued benefits of members, retired members, former members or their beneficiaries or of diverting any part of the Trust Fund to any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of members, former members, or their beneficiaries and the payment of reasonable HSP administration expenses.
3.	The Company reserves the right, by action of the Board of Directors, to terminate or partially terminate the HSP at any time. Upon termination or partial termination of the HSP or upon the complete discontinuance of contributions under the HSP, the member accounts of the members affected by the termination, partial termination, or complete discontinuance of contributions as the case may be shall be nonforfeitable.
4.	The HSP may be merged into or consolidated with another plan, and its assets or liabilities may be transferred to another plan; provided, however, that no such merger, consolidation, or transfer shall be consummated unless each member and beneficiary under the HSP would receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer, if the transferee plan then terminated, that is equal to or greater than the benefit he/she would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer, if the HSP had then terminated.
5.	The Company and the Union agree that every provision heretofore contained in this Agreement is contingent upon the Company’s receipt of a favorable determination that the HSP, as amended, continues to be qualified under Section 401 (a) et. seq., of the Internal Revenue Code. In the event any recession in the HSP is necessary to obtain or maintain a
106
favorable determination from the Internal Revenue Service, the Company will make the revisions, adhering as closely as possible to the level of benefits contained in the HSP.
6.	In the event any portion of this Agreement is determined by a court or government agency to be in violation of existing law or is voided by a change in existing laws, the Company retains the unilateral right to make whatever modifications it deems necessary and appropriate to comply with the law, including the right to rescind the Agreement, if it deems no such modification is feasible. The Company shall have no obligation to bargain or negotiate with the Union in the event that this Agreement is modified or eliminated or in the event the Company does not implement any or all of the provisions of this Agreement because it does not receive Internal Revenue Service approval, any or all of these plans are deemed not qualified, or because of a change in existing laws.
7.	The HSP will be administered solely in accordance with its provisions and no matter concerning the HSP or any difference arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure of the Collective Bargaining Agreement but rather shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the HSP and the interpretation of the HSP Committee.
8.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on September 13, 2008 and shall expire on September 12, 2011. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also terminate on September 12, 2011 and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also terminate on September 12, 2011 and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
between
HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC.
and
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357
NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
This agreement between HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. (“Company”) and INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357 (“Union” or “IBEW Local Union 1357”) covers all understandings between the parties concerning union organizing; access to employees and code of conduct applicable to union organizing efforts.
The Union and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to enhance the success and image of the Company, to acknowledge the Union as a valued partner, and to foster the pride and commitment of the employees. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development. As a means to enhance these goals, the parties will mutually support regulatory and legislative efforts, marketing/sales and service efforts and other business initiatives leading to employment security and Company’s business success.
The parties also recognize that the Union’s goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. (formerly a Verizon Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier). This shall be the exclusive means by which the Union, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize eligible employees in Hawaiian Telcom, Inc. as defined by the National Labor Relations Act.
1.	Employee Choice
Both the Union and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties’ mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage and nurture an environment during a union
122
organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct and voting will be performed by Company’s Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local management and designated Union representatives.
2.	Neutrality
The Company and the Union agree that an organizing drive will be met by a neutral position by the Company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. It should follow that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging.
Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the Union be antimanagement.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should not vote for a Union to represent them.
(c)	The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to employees to get their message communicated.
(d)	Management will respond to employee questions and is obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a “third party” or “outsider”.
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j)	The Company will not conduct meetings for the sole purpose of
123
discussing organizing activities without inviting appropriate Union representatives to attend.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3.	Rules
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show a minimum of 50% + 1 show of interest on signature cards of the appropriate unit.
(b)	A vote of 50% + 1 of those votes, validated by the Third Party Neutral (TPN), will determine the outcome.
(c)	If the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots in similar fashion to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.
4.	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will “start the clock”. The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90-day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process exceed 120 days. If employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local Union from having contact with the workers in the group. If employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and will be limited to the agreed upon unit.
5.	Informed Decision
124
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a Labor Union. Management’s role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries;
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including obligations and responsibilities; and
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies, misstatements or misunderstandings disseminated by the Union.
6.	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union or any other party or parties. One way to ensure this objective is to have a NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process that is called “Consent Election.” This process will work as follows:
(1)	As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use “Consent Election”.
(2)	The Unions shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a TPN proof of support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The TPN will then notify the Company’s Labor Relations Staff and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within five working days. The Union will also be furnished with the list. The “show of interest” cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(3)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two weeks of the submission of the Union’s show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The TPN will count the votes and
125
advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this agreement, a vote of 50% + 1 of those who vote will control. The parties may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(4)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union’s show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases where there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of using a neutral site will be split equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to composition of the unit, the TPN shall decide the issue within an additional seven days.
7.	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the Union for access, the Company’s Labor Relations Staff, in conjunction with local management and Union representatives, will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by the Union representatives. The Union will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Company facilities. It is the intent and commitment of the Company and IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357 that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of the Company generally, and specifically, the selected unit. Access agreed upon will be in nonworking areas and during employee nonworking times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, an uneventful access, such as a prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected.
If the Company and IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357 are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. The Company and IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357 commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.
8.	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, the Company’s Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with the Company’s management and appropriate
126
IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357 representatives. It is the intent and desire of the Company and the IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357 that such matters are dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. Either the Company or IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357 can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three working days’ written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide concise statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between them.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.) the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the NLRB and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
127
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. The Company and IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357 believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
The Company and IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357 agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses, resulting from the use of the TPN process, shall be split equally by the Company and IBEW LOCAL UNION 1357.
9.	Acquisitions and Ventures
The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications industry. The Company may acquire (or be acquired by) another entity. It has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The employees in those entities may be nonrepresented, represented in whole or in the part of the Union, or represented in whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement.
10.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on September 13, 2008 and shall expire on September 12, 2011. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also terminate on September 12, 2011 and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

PENDING DISPUTES
The Collective Bargaining Agreement contains the mechanism for settling grievances including arbitration. In order for this process to work effectively the parties must be able to use it to resolve disputes in a timely manner. At this time the number of pending grievances and arbitration cases is such that it is difficult to find solutions in the most effective way.
In recognition of this, the LCIF as identified in the Cooperative Efforts MOA will examine all pending disputes, attempt to discover the underlying causes and find lasting solutions. It is the intent of the Company and Union to resolve all current disputes as a part of their pledge to a new relationship and to restore the grievance procedure to its intended purpose of resolving problems when and where they occur.
Since the first responsibility for settling "shop floor" disputes lies with the union stewards and the first line supervisors it is imperative that they be equipped with the best available tools to carry out this responsibility. To ensure that they have received the best possible training in this area the parties agree to implement a joint training program including dispute resolution methods and contract interpretation.
The LCIF as identified in the Cooperative Efforts MOA is established for the purpose of fostering".a strong working partnership and to maintain positive
Company/Union relations." In a further effort to keep disputes at a minimum so that time and energy can be directed toward positive endeavors, the parties agree to extend the concept of the LCIF to the job site by the establishment of Cross Functional Teams (CFTs) which will meet periodically to discuss various matters which will affect, or are affecting, the employees, their jobs, and their ability to best serve the customers.

4.	For married employees, the spouse will automatically be considered the beneficiary. However, subject to the requirements regarding non-spouse beneficiaries and with spousal consent, a married employee may name a beneficiary other than the spouse. A single individual must be named as beneficiary; an estate or trust may not be named, nor may multiple individuals.
5.	Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the pre-retirement survivor pension may be distributed as a 50% or 65% survivor annuity, or the lump sum equivalent, based upon the employee's election.
6.	If a vested employee terminates employment on or after the effective date, the named survivor will be eligible for the survivor pension payable on the date the employee would have reached the age 65. An actuarially reduced benefit may be payable before age 65 if the vested employee would have
134
been eligible for an earlier commencement.
7.	In addition, the Pension Plan shall be amended to allow an employee, at the time of commencing a pension benefit, to designate any living person as the beneficiary for any of the forms of joint and survivor annuity offered under the Pension Plan or any of the term-certain forms of benefit. In the case of an employee who is married at the time of commencing a pension, the employee may not designate any beneficiary other than the spouse without complying with the spousal consent rules of the Plan.
8.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on September 13, 2008 and shall expire on September 12, 2011. The parties specifically agree that all the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also expire on September 12, 2011 and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement, unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

1.	HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. and INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357 mutually agree that the Company may, at its sole discretion, establish and implement from time to time Performance Differentials for employees who have completed the probationary period and are at the 54 or 60-month step of their wage schedule.
2.	It is agreed that an employee who is consistently meeting high performance standards may be granted a Performance Differential. The performance measurement criteria will be established on an annual basis. Each department (at the Director level) may develop and establish "stretch" performance standards/criteria for select job classifications and/or employee groups that must be met or exceeded in order for an employee to qualify for the Performance Differential. The criteria will be reviewed with the Business Manager prior to implementation.
3.	The amount of the hourly Performance Differential may vary by job classification and/or departments; this variance is necessary due to the varying levels of payback associated with incremental performance improvement in each job classification. All differential amounts must be reviewed with the Business Manager.
4.	It is also understood that the following parameters will apply to Performance Differentials:
a.	The performance differential will be applied only to hours actually worked, including overtime hours actually worked, and will be included in the computation of any overtime compensation that may be due employees.
b.	The performance criteria will be established once a year.
c.	Employees who meet the performance criteria accumulative average for six months will be paid the performance differential during the following six (6) months.
136
d.	To be eligible for the performance differential, the employee must have worked 840 straight time hours during the six (6) month review period.
e.	An employee whose differential is discontinued will be ineligible for the differential until the next six (6) month review.
f.	An employee who has received a Merit Increase is not eligible for performance differential for the same time period.
g.	In the event of a process suspension, employees currently receiving a performance differential will continue for an additional 90 days from the effective suspension of the agreement, or to the end of period for which their current differential applies, whichever comes first.
h.	The payment of an employee's earned performance differential shall end on the employee's last day paid.
If an employee met the criteria unethically, such employee's performance differential will be immediately stopped.
The provisions of the Performance Differential Memorandum of Agreement shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
5.	This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on September 13, 2008 and shall expire on September 12, 2011. The parties specifically agree that the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement, including the provisions of Performance Differentials, shall terminate on September 12, 2011 and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

4.	The balance of an employee's Personal Holidays in 2003 shall be requested and granted according to existing CSSC policies and procedures.

To calculate schedule time for compliance to schedule, the Company will use total “working” time, as defined by the scheduling tool.
Scheduled lunch and break are not included in “working” time. All exception off-line time defined as “working” time is included in scheduled time. This off-line time includes (but is not limited to):
•	Feedback sessions/coaching
•	Training
•	Union business-paid/working code
•	Clerical duties
•	Company meetings
All exception time defined as “non-working” time is NOT included in scheduled time. This time includes (but is not limited to):

i.	GRIEVANCE/ARBITRATION
The Incentive Compensation Plan shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure outlined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
j.	OVERTIME PAYMENT DETERMINATION
Incentive dollars are payments for hours worked and must be included in the regular rate for overtime payment purposes.
An employee’s wage incentive award for overtime payments will be calculated as follows:
Incentive dollars paid divided by total hours worked x .5 x number of overtime hours in the same period of time for which the incentive dollars were paid.
This calculation should be done when incentive dollars are paid and overtime hours are worked. The hours worked and overtime hours used in the calculation should represent the same period of time for which the incentive payment is being made. As an example, if the incentive payment is quarterly, the total hours worked and the total number of overtime hours worked for that same quarter would be used in the calculation.
Example Calculation:		
Quarterly Incentive Award	$55.00	/
Total Hours Worked	470	=
Incentive Hourly Rate	$0.1170	x
% Overtime Rate	0.5	=
Hourly Overtime Rate of Pay	$0.0585	x
Total Overtime Hours Worked	24	=
161
Overtime Payment
$1.40
The incentive award overtime payment will be included in the regular quarterly incentive award payout.

ATTACHMENT 2
STANDARD TRAVEL AGREEMENT
HAWAIIAN TELCOM, INC. and the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, LOCAL 1357 agree that the following conditions will apply to employees selected for assignments to the continental United States and Alaska.
1.	Transportation: Mode of transportation shall be determined by the Company. Transportation shall be by a carrier such as United, American, etc.
2.	Quarters: The employee will be accommodated at a commercial hotel and there will be one employee per room.
3.	Round trip travel from and to Home Island and Assignment Destination: The employee will be paid non-premium pay for the round trip traveling time between home island and assignment destination. This includes flight time spent waiting at the airport before and after the flight. If the employee is required to go directly from home to the airport, travel time for the reasonable time it takes to travel from his/her home to the airport will be allowed.
For the purpose of calculating the number of hours to be paid, the employee will remain on Hawaii time and be paid until he/she arrives at his/her assignment quarters. Paid time will not start again until the employee reports to work.
4.	Working time beginning with first day of work in assignment destination: The employee will be paid at least 8 hours from Monday through Friday, less 45 minutes for lunch.
5.	Per diem allowance: An allowance of $46.00 a day will be paid.
6.	Emergency notifications: In case an emergency arises in the employee's family, the Company will notify the employee if it receives notification of the emergency from a member of the employee's family.
7.	Interim trips home: The employee will not be allowed to return home before the completion of the assignment except under the following conditions:
a.	The employee's job performance or conduct is unsatisfactory.
b.	There is a serious emergency in the employee's family.
186
c.	The employee becomes ill and the nature of the illness requires the employee to return home.
d.	Cancellation of the scheduled assignment.
8.	Return home: The employee will not be returned home before the completion of the assignment except at the Company's discretion.
9.	Work assignment: The employee agrees to work in any location to which he/she is assigned and to perform any work assigned under his/her job classification. The Company agrees, however, that it will not assign the employee to work under conditions that would subject the employee to bodily harm.
10.	Insurance: In addition to the employee's existing Group Life Insurance and Workers' Compensation Insurance, the employee will be provided with accident insurance commencing when the employee leaves home or place of regular employment, whichever last occurs, and terminating when the employee returns home or to the place of regular employment, whichever occurs first. This coverage applies to death or dismemberment on a 24-hour basis as a result of an accident. The amount of coverage will be three times the employee's annual base rate of pay at the time of the accident.
11.	Telephone calls home: The employee will be allowed to make one telephone call at the Company's expense for each night away from home. Such calls shall be limited to fifteen (15) minutes each and may be used daily or accumulated, but such accumulation shall terminate at the end of the assignment.
12.	Other provisions: All provisions of the Labor Agreement, except as modified above will apply.
*Note: Employees who travel on award trips will do so voluntarily. They will be paid 8 hours per day, at straight time, while traveling or participating in business functions, only if scheduled to work on those days. Any travel and/or business function participation done on an employee's non scheduled work day, will be on the employee's own time. This method of pay treatment will be explained to the employee prior to the award trip.
