If a chauffeur accepts such yard work assignment he shall not make any deliveries that day if a chauffeur more senior than he refused the yard work assignment.

Upon a determination by the Union that an Employer has attempted to undermine the conditions established by the Agreement or that Employees have not satisfied their obligations under the Agreement, and that it would be in the interests of the bargaining unit to appoint a Shop Steward from outside the bargaining unit, the Union may appoint such an individual as Shop Steward until it determines that substantial compliance with the conditions in the Agreement has been restored.
An Employee who has been appointed as an On-Site Steward shall maintain his position on the seniority list of the Employer he was employed by at the time of his appointment for the duration of his appointment, provided he returns to his Employer within fifteen (15) working days of the termination of his employment.
