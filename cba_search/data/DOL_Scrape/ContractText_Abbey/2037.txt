North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters
Of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America

2.	When tools or equipment are to be cared for, it shall be done during working hours.
3.	Welding and cutting equipment and chain falls are tools of the trade having jurisdiction over the work being performed.

Employees using these tools shall perform any of the work of the trade and shall work under the supervision of the craft foreman.
4.	Piecework of any kind or description is strictly prohibited.
5.	Neither party shall set any arbitrary limits as to the amount of work to be accomplished per day.

ARTICLE IV
SCOPE OF WORK AND JURISDICTION
The parties understand that it is not practical to define the occupational scope in complete detail within this Agreement. Accordingly, even though specific tasks may not be listed or defined in this Agreement they will nevertheless be considered as and treated as part of the occupational scope if, the task is traditionally the work of the Carpenters and Joiners, or a specific assignment is made by the employer, or if the task has been or may hereafter be awarded to the Carpenters and Joiners by the National Joint Board for Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes or its Appeals Board.
Employees in the bargaining unit will perform all tasks assigned by the employer. In making such assignments, the Contractor will consider local practice within their company and the Owners perspective on efficiencies and cost of performing tasks.
In the event of a jurisdictional dispute involving the Union, the party shall request the other union or unions involved send representatives to the jobsite to meet with representatives of the Union and the Employer to settle the dispute. If this process does not result in a settlement, the Union shall request that its international union assign a representative, who shall make arrangements to meet representatives of the other international union or unions involved and representatives of the Contractor on the jobsite to seek settlement of the dispute. The Contractor also shall request the international unions involved assign representatives to seek settlement of the dispute. The Contractor and the Unions will abide by any decision arrived at as set forth above.
The Unions and the Employer agree that there shall be no strikes, lockouts or interruptions of the disputed work over jurisdictional disputes. The contractor shall not be required to change the assignment of any work until a jurisdictional agreement has been reached. Further, the contractor shall not be required to pay retroactively to any craft for work not performed.
JURISDICTIONAL RELAXATION
A.	On projects of $3,000,000 and under (excluding mechanical and electrical work), there will be a relaxation of strict enforcement of craft jurisdictional lines whereby the Contractor may assign work to the craft employed who can most efficiently perform the task or work.
B.	If there is less than eight hours work involved in any particular task, the Employer may utilize any craft he/she has in his/her employment on that project to perform such task, providing the craft that traditionally claims the task is not working on the project for the contractor that day.
LU 106 Commercial Agreement
North Central States Regional Council of Carpenters
Of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America
C.	For any job regardless of size or location whereby circumstances indicate a need for relaxation of strict enforcement of traditional craft jurisdiction, the Contractor will contact the basic trades unions to meet and discuss such needs.
D.	If any contractor or union believes that any above provisions are being abused, the complaining party shall first notify the alleged offender. If the situation is not resolved within 24 hours, the complaining party shall invoke Section 3 of the grievance procedure of Article V of this Agreement.
ARTICLE V

Section 5.6 The notice of intent shall include a definition of the grievance and statement of what action the party intends to take. The grievance can be anticipatory.

UNION REPRESENTATION

The Union, therefore, agrees that it will cooperate with the Contractor and support efforts to assure a full day’s work on the part of its members and that it will actively combat absenteeism and any other practices which restrict production. It further agrees that it will support the Contractor in efforts to eliminate waste of time and materials in production, improve the quality of workmanship, prevent accidents and strengthen good will between the Contractor and employees.
