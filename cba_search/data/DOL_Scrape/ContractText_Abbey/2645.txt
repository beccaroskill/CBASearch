PUYALLUP PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 3 PUYALLUP EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE AND ENTERED INTO by and between Puyallup School District No. 3 (hereinafter referred to as the "District") and the Puyallup Education Association, (hereinafter referred to as the "Association" or “PEA”), as follows:
PART I - ADMINISTRATION
ARTICLE 1.	ADMINISTRATION OF AGREEMENT
Section 1.1	Recognition
The District recognizes the Association, an affiliate of the Washington Education Association (WEA), as the sole and exclusive negotiating representative for all regular certificated employees of the District and all regular substitute certificated employees. The term regular substitute certificated employees shall mean substitutes who in the previous or current school year worked twenty (20) full consecutive days in the same assignment or thirty (30) full days during the year in various assignments. The term Certificated Employees shall include all certificated personnel regularly employed and under contract by the District, or on an approved leave or layoff, excluding all administrative staff. Exclusions for newly created positions shall be reviewed jointly by the District and Association utilizing Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) guidelines or services if required. Although the Association has functions not herein described, the District recognizes that the function of negotiations is exclusively accorded the Association as the representative of certificated employees as is the function of grievance representation.
Unless otherwise noted, the terms “staff,” “certificated staff,” “employee,” and “certificated employee” shall mean employees of the District covered by this bargaining unit and Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
Section 1.2	Management Rights
Consistent with the provisions covered in this Agreement, or those items which are mandatory topics of negotiations, the District shall have the right to carry out management functions as required.
Section 1.3	Duration
This Agreement shall become effective when ratified and signed by authorized representatives of the District and the Association and may be changed only after written request(s) for amendment by either party and then only by the mutual consent of both parties, with such amendments being arrived at through negotiations and formalized in the same manner as this Agreement.
This Agreement and any amendments hereto shall remain in force until August 31, 2010. Either party shall notify the other party in writing of its intent to amend, modify, or terminate the Agreement not less than 120 days, or more than 150 days, prior to the expiration day of this Agreement.
Section 1.4	Status of the Agreement
Both the District and the Association recognize the need for adherence to rules, regulations, policies, and this Agreement in carrying out their respective functions. In cases where there is a conflict between this Agreement and said rules, regulations, policies, or individual certificated employee's contracts, or the application thereof, this Agreement shall prevail. The Appendices are integral parts of this Agreement and by this reference are incorporated herein.

Any part of this Agreement, or of its application, found to be contrary to law by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction shall be invalid only while contrary, and only to the extent that it is contrary, but such invalidity shall not invalidate any other portion of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is so held to be contrary to law, the Association and the District shall commence negotiations on said provisions to arrive at a valid provision as soon thereafter as reasonably possible.
Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, nothing contained herein shall be interpreted and/or applied so as to adversely affect current individual salaries and employee benefits or other provisions which have heretofore been recognized, practiced or accorded by the District.
Section 1.6	Funding
In the event the Legislature substantially reduces Puyallup School District funds, or there is any major financial setback to the District (e.g. substantial enrollment decline, elimination of block grants, levy failure, etc.) and recognizing that program changes are a Board decision, the PEA will still have authentic participation and a significant voice in collaborative discussions of potential District budget reductions. If this financial setback occurs, this Agreement shall be subject to reopening for bargaining on the various monetary items included therein.
Section 1.7	Distribution
Copies of this Agreement shall be printed by the District, made available to prospective certificated employees, posted on the District website, and distributed to certificated employees within sixty (60) days of contract ratification and Board approval. In addition, fifty (50) copies shall be provided to the Association. Upon hiring, the district shall provide each new certificated employee with a copy of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Section 1.8	Subcontracting
Bargaining unit work presently held by unit members shall not be contracted to any other employee group or entity unless no bargaining unit member can be found to perform the work, provided however, that any such position shall be filled for up to one year only, when at such time it shall be posted in accordance with the transfer process.
ARTICLE 2.	ASSOCIATION RIGHTS
Section 2.1	Cooperation
Section 2.1.1	Availability of Information

All certificated employees, including the Association President, shall be provided with email addresses. The President’s email address shall be made available to all certificated staff and the Association President shall be included on the “All-District” email communications lists. Members of the Association shall be permitted to use the District email communications system to conduct Association business. District email shall not be used by the Association for the purpose of advocating for specific political action, work stoppage or other communication use prohibited by law.
Section 2.1.4	Orientation Meetings
An opportunity shall be provided for Association representatives to participate in orientation meetings for new certificated employees including substitutes.
Section 2.1.5	Equipment Use
The District shall honor reasonable requests by the Association for the use of facilities and equipment, the use of in-District mail service, and making bulletin board space available. The Association shall follow proper District procedures in requesting use of resources.
Section 2.1.6	Access
Representatives of the Association shall be permitted to transact Association business on school property and shall follow site check in/check out procedures. Such business shall preferably be transacted outside of the student day, but under no condition shall be conducted at times which interfere with normal school operation or interrupt other employees during the performance of their assigned duties.
Section 2.2	Association Leave
In order to provide proper representation of members of the bargaining unit and/or to confer with the District or its representative(s), leave shall be granted by the District according to the provisions of this section. All such leave shall be granted upon request of the Association President. Request for leave shall be submitted in writing as far in advance as possible, but never later than three (3) school days before the leave is to take effect unless circumstances prevent earlier notification, in which case a discussion will be held with the Director of Human Resources. The arrangements for the leave shall be discussed with the Association President. Billing for the leave shall be made to the Association by the District using the following guidelines. According to current practices regarding frequency or for purposes as mutually agreed between the Association and the District as follows:
A.	District-scheduled meetings such as grievance processing shall not be billed.
B.	Professional meetings affecting employer/employee relationships shall be billed at the cost of the substitute including the hourly rate, employer FICA costs, Workman's Compensation and retirement compensation if applicable.
C.	Employee interest activities such as lobbying and Association training sessions shall be billed to provide full reimbursement to the District for salaries and employer costs paid.
Certificated employees using such leave shall be responsible to provide appropriate preparation and lesson plans, as necessary, for their substitutes, as well as to provide appropriate follow-up after such leave. Contract provisions for Association Release time and Supplemental Conditions of the Grievance procedure are deemed not to be in conflict with this section.
Section 2.3	Association Released Time
In order to provide proper representation of members of the bargaining unit, the Association President shall be released up to full-time from regular employment to perform Association duties, to conduct Association

business and/or to confer with the District or its representatives. The Association shall request released time, if any, thirty (30) days prior to the end of the semester preceding the one for which the leave is sought, except in cases where such notice is not possible.
If the Association President remains a part-time employee, he/she will receive full salary and benefits as though employed full-time. However, the Puyallup Education Association will reimburse the Puyallup School District for the difference between what the Association President would have received as a parttime employee and the amount the Puyallup School District actually pays in compensations and benefits, except as specified below in items one through four.
If the Association President has full-time release, the District will be reimbursed for all compensation paid by the Puyallup School District during the period of release whether the full-time release is for the entire school year or a portion of a school year. However, it is agreed the Association President shall be deemed an employee of the District during the period of release and shall not be penalized in regard to salary, seniority, benefits or rights pertaining to employment. Specifically, the Association President: 1) will accrue leaves as other full-time employees; 2) will be eligible for TRI as approved by the Association; 3) will receive payment for supplemental days at the same rate as other full-time employees as approved by the Association; 4) will be eligible for State Retirement System employer contributions by the District only to the extent the law requires payment by the District during such leave.
The Association President shall have full rights to reinstatement subject to the Layoff/Recall provisions, if applicable, to his/her original job at termination of his/her term of office. If the original position is no longer in existence, the Association President shall be treated as an involuntary transferee with the rights afforded thereto.
Any employee elected or appointed to a position with the Summit UniServ Council requiring release time shall be granted the requested release and will be provided the same rights as identified for the Association President above. Reimbursement for said release time shall be paid to the District by the Summit UniServ Council as appropriate.
Any employee elected or appointed to a full-time position with NEA or WEA requiring full time release time shall be granted the requested release for the length of the term of office and shall be reinstated to a position for which they are qualified. Reimbursement for said release time shall be paid to the District by NEA or WEA as appropriate.
Section 2.4	Payroll Deductions
Section 2.4.1	Dues Deductions
The Association shall have the exclusive right to payroll deduction of dues, assessments, and fees required for membership for those certificated employees represented, provided however, that the Association shall present said deductions to the District in one billing which shall change no more than three times per fiscal year, exclusive of the addition or deletion of individuals. Authorization and/or revocation of membership shall be provided to the District on jointly developed forms, authorized and provided to individuals by the Association. In order to be effective, revocation forms shall be returned by individuals to the Association not later than September 11 in order that the Association can deliver said forms to the District by September 12. The District shall continue to provide such deduction service during the period of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 3.	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Section 3.1	General
The purpose of the following grievance procedure shall be to provide for the orderly and expeditious adjustment of grievances at the earliest possible time. This procedure shall be utilized as a method of solving problems in the interest of educational programs and in the spirit of cooperation among the administration and the certificated employees.
Section 3.2	Definitions
A.	A "grievant" shall mean a certificated employee(s) or the Association.
B.	A "grievance" shall mean a claim by a grievant that there exists a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication by the District of a specific provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, or any other written agreement between the Association and the District. In the case of a grievance filed by the Association, the Association shall state the specific instance(s) or circumstance(s) which precipitates said grievance.
C.	"Days" shall mean school days during the period September 1 through May 30 and all weekdays during the remainder of the year.
D.	"Time Limits": If the stipulated time limits are not met by the District, the grievant shall have the right to appeal the grievance to the next step. If the stipulated time limits are not met by the grievant, the grievance is deemed satisfied and may not be appealed further. The parties involved may by mutual written agreement, modify any time limits contained in the procedure. The District and the Association shall receive copies of such agreements.
Section 3.3	Procedure
The following steps are designed to secure, at the administrative level closest to the grievant, solutions to any grievance which may occur.
Step 1. The District and the Association acknowledge and the parties involved are advised that it is desirable for a certificated employee and the appropriate administrator to resolve problems through free and informal communications. If an employee chooses to meet informally with his/her supervisor, s/he may have a representative join him/her at any grievance meeting. Every effort shall be made to resolve the grievance at this level. An employee must notify his/her immediate supervisor of a grievance within thirty (30) days of his/her knowledge of a disagreement or violation of the contract, or the incident will be considered invalid and subject to no further process.
Step 2. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step 1 it may be presented as a written grievance by the grievant and/or his/her designated association representative, to the appropriate administrator within ten (10) days following the supervisor’s response to the informal meeting. The grievance shall state the fact(s) upon which it is based, the issue involved, any Agreement provisions allegedly violated, and the relief sought. The appropriate administrator shall arrange for a meeting with the grievant through the designated association representative within five (5) days after receipt of the written grievance. The date, time, and location of the meeting shall be mutually agreeable to all parties. Within ten (10) days after the meeting between the parties involved, the appropriate administrator shall provide the grievant and the association representative with a written response. Such response shall include the reason(s) for the decision.

Step 3. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step 2, the decision may be appealed to the Superintendent or designated representative within ten (10) days of the receipt of the written response. The Superintendent or designated representative shall arrange for a hearing with the grievant through the association representative within five (5) days of receipt of the written appeal. The hearing date, time, and location shall be mutually agreeable to all parties. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Superintendent or designated representative shall within ten (10) days, provide the grievant and the association representative with a written response. Such response shall include the reason(s) for the decision.
Step 4. Arbitration:
A.	General. Any grievance which pertains to the Collective Bargaining Agreement or other written agreements between the District and the Association may be presented to the Association for submission in binding arbitration if the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition at Step 3. Such request shall be presented in writing to the Association within five (5) days of receipt of the written response at Step 3. If the Association determines that the grievance involves an alleged violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication by the District of a specific provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement or other written agreements, the Association may, by written notice to the Superintendent presented within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the request at Step 4, submit the grievance to binding arbitration. If any questions arise as to the arbitrability of the grievance, such questions shall first be ruled on by the arbitrator selected to hear the grievance.
The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to rule on any of the following conditions:
1.	The termination of services or failure to reemploy any provisional employee.
2.	The content of an employee's evaluation or of an administrator's report pursuant to evaluation or probation, except for any procedural requirements which may affect such content.
3.	Any matter involving non-renewal, discharge, or probation, where other remedy is provided by law.
B.	Procedure. The following procedures shall be followed in processing arbitrable grievances.
1.	Within ten (10) days after written notice of submission to binding arbitration, the District and the Association shall seek agreement upon a mutually acceptable arbitrator who will serve. If the District and the Association are unable to agree upon or get commitment to serve from an arbitrator within the ten (10) day period, a request for a list of arbitrators shall be made by the Association to either the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) or the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Upon receipt of the list, the parties shall individually strike the names on the list they find unacceptable, number the remaining names in order of preference, and return the list to the selected agency within ten (10) calendar days.

2.	Neither party shall be permitted to assert in the arbitration proceedings any evidence which was not submitted to the other party before the completion of Step 3.
3.	The arbitrator selected shall confer with the Superintendent or designated representative and the Association and hold hearings promptly, and shall issue the decision not later than thirty (30) days from the date of the close of the hearings, or if oral hearings have been waived, then from the date the final statements and proofs are submitted. The arbitrator's decision shall be in writing and shall set forth his findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator shall be without power or authority to make any decisions which require the commission of an act prohibited by law or which is in violation of the terms of written agreement between the Association and the District. The decisions of the arbitrator shall be submitted to the District and the Association and shall be final and binding on both parties.
4.	The cost for the service of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if any, travel and subsistence expenses, and cost of any hearing room shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other costs shall be by the party incurring them except as provided herein.
Section 3.4	Representation.
A.	The District recognizes the Association as the sole and exclusive grievance representative for all certificated employees represented by the Association. The grievant may, at the grievant's option, request the assignment of an Association Representative during formal grievance proceedings. The Association may investigate grievances at any level.
B.	If in the judgment of the Association, a grievance affects a group of certificated employees or the Association, or if the grievance involves more than one supervisor or an administrator above the building level, the grievance may be filed at step 2 directly with the Assistant Superintendent of Human Resources who will assign the grievance to the appropriate administrator.
C.	The parties involved may include in the proceedings such witnesses as they deem necessary to develop facts relevant to the grievance.
D.	Nothing herein shall be construed as limiting the right of any certificated employee having filed a formal grievance, to have the problems adjusted without the intervention of the Association provided that: (1) the Association shall be notified of the scheduled meetings; (2) the Association shall be permitted to send a representative to scheduled meetings and may offer an opinion pertinent to the grievance; and (3) the Association shall be notified in writing of the disposition of the grievance. Such notification shall include the reason(s) for the decision.
E.	The Association on its own may continue any grievance filed and later dropped by a grievant, provided that the grievance involves the application or interpretation of the

Section 3.5	Supplemental Conditions
A.	All individuals who might possibly contribute to the acceptable adjustment of a grievance are urged to provide any relevant information that they may have to the grievant or the District at the earliest possible time.
B.	The grievant, District, and Association shall cooperate in the investigation of any grievance and shall furnish such information as is required for the processing of any grievance.
C.	No reprisal will follow any involvement in this grievance procedure.
D.	Should the mutually established meetings related to the investigation or processing of any
grievance require that a grievant or an Association representative be released from his/her regular assignment, the release shall be without loss of pay or benefits. Substitute costs shall be borne by the District.
E.	All documents, communications, and records dealing with the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel files of the participants.
F.	The Association and the District recognize that confidentiality and good faith are key elements to a successful grievance procedure. Accordingly, both pledge themselves to participate in good faith in the execution of this procedure, and to hold all matters pertaining thereto in confidence and to admonish and require all parties involved to limit the number of additional persons knowing of the grievance to those necessary to a successful resolution and/or implementation.
PART II - PERSONNEL
ARTICLE 4.	INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
Section 4.1	Rights of Citizenship and Nondiscrimination
Certificated employees shall be entitled to full rights of citizenship as granted to citizens generally. Employees shall not be discriminated against by reason of race, creed, religion, color, marital status, sexual orientation, gender, age, national origin, domicile, bona fide political activity or lack thereof, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability, except as permitted in accordance with this Agreement, or by law, nor shall the position on the salary schedule affect a certificated employee's assignment and/or promotion.
The private and personal life of any certificated employee shall not be within the concern of the Superintendent unless there is actual, probable, or potential adverse effect on the duties and responsibilities of the employee.

Certificated employees shall not be disciplined for arbitrary or capricious reasons, but only for just cause. The District agrees to follow a policy of progressive discipline. Progressive discipline includes: verbal warning, letter of reprimand, suspension without pay or termination of employment. Warnings shall be documented in the working file. Other forms of discipline shall be placed in the employee’s personnel file. Any disciplinary action taken against a certificated employee shall be appropriate to the behavior which precipitates said action.
Section 4.3	Right to Representation
In accordance with the law, all employees have the right to Association representation at any meeting they reasonably believe could lead to disciplinary action. All employees have the right to stop any such meeting to obtain such representation. The specific grounds forming the basis for disciplinary action shall be made available to the certificated employee and to the Association in writing, if requested. In the event that an allegation of misconduct is investigated and not supported by the available evidence, such records shall be retained in the District to substantiate that a thorough investigation was conducted and concluded.
Section 4.4	Complaint Procedure
Any complaint or accusation made against a certificated employee which could result in disciplinary action or have an adverse impact on the employee's evaluation will be promptly called to the attention of the employee, within fifteen (15) school days. The certificated employee will be told the substance of the complaint/accusation and the source. The possible options for handling said complaint/accusation will be discussed between the certificated employee and the administrator receiving the complaint. Normally, the certificated employee and complainant will be encouraged to attempt to resolve the complaint/accusation informally; however, there may be circumstances where such an approach would not be productive. After the certificated employee has discussed the concern with the administrator receiving the complaint, the employee shall have the right to have an Association representative present at any formal meeting held where the employee and the complainant are in attendance.
Any complaint or accusation not called to the attention of the certificated employee may not be used as the basis for any disciplinary action or adverse evaluation against the certificated employee. A complaint/accusation of which the employee has knowledge may be incorporated into an evaluation provided the reference shall be specific in nature and opportunities to resolve the complaint are verified.
Section 4.5	Administrative Leave
The district may place an employee on paid administrative leave upon receipt of a complaint or allegation of inappropriate behavior by the employee and when the employee’s continued presence in the workplace may threaten or endanger the health, safety, or well being of students or employees, disrupt the educational setting, or interfere with the investigation.
When circumstances allow, the employee shall be notified of the decision to place him/her on administrative leave in a respectful and discrete manner, preferably at the end of the employee’s work day in a private setting.
The employee shall be notified in writing of the specific complaint or allegation to be investigated as soon thereafter as possible. Investigations shall be conducted as quickly as possible. Administrative leave is not considered disciplinary.

ARTICLE 5.	STAFF PROTECTION
Section 5.1	Coverage
All certificated employees shall be covered by the District's liability insurance policy. The District shall make a reasonable effort to protect employees from bodily harm and property damage while carrying out assigned duties.
Section 5.2	Hold Harmless
Providing a certificated employee, at the time an act or omission is complained of, was acting in a reasonable and prudent manner within the scope of his/her employment and/or under the direction of the District, the District shall use the provisions of RCW 28A.320.100 to hold said certificated employee harmless and defend him/her from any financial loss, including reasonable attorney's fees, for legal actions arising from such alleged acts or omissions.
Section 5.3	Worker’s Compensation
Certificated employees covered by Worker's Compensation and State Industrial Insurance laws shall, upon loss of time due to a job-related injury or illness, and after establishment of eligibility for such benefits, have the option to be paid their regular sick leave rather than receive compensation from the ESD 121 Worker’s Compensation Co-op Trust, of which the District is a member. Determination of illness or injury shall be made using the rules of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries. Provided further that if the employee has exhausted all sick leave prior to the effective date of the beginning of the Worker's Compensation eligibility, the District will provide up to three additional days of leave or whatever portion thereof is needed. Additionally, the District will pay the medical insurance premiums for the balance of the school year for an employee eligible for Worker's Compensation who has exhausted all sick leave.
Section 5.4	Personal Property Insurance
The District shall provide insurance as specified by State statutes protecting certificated employees while they are acting within the scope of their employment obligations to the District. When certificated employees use personal property in a school related situation with appropriate safeguards against loss or damage, the District shall provide insurance to protect the property from loss or damage to a maximum of $1,500 total value per individual. Such insurance protection shall apply only to items for which prior approval has been given each year, in writing, by the principal or program director. Items totaling more than $1,500 need prior approval of the Superintendent or designee. Such approval must also be sought each school year and in no case extend beyond the third day after the school year ends.
Section 5.5	Vehicle Damage Insurance
Damage to a vehicle parked in the school setting shall be covered by the individual's insurance policy. All damage due to acts of God are the employee's responsibility. However, when an employee's vehicle is damaged in a school setting by vandalism, or is accidentally damaged by a student, the District will reimburse the amount of the employee’s deductible to a maximum of $500. Employees who have vehicles which are not covered by insurance shall receive the same benefit. Damage to an employee's vehicle by the District, or as the result of a District action, will be fully covered by the District. Vehicles need not be listed with the principal.
Section 5.6	Assault
Any case of assault, arising out of an employment related situation, upon a certificated employee shall be promptly reported to the District. The District shall render assistance to the certificated employee in connection with handling of the incident by law enforcement and judicial authorities. This paragraph does not apply to civil litigation instituted by the certificated employee.

Any democracy, if it is to remain a democracy, must expect and anticipate a change politically, socially and economically. In a democracy, change should come through law and through orderly procedure rather than through revolution and use of force. There are controversial issues inherent in change, which if correct solutions are to be found, must be freely and openly discussed.
Consistent with accepted professional standards and practices, all pupils shall have an opportunity to learn and certificated employees to teach, relevant to the course content; to find facts; to collect factual materials; to organize factual materials; to interpret factual materials; to examine attitudes; survey prejudices, note appeals, rethink assumptions, and to consider what ought to be as well as what is; and to generalize upon the basis of this material.
No certificated employee shall use his/her position to propagandize in the interests of any religious, social, economic or political creed. The techniques of dealing with controversial issues are the most valuable outcomes of those classes and include an ability to collect information, to refrain from passing judgments before sufficient facts have been secured upon which to base these judgments, to organize materials, to seek relationships, and to draw inferences and conclusions. Every certificated employee shall have the right to express personal views on controversial subjects, as long as other views/perspectives are also presented. No certificated employee shall express personal views at a time, or in a manner that would interfere with the achievement of these outcomes or would condition the thinking of the pupil upon the controversial issues under consideration before that pupil has basic facts.
ARTICLE 7.	REASSIGNMENT/TRANSFER
Section 7.1	Definitions
Vacancy: Shall be defined as a new position or a position vacated and available through resignation, termination or retirement.
Length of Service: Shall be defined in this Article only as the number of years of experience in the Puyallup School District, and part-years shall be calculated as they are for the S-275 Form.
Tie Breaker: In the event ties exist in number of years in the District, the employee(s) having the highest number of college or university credits beyond the B.A. Degree earned by September 1, and as documented in the Human Resources Office by October 1 of the current school year, shall have preference.

Section 7.2	Reassignment
Reassignment shall mean a shift of an employee from one department or grade level to another within a building different from that of the previous school year, but not merely a change in the number of sections in each department. In the case of related services itinerant staff or special program staff (as defined in Section 7.3.1), a reassignment shall mean a change in locations where an employee will provide a District program function.

Vacancies shall first be filled by reassignment where possible. Length of service shall be the determining factor when two or more employees are substantially equal in regards to the following: area of experience; expressed interest of the employee; certification, including level of endorsement; academic majors and minors or subject area endorsement; and program considerations.
Section 7.2.2
Reassignments shall be made only for valid educational reasons. These reasons shall be shared with the employee at the time of reassignment. If the educational reasons provided to the employee are considered unacceptable, it can be challenged through the grievance procedure.
The term “valid educational reason” is defined as an authentic rationale directly related to improving student learning, as distinguished from one that is arbitrary, capricious, or based on personality, race, religion, creed, gender or other irrelevant factors.
Section 7.2.3
If a reassignment would result in an identified increase in the work year for an employee, said position must be made available to employees through the voluntary transfer process.
Section 7.2.4
A reassignment shall not result in an employee being moved from one educational program to another (i.e. K-6 teacher to related services, secondary teaching staff to a K-6 teaching position, related services staff to a special program position, etc.).
Section 7.3	Involuntary Transfer
An involuntary transfer shall mean a transfer necessitated by an elimination or reduction in program, declining student enrollment, closure of schools, changes in school boundaries or reduction in staffing ratio.
Section 7.3.1
Involuntary transferees will be identified in the following manner:
A.	The elementary school (K-6), secondary department, special programs or related services area in which the involuntary transfer must occur will be identified. Special programs shall include: library, full-day Kindergarten, guidance, elementary physical education, music, special education, vocational education, remediation, AVID, QUEST and PAGE. Related services shall include: occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech and language pathologists, nurses, psychologists and behavioral specialists.
B.	Prior to designating involuntary transfers within the building, special program, or related service area, the Principal or immediate supervisor will solicit requests from those within the affected program or building willing to be designated as the involuntary transferee. It is recognized by the parties, that identifying involuntaries is not the most desirable method of changing staffing needs; therefore, it will be used only when voluntary methods do not accomplish the required changes.
C.	If no employee volunteers, the employee in the affected elementary, secondary department, program or related service area with the least length of service in the District will be identified as the involuntary transferee. However, in a secondary school, if the affected employee has a critical assignment(s) (activities, athletics or academics) and no other qualified employee is willing to accept the assignment(s), that employee may be by-passed for involuntary transfer. In any given school year, one such employee may be by-passed per school.

D.	No later than May 1 of each year, employees who have been identified as involuntary transferees will be notified in writing of their transfer and the reasons therefore. If the District cannot reasonably calculate its staffing because of the State Legislature's failure to act upon a K-12 budget, the parties to this Agreement will mutually agree to a reasonable extension of the involuntary notification timeline.
E.	If during the fall of the subsequent school year, a school is determined to be overstaffed, the building administrator will identify the involuntary transferee utilizing the aforementioned process. If this occurs, the involuntary transferee will be transferred to a different building or site; however, he/she will have the option of being declared an involuntary transferee the following spring and being accorded all the rights thereof. Said involuntary transferee must notify the Human Resources Office by April 15 if he/she decides to exercise this option.
F.	When an involuntary transfer occurs during the school year, up to three (3) days of release time shall be given to the affected teacher in order to complete the move and become oriented to the new building or site. Outside the school year, when an employee is involuntarily transferred from one school to another, the employees will receive up to eight (8) hours of pay at the professional rate in order to complete the move and become orientated to the new building. The District shall provide assistance as needed in moving equipment and materials.
G.	When an employee is involuntarily transferred to a new subject area, grade level, special program or service area, appropriate observations of other employees will be arranged.
H.	In instances where teaching positions within a building are combined or where declining enrollment in separate buildings causes the combining of teaching positions, the principal and the employees involved who are qualified to meet the identified instructional needs will attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable identification of who will fill the respective positions. If the employees cannot agree, the employee with the greatest length of service in the District will be given his/her choice of the remaining position(s) or of being identified as an involuntary transferee. The aforementioned process will be followed going from the most senior to the least senior employee, until no positions remain. In the case where none of the employees involved are interested in the remaining positions, said positions shall be awarded to the employee(s) with the least length of service in the District.
Section 7.3.2
When involuntary transfers occur, employees who are involuntarily transferred will select a position for which they are qualified from a list of vacant positions. If there is no position available at that time, they will be placed in a position for which they are qualified when one becomes available. Selection of positions shall be done in seniority order. In either case, involuntary transferees shall be placed prior to other employees in filling vacancies, except in the opening of new schools.
Section 7.3.3
Due to the fluctuation in enrollment associated with the Kindergarten program, Kindergarten teachers who have been involuntarily transferred shall have the option to transfer back to their previous Kindergarten position should it become available by the end of the third week in August.
Section 7.3.4
Employees may be transferred involuntarily for valid educational reasons when continuation in the assignment is detrimental to the program and/or employees due to serious conflict between

employees or the employee and administration. Such valid educational reasons must be directly related to improving the learning/work environment or improving staff relationships and not for arbitrary or capricious reasons. Before the employee may be involuntarily transferred, the employee shall have been notified of those concerns by his/her immediate supervisor, and shall be provided a reasonable opportunity/time to remediate the problem. The amount of time may vary depending on the situation (e.g. employee(s) refuses the opportunity to remediate).
Prior to providing notice to the employee of the District’s intention to implement such involuntary transfers above, the District and the Puyallup Education Association will meet and discuss the circumstances of, and necessity for, the proposed transfer.
An Association Representative may make a request to the District in writing that an employee be transferred. Such written request shall include the reason(s) for the transfer. The District and the Association will meet and discuss the reasons for the request.
Section 7.4	Transfer
Transfer shall be defined as change from a position in one building to another, or from a position in one District special program to another position, or from one related services program to another position. Employees may transfer through August 31.
Section 7.4.1
Prior to positions being filled through the transfer process, the District may fill ten (10) positions with external applicants and shall inform the Association when requested.
Section 7.4.2
During the month of February, continuing contracted employees may apply for a transfer to another building or special or related services program by filling out the online Human Resources Transfer Request form. Continuing contracted employees may apply for a transfer to another building or special or related services program by indicating the school(s) or special or related services program(s) to which they wish to transfer and the subject area(s) and/or grade level they would like to teach. Such preferences shall be listed in priority order. As positions become open, the names of employees who have indicated an interest will be submitted to the building(s) or program(s). Positions being filled will be listed on the District website. If an employee accepts any position or declines his/her first choice, he/she is removed from consideration for other positions. Employees may add to or change their request form at any time if they have not yet accepted or declined a position.
Applicants will be interviewed for the position if they meet the following criteria: areas of experience, interest in the position, certification (including level of endorsement), length of service, academic majors and minors or subject area endorsement, and valid educational reasons. Principals or immediate supervisors may prescreen applicants. If candidates are substantially equal in the aforementioned criteria, principals or immediate supervisors shall only have to interview the three most senior candidates. If the candidates are nearly equal, the candidate who has the greater length of service in the District will be awarded the position. Applicants for transfer will be advised of the selection decision within seven (7) calendar days.
Section 7.5	Employees Returning From Leave
Leave returnees not guaranteed their former position shall be placed into a position for which they are qualified when one is identified.

Section 9.2	Placement on Salary Schedule
All certificated employees will be placed on the negotiated base salary schedule (Schedule A) according to qualifying highest degree, number of credits, and experience as determined by the regulations promulgated by the Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction for placement on the state allocation schedule and printed in the “S-275” instructions. ESA staff employed as of 9/1/05 who were granted experience not recognized by these regulations will be placed on Schedule A consistent with the regulations and will receive a supplemental incentive stipend for the difference between that placement and the placement they would obtain based on experience previously granted. Additional years of clinical experience will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will be granted if meeting the District established criteria.
Section 9.3	Salary Deductions and Payments
A.	Salary Deductions for Absences. In case of absence other than those covered in Approved Leave Policies, the salary deduction shall be one full day's pay in accordance with the contracted days of employment.

Upon the certificated employee's appropriate written instructions, warrants shall be held at the Education Service Center to be picked up by the certificated employee. In the absence of such written instruction, or in the event the warrant being held at the Education Service Center for pickup is not so claimed within a one (1) week period, the warrant shall be mailed to the certificated employee's address of record.
C.	Early Payout. Upon application, certificated employees retiring from the teaching profession shall receive the balance of their salary payments on the June payday during the year in which they leave. The District may elect to pay off any other certificated employee(s) at the time he/she leaves the District. All deductions due for the remainder of the year for which this salary is paid shall be made at this time and appropriately transmitted by the District, along with fringe benefits due for this time period. At the request of the employee, the District shall continue to deduct insurance contributions due for the months of June, July and August, and shall make its normal contribution for those months in the normal manner. Employees should consult a tax accountant to review possible tax implications regarding this section.
D.	Errors in Contract Salaries. Following notification to the employee, errors resulting in over or underpayments shall be corrected on the next month’s payroll. If requested by the employee, the HR department and the employee will work out a repayment agreement prior to any adjustment to the employee’s pay warrant. In the event an employee is notified of an over payment prior to receiving said payment, the District may elect to deduct the amount of over payment from the employee’s next pay warrant.
Section 9.4	Part Time Contracts
A certificated employee's prorated pay for less than a full year shall be figured in the following manner: use as the numerator the actual number of days that the certificated employee is employed, and as the denominator the actual number of basic contract days in the entire year. This fraction times the annual salary for said certificated employee's position on the salary schedule shall equal their pay for the part of the year employed. Part day employment pay shall be similarly prorated. Part time employees with .5 FTE and above shall receive full time TRI except for staff members who are job sharing. Such employees will each receive their respective FTE times the amount for which they would qualify if in a full time position. Part time employees less than .5 FTE shall receive TRI on a prorated basis according to their FTE.

In the event the School District receives from the State of Washington more funds for the specific purpose of increasing certificated employee’s salaries and/or benefits than the District has contracted to pay for the given school year, the District shall notify the Association and begin negotiations with the Association on the distribution of such funds for application to the salaries and/or benefits for certificated employees for said year and shall then make such adjustments, including amendments to the individual certificated employees' contracts, if necessary, as soon as practicable.
ARTICLE 10.	INSURANCE BENEFITS
Section 10.1
For 2008-09, the District shall allocate a maximum of $732.00 per month from September 1 through August 31 for each full-time certificated employee for mandatory long-term disability insurance, vision, life, and dental insurance, all jointly approved by the District and the Association. Part time employees will receive a prorated allocation based on their FTE. Job share staff will be eligible to share one benefit allocation on a pro rata basis. The District is solely responsible for paying the HCA premium for retirees.
For all other years of this agreement, the District shall allocate the amount identified in the State Appropriations Act for each full time certificated employee. The allocations identified in this article are dependent on the state both authorizing and providing funding to pay such benefit allocation. If the state fails to authorize and fund the District to the full extent of the allocation stated above, the District shall pass through any state funding actually received.
Section 10.2
All unused insurance allocations from the section above shall be pooled for the benefit of bargaining unit members. Funds shall be distributed equally to all employees with out-of-pocket costs for medical insurance on a dollar for dollar basis until all such funds are fully expended. Part time employees shall receive a prorated allocation of these pooling dollars based on their FTE.
Section 10.3
The pooling calculation shall be made once each year no later than December to apply to the earliest pay period practicable thereafter, and for the following eleven (11) months. Benefit amounts published during the open enrollment period shall reflect out-of-pocket costs with zero pooling assistance.
Section 10.4
When a portion of this contribution is applied to a combination of medical insurances, the application shall be first to the mandatory insurances in this Article, then to health insurance up to the amount of the premium.

If, after the review, the existing brokerage services are rated as being unacceptable, the committee shall make a recommendation through the Superintendent or designee to the School Board regarding future services.
ARTICLE 11.	TRAVEL AND REIMBURSEMENT
Certificated employees shall be reimbursed for reasonable expenses of mileage, meals, housing and registration fees when such employees are on official business.
Section 11.1	Travel Within the District
Reimbursement for travel expenses of certificated employees shall be limited to those cases where work requires regular and frequent travel from school to school and the Superintendent has approved reimbursement. The District will meet with the Association by October 1 of each year to review travel time allotted for employees who are regularly required to travel between buildings as a requirement of their job. When needed, adjustments will be made to provide reasonable travel time.
Section 11.2	Travel Outside of the District
Prior approval of the District shall be required for reimbursement of certificated employees who travel outside of the District on school business. Direct billing and/or advance payment of travel, registration fees, lodging and subsistence costs may be authorized, provided that advance approval of overnight travel has been approved by the District.
Section 11.3	Reimbursement
The mileage allowance shall be paid at the IRS rate. Mileage records shall conform to State Examiner requirements. On forms provided by the principal, meals and mileage shall be listed and receipts for registration fees and lodging attached.
Section 11.4	Learning Improvement Calendar Employee Travel
Mileage will be reimbursed for travel between schools when related to LIC work. The building administrator must approve such travel in advance. To the extent possible, staff will make efforts to carpool.
ARTICLE 12.	EVALUATION OF CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES
Section 12.1	General
All certificated employees shall be evaluated during each school year in accordance with the procedures and criteria set forth herein. The evaluation of certificated employees is intended to provide a positive attitude by all parties toward the development and improvement of the instructional staff of the District; the written evaluation report shall not be the method used to formally discipline a certificated employee; provided, however, that this is not intended to prevent discussion of disciplinable problems as these affect teaching competency. The evaluation procedure recognizes high levels of teaching performance which have a positive impact on student learning as well as encouraging improvement in specific areas identified through the evaluation of the certificated staff member. The improvement of instructional services available to students is the ultimate objective of the evaluation program and should be effected by an open discussion of strengths and weaknesses.

Section 12.5	Evaluations
Final written evaluations should be completed thirty (30) days prior to the end of school, particularly for certificated employees who have had significant competency problems that school year, and must be completed ten (10) days prior to the end of the school year for all certificated employees. In any school year, after an evaluator develops concerns regarding the performance of an employee for any evaluative criterion, a conference must occur within ten (10) school days of each required observation. Prior to the preparation of the final written evaluation, any teacher may request an evaluation conference.
All copies of the evaluation form shall be signed by the evaluator and the certificated employee. Signature of the employee does not necessarily imply agreement with the evaluation. The certificated employee may submit signed comments concerning the evaluation report within ten (10) days of receipt of the report and such comments shall be attached to the evaluation report in the personnel file. The original of the evaluation shall be submitted to the Director of Human Resources or designee for review and filing in the personnel file. A second copy shall be provided to the certificated employee and a third copy shall be retained by the principal or the Director of Human Resources or designee. The Evaluation Conference shall not be used as a disciplinary meeting to issue a formal warning, reprimand, or discipline, provided, however, that this is not intended to prevent discussion or disciplinable problems as these affect teaching competency.
Evaluation statements based on complaints from other data sources shall only be incorporated as per the Complaint Procedure section.
Section 12.5.1	Short-Form Evaluation
Not withstanding the above, as per RCW 28A.405.100. Minimum criteria for the evaluation of certificated employees, including administrators - Procedure - Scope - Penalty.
After an employee has four years of satisfactory evaluation under subsection (1) of this section, a school district may use a short form of evaluation. The short form of evaluation shall include either a thirty-minute observation during the school year with a written summary or a final annual written evaluation based on the criteria in subsection (1) of this section and based on at least two observation periods during the school year, totaling at least sixty minutes without a written summary of such observations being prepared. However, the evaluation process set forth in subsection (1) of this section shall be followed at least once every three years and an employee or evaluator may request that the evaluation process set forth in subsection (1) of this section be conducted in any given school year. The short form evaluation process may not be used as a basis for determining that an employee's work is unsatisfactory under subsection (1) of this section nor as probable cause for non-renewal of an employee's contract under RCW 28A.405.210.
The above process will be available to building administrators but shall not be used if a staff member prefers the long form process. If an administrator would like to use the short-form process, it is agreed that:
A.	Notice of this request will be given to the employee prior to September 30.
B.	No person being evaluated by the process will be rated less than satisfactory.
C.	The same summary form will be used as with the long form, but without narrative.
Section 12.5.2	Professional Growth Option
The District will offer the Professional Growth Option as an evaluation component. (See WAC 392192.)

Section 12.7	Relationship to the Grievance Procedure
Except for the procedural requirements of the evaluation and probation sections of this Agreement, the content of a certificated employee's evaluation, or of an administrator's report pursuant to the Articles regarding Probation and Personnel Files, shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure.

Section 13.2	Advisory Conference

B.	Review the improvements required for the performance to be considered acceptable.
C.	Discuss the specific and reasonable program of improvement being contemplated to recommend to the Superintendent.
The advisory conference may be held at any time. At the request of the employee, Association representation may be present.
The three items above will be provided to the employee in writing prior to the advisory conference and in the same document the employee shall be notified that he/she is entitled to Association representation during the advisory conference. If the decision is still to recommend probation to the Superintendent, the supervisor shall provide to the employee a copy of the written interim evaluation and the recommendation being sent.

At the conclusion of the probationary period, the principal or director shall complete a written evaluation for each probationary employee and recommend to the Superintendent:
A.	That the certificated employee has demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency to justify the removal of the probationary status, or
B.	That the certificated employee has demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency to justify removal of the probationary status if accompanied by a letter identifying areas where further improvement is required, or
C.	That the certificated employee has not demonstrated sufficient improvement in the stated area(s) of deficiency and action should be taken to not renew the employment contract of the certificated employee.
Should the required reports of the certificated employee's probationary progress, if any, contain information not previously made known to the certificated employee, the certificated employee may submit a written statement which shall be appended to such report.
Section 13.5	Action by Superintendent
Following a review of any report submitted pursuant to Section 14.4, paragraph 4 above, the Superintendent shall determine which of the alternative courses of action is proper and shall take appropriate action to implement such determination. Probationary employees shall be notified as soon as possible of the Superintendent's decision regarding the disposition of their probationary status. Following the probationary period and at the Superintendent’s discretion, the Superintendent may remove the employee from his or her assignment and place the employee in an alternative assignment at the same rate of pay and benefits or place the employee on paid leave for the balance of the contract term, provided that the employee’s reassignment shall not displace another employee.

For purposes of this Article, leaves shall be granted in the following order of priority: 1) Illness, Injury and Emergency; 2) Bereavement; 3) Family Illness; 4) Discretionary; and 5) Other Leaves.
Section 16.1 Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave for All Certificated Employees
A full time certificated employee shall be allowed twelve (12) days a year for the certificated employee's personal illness, injury, and emergency leave. The twelve (12) days shall be posted to the credit of the employee effective the first day each school year, but shall be reduced proportionately for an employee who fails to complete the first quarter of the school year for any reason other than illness, injury, or emergency. Such leave shall be accumulated from year to year as allowed by law. No deduction from salaries shall be made during these days. Certificated employees working less than a full year shall be allowed personal illness, personal injury and emergency leave as follows: number of days worked, divided by 180, multiplied by 12. An employee may choose to use such leave to care for his/her minor children, spouse or partner, parents, parents-in-law, grandparents, or children over age eighteen (18) with disabilities with a serious health condition as defined by the Family and Medical Leave Act.
The District may require a physician’s statement at any time to verify use of Illness, Injury and Emergency Leave.
An "emergency" is defined as an unforeseen and suddenly precipitated occurrence of a serious nature beyond the control of the certificated employee which threatens the physical well-being or property of the certificated employee or his/her immediate family, and is of such nature that pre-planning is not possible or

could not relieve the necessity for the certificated employee's absence. Application for emergency leave shall be made to the Superintendent or his/her designee.
Even though a substitute teacher is not called when certain personnel are absent, the regular policies of deductions and illness, injury and emergency leave shall be used.
Illness, injury and emergency leave shall also apply to disabilities caused or contributed to by pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, childbirth and recovery therefrom.
Eligible employees may utilize the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for their own serious health condition. All the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act shall be extended to employees with work assignments of seven and one half (7.5) or more hours per day and at least 180 days per year who meet all other FMLA eligibility requirements.
Section 16.1.1 Attendance Incentive Program
Non-VEBA Conversion: Certificated employees may elect an annual conversion of accumulated illness, injury and emergency leave in accordance with number one (1) below. Employees may elect a conversion of illness, injury and emergency leave upon retirement, separation from service or death for monetary compensation in accordance with number two (2) below. The conversion procedures are as follows:
1.	Annual Conversion: Any certificated employee who at the end of the previous calendar year
shall have accumulated in excess of sixty (60) days of unused illness, injury and emergency leave, may convert unused illness, injury and emergency leave earned the previous year in excess of the said sixty (60) days to monetary compensation at the rate of 25 percent of the employee's current full-time daily rate of compensation for each full day of eligible illness, injury and emergency leave up to twelve (12) days. Any such election shall be made by written notice to Human Resources during the month of January. Any such annual conversion of accumulated illness, injury and emergency leave shall be in accordance with law.
2.	Conversion Upon Retirement, Separation from Service or Death: Any certificated employee who shall retire, separate from service or die while employed by the District may elect (personally or by a personal representative, as appropriate) to convert accumulated unused illness, injury and emergency leave days to monetary compensation at the rate of 25 percent of the employee's full-time daily rate of compensation at the time of retirement, separation from service or death for each full day of eligible illness, injury and emergency leave up to a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) days. Any such conversion of illness, injury and emergency leave upon retirement, separation from service or death shall be in accordance with law, including RCW 28A.400.210 and RCW 28A.400.212.
VEBA Conversion: The Association will annually notify the District of its intent to participate in VEBA III. Any such conversion of illness, injury and emergency leave annually or upon retirement, separation from service or death shall be in accordance with the law, including Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(9).
Section 16.2	Bereavement Leave

request by an employee to the Director of Human Resources, bereavement leave for the death of any other close family member as defined by the employee will be considered on a case by case basis and will not be unreasonably withheld. The number of days of leave, not to exceed five (5) per occasion of death shall be allowed according to the circumstances of each case as determined by the Director of Human Resources. Bereavement leave days need not be used consecutively, but shall normally be used within one (1) month following the death. Bereavement leave days are not cumulative or transferable. No deductions from salaries or sick leave shall be made during these days. Additional emergency leave days from the employee’s sick leave may be utilized upon approval from Human Resources.
2.	Any certificated employee who has a death of a student in his/her classroom shall be authorized one (1) day of bereavement leave to attend the memorial and/or a funeral service.
3.	Any certificated employee who has a death of a close personal friend may use one (1) day of emergency leave or discretionary leave to attend the memorial and/or funeral service.
Section 16.3	Family Illness
Certificated employees shall be eligible for a non-cumulative family illness leave for serious health condition in the immediate family as defined by the employee. This leave shall warrant up to a maximum of three (3) working days during a contract year and shall not be deducted from accumulated illness, injury or emergency leave. A maximum of two (2) additional days with the cost of a substitute being deducted from the employee's salary shall be allowed.
Additional emergency leave days from the employee’s sick leave accumulation may be utilized upon approval from Human Resources.
This leave may require a written statement from the attending physician.
Section 16.4	Discretionary Leave
One (1) discretionary leave day shall be allowed each certificated employee for important compelling personal matters. This discretionary leave day shall not be used for conducting income producing business. Discretionary leave shall not be used for a strike against the Puyallup School District. Discretionary leave shall not be used on LID or Supplemental Days, during the first week of school, last week of school, or the day before or the day after winter break, mid-winter break or spring break.
The District shall grant Discretionary Leave in the order the requests are received provided the requests are made in compliance with the above conditions. On Fridays, only ten (10) discretionary leave requests shall be honored.
Due to a lack of substitutes on Career Fair Day sponsored by the Washington School Personnel Association, only five (5) discretionary leave requests shall be honored.
An employee may utilize a discretionary leave day prior to or after a holiday or vacation period consistent with paragraph 1 above. Only fifteen (15) such requests shall be guaranteed per holiday/vacation period.
A maximum of six (6) discretionary leave days may be accumulated over a period of six (6) years. A maximum of two (2) days may be used consecutively unless additional use is approved by the Director of Human Resources.
During the restricted timeframes and on the days with limits, additional requests may be granted by the Director of Human Resources for compelling personal reasons, provided three (3) or more weeks notice is provided by the employee.

Employees may receive monetary compensation for their unused discretionary leave at $200 per day. A request for monetary compensation must be made by June 1 on a form provided by the Human Resources Office.
To the extent permitted by law, unused discretionary leave may be shared with other employees at the option of the individual employee. Employees who choose to share discretionary leave must complete the Discretionary Leave Sharing Authorization Form before transferring leave to another employee.
Section 16.5	Family and Medical Leave (FMLA)
In accordance with the FMLA, full time certificated employees (employees who work at least seven and one half (7.5) hours per day and at least 180 days per year), who have also worked for the District at least one (1) year in the preceding year shall be entitled to twelve (12) work weeks of unpaid Family Leave during any twelve (12) month period for the following:
A.	To care for a newborn or adopted child of the employee who is under the age of eighteen (18) at the time of placement for adoption, or a newly-placed foster child;
B.	To care for a spouse, domestic partner, parent or child of the employee who has a serious health condition; or
C.	For a personal health condition if it renders the employee unable to perform his or her job.
FMLA shall run concurrently with all applicable paid leave time available to the employee.
Leave taken for newborn or adopted child care shall be completed within one (1) year after the date of birth or placement for adoption. Family Leave authorized under this policy must be taken full time and consecutively unless an alternative schedule is approved by the Human Resources Department or where intermittent or reduced leave is medically necessary. Instructional staff may not take reduced or intermittent leave without the approval of the Director of Human Resources. An instructional employee may be transferred to an alternative equivalent position that would accommodate reduced or intermittent leave, if such a position is available.
The District will continue to pay its portion of the employee’s medical and dental benefit during approved FMLA leave.
A period of Family Leave is in addition to any sick leave taken due to the employee's temporary disability attributable to pregnancy or childbirth.
If both parents of a newborn or newly adopted child are employed by the school district, they shall be entitled to a total of twelve (12) work weeks of Family Leave during any twelve (12) month period, and leave shall be granted to only one parent at a time. There is no pooling in effect for spouses if the Family Leave is related to a serious health condition.
The Human Resources Department shall require written verification from the employee's health care provider.
The District may obtain the opinion of a second health care provider, at District expense, concerning any information pertinent to the employee's leave request. If the opinions of the health care providers differ on any matter determinative of the employee's eligibility for Family Leave, the two health care providers shall select a third provider, whose opinion, obtained at the employer's expense, shall be conclusive.

Return to Work. Any employee returning from an authorized Family and Medical Leave within twelve (12) work weeks, shall be entitled to the same position held by the employee when the leave commenced, or to a position with equivalent benefits and pay.
Reinstatement of an employee returning from Family and Medical Leave need not occur if: (a) the specific job is eliminated by a bona fide restructuring, or a reduction-in-force resulting from lack of funds or lack of work, (b) an employee on leave takes a position with another employer outside the home, or (c) the employee fails to provide the required notice of intent to take leave or fails to return on the established ending date of leave. If an employee fails to return from leave for a reason other than the employee’s death, the District may recover the costs of the employee's health benefits paid during the leave. Instructional staff may be required to delay their return from family leave to the beginning of the next semester under the following circumstances:
A.	The employee began leave five (5) or more weeks before the end of the semester, the leave is for more than three (3) weeks, and the employee would otherwise return to work within three (3) weeks of the end of the semester.
B.	The employee began family leave (except for a personal health condition) less than five (5) weeks before the end of the semester, the leave is for more than two (2) weeks, and the employee would otherwise return to work within two (2) weeks of the end of the semester.
C.	The employee began family leave (except for a personal health condition) three (3) or fewer weeks before the end of the semester and the period of leave is more than five (5) working days.
Section 16.6	Long-Term General Leave
Employees requesting a long-term general leave of absence for the following school year must normally do so on or before March 1. Employees requesting a long-term general leave of absence for the following semester must do so by March 1 (for first semester of the following school year) or December 1 (for second semester). The District cannot always grant a long-term leave of absence as there is no certainty of a vacancy to make room for the employee when returning. The Director of Human Resources, however, will consider such cases individually and may grant a long-term leave of absence without pay for a period not to exceed one (1) calendar year. Leave may be granted beyond one (1) calendar year under special circumstances if approved by the District. A certificated employee granted such leave shall be guaranteed reemployment by the District at the conclusion of said leave, consistent with the contract provision regarding Layoff and Recall. The returning employee will not necessarily be assigned to the identical position occupied before the leave, but will be reinstated to a certificated position equivalent in duties and salary to that held at the time the leave of absence began. Such reinstatement is contingent upon the availability of such a position. A salary increment shall not be given for the year during which the leave of absence is taken unless the individual is engaged in a District approved teaching assignment, or has been drafted into the United States Armed Services. A long-term leave of absence shall generally not be granted to an employee until completion of three (3) years of experience. General Leave may run concurrently with any FMLA leave taken, depending on the nature of the long-term leave. While on an approved long-term general leave, an employee’s benefits, accrual of benefits and accrual of seniority shall continue as indicated in the section titled Benefits While on Leave.
Section 16.7	Short-Term General Leaves of an Extraordinary Nature
Application for unpaid, short-term general leaves shall be made to the Director of Human Resources. Such leaves may be approved at the discretion of the Director of Human Resources, and may include, but not be limited to, personal business of an urgent nature involving possible loss of money or property, or severe

hardship to self or the immediate family, or for extraordinary personal reasons after the employee’s discretionary leave has been exhausted. Short-term general leaves of absence are intended for extraordinary or unexpected situations and shall not normally exceed three (3) months. If applicable, short-term general leaves of absence will be deducted from the employee’s accumulated illness, injury and emergency leave. Short-term general leaves may run concurrently with any FMLA leave taken as per section 17.5, depending on the nature of the long-term leave.
Section 16.8	Pregnancy Disability/Adoption/Parental Leave
16.8.1	Pregnancy Disability Leave
A pregnancy disability leave of absence shall be granted to a female certificated employee upon her request for the period of temporary disability and as verified in writing by her personal physician or licensed health care provider. Pregnancy disability leave shall be a leave with compensation during the temporary disability within the limitations of the sick leave provision.
The certificated employee who becomes pregnant shall notify her immediate supervisor and the Superintendent or designated representative of the condition by the beginning of the fifth (5th) month of pregnancy, or, if beyond the fifth (5th) month, at the earliest time the condition is confirmed by her personal physician or licensed health care provider. At that time she shall indicate in writing to her immediate supervisor and the Director of Human Resources whether she plans to:
1.	Take pregnancy disability leave only for time of temporary disability;
2.	Request a general leave to care for the child. If an employee is eligible for FMLA
leave and has leave remaining, the general leave would include any leave available under the FMLA;
3.	Request a combination of 1 and 2;
4.	Take FMLA leave for a period of up to twelve (12) weeks following the period of pregnancy disability, if eligible. The District will extend the employee’s health benefits during this period of unpaid FMLA leave; or
5.	Terminate her employment.
The pregnancy disability leave shall begin at a time determined suitable by the certificated employee and as verified in writing by her personal physician or licensed health care provider, after consultation with her immediate supervisor and the Human Resources Department. The official date of leave shall not begin until the school day following the day she leaves the job. Pregnancy Disability Leave, including time taken as FMLA leave and/or general leave to care for a newborn child shall not exceed one (1) year.
Assignment upon return from the pregnancy disability leave shall be guaranteed and shall be into the certificated employee's former position. She shall retain all rights, seniority and benefits commonly afforded certificated employees on leave, including those under the Continuing Contract Law.
Before returning in her contracted duties, the certificated employee's personal physician or licensed health care provider shall certify that the certificated employee is in good health and ready to resume her contracted duties. After receiving certification to return to work from her personal physician or licensed health care provider, the certificated employee shall return to her contracted duties at a time which she and the Director of Human Resources deem appropriate.

16.8.2	Adoption/Parental Leave
A certificated employee shall be allowed a maximum of three (3) days leave with pay for purposes of gaining custody of an adopted child and/or transacting the legal requirements necessary in the adoption process. A maximum of two (2) additional days at the cost to the District of a substitute being deducted from the employee's salary shall be allowed. Adoption leave without pay shall be granted pursuant to the provisions of the General Leave section for the adoption of a child. It shall run concurrently with any FMLA leave for which the certificated employee is eligible. The certificated employee shall notify his/her immediate supervisor and the Human Resources Department as soon as possible of his/her intention to take adoption leave and his/her planned time for adoption. Leave shall then begin on the first school day after custody of the child is obtained provided, however, that this beginning date may be extended by the District, if needed, to obtain a satisfactory replacement. All conditions pertaining to his/her return to his/her contracted duties are the same as the above provisos for pregnancy disability leave except that the certification of his/her personal physician or licensed health care provider shall not be required at any time and that the position returned to may be a comparable.
Extension of pregnancy disability or adoption leave to the beginning of the certificated employee's next normal contract year shall be mutually reviewed by the District and the certificated employee if the leave period expires after the beginning of the fourth (4) quarter of a school year.
In addition to any other leaves, within the first year of a child’s birth to, or placement with, an employee, such employee shall be allowed three (3) days of parental leave with pay. As well, two (2) additional days may be taken upon agreement by the employee to reimburse the District for the cost of a substitute.
Eligible employees may utilize the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to care for their newborn or newly adopted child. All the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act shall be extended to employees with work assignments of seven and one half (7.5) or more hours per day and at least 180 days per year who meet all other FMLA eligibility requirements.
Section 16.9	Leave Sharing
16.9.1	Receiving Shared Leave
An employee is eligible to receive donated leave if any of the following are true:
A. The employee requesting shared leave suffers from, or has a relative or household member suffering from, an extraordinary or severe illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition which has caused, or is likely to cause, the employee to:
1.	Go on leave-without-pay status; or
2.	Terminate his/her employment.
B.	The	employee’s absence and the use of shared leave are justified;
C.	The	employee has depleted, or will shortly deplete, his/her annual	leave and sick
leave reserves;
D.	The	employee has been called to service in the uniformed services;
E.	The	employee has abided by District rules regarding sick leave use;	and

F.	If the employee is later found to be eligible for industrial insurance benefits, the employee agrees to and shall reimburse the District for the time loss compensation that is paid to him/her to the extent that the employee is paid time loss compensation (temporary total disability compensation or loss of earning power compensation) and shared sick leave for the same day(s). An employee shall not use shared sick leave or donated leave to supplement the difference between time loss compensation and either net or full wages. If an employee has already received shared sick leave and is later found to be eligible to receive industrial insurance benefits, the remaining difference between shared leave minus the industrial insurance benefit shall be deducted from the employee’s sick leave balance, even if it results in a negative balance.
The Director of Human Resources shall determine the amount of leave, if any, which an employee may receive under this policy. Normally an employee shall not receive more leave than the number of contracted days remaining in the current school year. However, in the event that the condition requiring the employee's absence continues beyond the current school year, the employee shall not receive a total of more than 261 days of shared leave in accordance with RCW 41.04.665.
Section 16.9.2 Donating Shared Leave
District employees may donate annual leave or sick leave as follows:
A.	A staff member who has an accrued annual leave balance of more than ten (10) days may request that a specified number of days be transferred to another staff member authorized to receive shared leave. A staff member may not request leave to be transferred that would result in an accrued annual leave balance of fewer than ten (10) days. For purposes of this subsection A, annual leave does not accrue for employees who receive compensation in lieu of accumulating a balance of annual leave.
B.	A staff member may not request a transfer that would result in an accrued sick leave balance of fewer than one hundred seventy six (176) hours of sick leave. “Sick Leave” means leave for illness, injury or emergencies of extraordinary or severe nature pursuant to RCW 28A.400.300.
The donation of leave is totally voluntary. No employee shall be coerced, threatened, intimidated or financially induced into donating leave.
The number of leave days transferred shall not exceed the amount authorized by the donating staff member.
Leave transferred is based upon the current salary rate of the person receiving the leave. The receiving staff member will continue to be paid his/her regular rate while on shared leave. For example, if a staff member earning $20.00 an hour donates one day of leave to someone earning $10.00 an hour, the recipient would get two days of sick leave. However, if the $10.00 an hour employee donates one day to the $20.00 an hour employee, the higher paid employee would receive one-half day of leave.
Any leave transferred under this policy which remains unused shall be returned at its original value to the staff member who donated the leave.
Section 16.10	Jury Duty, Subpoena
Leave with pay shall be allowed for jury duty.

Leave with pay shall be granted a subpoenaed employee while appearing as a witness in court or in an administrative hearing in which the employee is not a party in interest, or if such appearance is related to the employee's District responsibility.
Section 16.11	Public and Military Service Leave
A.	Civic Service. Certificated employees shall be encouraged to take an active part in civic organizations. Such activity, however, should be outside of the regular school hours. Certificated employees who are called upon occasionally to take regular school time for club or community service may do so with prior approval of their immediate administrator.

E.	Layoff of certificated employees shall not occur unless the District can show there is a financial problem that would prevent the District from employing certificated staff at the same level as the previous year, or there is a reduction in enrollment necessitating layoff over and above attrition, or there is discontinuation of a position(s) including those resulting from termination or reduction of funding categorically funded projects. The District shall provide the Association, upon its request, with a detailed report on the financial affairs of the District, including copies of documents related to said finances and information related thereto.
Section 21.2	Procedures for Staff Reduction
In the event that it is necessary to reduce the number of certificated employees, those certificated employees (collectively "certificated employees" herein) who will be retained to implement the District's reduced or modified program and those certificated employees who will be terminated from employment or adversely affected in contract status will be identified by using the following procedures:
A.	Determination of Vacant Positions. The District will determine, as accurately as possible, the total number of certificated staff known as of April 1, leaving the District for reasons of retirement, family transfer, normal resignations, leaves, discharge or non-renewal, etc., and these vacancies will be taken into consideration in determining the number of available certificated positions for the following school year.
B.	Certification. Possession of any valid Washington State Certificate with the necessary endorsements which may be required by statute or administrative code for the position(s) under consideration shall be a prerequisite for retention.
C.	Employment Categories. The following categories and specialties are established to ensure the qualifications of personnel assigned to retained positions:
1.	Elementary teachers will be considered for retention in one category (K-6). Elementary teachers shall include classroom teachers, elementary Title I/LAP, elementary general music teachers, elementary physical education teachers, and highly capable education teachers.
2.	Except as provided in Section 21.2(C)(1), secondary teachers (7-12) will be considered for retention by teaching specialties such as science, math, social studies, language arts, family and consumer science career and technical education, music, art, health and fitness and world languages (by language).
3.	Other certificated employees will be considered for retention according to their specialties, which will include:

Certificated employees on leave from the District shall be placed in the category appropriate to said employees, and certificated employees employed on one year non-continuing contracts shall not be so included.
D.	Retention by Employment Category. Each certificated staff member will, in accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph E hereof, be considered for retention in the category or specialty within a category appropriate to the position held at the time of the implementation of these procedures. For the purposes of this section, an employee is currently performing in any given category or specialty if .4 FTE or more of such employee's assignment is devoted to such category or specialty. Certificated employees shall also be considered for retention in such additional categories or specialties as any such employee may designate in writing to the Superintendent or designee, provided, that in order to qualify for consideration in any such additional category, the employee must have had a minimum of one (1) year full-time professional experience* in each such additional category, a documented major or minor, or an endorsement in a category.
All written designations for consideration in additional categories shall be submitted in writing within five (5) working days after any request for such information is made by the Superintendent or designee. Employees will be considered for additional categories only if they do not qualify for retention in the category appropriate to the position held at the time of the implementation of these procedures.
E.	Selection Within Employment Categories. Certificated employees shall be considered for retention in available positions within the categories or specialties for which they qualify under Section 21.2(D) hereof. In the event there are more qualified employees than available positions in a given category or specialty, the following criteria shall be used to determine which employees shall be recommended for retention:
1.	Total seniority as a certificated employee as documented* 1' in the Human Resources Office by December 15 of the school year shall be the basis for retention for those categories and specialties identified in Section 21.2(C) above. Within each such category or specialty, the employee(s) having the greater seniority shall be recommended for retention*. In the event ties exist, the employee(s) having the most full days on paid status between September 1 and January 1 shall be retained. If a tie remains, the employee(s) having the highest number of college or university credits beyond the B. A. Degree earned by September 1 and recorded in the Human Resources Office by December 15 of the current school year shall have preference. If ties still remain, the employee(s) to be retained shall be determined by drawing lots among the employees who tie.
2.	"Seniority" within the meaning of this paragraph shall mean years of certificated experience of the nature eligible for recognition by the District for salary purposes, regardless of whether actually providing higher salary on a

Employees who, by part time assignments, have accumulated the equivalent of one (1) year of full time experience in an additional category satisfy the requirements of this paragraph with respect to such additional category.
It shall be the responsibility of the District to provide notice to each staff member the documented seniority and credits on file for that employee by November 15 of each school year.
It shall be the responsibility of the employee to review the seniority and credit information provided to them by the District and document any errors by December 15 of each school year. If more than one such employee is qualified for an open position, the criteria set forth in Section 21.2.E shall be applied to determine who shall be offered such position.

For example, if a salary schedule "tops out" at 15 years, an employee with 16.5 years would be senior to an employee with 16.0 years.
Seniority shall be calculated based on documented experience for each employee occurring prior to September 1 each year. The Association shall be provided a seniority list by February 1 each year. The list shall not include any certificated staff under replacement contracts on February 1.
F.	Action by Superintendent or his/her Designee. The provisions of Section 21.2(A-E) above shall be implemented on or before May 15 of the school year prior to the school year in which any staff reductions may be necessary. The Superintendent or his/her Designee shall take such action as may be required by statute to non-renew or adversely affect the employment contracts of affected employees.
G.	Employment Pool.
1.	All certificated employees who are not recommended for retention in accordance with these procedures shall be terminated from employment and placed in an employment pool for possible reemployment for a period of up to three (3) years. Employment pool personnel will be given the opportunity to fill open positions within the categories or specialties identified in Section 21.2(C) for which they are qualified under Section 21.2(D).
2.	When a vacancy occurs for which a person(s) in the employment pool qualifies, notification from the School District to such individual will be by certified mail or by personal delivery. Such individual will have five (5) calendar days from receipt of the letter to accept the position.

ARTICLE 24.	LEARNING IMPROVEMENT CALENDAR (LIC) COLLABORATION DAYS
Overview. The intent for the use of LIC days is for administration and certificated staff to work together to improve student learning and achievement. Professional development and communications are necessary for the improvement of student learning. This can only occur in an environment where people collaborate, compromise, examine things from the other person’s point of view, treat each other with courtesy and respect and focus on what is in the best interest of the students. The following concepts are the foundation of the LIC Collaboration Days:
1.	The principal is the educational leader in a school and is therefore responsible to work continuously with staff to bring about the improvement of instruction and student learning. Principals are obligated to bring legislative mandates, legal requirements, School Board and administrative initiatives, and school issues to the staff.
2.	The Comprehensive School Improvement Planning (CSIP) Team will use data and applicable information to determine student improvement needs and professional development opportunities. The team will design the annual plan which includes the work to be accomplished and the time lines for implementation. Team members will ensure that other staff members have been given an opportunity to give input. Following this input, the building administrator, as the instructional leader, will direct and facilitate the work to be accomplished.
Prior to the end of each school year, building staff will have an opportunity to choose grade level/department representation to reflect a cross-section of the diversity within the school and community. Membership is to include at a minimum: the building Principal, a teacher, other support staff, a parent and when appropriate, a student. The CSIP committee work which extends beyond the 7.5 hour workday shall be compensated at the professional hourly rate. The CSIP team will regularly communicate with and solicit input from the staff to ensure maximum staff participation in school-wide learning improvement efforts.
3.	The concept of collaboration is that administrators and certificated staff work together; however work on the Collaboration Wednesdays does not always have to be done with other people. For example, if the CSIP team has been involved in a process to identify strategies for improving achievement scores, the employees might meet in grade level, subject area or job-alike groups to discuss the work to be done, develop individual assignments and meet again when appropriate.
4.	Early release days on Wednesdays have been negotiated to provide principals, and certificated staff time to work together. If there is no CSIP work or meetings scheduled, other work such as grade level/subject area teachers working together may be done on the Collaboration Wednesday. Employees will be treated as professionals and will be allowed to make decisions regarding the use of this time. It is understood and expected that work to improve student learning will be accomplished by both parties.

5.	It is important that LIC activities be appropriate and related to an employee’s assignment. In the event an employee believes a scheduled LIC activity is not relevant to his/her work assignment, the employee shall discuss the matter with his/her supervisor. The employee and supervisor may mutually agree on an alternate activity for the employee aimed at improving student learning.
Section 24.1	Part Time Employees LIC
Part time employees will participate in Learning Improvement work if they are assigned to work on the Learning Improvement day and they are scheduled to work in the afternoon. On a case-by-case basis, part time certificated employees may request or be requested by the building administrator to participate on a Wednesday and be paid at the employee’s per diem rate of pay.
Section 24.2	LIC Parameters
The LIC chart, found in Appendix J shall identify the type of LIC work that is to be performed on specific LIC days. For any given month, the principal, building staff and District program supervisor may have the flexibility to change the order of the days, except those days designated for Special Service job-alike training. Any changes to the LIC must be communicated to the appropriate District supervisor and shall preserve the amount of time in each respective category.
If there are only two (2) LIC days in a month, one shall be a principal day and the other an individual planning day. If there are only three (3) LIC days in a month, the collaboration and teaming day will be eliminated and an individual planning day will be substituted in its place. If there is a fifth (5) LIC day in any month, the day will be used for individual planning.
During elementary conferences in the months of November and March, there shall be two additional LIC days for evaluation and conference time.
Section 24.3	Specific Requirements
1.	Non-emergency mandatory building meetings will not be called during individual planning time.

The District shall provide a class size report to the Association three (3) weeks following the start of each semester, and thereafter upon request.
* The K-1 class size goals shall be increased if the state basic education apportionment ratio, local levy funding, I-728 funding, or federal class size reduction funding falls below the 2002-03 school year level. These class size average goals shall not increase past twenty-two (22) students in any case.
Section 25.2	Workload Relief
If an employee experiences excessive workload due to the combination or special needs of students, the employee may request a meeting with the building administrator to discuss potential solutions to provide workload relief.
Section 25.3	Elementary Class Size Triggers
Classroom assistance will be provided as indicated in the chart below when these triggers are reached:
	1	2	3	4
Grade	$750 Stipend	$1,000 Stipend	3.0 hr/day Para	4.0 hr/day Para

extending the hourly assignments of paraeducators already assigned to a building. Those classes with the larger class sizes will receive priority consideration. The final count for class size overload assistance will be taken on the 11th school day and adjustments in paraeducator time will be made according to the chart above. The same process will be used in January on the 2nd Monday.
Following the count days, District administrators and PEA representatives will meet to discuss the class size loads district-wide and any anticipated problem situations. Throughout the year, as specific class size issues arise, the parties will meet to discuss the issues.
If additional students are added to a classroom beyond the fourth (4th) column, the District, the Association, and the affected teacher(s) will meet to discuss additional paraeducator assistance and/or compensation.
Resource room teachers are excluded from the chart above. Staffing is done using a different process, which includes the consideration of individual students’ needs. A resource staffing report will be provided to the PEA by October 15.
An elementary teacher whose class size falls within the first column of the trigger chart may elect to waive the $750 stipend and receive one (1) hour of paraeducator assistance time per semester instead of the stipend. An elementary teacher whose class size falls within the second column of the trigger chart may elect to waive the $1,000 stipend and receive two (2) hours of paraeducator assistance time per semester instead of the stipend. For columns three and four, only paraeducator assistance is available.
Section 25.4	Combination Classrooms

The number of students in a combination primary/intermediate room should not be more than twenty-four (24) students without the teacher’s approval. The District will make a reasonable effort not to assign non-sequential combination classes.
Upon creation of a combination class in grades 5/6 and 1/2, the District will meet with the employee and a PEA representative to consider options to alleviate the curriculum concerns.
Section 25.5	Inclusion of Special Education Students
Where special education students from self-contained classes are in an elementary classroom for instruction, those students should count as part of the class size if they are in that class more than five (5) hours per week.

Digitool teachers will receive a stipend based on the total number of 9th grade students divided by two (2).
The following are excluded from the above provision: JAG, advisory, and TAs. These excluded positions shall be eligible for relief at the building level through the money distributed to the building on an FTE basis.
Teachers who are not 1.0 FTE will have their total student workload and stipend prorated based on their FTE. For purposes of this section, buy outs will be considered a 1.2 FTE.
Under special circumstances, an employee may have a small class due to the educational nature of the class. In such cases, if the small class negatively affects the overall daily class size trigger amount, the employee shall discuss the matter with Human Resources and a PEA Representative to determine the appropriate class size trigger.
If a secondary administrator elects, with input from the staff, to use one (1) FTE certificated staff member in an instructional support role (instead of teaching five classes), the members of that staff will add +3 to class overload trigger numbers in each cell. Prior to making this decision, the staff will be informed of the estimated impact regarding class size and triggers.
Teachers who are eligible for stipends may pool their money and purchase paraeducator time.
Stipends will be paid based on the official enrollment counts on November 1 and March 1.
ARTICLE 26.	STUDENT LEARNING PLANS
In order to effectively implement student learning plans (SLPs), employees shall have the opportunity to utilize the October LID to perform work related to developing student learning plans and interventions. Efforts will be made to fairly distribute SLPs and to consider workload issues.
Upon completion of a SLP, the employee will make two attempts to conference with the student’s parent/guardian. After two unsuccessful attempts, or one no-show for a scheduled conference, the SLP will be mailed to the parent/guardian. The SLP form sent home to the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the student will be signed by the building administrator and contain a list of the SLP participants.
All SLP forms and conferences will be completed by the end of first semester.
ARTICLE 27.	SPECIAL SERVICES
Section 27.1	General
Special Services programs provide support and intervention for students who have health needs and/or who have been identified for specific interventions. Current special services policies and regulations are available on the Puyallup School District website. All students are general education students first. An individual student can receive additional support through special services programs when he/she qualifies by meeting eligibility criteria. Collaboration between special and general education staff is essential to plan, implement and assess appropriate support. Placements of students with Individual Education Plans (IEPs) will be in the least restrictive environment as determined by the IEP team and will be consistent with state and federal guidelines and regulations.

ARTICLE 28.	PARA EDUCATORS
Section 28.1
Assistants and paraeducators may be employed to aid professional school personnel wherever it is indicated that such services will provide for improvement in the school programs.
Assistants and paraeducators shall not assume professional responsibility for the guiding of instruction or the control of students for instructional purposes. These responsibilities reside with the professionally certificated employee.
Section 28.1.1
Employees shall not be required to do paraeducator evaluations, however they are encouraged to provide input so a fair evaluation can be written for the paraeducator.
Section 28.2

Section 28.4	Staff Utilization
The safety of students at school is a shared responsibility of all the certificated and non-certificated staff. The supervision of students before school, after school, in the lunchrooms, during recesses, during passing periods, and in non-instructional settings shall therefore also be a joint responsibility. In making provision for the prudent supervision of students, it shall be the goal in each building to balance the supervisory responsibility among all staff members. However, within the limits of the staff hours allocated to each building, certificated staff shall be utilized in roles where certificated persons are required to perform the work, and non-certificated staff shall be utilized where possible to release certificated staff to perform those tasks. The assignments of the personnel allocated will vary from building to building in response to the collaborative decisions of building staff and administration. If an accord cannot be reached in a building, the administrator shall implement temporary assignments and the parties shall seek facilitation of an accord in a timely fashion.
ARTICLE 29.	BUILDING STANDARDS

B.	Make recommendations to the Executive Director of Facilities on what planned work is to be completed before occupancy. This planned work will be incorporated into the punch list attached to the “Certificate of Substantial Completion.”
C.	Assist the Executive Director of Facilities in selecting alternate housing options or a delayed school opening.
Said committee shall make its recommendations on readiness or alternatives at least two (2) weeks in advance of the opening of school. If said committee finds deficiencies with respect to the Educational Specifications, it shall recommend what work needs to be completed before occupancy should occur to: (1) The Executive Director of Facilities, who will incorporate items into the “punch list” attached to the “Certificate of Substantial Completion”; (2) The Association President; and (3) The Superintendent, who will share the recommendations with the School Board as a part of his/her regular reports on the status of District facilities. If occupancy occurs before completion of the recommendations, the District shall report to the committee as to the status of the committee's recommendations and specify the date by which the work is expected to be completed.
Section 29.2
Communications' capacity being important, the District will continue to include telephones in each classroom as buildings are built or totally remodeled.
Each existing classroom shall be equipped with a means of communicating with the Main Office. Each site will have a phone designated for faculty use for private conversations. The need for staff members to receive messages at work is recognized, and in each building this process will be collaboratively arrived at for utilizing the system and persons available. However, it is agreed that staff members will, except in emergency cases, restrict their use of phones to times that will not diminish the District from the educational process and that personal business calls should be made outside the school day.
ARTICLE 30.	STUDENT DISCIPLINE, SAFETY AND SECURITY OF STUDENTS AND STAFF
Section 30.1	No Tolerance Policy
The District and the PEA are jointly committed to providing quality educational programs in a warm, open, supportive environment which protects the safety and security of all students and staff. Therefore, the parties agree that an optimal teaching and learning climate for staff and students requires a no tolerance policy for weapons, dangerous devices, and assaultive behavior. The parties recognize the increasing incidence of weapons, dangerous devices, and serious assaults in the society in general and in the nation's schools, and recognize that with such serious misbehavior, experience has shown that normal sanctions less severe than expulsion have failed to preserve a safe and orderly educational environment.
Section 30.2	Prohibition of Weapons and Assaultive Behavior
To achieve the above, it is agreed that possession or use of weapons, explosives, firecrackers, illegal knives, or other items capable of producing bodily harm shall be prohibited. Consistent with student due process and other legal requirements, the normal penalty shall be expulsion for possession or use of any weapons or dangerous devices, including but not limited to any weapon listed as a deadly weapon in RCW 9A.04.110 or local ordinances. Likewise, when any item is used by the aggressor as a weapon, or which a victim reasonably believes to be a weapon, the same sanctions will apply. Further, it is agreed that the normal penalty is emergency expulsion and other appropriate sanctions for any student who commits a serious

assault. Serious assaultive behaviors are defined as either physical assaultive behavior (purposeful assaultive, aggressive behavior, with intent to do serious harm), or verbal assaultive behavior (racial threat or threat to do serious bodily physical harm, either student-to-student or student-to-staff). An emergency expulsion shall continue if the Superintendent or designee has good and sufficient reason to believe the student(s) presence poses an immediate and continuing danger to employee(s), a student, other students or school personnel, or an immediate and continuing threat of substantial disruption of the class, subject, activity or educational process of the student(s) school. In making that determination, the hearing officer shall solicit input from the staff and administration of the building(s) directly affected.
Section 30.3	Assistance and Support
The District shall provide prompt assistance and support to certificated employees in connection with student discipline problems. An administrator or acting administrator, volunteering to be invested with the authority to act as such shall be available during school hours. When the administrator is away from the building, but in the District, an administrator shall be on call. When the building administrator is out-ofdistrict or absent for half the day or more, a substitute shall be provided when needed to maintain the building administrative coverage, unless a building's assistant principal is available. Teachers shall not be asked to accept the administrative responsibility and still teach their assigned classes.
In the maintenance of a sound learning environment, the certificated employee and the District shall expect and work to enforce acceptable behavior on the part of all students who attend schools in the District. Certificated employees shall operate within State law and District policy in maintaining good order and discipline in their classrooms at all times.
Without revealing specific information regarding criminal histories, medical histories, or specifically protected private information, receiving certificated employees will be notified in an appropriate manner of students who have exhibited serious assaultive behavior prior to their admittance to classrooms. Staff members so informed shall treat the information as confidential.
Section 30.4	Class Exclusion
Any student who creates a disruption of the educational process in violation of the building disciplinary standards while under a teacher's immediate supervision may be excluded by the teacher from his or her individual classroom and instructional or activity area for all or any portion of the balance of the school day or until the principal or designee and teacher have conferred, whichever occurs first: provided, that except in emergency circumstances, the teacher shall have first attempted one or more alternative forms of corrective action: provided further, that in no event without the consent of the teacher shall an excluded student be returned during the balance of that class or activity period. If a student makes a serious unfounded allegation against an employee, the employee may request a meeting with the principal/supervisor to discuss options regarding the student. Further, the authority of certificated employees to use prudent disciplinary measures for the safety and well-being of students and employees as well as the authority to use standard disciplinary measures for each disabled student, except where notification to the contrary has been provided to staff, is supported by the District. In the exercise of authority by an employee to control and maintain order and discipline, the employee may use reasonable and professional judgment, including reasonable and prudent use of physical constraint, to protect harm being done to a student or to him/herself.
Section 30.5	Disciplinary Standards
On or before September 30 of each school year, each building principal and his/her teaching staff shall meet to develop and/or review building disciplinary standards, and uniform enforcement of those standards. Visitor access regulations will be in the employee handbook. In addition, the special education guidelines will be reviewed.

Within three (3) days of written notification (to principal or his/her designee) of a behavior problem of a student with an IEP, an employee shall have the right to meet and confer with the principal and/or the available members of that student’s SRC (Student Review Committee).
ARTICLE 31.	SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS
Certificated employees shall not be expected to work, teach or supervise students in an area where such work would likely result in physical or emotional harm to said employee(s) or student(s). When the staff member(s) and site administrator(s) indicate a hazardous condition exists, the concern will be acted upon within five (5) working days. If there is a disagreement as to the hazardous condition, the matter may be referred by either party to the appropriate state or county agency for determination. If the safety concerns relates to workload, then it shall first be taken up with the principal.
All rooms in which students are required to eat lunch shall be cleaned daily, including floor, sinks and trash removal.
Certificated employees shall promptly report any safety hazards or unsafe conditions they are aware of to their immediate administrator. The District shall advise certificated employees of any unsafe working condition(s), as determined by a state or county agency, which would pose an immediate and substantial threat to them or their students' health in the areas in which they work. A copy of the notification to the certificated employee(s) will be sent to the Association President within five (5) working days of receipt of the same by the District. Within five (5) working days following the District’s receipt of facility environmental testing prompted by an Association complaint, a copy of all environmental test results shall be provided to the Association President.
ARTICLE 32.	DISTRICTWIDE COMMITTEES
Section 32.1	Instructional Program
The Superintendent or his/her designee shall post the existence of regular District-wide instructional program committees in each building each school year. Criteria for membership, contractual rate of pay offered, if any, and the available openings on the committees, if any, shall be listed at the time of posting. Certificated employees shall have five (5) working days after the date of posting to indicate to the appropriate administrator their desire to serve on said committee(s). Employees are not required to participate in district-wide committees outside the seven and one half (7.5) hour work day. Such participation is strictly voluntary. Administration shall not coerce or intimidate employees to participate on committees, particularly employees new to the District, and/or profession. Committee work outside of the seven and one half (7.5) hour work day shall be compensated at the stated professional rate of pay.
Section 32.2	Other Committees
The District may request that an employee serve on a District committee, and building level administrators may request that an employee serve on a building level committee. Each employee shall not be subject to reprisals for choosing not to serve on District or building-level committees. When the District or building administrator deems appropriate, released time shall be provided for participation on said committee(s). Employees who choose to participate on District wide or building-level committees outside the seven and one half (7.5) hour work day will be compensated at the professional rate.

Section 32.3	Composition
The composition of district wide task forces and committees shall be reviewed by the Association prior to a committee meeting to ensure appropriate representation of Association members.
ARTICLE 33.	STUDENT TEACHERS
The Board and Association agree that the acceptance and proper deployment of student teachers in the Puyallup School District can constitute a significant contribution to the improvement of the educational profession.
Guidelines for consideration include: (1) only one student teacher per year per supervising teacher, (2) assignment only with an experienced teacher, (3) the program is voluntary, and (4) spring preplanning is valuable in making the program effective.
ARTICLE 34.	GRADING STANDARDS
Teachers are responsible for setting permissible standards for grading students, communicating those standards and fairly applying them. Such grades and/or comments will only be changed in accordance with the law or District policy. Prior to making any decision which alters any grade or comment or making a recommendation to alter a grade or comment, a building administrator/supervisor will study the records, ascertain the factors involved and consult with the employee who gave the grade. If a grade or comment is altered by a District representative, the employee and parent/guardian of the impacted student shall be notified in writing. (See WAC 180-44-010 and RCW 28A.150.240)
The District will form a committee during the 2008-2009 school year to study the technical requirements of the elementary report card to look for potential ways to simplify and/or improve it.
PART IV - SUBSTITUTES
ARTICLE 35.	SUBSTITUTES
Section 35.1	Application of Agreement
The provisions of this section apply only to represented substitutes as defined in Article 1. Only the sections of this Collective Bargaining Agreement specifically referred to in this Article shall be applied to substitute employees. The sections of this Agreement applying to substitutes shall be:
A.	Student Calendar
B.	Article 1 (Administration of Agreement, Section 1.2 only)
C.	Article 2 (Payroll Deductions, Sections 2.4.1, 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 only)

supervisor request, teacher request, reports of previous placements, formal training, certification, endorsements, previous substituting experience, immediate availability, demonstrated willingness to accept assignments, length of time with the District and administrative convenience. Substitutes are responsible for carrying out their responsibilities as outlined in the Puyallup School District Substitute Teacher Handbook, including, but not limited to, following the teacher's lesson plan. The District shall notify substitutes of the handbook and shall make this accessible. Substitutes, however, are protected as regular employees by Article 6, Teaching of Controversial Issues.
Section 35.3	Job Exclusion
The District may elect in which buildings and classrooms to utilize a substitute. A substitute may be excluded from a particular classroom upon request by the classroom teacher. However, the substitute shall be provided with the nature of the complaint and shall have an opportunity to conference with said teacher. The conference shall be arranged through the building administrator. Before deciding not to use a specific substitute in a particular building again because of a complaint(s) regarding that substitute's work, the substitute shall be informed in writing of the nature of the complaint(s) and be given an opportunity to respond to the allegation. A substitute will only be excluded from a particular building if a problem is not remediable as determined by the principal. The Human Resources Department shall review any decision made by a building administrator to not use a specific substitute. However, only when the District decides to drop a substitute from its substitute list is that decision grievable and is grievable only to the extent there is no just cause. For this section, just cause shall include any material or significant breach of the duties of substitutes outlined in the Substitute Teacher Handbook, repeated parental complaints, insubordination, unprofessional conduct or conduct which reasonable educators would consider detrimental to students or to their education.
Section 35.4	Compensation
Substitutes pay shall be .38% of the base salary for teachers. Senior substitutes shall be paid 103% of the regular substitute pay rate. A half-day shall be defined as 4 hours and paid at 54% of the regular substitute full days pay. On LIC Wednesdays, substitutes shall work 4.5 hours and be paid at 60% of the regular substitute full days pay. On the 20th day of work in a single continuing assignment, retroactive to the first day of the assignment, a substitute shall be paid at the per diem rate that employee would receive if paid on the salary schedule for regular employees. Further, when substitutes are placed in assignments known from the outset to extend more than twenty (20) days, that per diem rate shall be paid from day one (1). Upon completion of the school year substitutes shall receive one of the following incentive bonuses: $200 for working the equivalent of 50 full days, $300 for working the equivalent of 70 full days, or $400 for working the equivalent of 90 plus full days.
Section 35.5.	Long Term Assignments
When filling a long-term assignment (anticipated to be 20 days or more), the District may 1) elect to post the position, 2) select from its applicant pool, 3) retain in the position a substitute who can provide continuity for the program, or 4) fill the assignment from the substitute pool in the same manner as selection of daily job assignments. After working ninety (90) days in a long-term assignment, substitutes may request that their building administrators or program supervisors complete a formal observation of their work for their files. Pre-conferences and post-conferences shall be optional. The observation form used shall be the same as that used for regular employees by that supervisor. The substitute shall have the option of having the evaluation placed in his/her file. The content and process shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure, Article 3.
Section 35.6	Length of Work Day
The length of the school day is 7-1/2 hours for substitutes. Except in the case of unusual circumstances, the substitute shall have the same planning time as the employee for which the substitute has been assigned. Substitutes expected to work beyond the 7-1/2 hour work day will be compensated at their extra hourly rate of pay. The hourly rate of pay will be based on a 7-1/2 hour work day and the individual substitute’s

classification. A substitute assigned to work more than one-half (1/2) day, with prior notice, will be required to work a 7-1/2 hour day. When a substitute teacher is asked to cover for another teacher during planning periods or when asked to teach during a planning period that has been “bought out,” they shall receive additional compensation. The District shall provide a duty free lunch for substitutes traveling between buildings.
Section 35.7	Information Access
Each work site shall identify a mailbox for substitutes to receive copies of general correspondence. Each substitute shall be provided a weekly bulletin, if available, and each site will determine any other appropriate means of communicating staff information to substitutes. Substitute teachers shall be provided access to district e-mail. Substitutes may, upon request, review the contents of the substitute personnel files kept in the Education Service Center and the reports retained at the schools. Information regarding high-risk students shall be incorporated in the substitute folder. The District shall provide substitute teachers with permanent identification badges.
Section 35.8	Required Training Support
It is agreed that FBI background check, fingerprinting and HIV/Hepatitis B training are conditions of employment, and costs are to be assumed by any person seeking employment in the District. However, employees who retire from the District shall be automatically accepted into the substitute pool upon request without application, interview, fingerprinting or FBI background check as long as there has been no break in service from the time the employee retires to the time they join the substitute pool. If the District requires additional training of represented substitutes, the District agrees to pay a pro rata of the daily substitute rate for attending such training. The District will provide a Job Search Seminar at least once a year for substitutes.
Section 35.9	Senior Substitutes
Substitutes who have been active on the District’s substitute list more than three (3) school years or who have retired from teaching after at least one year of teaching in this District may request “senior substitute status.” Senior substitutes will be called in the order of seniority for substitute assignments for other than “same day work” when:
A.	There has been no other substitute specifically requested by a supervisor or teacher;
B.	The substitute	has	the necessary background and training;
C.	The substitute	has	demonstrated competence by previous work in	the	area of the assignment;
D.	The substitute	is available when called; and
E.	The substitute	has	not already been placed in an assignment for that time period.
A person requesting “senior substitute status” must accept the assignment when offered unless:
A.	The substitute is ill or caring for a dependent family member;
B.	The substitute has not requested placement at this grade level (K-3, 4-6, 7-12) or in the
subject area of the assignment; or
C.	The substitute has not requested one week in advance to be excused from assignments during the period of the assignment.

To the extent possible under the terms of contracts with providers, and to the extent permissible under law, substitutes will be provided medical/dental insurance eligibility as set out below:
A.	Any substitute teacher who worked as a substitute teacher for ninety (90) days or more in the District during the immediately preceding school year, and who remains available to work as a substitute in the District, may participate in the plan by notifying the District before August 15 of his/her desire to participate in the plan for the upcoming school year.
B.	Any substitute teacher participating in the Plan shall be eligible to join, on a self-pay basis, any of the District approved medical insurance plans or other voluntary insurance plans, subject to any conditions imposed by the District’s insurance carriers. The initial payment must be received in the District Payroll Office before August 15.
C.	Initially the substitute teacher who is eligible for insurance coverage shall make the first month’s payment and a second month’s deposit. By the fifth (5th) day of each month thereafter, the substitute teacher shall submit to the District Payroll Office a check in the amount of the premium due.
D.	In a month when the substitute teacher fails to deliver payment to the District Payroll Office, the deposit will be forwarded to the insurance carrier as payment. If the deposit is used, the District Payroll Office shall notify the substitute teacher within two weeks that the deposit was used. The substitute teacher shall be solely responsible for leaving another deposit with the District Payroll Office within two weeks to make the premium payment if it is again necessary.
E.	Failure to make the required payment to the District Payroll Office as detailed in 1 and 2 above shall serve as the substitute teacher’s notice to the District that the substitute teacher wishes to discontinue his/her medical/dental insurance coverage.
Section 35.11	Employment Interviews
Substitutes who work more than seventy-five (75) assignments in a school year prior to the annual Puyallup School District Recruitment Fair (typically in March) will, upon request, be granted an interview during the recruitment fair.
PART V - MISCELLANEOUS
ARTICLE 36.	SITE-BASED DECISION MAKING
Section 36.1
The parties affirm a principle of modern management that recognizes some kinds of decisions in the operation of an organization are best made by the individuals who actually provide a service. A site-based decision-making philosophy is comprised of three main elements: a) the decentralization and democratization of appropriate building-level decisions; b) delegation of authority to the building principal, the site staff and, where appropriate, parents and community members at that school to make identified changes in the instructional programs of the school which will improve the education being provided for the students; and c) development of responsibility among site staff for the determination, execution, and evaluation of the revised instructional program. Site-based decision making shall involve those who are affected by the decision. Participation shall be direct or through representation of their choosing.

Site-based decision making shall only address topics and actions that affect the instructional delivery system of a specific school site and may include such items as staff development (building inservice), student discipline, staff utilization, early release days, school goals, programs and priorities and other building instructional concerns, but excluding hiring decisions. Staff may at times be asked for their participation in hiring processes, and their input and reactions to candidates may be solicited.
Section 36.3
Site-based decisions shall not violate Board policies, state law, or this Agreement.
Section 36.4
Special Services staff members who have no school site to which they are attached per se, and/or no building staff with whom they need to be involved regarding a particular site decision, shall for the purposes of this Article be considered part of a site-based team assigned to the Special Services Office.
ARTICLE 37.	TEACHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The District will follow the listed criteria and processes in implementation of the Teacher Assistance Program in accordance with (WAC 392-196) and the criteria specified.
1.	Selection of Mentor and Beginning Teachers
It is recognized that funding may limit the participation of eligible teachers as per WAC 392-196. Thus selection of beginning teacher participants shall be based on their hiring seniority and willingness to participate. In the event a beginning teacher is unable to participate, the next eligible beginning teacher will be contacted by the building principal for participation.
Mentor teachers must meet the criteria specified in the legislation and participation will be on a voluntary basis. Mentor teacher selection will be based on: a) similarity of assignment to the beginning teacher (i.e. same grade level and subject area) and b) a willingness to fully participate in program seminars and related activities.
2.	Funding and Compensation
The program will be funded through an allocation provided by the state. Compensation will be based on 75% of the remaining funds to the mentor and 25% to the beginning teacher.

Memorandum of Agreement
Puyallup School District and the Puyallup Education Association (PEA)
Teacher Access Center (TAC) Support Plan for 2008-2009
Recognizing the importance of communication to parents/guardians and students regarding student progress, the Puyallup School District is dedicated to supporting staff in the implementation of the Teacher Access Center (TAC). The district acknowledges and appreciates the efforts made by staff to implement this student data management system.
As we work toward full implementation of StudentPlus during the 2008-2009 school year, the district will provide ongoing support to staff. That support will include:
•	New Teacher training: new teachers will receive a day of technology training which will include TAC training.
•	Daily ‘drop in’ training sessions will be provided at ITC during the first two (2) weeks of school for staff to receive individualized support. Staff will be compensated at the professional rate for training beyond the regular work day.
•	‘Drop in’ training sessions will be provided at ITC for the first two days of the elementary trimester report card. Staff will be compensated at the professional rate for training beyond the regular work day.
•	Regional Building Technology Liaisons (BTL) will be identified in order to provide regional support for elementary staff.
•	Secondary schools will identify a BTL to provide daily ongoing support for building specific questions.
•	Building administrators will continue to receive TAC training.
•	Specialized training by work groups will be provided when requested and appropriate. Staff will be compensated at the professional rate.

Potential upgrades will go through a testing process that will include user group involvement before going ‘live.’ Upgrades will occur during the school year only if they will not disrupt the necessary and important work of staff. In that case, they will be completed during summer months.
•	The district will make an ongoing effort to resolve problems/concerns and communicate consistently regarding TAC assistance and system availability.
•	The District will gather input from a cross section of TAC users (from advanced to novice levels of proficiency) to assist in responding to TAC concerns.
•	Wider access to student information may be required and may be provided to specific work groups (i.e. counselor, specialists, resource teachers, department chairs) on an as needed basis. Such requests will be made to the building administrator who will contact ITC regarding this request.
•	Easy Grade Pro (EGP) aligns with TAC for elementary staff who choose to use EGP as their grade book.

Years of experience means the number of years of full-time and part-time professional education employment as of August 31 prior to the current "snapshot" date.
Professional education experience is limited to the following [WAC 392-121-245]:
1.	Employment in public or private preschools or elementary and secondary schools in positions which require certification;
2.	Employment in public or private vocational-technical schools, community/junior colleges, colleges, and universities in positions comparable to those which require certification in the common schools;
3.	Employment in educational institutions in any professional position, including but not limited to, C.P.A., architect, business manager, physician, if employment is in an education agency or institution such as an ESD, OSPI, or the United States Department of Education;
Educational agency or institution, as interpreted for this purpose, means a governmental agency administratively responsible for providing public elementary and/or secondary instruction or educational support services. This does not include school districts nor is it likely to include any agency below the level of a regional education agency such as an ESD.
4.	Experience in the following areas if recognized by the district for placement on the district salary schedule:
a)	Military, Peace Corps, or Vista service which interrupted professional employment;
b)	Sabbatical leave; and
c)	For vocational instructors who hold no degree, up to a maximum of six years of management experience acquired after the instructor meets the minimum vocational certification requirements.
NOTES:
•	Employment may be in Washington, out-of-state, or in a foreign country.
•	Document years of experience in the employee's file on a letter or any other document that provides
evidence of employment, including dates of employment [WAC 392-121-280(3)].
•	Report all years of experience including those beyond the experience limit of the district's salary schedule [WAC 392-121-245].
•	The traditional nine-month academic year is considered as one school year. Count no more than one year of experience for any twelve-month period [WAC 392-121-245].
•	Accumulate full- and part-time employment to three decimals and report in tenths of school years [WAC 392-121-215] and [WAC 392-121-245].
•	Report substitute days as part-time professional education employment. Calculate years of experience for substitute days, summer school and extended school year days by dividing the accumulated number of full-time days by 180 and rounding to the nearest tenth. Report partial substitute days as part-time professional education employment by dividing the part of the day worked by the full day as determined by the district and rounded to the nearest tenth of a day [WAC 392-121-245].
EXAMPLE 21
A person worked 87 days full-time one year, 180 days half-time the second year, and 100 days fulltime the third year. A full year in the District is 180 days. District files record this experience as .483 FTE + .500 FTE + .556 FTE = 1.539 FTE. Report 1.5 years of experience.
92
APPENDIX I:	JOB SHARE GUIDELINES PUYALLUP SCHOOL DISTRICT
1. What is the difference between a part-time position, a part-year position and a job share position?	A part-time position is funded as a fraction of a full-time single position, for example, a .5 FTE. A part-year position is a position that is for less than 180 days and, therefore, is reported as a fraction of an FTE, i.e., 160 divided by 180 would be a .89 FTE. A job share exists when two people share the responsibilities of one full-time position at their request.
2. What is the difference in benefits between job share and part-time positions?	Part-time employees will receive a prorated allocation as agreed upon by the District and the bargaining unit. Job share staff will be eligible to share 1 benefit allocation on a prorated basis. Full-year employees at .5 FTE or above are eligible for full TRI, except where staff members are job sharing. In job sharing situations, the two staff members will each receive their respective FTE times the amount for which they would qualify if in a full-time position. Part-time staff members and staff members who are less than .5 FTE will be eligible for a pro rata share of TRI based on their FTE.
3. What about planning/release, the 181st Day and staff meetings?	Planning and release days are prorated based on the job share FTE. Job share partners shall attend all LID and Supplemental Days. One member of the team must attend building planning days and staff meetings. Both members are responsible for keeping abreast of building discussions, issues and concerns.
4. Is the District obligated to share a position?	The District is obligated to consider job sharing when there is an open position.
5. How does one get permission to job share?	Job Share Application forms are available in Personnel. One application is to be completed by each team. All applications for reassignment in a building must be submitted in time to be approved no later than May 1 of the preceding school year, provided however, applications that cause no “domino effect” may be submitted any time before the first student day. Applications for open positions will follow the same timelines required for transfers outlined in Article 10, Section 4, of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
6. What must be done before a job share request is approved?	a)	Individuals interested in being reassigned to a job sharing position must identify a job share partner within the current ranks of provisional and continuing District staff who is acceptable to the building principal. If no job share partner is found in the ranks of current employees, the job share is posted. b)	The potential job share team must then identify the position they wish to share. c)	The Job Share Application form must be completed by the team requesting the job share, approved or disapproved by the principal and returned to the Personnel Office for review.
93
7. Can a job share team work alternating weeks?	Alternating weeks if approved by a Principal and District designee.
8. Who authorizes a job share?	The Director of Human Resources will authorize a job share after reviewing the recommendation of the building principal.
9. What will be the basis for consideration of job share requests?	The consideration will be based on administrative and program needs. The District will maintain a limited number of job share opportunities per building depending on the number of administrators, staff and special programs. If a job share application is rejected, a written rationale for the denial will be provided if requested.
10. What happens to an individuals contract when job sharing?	The individual retains the present year FTE and will be placed on leave for the portion of the FTE being shared, e.g., 1.0 FTE equals .5 leave and .5 assigned.
11. How long is a position job shared?	One school year. Job share teams will have the opportunity to reapply in the following spring.
12. Can a job share be started mid-year?	The creation of job shares mid-year would be most unusual. All requests to be reassigned to a job share must be submitted pursuant to guideline #5.
13. Can job shared teams trade scheduled days?	Yes, with prior approval of the building administrator.
14. Can one team member substitute for another team member?	Yes. The request must be made through the Substitute Office and the pay for substituting will be at the regular substitute rate.
15. To whom is the job share position assigned?	a)	Where a position already belongs to one team member, it remains that member’s position when the job share team dissolves. b)	Where a position is “open,” it shall be assigned to the senior member of the team (by building and then by District seniority).
16. What happens when both members want to end the job share?	The person whose position was shared retains the position unless staff reduction provisions of the contract have been implemented. The other member may remain in the building if there is a position available; otherwise, that member must transfer. If one or both members of a team wish to job share with new partners, the application process must start over again.
17. Is special consideration for continued job sharing given to anyone?	Yes. Special consideration is given to job share teams that were in existence prior to the 1993-94 school year because at the time of the creation of those teams, the guidelines were not in place.
