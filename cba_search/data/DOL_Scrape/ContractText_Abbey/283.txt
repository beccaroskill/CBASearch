INTRODUCTION
The management of Delphi Corporation recognizes that it cannot get along without labor any more than labor can get along without the management. Both are in the same business and the success of that business is vital to all concerned. This requires that both management and the employees work together to the end that the quality and cost of the product will prove increasingly satisfactory and attractive so that the business will be continuously successful.
Delphi Corporation holds that the basic interests of employers and employees are the same. However, at times employees and the management have different ideas on various matters affecting their relationship. The management of Delphi Corporation is convinced that there is no reason why these differences cannot be peacefully and satisfactorily adjusted by sincere and patient effort on both sides.

of the Local Apprentice Committee within seven (7) calendar days from the date of the meeting. •
(69)	The Standard Apprentice Plan, as revised, shall become effective and is to be followed as of the effective date of this Agreement. For identification a copy of such plan has been signed by the' parties hereto.
(70)	. The number of new apprentices who may be enrolled shall be determined on the basis of the number of joumeypersons employed for the program averaged over the preceding twelve (12) months. The ratio of apprentices in training to journeypersons should not exceed one (I) apprentice to eight (8) joumeypersons. However, the union agrees that local Management can establish a ratio of apprentices to joumeypersons in excess of the one (1) to eight (8) ratio, but not to exceed a ratio of one (1) apprentice to five (5) joumeypersons. Deviations below the one (1) to five (5) ratio may be agreed to by the Local Apprentice Committee. Favorable consideration will be given to requests for deviation below the one (1) to five (5) ratio in instances	,
in which it is anticipated the impact of early retirement will create a skilled labor shortage. Disputes concerning such deviations will be referred to the Delnhi-IUE-CWA Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee for decision. In the event of a reduction of force, the apprentices in
82
excess of the one (1) to eight (8) ratio will be laid-off before any joumeyperson in that trade is laid-off. The ratio of apprentices in training to journeypersons will be based on the average number of journeypersons employed for the program computed on the last Monday of each of the twelve preceding months. The average thus computed shall remain in force until a new computation is made on the last Monday of the next succeeding month.
If, during periods when joumeypersons are laid-off, any monthly computation results in a ratio in excess of one (1) apprentice to eight (8) journeypersons, such excess apprentices will be laid-off by the end of the pay period during which the last Monday of the month falls except that a minimum of one apprentice may be retained in each trade. In the event the reduction in force is due to unusual circumstances, including, but not confined to: a transfer or discontinuance of an operation, major technological developments, the elimination or consolidation of classifications, the discontinuance of a shift, or a drastic reduction in the level of work resulting in a heavy reduction in the skilled work force; the parties locally shall mutually agree to an acceptable layoff and recall plan. Such a layoff plan may provide for reducing the ratio below one (1) to eight (8), or for laying off all apprentices in a particular trade.
(71)	To maintain the proper schedule for graduating apprentices, their standard work week shall be 40 hours. Changes in the standard work week that are expected to exist over a period of time that would affect materially the time when the apprentice would otherwise graduate, shall be negotiated locally. '
(a) Equalization of any overtime available to apprentices is subject to Local Agreement between the Local Management and the Union caking into account the training schedules.	•
I
(72)	Upon graduation or transfer to another classification, the seniority of the apprentice shall start from the date of the Apprentice Training Agreement or the apprentice’s plant seniority date established pursuant to Paragraph 29, whichever is later.
(73)	Any problems involving apprentice related training schedules which cannot be settled locally by the Local Apprentice Committee shall not be subject to the grievance procedure. Such problems will be reviewed
।	jointly by representatives j>f the-Corporation»and the= =“
1	International Union,
Upgrading
(74)	Management will study its future tool, die, wood and metal pattern shop, and machine repair shop needs, and will post on the bulletin board a list of jobs for which a shortage of joumeypersons is anticipated. Employees now working on production jobs in the plant, who have experience and qualifications for such jobs, will be permitted to file applications with the Personnel Department, listing their experience and qualifications for jobs as operators for such jobs in order that they may be considered when vacancies occur, "
(75)	When such vacancies occur and joumeypersons are hot available for employment, and there are no joumeypersons currently working on other than skilled trades classifications who have submitted appropriate documents to Management pursuant to Paragraph (84), vacancies are to be filled by the upgrading of other workers in the plant who have the necessary qualifications to perform the work and who have previously made application for such work. When the qualifications of such employees are equal, employees with the longest seniority will be given preference. The recruitment, selection, employment, and training of upgraders shall be without
84
discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation or sex. Affirmative action will be taken to provide equal opportunity in the Upgrader Program.
(76)	Where no applications of employees with qualifications have been filed pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (74), new non-joumeypersoti applicants with qualifications may be hired for the work.
(77)	Where the minimum rate of the tool, die, wood and metal pattern shop, or machine repair shop job to which the employee is upgraded is not more than ten cents above the rate the employee is earning, the employee will be advanced to such minimum rate upon transfer, but where there is more than a ten-cent differential, the employee will be advanced ten cents over the rate the employee has been earning, or to a rate of $25.58 per hour until September 19.2005. $26.09 per hour until September 18. 2006. and $26.87 per hour thereafter, whichever rate is higher at the time, and will be stepped up not less than ten cents each sixty days, if retained, until the employee reaches the minimum rate of the classification.

Contracting Out of Maintenance Work
APPENDIX A
DELPHI CORPORATION
November 16,2003
Mr James D. Clark
Chairman, IUE-CWA
Automotive Conference Board
2360 W. Dorothy Lane Suite 201 ■	'
Dayton, OH 45439
Dear Mr. Clark;	.
i
I
I t
I
It is the policy of the Delphi Corporation to perform maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the labor, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits. At times the Corporation does not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or let the work to outside contractors. This letter is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.
The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue Its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees to perform maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past.
In this regard, we have seen the use of joint Management and Union work schedule and business opportunity teams work very successfully in many of our locations. This approach has not only enhanced job security, but has allowed a better understanding as to the competitive challenges facing the parties. As such, each location is encouraged to establish a skilled trades subcontracting planning team involving both Management and Union representation who will review forecasted work
129
Appendix A Contracting Out of Maintenance Work schedules, including projects and jobs which may be subject to subcontracting, in order to develop the most efficient approach to the work to be performed.

Dear Mr. Clark:	'
During the current negotiations, the Union discussed with the Corporation serious problems affecting the job security of employees resulting from contracting out of work.
During the course of negotiations, the Union ,	complained that in certain instances the workforce in
maintenance and tool and die trades particularly was reduced through attrition and then work was . contracted out to the point where there was insufficient labor available within the plant to perform the work; that in certain instances Upgraders were reduced to production jobs and work in their -trades which they historically performed and which
1	they were capable of performing was subsequently
contracted out for extended periods without recalling
I	the Upgraders to the skilled trades jobs from which
'	they had been reduced; and that in certain instances
skilled trades employees were permanently laid-off i	and new work which they had historically performed
I	was contracted out for extended periods, instead of
1	recalling these employees to their jabs.
1	The essential elements in the complaints registered
by the Union went to the question of job security.
i	During the current National Negotiations, the parties
I	reviewed the competitive advantage of Delphi
I	Corporation talented skilled trades workforce.

AppsrUlx B
Jab Security - Contracting Out of Mfodt
Discussed were the Union's concerns for the integrity of the apprenticeable trades, the job security of the skilled trades workforce, the content of skilled trades work assignments, and the status of work functions historically performed by the bargaining unit.
At times it is not practicable for the Corporation to do the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve the right to decide whether it will do particular maintenance, tool and die and engineering skilled trades work, or contract it out. The Union recognizes ______that in making,such decisions.the Corporation must—	1 consider, among other things, the efficiencies and economies involved, the need for specialized tools and equipment, special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model change and plant rearrangement deadlines.
In our discussions we agreed that employees' jobs should not be eliminated by reason of a practice of contracting out, and we agreed that existing employment opportunities of seniority employees should not be unnecessarily reduced by reason of management contracting out work. The Corporation, moreover, states that it is its policy to fully utilize its seniority employees, under circumstances in which it is reasonable and practicable to do so, in the performance of work which they have historically ’ • performed to produce its product and perform its services.	’
While Delphi intends to provide this opportunity to its skilled trades workforce, the parties agreed that prolonged schedules Involving substantial overtime were not in the best interest of employees or the Corporation and, as a result, Delphi must consider the availability of its skilled workforce when scheduling potential overtime. The parties are expected to work out acceptable means by which Management will have reliable information as to the	.
hours employees will work when planning such work	.
schedules.	1
Accordingly, the Corporation states that it will make a reasonable effort to avoid contracting out work

■ requires mutual respect and recognition of each others problems and concerns. Accordingly, in addition to the Local JOBS Committee’s responsibilities for the JOBS Program and participation in discussions provided in related Letters of Understanding, each committee will focus on cooperative efforts toward our common goal to improve the effectiveness of operations and remove barriers to improvements, increase job opportunities and fully utilize the workforce. The local committees will jointly develop a plan through an exhaustive analysis of the location’s operational efficiency.
Within six months of the effective date ofthe ’ Agreement, each Local JOBS Committee will review with Divisional Management and the International Union the overall competitiveness of the location’s products and their plans indicating actions, and/or changes needed to improve quality and efficiency at their location and to stimulate job security of the existing workforce and attract new work. Such plans must then be approved by the established National Job Security and Operational Effectiveness Committee.

APPENDIX F SOURCING
During these negotiations, the Union raised numerous concerns about the Corporation’s sourcing actions and the impact on employment opportunities. To that end, the Corporation will work with and assist the Union at both the Local and International levels to preserve jobs, johtly. define, and expand the roles and responsibility of ■ the fobs Preservation Committee, replace jobs which may be lost by outsourcing action, and to create jobs for Protected employees and laid-off employees. It is an objective of the Corporation to grow the business and to continue to rely upon its employees and facilities as die source of its products. During the life of the current Agreement, the Corporation will advise the Chairman of the IUE-CWA Automotive Conference Board, of the Labor Policy Board meeting results relative to sourcing recommendations, including the number of potential jobs affected. Additionally, data regarding incoming and outgoing work will be given to the International Union in a quarterly meeting. In this manner,, the parties can judge the success of mutual efforts toward improved job security. The Corporation agrees to incorporate the procedures and structure outlined herein when making sourcing determinations during the current Agreement.
The rationale for sourcing actions will consider the criteria of quality, technology, cost, timing, statutory requirements, occupational and related environmental health and safety issues, the impact on long-term job stability, the degree to which the Corporation's resources can be allocated to further capital expenditures, the overall financial stability of affected facilities, and the impact on related facilities. Other factors considered by the Corporation before a final sourcing decision is made will include the effect on employment, and job and income security costs, on both
175

a short and long-term basis. Such criteria shall give equal weight to the full impact of a sourcing action on Delphi-IUE-CWA represented employment levels and the job and income security of Delphi-IUE-CWA represented employees. The National parties will jointly further develop the above criteria, to be used to address sourcing issues. In developing this criteria transfer pricing profits will not be considered in making sourcing decisions. Only appropriate return on_ investment.and-burden-wil Ubc'coiisi’dcfcd. The International Union and where appropriate the Local Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information, that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and contemplated sourcing. The Union agrees to keep all such information confidential until the Corporation consents to its release. Further, in this regard, the plant Chairperson will designate in writing those Union representatives who will have access to the quote package and related information,
If the Local Committee cannot resolve a sourcing issue, it may file a grievance at the appeal step of the grievance procedure. In addition, the following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of IUE-CWA members:
1, Insourcing
The Local JOBS Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Committee identifies as that which might be performed competitively within the location based on the criteria outlined above. To assist in this process, upon request the International Union will be furnished a complete master file of commodities which will be used to generate a list of parts similar to those currently manufactured at the location that
176
Appendix F
Sourcing
have been (1) outsourced from that location or (2) are currently manufactured by non-Ddphi;IUE^3!& suppliers for Delphi Corporation. This list will be updated and expanded to include supplier expiration dates, supplier location (city and state), annual volume, and Union affiliation, if known and will be famished quarterly or as otherwise agreed to by Che National Parties. Thereafter, the parties will initiate efforts to insource particular work consistent with the aforementioned criteria to create prospects for growth and to provide jobs for Protected employees and employees on layoff.
If it is established that certain work can be performed competitively judged by the above criteria, management will adopt the Committee’s proposal and barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approval or ratification within 30 days of the decision to bring the work in-house.

When die quoting process begins, the local Union at the affected location(s) will review and have access to the entire request for quotation package for this . work along with cost book information.- Upon receipt of this package at the plant, the Chairperson and the Personnel Director will indicate on the accompanying notice (Notice of Potential Outsourcing) that the information has been received. This notice will include a description of the work involved and will be mailed to the Chairman of the IUE-CWA-Automotive •Conference Board, and the Executive Director, Industrial ^Relations,, Delphi Corporation.
Following receipt of the request for quotation package (or in the infrequent instances where a quote package is not utilized), the local parties will have the opportunity to jointly develop a plan to perform the work competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix. The local Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness arid the potential sourcing action. Prior to submission of the initial quote response, the information contain cd therein will be reviewed by the local parties.	■
At the close of the quoting process, the local parties

will be advised in writing of the most favorable quote response which best meets customer requirements and the terms and conditions contained therein. If this quote response is other than the one submitted by the affected location(s), a written notice will be issued to the Chairperson which includes the reason for the potential outsourcing, the quote price from the affected location, if applicable, the terms and conditions of the most favorable quote response, the potential jobs impact, and the anticipated impact date. Thereafter, the local parties will be given an additional 30 days, or longer when possible, to meet the terms and conditions of the quote response referenced above. A copy of this notice will be sent to the Executive Director, Industrial Relations, Delphi Corporation, and the Chairman of the 1UE-CWA Automotive Conference Board.
Additionally, International Union and local union input will be sought by the Corporation and its Divisions as early as possible in the outsourcing decision-making process to allow for more thorough discussion and to permit the parties to better assess the impact of outsourcing on the long-term job stability of employees and the financial viability of given Corporate locations.
The Corporation agrees not to use the results of such discussions lo obtain more attractive gopnacL tepns from outside suppliers in lieu of keeping the work in-hous&
The sourcing authority will not enter into a contractual relationship with a non-Delphi;lUE; CWA supplier until such time as the designated management representative of the impacted location provides written verification that the above notification procedure and discussion by the JOBS Committee, has taken place.

Interpretation of the Time and One-Half Provisions of the National Agreement - Paragraph (52)(a) (Special Case Caused by Short Shift)
In the event an employee works more than eight consecutive straight time hours on a shift (exclusive of an unpaid lunch period) under circumstances where the present daily overtime provisions and interpretations —would make-the time-worked in excess of eight hours on-that shift payable at straight time, such time worked in excess of eight hours on that shift will be paid for at time and one-half. Any such time worked and paid at time and one-half instead of straight time, will be considered as having been paid at straight time for purposes of computing daily overtime within the 24-hour cycle in which such time worked occurs.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH AND SAFETY
The Corporation recognizes its obligation to provide a safe and healthful working environment for employees. We are committed to protecting the Health and Safety of each employee as the overriding priority of this Corporation. The implementation of actions to help our employees realize a healthy, injury-free environment is a leadership responsibility. The Union will cooperate with the Corporation’s efforts to fulfill its obligations. To implement and coordinate these principles, a National Joint Health and Safety Committee and Local Joint Health and Safety Committees have been formed, trained and empowered to function dealing with a broad range of the subject matter. Included in Attachment "A” to the Memorandum of Understanding Health and Safety is a Review Board process designed to enhance Health and Safety awareness and compliance across Delphi Corporation operating divisions. The parties continue to recognize their roles and responsibilities, for assuring that all Delphi Corporation employees have safe and healthy work environments. The function of the Joint Committees should be technically constructive, cooperative, advisory and problem resolution oriented. As a result of this Memorandum of Understanding, the Union has agreed that it will encourage its members to utilize the internal resolution mechanisms as the means to resolve complaints regarding health and safety matters.	,
The parties recognize that a joint commitment must be directed toward achieving a safe and healthy work place. Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of the National Joint Committee, as the mechanism, to guide in an appropriate direction.

JOBS PROGRAM -VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS
DELPHI CORPORATION
November 16.2003
Me, James D. Clark Chairman IUE-CWA Automotive Conference Board 2360 W. Dorothy Lane Suite 201
Dayion, OH 45439
Dear Mr, Clark:
Subject: JOBS Program - Volume Related Layoffs
During the course of these negotiations, the Corporation and Union have provided Delphi Corporation employees with substantially increased job security through the new JOBS Program, which protects eligible employees against layoff for virtually any reason except volume related market conditions. The parties recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry. The Corporation acknowledges, however, the importance of minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume related declines are unavoidable.
In any event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in line with local seniority agreements and, if otherwise eligible, receive benefit treatment in accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the current Delphi-tUE-CWA Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Identifying the complex inter-relationships of all the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a difficult task. The parties agreed, however, that for purposes ot .determining JOBS protections they must identify just those volume declines that are attributable to market related conditions, and in turn just those declines that are not affected by Corporation sourcing choices of components that compete with or act as replacements for components produced by Delphi Corporation employees covered by this Collective Bargaining
223
Doc, No, 4
JOBS PROGRAM -VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS
Agreement. In other words, volume declines that are attributable to the Corporation's production and purchase arrangements with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, captives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.) would be considered an exception to the overall volume related exclusion in Section 1(C) of the JOBS Program.	.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that the Corporation provide Local JOBS Committees adequate notice of any impending volume-related layoff, as well as all information necessary to fully evaluateits underlying causes,, the extent, to which--------
such decline is associated with a Corporate sourcing action and the appropriate number of eligible employees that should be affected by the layoff-
The Corporation recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context of the protections spelled out in the JOBS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Corporation also acceptsthe responsibility of proving that the proper number of employees are recalled when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the JOBS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.
The following are to be considered as illustrations to assist the parties in determining when volume related :	■
declines support reductions in employment. These illustrations should not be considered all inclusive.
* Market Related Conditions - Included in this category is customer preference of one product over another that might result in a decline in sales of a U.S.-built Delphi Corporation product that requires the layoff of employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of increased sales or increased market share of competitive captive ' imports or joint venture products or any other product sold in the U.S. by Delphi Corporation hut not	~
produced in an iUE-C WA-Delph i Corporation plant.
— Example of Market Related Conditions	■
(1)	There is a decline in economic activity which
224
Doc. NO. 4
JOBS PROGRAM -VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS
depresses retail sales of lUE-CWA-Delnhi Corporation products. Lower production levels require the layoff of employees. Plant A, employing 4,100 JOBS-eligible employees, is the sole source of Product Z for the U.S. market; it is required to layoff one shift, or 2,000 employees. The plant's number of JOBS eligible employees at the plant remains at 4,100, including 2,000 laid-off employees.
While the plant is down to one shift, the Corporation decides to outsource Product X, which reduces employment requirements by 250 employees per shift. Two hundred fifty (250) employees are placed on Protected
‘ employee status,
U.S. demand picks up to pre-layoff levels and the second shift is called back. Active employment at the plant goes back to 4,100.
As the second shift is called back and the plant is back to pre-downtum production levels, an additional 250 employees are placed on Protected employee status which now leaves a total of SOO employees.
(2)	Plant B (5,000 JOBS eligible employees) is not the sole source of Product Y, which is also produced in Canada far the U.S. market, in Plant BC. Plant BC supplies one-fourth of the U.S. demand for Product Y. An economic downturn in the U.S. reduces demand for Product Y by 160,000. In accordance with JOBS guidelines, volume related employment reductions cannot exceed Plant B's share of pre-downtum volume levels (three-fourths) applied to the reduced level of overall sales. Production in Plant B is therefore reduced by no more than 120,000 units, causing layoffs of 2,000 workers. Plant B's number of JOBS-eligible employees remains at 5,000, including 2,000 open Bank positions.
Product Y demand in the U.S. market picks up by 60,000. The Corporation decides to produce
225
Doc. No. 4
JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS
30,000 of those units in Plant B and the rest in Canadian Ptant EC. The increase in production is not accomplished in proportion to pre-layoif production shares; to comply with the Job Security Program, the Corporation must recall 250 employees which it assigns to Protected employee status in addition to the 500 employees required for the pick up in production.
■ Product Discontinuance - Because of the introduction of a new U.S.-built Delphi Corporation product or a nonrallied company"product not sold by Delphi Corporation, sales of another Delphi Corporation manufactured product may decline, and production of the latter product must be curtailed necessitating reductions in employment- Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(C) of the Program.
— Examples of Product Discontinuance or Phase Out and Changes in Customer Preference
(1)	A new U.S.-built Delphi Corporation product (or any other new nan-allied company product which is not marketed by the Corporation) is introduced. Sales of Product X decline by 50%, and production must be curtailed. The
. necessary reductions in employment are made through layoffs, keeping the number of JOBS-eligible employees at the product plant at the same level.
(2)	Battery Plant C, employing 1,400 JOBS-eligible people, produced half of the batteries for Vehicle X: the other half are produced at a Corporate plant in Mexico. The volume reduction is made totally at Plant C rather than split proportionately between Plant C and the plant in Mexico. Therefore, in accordance with the JOBS guidelines half of . the 700 employees who are not required any longer in Plant C due to this event are assigned to Protected employee status, and the other 350 employees would be laid-off. The number of JOBS-eligible employees at
226
Doc. NO. 4
JOBS PROGRAM -VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS
Plant C remains at MOO, including 350 open volume related positions.
•	Faulty Product - Vehicle line volume may decline because of faulty parts in a vehicle that cause customers to place the product in disfavor. Related Delphi Corporation product volume may also decline. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(C) of the Program.
*	Changes in Customer Preference - Delphi Corporation volume may decline because of customer preference shifts ■ in turn affecting mix and therefore demand, e.g., small car preference shifts to large car; option preference swings; high product content to low product content. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(C) of the Program.
•	Non- Delphi Corporation Commercial Customer Preference - Cancellation or declines in product volume for Delphi Corporation manufactured parts that are sold to unrelated firms may cause volume changes. Such volume reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(C) of the Program. '
— Examples of Non- Delphi Corporation Commercial Customer Preference
Plant A produces heavy duty cranking motors for off the road construction equipment. Volume is reduced as a result of a decline in the construction industry. One hundred fifty (150) lOBS-eligible employees are laid-off; these 150 employees have Job Security Protection.
At the time production is back to pre-layoff levels the Corporation introduces two robots which replace 25 employees. According to JOSS guidelines all of the 150 employees are recalled from layoff. 25 of them are assigned to Protected employee status, and the number of IOBS-eligible employees number remains equal to its pre-layoff level.
227

JOBS PROGRAM ■ VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS
• Non- Delphi Corporation Produced Products - li sales of a new or replacement product manufactured by an allied company for Delphi Corporation, that competes with a product manufactured by the Corporation, results in reduced sales of the Corporation-manufactured product, the action would not be volume related and layoffs under Paragraph 1(C) of the Program would not be permitted.
— Example of Non- Delphi Corporation -Manufactured Products
The Cdfpdratidh^dutsdurces'dproduct’tKat'it'' markets in competition with Product W manufactured by IUE-CWA Delphi Corporation employees. This results in reduced sales of Product W, Employment requirements are reduced, but this event is not covered under Paragraph KC) of the JOBS Program and layoffs are not permitted. This protection also extends to employees producing HJE-C WA-Delphi components which are manufactured for Product W.
* Components or Materials
It is recognized that reductions in vehicle production will often be accompanied by reductions in component production. When reductions in vehicle production are volume related, pro-rata reductions in component production will normally be considered volume related as well. However, to the extent a reduction in component production results from a shift in sales to products sold by Delphi Corporation but not produced in IUE-C WA-Delohi Corporation plants, the reduction will not be considered volume related. Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dual-sourced from an lUE-CWA-Delnhi Corporation and a non-IUE-fflffl&zDelphi Corporation plant, production declines at the HJE-CWA-Delnhi Corporation plant will only be considered volume-related to the extent the dual-sourced component produced at that plant continues to be produced in its pre-production decline proportion.

JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS
— Examples:
(1)	Plant A receives regular automotive batteries from an IUE-CWA-Delphi Corporation plant anti heavy duty batteries from a non-IUE-CWA-Delphi Corporation plant. A volume decline occurs tn regular automotive batteries because of customer preference for heavy duty batteries. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under the Program but would not have to be taken proportionately because the batteries would not be considered like or similar components.
(2)	Plant B receives regular batteries that have plastic fastening brackets from an 1UE-CWA-Delphi Corporation plant and regular batteries that have steel fastening brackets from a non-IUE^QJKfi;Delphi Corporation ,	plant. The batteries are used interchangeably
and would be considered like or similar
.	components. Therefore, any volume declines
1	in battery production would have to be taken
■	proportionately to be considered volume
related.
1	As implied by these examples, there are many
1	variations to be considered when determining volume
'	actions. This letter is intended to provide a framework
.	within which Local and National JOBS Committees may
।	review the applicability of Paragraph 1(C) to volume
i	reductions.
l	If a Local JOBS Committee cannot agree on a situation
I	being defined as volume related, the matter may be
'	appealed to the National JOBS Committee for resolution.

During these negotiations, the IUE-CWA stated its interest in having the Corporation continue to recognise the importance of using suppliers which are good corporate citizens and which can be relied upon far quality products and reliable delivery. The IUE-CWA further pointed out that the Corporation's selection of and relationship with suppliers have a significant bearing on its relationship with the Union, In this regard, the Union stressed repeatedly the importance of	'
the Corporation's use of high quality, reliable suppliers which maintain good, fair and equitable relations with their employees, qgd which satisfy, the Corporqtlog's need fora continuous, reliable, and cost-effective supply ol quality parts and-materials.	''
Delphi Corporation fully understands the Union's concerns in these matters, because quality products, uninterrupted delivery and good corporate citizenship -by the Corporation and its suppliers - contribute significantly to the Corporation's success in the marketplace, and ail of these factors have a direct bearing on the job and income security of IUEd*Wfl members.

SUPPLIER CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
Delphi Corporation agrees thal its relationship with the Union is of paramount importance to the Corporation's long-term success. The Corporation has told its suppliers and the business community in the past of the positive aspects of its relationship with the IUE-CWA and will continue to do so in the future. Delphi Corporation, therefore, has no interest in embarking on a purchasing strategy that would detract from that relationship.	.	•
Correspondingly, the Union has, from time to time, expressed to the Corporation its concern about certain aspects of the Corporation's relationship with particular suppliers in the area of quality, continuity of supply, and overall performance as a supplier including the maintenance of good relations by the supplier with its employees. The Union recognizes that the Corporation has expressed its views and made suggestions to its suppliers as a result of ihe Union's concerns, all within the bounds of applicable legal principles.
The parties recognize that instances in which these matters arise are inherently dependent upon the particular facts that are present in each situation and plan to continue to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis as they have in the past, and in compliance with applicable laws.
In particular, the Corporation will continue to urge its suppliers to treat their employees in a good, fair and equitable manner to provide them wages and benefits competitive within their industry to provide a safe workplace and to avoid conduct which violates national ar state labor and employment laws. In addition, the Corporation will, in a manner which is in compliance with applicable laws, notify suppliers of the importance the Corporation places on harmonious relationships between suppliers, their employees and any union that may represent them.
The Corporation will send or transmit to each of its current suppliers a letter, in the form attached-hereto (ihe "Lettgf), withip 60-jgys after the elective date of the National Agreement, and, upon request of the Union. the Corporation wjjl re-§end thg attached letter withip

Form o1 Letter to beSent to Suppliers
This letter will describe some aspects of Delphi's policy on supplier selectiop.
The Corporation's decision to select op remove a particular supplier is based on numerous criteria, applied in conformance with legal requirements. Delphi Corporation recognizes the! it is in the mutual interests of employer? and their employees for the employer to fully respect the right of the employees to representation by a union. It is. however, definitely not Delphi's policy or practice to rempve a product from a supplier if that supplier's employees have chosen to ioin the IUE-CWA.
As you know. Delphi has.a positive and constructive relationship with the IUE-CWA. and we encourage our . Supplier? to strive for similarly constructive relationships with their employees or representatives of their employees. Our joint programs.have allowed us to make significant Approvements in areas such as Health and Safety. Quality and tjie implementation of lean manufacturing utilizing the tools of our OualitviNetworic Process. We respect the IUE-CWA and the IUE-CWA respects us.
Delphi alsanotes that many of our supplier facilities have recognized the IUE-CWA based on ashowing of a majority support among employees by means of a "card check" certified bv a neutral third party. Delphi fully approves ofjdecisions bv our suppliers to use such peaceful means of determining employee sentiment.
Should you have any question? with respect to this matter, please call.

____DearMr. .Clark:,	.------------- ■
During these negotiations we have explored at length methods to preserve and increase the job opportunities of our employees — your members. Further, we have mutually recognized that the best potential for increased job opportunities is a growing and thriving Corporation iully competitive in all aspects ai its business.
During the discussions and in response to your concerns regarding the outsourcing of IUE-CWA work, a new sourcing letter has been submitted providing a mechanism for meaningful advance Union involvement so that the plant, division, or Corporate sourcing authority may objectively consider the Union's input., The Job Security (JOBS) Program provides job security unmatched in American industry.
The major concern addressed by both the sourcing letter and the JOBS program is the retention of IUE-CWA jobs within the Corporation. The entire issue of job security, however, is broader than the continuation by the Corporation of its cunent business activities. The JOBS Program recognizes that long-range jab security must include opportunities in our traditional and non-traditional businesses, providing jobs for our current employees and future job entrants.
The challenge to the parties is a serious one, requiring the full range of all of our talent, experience and

imagination. To enhance opportunities for employment growth, the parlies agree the Growth and Opportunity Committee will be continued during the term of the current Agreement. This Committee is charged with pursuing opportunities in traditional and non-traditional business areas with an overall view toward providing new fobs not currently included in the scape of Delphi Corporation operations. Each feature ol the total business opportunity must be examined including I) the market for the product to be produced. 2)	'
expenditures that are required for equipment or tooling, 3) the cost of any plant modernization or rearrangement, including additions to an existing facility, 4) the availability of the necessary technology, 5) the Lease or purchase of a new facility. 6) characteristics of the business including material, capital funds, and wage and benefit levels of other employers in the industry in which the new business will compete, 7) the nature of bargaining agreements needed to assure the new business is competitive, and B) the expected return on investment relative to the standard in the industry in which the new venture would compete.
In analyzing the feasibility of entering into new business ventures the parties have agreed to call upon the full extent of Corporate and Union resources. As an indication of the seriousness of its commitment to employment growth through business diversification into traditional and non-traditional areas, the Corporation will make available up to $5,295,000 of funding to provide for this program during the term of the current Agreement. However, should the Growth and Opportunity Committee recommend new business funding in excess ol this amount, the Corporation agrees to review such requests in accordance with the guidelines of this Document No. 6. These funds will be available for investment in new business ventures including, as appropriate, the establishment of separate Corporate organizational structures.
Investment funds will be released on an "as required" basis. Only those ventures receiving concept approval and initial funding prior to the expiration oi the cunent
235
Doc. No. 6
GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY COMMITTEE
Agreement will be considered as firm commitments by the Corporation. Accounting for fund expenditures will be the responsibility of the Growth and Opportunity Committee.
This new program will be administered by the Growth and Opportunity Committee. This Committee will be comprised of equal numbers of Corporate and Delphi-IUE-CWA representatives with multidisciplinary backgrounds. It will be the responsibility of the Committee to make recommendations to the Corporation and Union for concept approval and to request new venture funding from the Corporation for “business opportunities deemed’to be consistent with employment growth objectives of the program.
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will be responsible to: 1) communicate to divisional and local managements and to regional and local union representatives the full scope of this new business concept, 2) review and study the feasibility of proposals made by local JOBS Committees regarding entry into new business ventures, 31 initiate studies necessary for a complete examination of new business ventures proposed locally or by the Committee, 4) report back, where appropriate, to the local JOBS Committee its findings and recommendations regarding a proposed new business venture, and 5) devise means of encouraging the entire organization, hourly and ' ” salaried, to participate in bringing new competitive business into the Corporation and creating new jobs.
Contingent upon the business climate and market proximity, we have agreed to pay particular attention to communities afiected by the loss of Delnhi-IUE-CWA employment opportunities. Accordingly, any newly created business venture developed through the efforts of the Growth and Opportunity Committee will be expected to provide opportunities for new employees, with preferential consideration given to IUE-CWA represented employees laid-off from or working at Corporation facilities. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, the Corporation or other employer will recognize the IUE;CWAas the representative of the hourly

employees working at businesses developed through the Growth and Opportunity Committee tor the purpose of collective bargaining. In this regard, the parties recognize the need to develop innovative approaches to labor relations and commit to negotiating new collective bargaining agreements for each venture.
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will report periodically to the appropriate Delphi Corporation Executives and International Union IUE-CWA on their progress in identifying and developing viable opportunities for employment growth.
The approach to job security and new business opportunity reflected in this agreement requires a relationship typified by trust and the mutual willingness to take risks in return for economic rewards and job opportunities. Our enthusiasm to search for -new business must be shared by divisional and local managements and by regional and local union representatives.
The success of this joint activity will be measured based upon results. A high level of commitment will be required from all parties to enhance the potential for success. The commitment of a full-time effort to seek new employment opportunities should improve the overall effectiveness of the program.

3.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is S, followed by zeros, the preceding digit is increased by one if It is odd and remains unchanged if it is even.

Subject; Compliance with the Family and Medical ’ Leave Actof 1993 -	.
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) ol 1993. The Corporation assured the Union that it will comply with the provisions of the FMLA.
As part oi its compliance, the Corporation has established a category of unpaid leave called "FMLA Leave/ la some instances, FMLA Leaves will be concurrent with leaves of absence covered by the National Agreement. Accordingly, in those cases where the employee is eligible far leave under the National Agreement and the leave also qualifies under the FMLA, the Corporation intends to comply with the requirements of the FMLA as well as the separate provisions of the National Agreement regarding covered leaves of absence.
Pursuant to the Corporation's present plan for compliance with the FMLA, the Corporation's rights under the Act will be modified to:
• Provide that an employee on FMLA Leave will continue to accumulate seniority in the same manner as an employee on a Personal Leave of Absence;

Dear Mr. Clark:
During the course of the cunent negotiations. Delphi Corporation and the International Union, IUE-CWA reaffirmed the matter of the Corporation's letter of November 26,1973, regarding the National and Local Human Relations Committees. In line with that letter, the parties have agreed to the following:
For many years the Corporation and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and ellectuating policies against discrimination because of age, race, color, sex. religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation and sexual harassment and to this end the parties have „ ; expressly incorporated Paragraph (5a) in their National Agreement that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Delphi Corporation and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violations of that principle.
The parties recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (1) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive method for prompt resolution of all contractual claims of violations of Paragraph (5a), (2) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (3) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights

Dear Mr, Clark:
During the past several years, the Corporation in cooperation with IUE-CWA leadership, together with the men and women of Delphi Corporation have worked together in a spirit of teamwork to improve product quality This spirit of cooperation has resulted in substantial improvement in the quality of the Corporation's products and services.
Further, the parties recognize that the production of the highest quality, customer-valued products is essential to secure the Corporation's position in the global markets and assure jab security. The Corporation stated that high quality, customer-valued products result from a company-wide fully integrated total quality process and are essential to Delphi Corporation if it is to achieve its vision of being "Recognized By Our Customers as Their Best Supplier!" Delphi's process for total quality management is the Quality Network. This jointly developed quality improvement process emphasizes customer enthusiasm, continuous quality improvement and the elimination of waste in the design, engineering, manufacturing and delivery of all products and services which serves to enhance job security for all employees.
261
Doc. No. 20
QUALITY COMMITMENT
Although management has the ultimate responsibility for the Quality Network, it is recognized that IUE-CWA leaders and members are valuable partners in the implementation and continual improvement of this process. During discussions, the parlies restated their commitment to the Quality Network process. Such commitment is reflected in the extensive efforts both . parlies have devoted to the subject of quality, both on .the national and local levels, and is exemplified by the—	~l~
institution of the Quality Forum and plant quality councils.
It is also recognized that the point where product design, technology, process and materials come together and must work in harmony is at the worker/supervisor level in the organization. High quality products result from well-managed processes that motivate employees to work together in a spirit of teamwork to continuously improve customer enthusiasm. In this process, it is recognized that seeking opportunities for continually improving product quality must be the foundation for customer enthusiasm. It is acknowledged that it is ultimately management's responsibility to establish and assure product quality. : . . . ■ requirements and provide the processes for continual quality improvement that support all employees and are based on the Beliefs and Values, as recorded in the Delphi Business System Policy Manual referenced as "Quality Network" (revised G/l/03k This manual outlines specific policies to be followed throughout Delphi Corporation and states in part:
"The Quality Network is a process for running Ihg business based uponioinlly developed tools, techniques, beliefs and vglugs to achieve customer enthusiasm through people, teamwork and continuous quality improvement.*

Dear Mr. Clark;
During the cunent negotiations, Delphi Corporation and the IUE-CWA reaffirmed the necessity of providing active and laid-off employees the means to obtain additional education and training in order to enhance their opportunities within Delphi Corporation ar to reenter the workforce. Accordingly, the parties agree to continue the Individual Upward Educational Plan (IUEP). The Plan is designed to help employees:
•	who are laid-off. jipprove their chances for re-emplovtn ent:
•	or whojare active, enhance their opportunities for advancement.
Under this Plan, qualified employees who wish to pursue a formal degree ar to improve their job skills are able to receive a defined level of assistance in the form of up-front payments to specified licensed or accredited schools.
Additionally, the spouse or dependent children of a deceased, active employee will be entitled to utilize the remaining balance of the employee's current year's Individual Upward Educational Plan assistance eligibility (excluding any advance payment) for college or educational pursuits during a period equal to the length of the present Agreement following the date of the employee's death, furthermore, the spouse of a deceased active employee a«ry necqivq g onq-tim& payment, up to a	of &300 of the remaining

The benefit is not to exceed the maximum annual benefit allowed each year following the employee's date of death.
it shall be the responsibility of the National Joint Skill Development and Training Committee to develop such a Plan along with guidelines that include, but ate not liatited to, such elements as initial and continuing eligibility, course degree and school approval, level of assistance for qualified workers, and the application and approval process.	,
As specified in the IUEP Administrative Guidelines, the maximum total assistance per qualified active' employee per calendar year is $4.600. of which $100-00 may be used tor the purchase of books, for courses leading to a formal degree and $2^00 for job-related, high school equivalency and literacy courses.
Employees enrolled in college degree programs through accredited institutions, who exhaust their current year IUEP assistance eligibility, may utilize up to $1,000 of tbe following year's eligibility to cover the present or next semester eligible expenses. This advance payment is provided only in conjunction with courses offered at regionally accredited colleges or universities on a semester or quarterly basis and is not available for job related, high school equivalency and literacy courses. Advance payment of up to $1,000 will occur automatically when the employee's request for IUEP assistance exceeds the cunent year eligibility.
Advance payment is not available in the last calendar year of the Agreement and does not expand total IUEP assistance eligibility over the life of the present Agreement

Dayton, OH 45439
Dear Mr. Clark:
The parties have long recognized the importance of providing orientation programs for new employees. Many of these programs resulted from the diligent efforts of plant employee groups and have addressed such topics as quality, teamwork, safety, and joint programs in addition to those items new employees must know to perform their jobs.
Men and women enter the workforce today with little or no knowledge of what is expected of them as employees and as union members in a unionized, industrial plant community. Many of them have not -been adequately prepared to cope with industrial situations in which they suddenly find themselves.
New employees come to Delphi Corporation with little or at best incomplete information about their employer and their Union. They have little knowledge of the extensive economic benefits available to them as agreed upon in collective bargaining between the lUE^ CWA and Delphi Corporation over a period of more than thirty years.
Many new employees may be unaware of the commitment of Delphi and the IUE_-CWA to fair employment practices and to the application of the	,
National Agreement to all employees without regard to age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation. They are not familiar with basic	,
contract provisions covering such subjects as transfers,	।
i

ORIENTATION PROGRAM
promotions, shift preference and seniority. They may be unaware of the opportunities for advancement to highly paid skilled trades jobs through the Apprentice Upgrading and Trainee programs. They tend to be unfamiliar with the obligations of the employees to their job, to the union and to their employer. Many are unaware of the importance of regular attendance, quality workmanship and the need for cooperation by all in getting the job done. Too often they are ' unacquainted with the various procedural matters related to their jobs and their relationship to their union and their employer.	’
New employees usually have little knowledge of the long history of the IUE-CWA and of the administrative structure of the IUE-CWA at the International and local union levels. They do not understand about their relationship to the Union, about the initiation fees and dues requirements and their rights within the union contained in the IUE-CWA Constitution.
Frequently, they have never seen the inside of a manufacturing plant before and are unfamiliar with the operations, the nature of the product and how it is used.
t	You have underscored these realistic considerations in
our discussions. You have indicated that this may
.	explain to some extent the high turnover and
absenteeism being experienced in industry today
1	among the new workforce. And you have suggested
;	that a properly developed and conducted orientation
*	procedure designed to create an "awareness bi the
'	dynamics of the labor-management relationship, and
the years of long effort to build a community of interest
।	in resolving labor-management problems through
I	orderly procedures..." might serve the best interest of
,	the employees, the TUE-CWA and Delphi Corporation.
।	Accordingly, pursuant to the Union's suggestion, the
I	Corporation has, in cooperation with the International
i	Union, developed a joint pilot orientation program to be
I	presented to new jobapplicants prior to the time they
start their jobs.
287
ttoc.No.22
ORIENTATION PROGRAM
The content ci the orientation program was developed by the Corporation and the International Union and implemented on a pilot basis in Packard Electric . System Division where significant numbers of new employees were being hired. This experience has formed the basis for the adoption and implementation of a program at ail other plants where a sufficient number of new employees are being hired to_warrant    ~ ,— such a programs------------	.
The Corporation and the International Union shall continue to determine how the various portions of the 1 orientation program are implemented. Some subjects might most appropriately be presented by a Management representative, some by a Union representative, and others by both Management and Union representatives.
The orientation program is not subject to the grievance procedure and may be terminated at any plant by either the International Union or the Corporation, in the event that the program at that plant is not being carried on in a manner consistent with the purpose and intent of the program as established by the national parties. The _ _ joint Orientation Program will be limited to those subjects agreed to by the Corporation and the International Union and the establishment of such a program will not limit any other communication by	-
Management with its employees or by the Union with its members.
The Corporation and the International Union will commence development of an orientation program at all Delphi Corporation plants where a sufficient number of employees are being hired to warrant such a program in accordance with the understanding expressed in this letter.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Delphi Corporation and the International Union express their determination to work jointly with personal problems including substance abuse and mental health among Delphi workers and their families.
Alcoholism and drug dependency is recognized by medical, public health authorities, Delphi Corporation and the IUE-CWA as a disease. These diseases can impair workers' ability to function in their lives and on their jobs. Alcoholism and drug dependency as well as other persona) problems contribute to increased absenteeism and tardiness and deterioration of job performance. This in turn disrupts work schedules with consequent dissatisfaction among the majority of workers who are sincerely trying to do conscientious jobs. The combination of factors is recognized as having a potentially damaging effect on plant efficiency and endangers the job security of the worker.
The causes of persona] problems including alcoholism, drug dependency and mental health are not well understood and cures are difficult Nonetheless, Delphi Corporation and the IUE-CWA believe that constructive measures are possible to deal with these problems which can be a major cause of family breakdown and are related to personal breakdown and violence in the community.
Delphi Corporation and the International Union agree that the Delphi-IUE-CWA Employee Assistance Program should be used to provide all EAP services for all lUE-CWA-represented employees.

i the purpose of this program is designed to help prevent । the development of personal problems and provide____________
'__—access - for- treatmen t=and- after care" for’those'a) ready
affected.
Delphi Corporation and the International Union acknowledge that neither local management nor the local union working alone can always provide the level of motivation required by employees experiencing personal problems. As a result, joint efforts are imperative in encouraging the employee to seek EAP services, as needed, to respond successfully to treatment, and to maintain a resolve to avoid further personal problems. . -
II.	Guidelines for Administration
Delphi Corporation and the International Union will . engage in a cooperative effort and function administratively'in consulting with and seeking the cooperation of local management and local union personnel. In this regard it is important to:
1.	Generate a climate at the plant level which will eliminate the effects of the social stigma associated with mental disorders, alcoholism and drug dependency and other personal problems, which act as a barrier to employees seeking help to resolve personal problems; .	■ . . . • .
2.	Insist that local management and the local union at all levels exercise their best efforts toward the objective of earlier identification and motivation of the employee to accept EAP services;

It will be the responsibility ofthis Committee to review on a periodic basis the local Employee Assistance Program.
Delphi Corporation and the International Union will designate representatives of local management and representatives of the local union to work jointly on these problems. Among the responsibilities of the local EAP team are:
I.	In cooperation with the central review organization (CRO), the carrier and the local central diagnostic referral (CDR) agency, survey community resources to determine the availability of appropriate treatment facilities and the cost of treatment. Where facilities are inadequate or unavailable, undertake efforts to improve the situation. '
2.	Help employees understand that they may consult on a confidential basis with the Local EAP team, or an outside central diagnostic and referral (CDR) agency, concerning their problem.
3.	Arrange for the local union benefits representative to be available to explain to the employee and others who may be involved the extent to which recommended treatment qualifies for payment under the Delphi Health Care Program.
291
Doc. No. 23
EAP
4, Establish and maintain active aftercare and followup programs. Help employees understand the therapeutic benefits of self-help groups and engage EAP participants in these group activities.
Delphi Corporation and the International Union acknowledge that:
1.	Nothing in this statement is to be interpreted as constituting any waiver of management’s responsibility to, mainlain.discipline artheTigSfto invoke disciplinary measures in the case of misconduct which may result from or be associated with the use of alcohol or drugs or personal problems. The Union may exercise its right to process grievances concerning such matters in accordance with the Delphi- n JE-C WA National Agreement;
2.	During or following treatment the employee should not expect any special privileges or exemptions from standard personnel practices; and
3.	When a leave of absence is necessary so that an employee may undergo medical treatment for alcoholism or drug dependence or personal problems in or from an appropriate facility in accordance with this program, and when Che employee has voluntarily submitted to such treatment and provided the employee has unbroken seniority, a sick leave of absence will be granted pursuant to the National Agreement and the employee will be eligible for benefits in accordance with the Delphi Health Care and Life and Disability Benefits Insurance Programs as negotiated with the International Union.

EAR
highlights of those discussions and the commitments arrived at between the parties:
1.	A key ingredient in combating personal problems lies in education, early identification and early intervention. Accordingly, the National Parties with the assistance of the Joint Activities Center will develop an education and training program directed at all levels of local management, local union, and the workforce. Costs of these activities and the implementation of any recommendations will be funded by Joint Training Funds.
2,	The National Parties have developed standards for lUE-CEieDelphi Employee Assistance Programs,
3; The National Parties will continue efforts towards facilitating the professional development of individual plant EAP Representatives. In line with professional development, the parties commit to expand professional development efforts to include mandating certifications of future EAP Representatives.
V.	EAP Representation
1.	Employee Assistance Representatives will be scheduled to report for Employee Assistance representation purposes during overtime, part-time or temporary layoffs, or inventory when 50% or more of the people they represent on their shift are scheduled to work.
2.	During overtime hours, when less than fifty percent (50%) of the people they represent on their shift are scheduled to work, they will not ftinction pursuant io this Memorandum of Understanding, but will be scheduled to perform EAP activities if they would otherwise have work available in their equalization group.

VI. Drug Testing
Because of the recent emergence of a substantial body of legislation requiring drug testing of many of the Corporation's employees, both represented and nonrepresented, the parties have had extensive discussions surrounding drug testing and have agreed to the following:
1. All drug testing performed will be conducted in accord with appjicable. laws mandating or regulating =—’~Jsiich testing; such as, Federal Aviation
Administration, Department of Transportation, or Department of Defense.
Vtl. Conditions of Employment Guidelines * For those Employees in the Employee Assistance Program Whose Seniority has been Broken
When Employee Assistance Program participants or other employees suspected of being in need of EAP services return to work, the following can be agreed upon between the bargaining unit representative, Labor Relations, the EAP team and the employee.
The specific items to be included .will depend on the individual case and should be developed to meet the particular circumstances. Accordingly, items one through five may be recommended for inclusion in a condition of continued employment by the joint EAP team.
1.	Participation in in-plant self-help meetings. Length of participation that will be required and frequency of meetings can be either specified in advance or left up to the discretion of EAP team.
2.	Participation in outside self-help groups and mandatory completion of an aftercare plan which might include antabuse recommended by a treatment facility and monitored by the EAP team.
294
Doc. No. 23
EAP
3.	Mandatory cooperation in follow-up and monitoring for a period of time specified by EAP team members.
4.	Periodic scheduled urine screening when it is felt this procedure could be of value in monitoring and encouraging abstinence. In cases, of positive findings, the results must be confirmed by a second testing method.
5.	A specific period of total non-use of alcohol or other drugs can be agreed to between the parties. The EAP team and the employee must concur with this probationary period which is defined as not less than six months nor more than two years and it must be understood by all parties that resumed use could result in termination of employment during this period.
The above items (one through five) will be administered jointly by the EAP team for those employees returning under these conditions. Any conditions of continued employment agreed to by Management, the Union and the employee are considered contractually binding and non-compliance could result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The employee’s previous disciplinary record and action which may be taken for further misconduct will be matters reserved to the actual settlement of any grievance(s) involved and/or will be resolved between the bargaining unit representative and Labor Relations.
The seniority status of the employee must be specified as either a new hire or reinstatement of former seniority. If seniority is reinstated, all rights and privileges which would normally accrue in line with the reinstated

During the current negotiations, Delphi Corporation and the International Union again discussed at length problems encountered in the administration of Grievance Procedure at some locations. The parties reaffirmed their mutual determination that the purpose of the Agreement as stated in Paragraph (1} is "to provide orderly collective, bargaining relations between the Corporation and the Union, to secure a prompt and equitable disposition of grievances," In addition, the Union and the Corporation agreed that the delaying or holding of grievances at any step of the Grievance Procedure was contrary to the best interests of the employees and the parties. In this regard the parties emphasized that full ” " implementation of this document would result in the timely processing of continuing liability cases.
The parties reaffirmed their mutual desire and intention to assure that grievances will not be allowed to accumulate at any step or steps in tbe Grievance Procedure in any plant.
The Corporation asserted that the provisions of the Grievance Procedure, if closely administered, make it impossible for committeepersons unilaterally to stall any grievance from consideration or decision at the next step of the Grievance Procedure and to delay the processing of grievances in the procedure. The Corporation stated further that the current language provides Management with the right after a lapse of
300

a reasonable time to initiate answers to grievances in order to prevent them from being delayed at any step in the Grievance Procedure.

During the current negotiations the International Union, IUE-CWA. informed Delphi Corporation that the content of Homer C. Pierce's letter of November 16, 1970 regarding expeditious grievance handling was again being published as a position of the International Union, IUE-CWA.
During the 1970 negotiations, the Corporation complained that at certain locations some Committeepersons made little or no effort to resolve grievances they have written ar to process them from one step of the procedure to the next in an
. expeditious manner. The Union pointed out to the Corporation that grievances.accumulate under the - - -circumstances complained of in some instances because the Local Managements take no independent action to answer grievances or to move them from one step of the procedure to the next.
The International Union advised the Corporation that it fully subscribes to the principle set forth in Paragraph (181 that "...the prompt adjustment of -grievances is desirable in the interest of sound relations between the employees and the	‘ ■

Dear Mr. Clark
The following is the text of Delphi Corporation written and published policy regarding sexual , harassment.
"Delphi Corporation has had for many years a written and widely distributed policy on equal opportunity employment. Sexual harassment, as in the case of harassment based an age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation has long been regarded as a violation of this policy.
"All employees are expected to deal fairly and honestly with one another to ensure a work environment free of intimidation and harassment. Abuse of the dignity of anyone, through ethnic, racist or sexist slurs or through other derogatory or objectionable conduct, is offensive employee behavior. Sexual harassment also includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
"All Delphi employees are entitled to a work environment in which words and actions do not have even the appearance of disrespect.
Sexually-oriented jokes, cartoons, pictures, language, certain gestures and touching may be offensive to people arid, therefore, may result in a hostile work environment. This type of conduct will not be tolerated in the workplace. Delphi

SUBCONTRACTING - IMPLEMENTATION PARAGRAPH (8M)

Dear Mr. Clark:	■ .
During the current negotiations the IUE-CWA complained that procedures set forth in Paragraph (86d) are not being satisfactorily implemented by Management in many instances.
This letter is intended to clarity the intent and purpose of this provision:	.
1.	The "advance discussion" except where time and circumstances prevent it, will take place "prior to letting the contract for the performance of maintenance and construction work," before any decision has been made as to whether the work should be contracted out. The "advance discussion" will include information as to "why .Management is contemplating contracting out the work." It is evident that except as noted above, since Management is only "contemplating contracting out the work" when the "advance discussion" takes place. Management should not have made any decisions concerning whether or not to contract ' out the work before such "advance discussion" is held.	.	_
2.	Management will advise the local union of the "nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reason or reasons (equipment manpower, etc.), why Management is contemplating contracting out the work " • This information is related to the letter dated
307
Doc. No. 30
SUBCONTRACTING - IMPLEMENTATION PARAGRAPH (Md)
December 19,1967, to the International Union signed by Mr.' Louis G. Seaton. That letter makes reference to "manpower skills, equipment and facilities'' and also as to whether the Corporation "can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits." Since any or all of these conditions may be entailed in the determination as to whether a particular contract should be let out or nct,-it is necessary :	” that Management advise the local union in the
"advance discussion" concerning the item or items which are relevant to the decision making.

Dear Mr. Clark
During the current negotiations the parties discussed the matter of subcontracting major tool and die projects.
The parties recognized that such subcontracting within the Corporation is an extremely complex subject. The dilierent types of such work being subcontracted, time constraints imposed upon completion, facilities limitations and the variety oi ways such work is handled within the Corporation all add to the complexity of this subject.
The Corporation stated that tool, die and engineering shops in the plants are primarily equipped and staffed to provide maintenance and service to productive operations. To provide individual notice of each subcontract would be complex and burdensome, therefore, the parties focused their discussions on broader inf urination concerning annual model programs and the introduction of major new products.
Accordingly, in recognition of the Union's desire to better understand the overall competitive nature of the business, Local Management representatives will meet with affected Local Union representatives from time to time to review the nature and scope of the die construction work involved in major new or modified product programs oi the type normally and historically performed by represented employees that Management anticipates subcontracting to non-

During the course of the discussions leading to the current National Agreement, the Corporation and the IUE-CWA discussed situations where the placement in the program oi a selected apprentice or upgrader applicant is delayed. The Union emphasized that problems resulted when such a delay occurs due to (I) an approved leave of absence for jury duty, (2) approved vacation time-off pursuant to the Vacation Section, (3) a sick leave of absence under the provisions of Paragraph (90) or (91), (4) the short term needs of Local Management such as the necessity to train a replacement for the person who has been selected, or (5) an absence which qualifies the employee for bereavement pay, (6) paid absence allowance lime-off under the provisions of prior -agreements, (7) short term military duty.

The Corporation agreed to provide a suitable work center for the internal use of designated Union’ representatives in plants employing 200 or more employees. The Union recognizes that the work -center will be for the use of designated Union representatives for the purpose only of handling internal Union affairs required by the National Agreement as they relate to the duties of their office. It is further understood that other employees may contact Union representatives in the work center during the non-work time of such employees.
The size and location of the work center should be consistent with the use for which it is intended and shall be determined by the local management after consultation with the Chairperson of the Shop Committee. The International Union has been informed by the Corporation that each work

In any event, however, Management should not ' unnecessarily delay such discussion where changes in the established shift hours or lunch periods are . involved.	,	.	,	.	'
The International Union and the Corporation have also discussed the provisions of Paragraph (55) which direct that such discussions of changes in established shift hours or lunch periods shall take place with the Shop Committee.

OVERTIME POLICIES
DELPHI CORPORATION
Date:	November 16,2003
Subject: Overtime Policies
To:	All Presidents
As part of the current negotiations Delphi Corporation informed the International Union, JUEL CWA that it was the Corporation’s intention to republish the content of Mr. Edward N..Cole's letter.of-
November 20,1970 regarding Overtime Policies as follows:.
There was considerable discussion in the 1970 negotiations about the claims of the Internationa) Union, IUE-CWA that too many employees who are required to work overtime over extended periods . are not excused from overtime work assignments even though they have legitimate reasons to be excused.
The Corporation pointed out that overtime serves a number of functions essentia] to the effective operation of Delphi Cornoration tightly integrated and interdependent manufacturing system. In many instances overtime*must be worked at one of ~ ~ more plants in order to permit other plants to meet their schedules. Emergency overtime to repair breakdowns in essential equipment is often necessary to prevent or minimize interruptions in plant operations and resultant short work weeks for many employees. Overtime is also necessary on bottleneck jobs and also during certain times of the year in order to meet model change deadlines and to satisfy fluctuations in customer demand for Delphi Corporation products.
334
Duc. No. 47
OVERTIME POLICIES
Both the International Union and the Corporation recognized that the nature of the business requires overtime work assignments. In many instances, however, less than a full complement in a supervisor's group is needed to cover the jobs which are working overtime. When less than a full complement of employees is needed it is usually practicable for the supervisor to excuse employees who do not wish to work and confine the overtime assignments to those employees who do wish to work. In situations where there are sufficient employees available who wish to work overtime and who are capable of doing the overtime work assignments, employees who do not wish to work overtime are to be excused from doing so, insofar as practicable.
Employees who are required io work overtime should be given as much advance notice as is practicable so that they can make any personal arrangements that may be necessary.
An individual employee's personal problems in connection with working overtime should be given -careful consideration and an employee's individual needs should be recognized. The individual employee's request to be excused from an overtime work assignment, when made a reasonable period of time in advance, should receive every possible consideration. When the employee's request is granted the employee will be notified as far in advance as possible so that the employee can make personal plans accordingly. Thereafter, any cancellation or change in the arrangements to excuse the employee will only be made with the employee's consent.
335
Doc. No. 47
OVERTIME POLICIES
Except in situations of an emergency or crisis nature, an employee who is not assigned to □ necessary continuous seven-day operation and who has worked thirteen consecutive calendar days will be excused from work on the next following Sunday provided the employee has requested the day off before the end of the employee's shift on the previous Friday.

Dear Mr. Clark:
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern regarding benefit servicing for liourly employees who retire or were retired on or before January 1,2000, from locations which are now part of Delphi Corporation (Delphi).
The parties acknowledged that through the term of the 2QQS Agreement, such retired hourly employees would have benefit services provided by the local Delphi-IUE-CWA benefit representatives although GM retains the responsibility for the benefits and administration of such retirees’ benefit plans. It was also acknowledged that over time GM and Delphi benefit systems might become Incompatible thereby creating difficulty for local Delohi-fUE-CWA benefit representatives to service retirees who have GM benefit plans.

Dear Mr. Clark:
= During" the current negotiations, the Union cited several problems concerning the request for time-off under the provisions of (1011) of the Delphi-HJE-CWA National Agreement. The Union cited instances where certain employees have been unable to obtain time-off when such request has been made in advance of the requested day. The Union also stated that other employees have not been excused when the individual circumstances have not permitted an advance request.
The Corporation assured the Union that an individual employee's needs will be given every possible consideration when determining if an advance . request can be accommodated. The parties recognized that such requests must be consistent with production requirements and other time-off requests and their effect on the Corporation's operations.	'
It is also recognized that there are instances where it may be impossible, due to unforeseen circumstances, tor an employee to request time-off in advance. Payment for such instances must be determined on an individual basis with due consideration being given to all the attendant circumstances.

STATEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS
STATEMENT ON TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS
The parties have recognized that continuing l improvement in the standard of living of the employees 1 covered by the National Agreement depends upon , technological progress, better tools, methods, processes 1 and equipment as well as a cooperative attitude on the part of all parties in such progress.
The Corporation is mindful of the Union’s concern regarding the scopc and_work^content?of-the'iob ’ “classifications of employees in the IUE-CWA bargaining unit and how such may be affected by advancing technology.
Accordingly, the Delphi-IUE-CWA Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee will meet periodically to discuss the development of new technology at the Corporation level and its impact upon the scope of the bargaining unit.
It is not the Corporation's policy to assign to nonrepresented employees work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at a particular plant location. The Corporation recognizes that mere novelty or the sophistication of new technology alone is not grounds for withdrawing work from represented employees. Similarly, the Corporation does not believe that the perimeters of the bargaining unit at a particular plant location should be expanded simply by the introduction of new technology.
It is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of performing a work function including the introduction of computers, energy management systems, modem, art to part, tool
340
DOC. No. 50
STATEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS
cutting paths, broadband communication systems and fiber optics, CAM, CMM, CAE, 3D visualization or other new or advanced technology will not serve to shift the work function front represented co non-represetited employees. Therefore:
1.	Where a work function at a plant location preceded the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was assigned at the time of certification, unless there has been written agreement otherwise.
2.	Where a work function was introduced at a plant location following the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was originally assigned, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
Die Corporation and the International Union are in agreement that the assignment of represented or nonrepresented employees depends upon the work function involved and not necessarily upon the work tasks required to accomplish such work function.
In view of the Corporation's interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology, the Corporation shall make available, as far in advance of the Technology introduction to the plant as practical, short-range, specialized training programs for those employees who have the qualifications to perform the new or changed work, where such programs are reasonable and practicable. Therefore, in the event the work performed by employees covered by the National Agreement is altered as the result of technological changes so that additional short-range training may be required, the Corporation is willing to train such employees where practicable to enable them to perform such work,

STATEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS
Where, as the result of the initial introduction of new or advanced technology, it is anticipated that an impact upon the scope of the unit of Union represented l	employees may occur, the Local Management will
i	discuss the, matter with the Chairperson of the Shop
' Committee. Such discussion will take place as far in advance of implementation of such a technological change as is practicable in order to provide the Local Union with timely input into the particular application _______ of.the new technology.“The Local'Management will at that time describe for the Chairperson of the Shop Committee the extent to which such technological changes may affect the work performed by represented employees at the plant location involved. Comments by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee concerning the information provided will be carefully evaluated by the Local Management in accordance with the Corporation's policy relative to the assignment of work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at the plant location. During the discussions the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may include other Local Union representatives such as die Heal th ..and,Safety Representative, a representative from the Local Joint Skill Development and Training Committee, and the Chairperson of the Union Members.of the Local Apprentice Committee, as necessary, in order to review the various matters of concern relative to the introduction of the new technology involved. Likewise, Local Management may include representatives from appropriate functions, such as Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Purchasing, as required, in order to enhance meaningful discussions. These discussions may take place with all parties present as a group or separately according to individual disciplines as practicable.

Subject:	POW/MIA Flags
During the current negotiations, the Union requested that Delphi Corporation facilities fly POW/MIA flags. As discussed, Hying of flags at Delphi Corporation locations is a matter of Corporate policy.
In view of the special sensitivity associated with Vietnam era MIA and POW issues, the Corporation indicated a willingness io consider exceptions to its normal policy on flags when so requested by a Local Union. These exceptions may include: individual special requests, special days recognized by the U. S. Government to honor or remember POWs or MIAs, or other appropriate holidays such as Memorial Day and Veterans Day.
It is understood that this matter is one of Corporate policy and if revisions to the policy are made, the Union will be notified.

Mr. James D. Clark Chairman IUE-CWA Automotive Conference Board 2360 VI. Dorothy Lane	.

Dear Mr. Clark;
During the 1990 negotiations, the Union expressed concerns relative to the assignment of work at certain locations by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which the Union felt should have been assigned to the respective IUE-CWA bargaining unit. In this regard, the Corporation agreed to reissue the content of the B. P. Crane, Jr. letter dated February 20,1986 as follows;
Delphi Corporation and Electronic Data Systems entered into a contractual agreement which defines the business relationship between the two entities. Under the terms of this agreement, EDS has assumed worldwide responsibility fer the management, operation, provision and maintenance of computer and information processing services, communication services and health care administration activities for Delphi. It is also the intent of the parties that the Delphi User Organization continues to be the customer of EDS.
As such, it is oi particular importance to bear in mind that EDS, under the terms of this business agreement, remains separate and distinct. It becomes, in part, our responsibility to offer assistance in the successful operation of this relationship. Specifically, this relates to our acknowledging the fact that EDS is not a party to our National and Local agreements with the unionfl representing Delphi Carooration employees.’ EDS does recognize the historical nature al Delphi job functions and agrees that those job functions associated with manufacturing processes.
345
Doc. No. 52
CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS - EDS
which have been historically performed by Delphi hourly personnel, should continue to be performed by bargaining unit employees.	~
We can relate this to a case in point - the installation and maintenance of the new voice communication system. The role that EDS plays in this situation is the traditional role of the local telephone company. Structural preparation remains the responsibility of -Delphi Corporation and is most often accomplished utilizing bargaining unit .employees—The other job*— — functions associated with this voice communication system, in most cases, are not functions historically performed by our bargaining unit and are, therefore, the responsibility of EDS.	*'	,	(
Also, our understanding concerning bargaining unit work does not limit the fulfillment oi warranty ' > obligations by vendors. Such warranty obligations ■ and/or other work performed by employees of an outside contractor, including EDS employees, will be handled pursuant to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreements pertaining to outside contracting, where applicable."
In summary, we have had several meetings with EDS to discuss our mutual concerns. We have arrived at = an understanding assuring the continuation oi historical practices as they relate to Delphi Corporation jobs functions associated with manufacturing processes. We feel that this position is fair and will best accomplish our joint goals and recognizes the traditional role of bargaining unit employees.
As always, I appreciate your comments and -suggestions. Please refer any questions to the Delphi Labor Relations Staff.	•1 -
During the 1993 Negotiations, the Union raised several instances wherein they felt that EDS misapplied the concepts outlined in the above letter, oftentimes when there was a change in local Account Managers, and specifically with regard to the .
346
Doc. Nd. 52
CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS - EDS
applicable notiiication requirements outlined in the subcontracting provisions of the National Agreement. The Corporation observed that much at the work at issue is non-core in nature, but reiterated its intent to continue the concepts outlined in the B. P. Crane, Jr. . letter.
Furthermore, necessary arrangements will be made to review these concepts and contractual commitments with all Deiphi-EDS Account Managers.

During the current negotiations, the parties reviewed the existing Human Resource Development (HRDj Programs in 1UE:C WA-represented plants. As a result of this review, the Corporation and the Union reaffirmed their support for ongoing Human Resource Development Programs and agreed to encourage local managements and local unions to participate in such programs.
In these discussions, the Union described instances where local unions were unable to participate fully in joint projects due to a lack of trained bargaining unit personnel.
■ As a result, the Union agreed io appoint a bargaining unit Human Resource Development Program Coordinator at those plants which have an ongoing joint Human Resource Development Program. The Union also recognized that frequent replacements of Human Resource Development Program Coordinators can seriously affect the progress of Human Resource Development Programs as well as increase expenses related to Coordinator training.
The selection of the Coordinator will be made by the Union subject to the approval of the National Joint Skill Development and Training Committee. The Coordinator will work in cooperation with the locally established joint Human Resource Development Committee and will report to designated representatives of the local parties. It is understood

Subject; Plant Closing and Sale Moratorium
As a result of your deep concern about job security in our negotiations and the many discussions which took place over it. this will confirm that during the term of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, until October 12.2007 the Corporation will not close, nor partially or wholly sell, spin-off, split-off, consolidate or otherwise dispose of in any form, any plant, asset, or business unit of any type, beyond those which have already been identified, constituting a bargaining unit under the Agreement.
In making this commitment, it is understood that conditions may arise that are beyond the control of the Corporation, e.g., act of God, and could make compliance with this commitment impossible. Should such conditions occur, the Corporation will review both the conditions and their impact on a particular location with the Union.

Dear Mr. Clark:	.
During the current negotiations, Delphi Corporation and the International Union, IUE-CWA. discussed the problem of "seniority slippage" under Paragraph (00a) which inhibits bargaining unit employees from accepting assignments to fill supervisory positions. ■ It was recognized that in many instances it would be of mutual benefit to the parties for these employeesto function in such positions.
Accordingly, this letter serves to confirm the agreement reached between the National parties that:	,
1.	The transfer of any employee from a job classification in the bargaining unit to a supervisory position will result in the recall of a seniority employee from Layoff status, if available, consistent with the provisions of the J.O.B.S. Program, and/or:
2.	The transfer of an employee from a supervisory position back to the bargaining unit does not result in the layoff of a seniority employee:
Paragraph {30a) of the National Agreement will be modified in the following manner.
{30a) Any employee who has been transferred from a supervisory position to a job classification in the	’
bargaining unit shall be credited with the seniority	,
the employee had established prior to March 1,1977,	j

March 1,1977, and all time worked in a supervisory position subsequent to the elective date of this agreement provided:
(a) The employee previously worked on a job classification in the bargaining unit. This shall ' also be applied to employees who were promoted prior to certification of the Union.
(bl The employee's employment with the Corporation has remained unbroken.
Such employee may be placed on the job to which	'
seniority would entitle the employee tinder the local seniority agreement, beginning with the last previous job held in the bargaining unit; provided however, that if such last previously held job is no longer in existence, the employee may be placed in accordance with Paragraph (30). In no event shall such employee be transferred to a bargaining unit job at a time when the employee has insufficient seniority to be so placed.
In order to assure accurate and timely administration of the conditions stated above in Paragraph (30a) of the 1984 National Agreement, the following procedures will be instituted:
1,	When any employee is transferred from the bargaining unit to a supervisory position, the Chairperson of the Local Union's Shop Committee will be given a letter specifying the employee's name and the name of the seniority employee who is recalled from layoff status.
2.	When such supervisory employee, specified above, is returned to a job classification in the bargaining unit, the Chairperson of the Local Union's Shop Committee will be given a letter, notifying the Chairperson of such transfer back Into the bargaining unit.
3.	It is understood that any mutually satisfactory local agreement or practice in effect prior to the

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING

Suite 201 Dayton. OH-45439 ■---- =
Dear Mr. Clark:
This will describe the methods io be used by the Compensation activity in regard to withholding of Federal income tax from employee's wages attributable to grievance awards, vacation pay and pay in lieu of vacation from employee's wages.
Grievance awards in excess of $500.00. but involving periods less than one calendar year, will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be calculated using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
Likewise, pay in lieu of vacation also will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be withheld using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
It should be noted that the tax withholding referenced above only covers the Federal withholding amount. An amount for FICA taxes and state or local income taxes, where applicable, will be in addition to the amount withheld tor Federal income tax.
Grievance awards which are less than $500.00 will be aggregated with the regular payroll and the income tax withholding will be calculated on the total amount.	■
If a grievance award is made tor a period of more than one calendar year, the income tax withholding
376
Doc. Nd. 70
FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING
will be calculated as if the payment were for a single annua! period. Thus, in such situations, the Compensation activity will use the annual percentage table Io calculate the income tax withholding for such awards. This method would be the same as considering the award as having been paid equally over the preceding 52 weeks.
Far vacation payments made far time away from work, such payments will continue to be treated as a regular wage payment; i.e., income tax withholding will be calculated as if the vacation payment represented a regular weekly wage payment.
The above methods are dictated by Federal Income Tax Regulation s. Therefore, any change or amendment to such Regulations will, of necessity, have to be reviewed for compliance with the above changes.	.
Formal procedures to effect these changes are being communicated to the Compensation activity by separate letter, with instructions to make these changes as soon as practical.

Dear Mr, Clark
During the cunent negotiations the parties discussed the situation where an employee has applied for and been granted a vacation for a calendar week which contains a holiday as defined by Paragraph (102) of the Delphi-IUE-CWA National Agreement. The Union was concerned that if an employee was credited with a full week of vacation time-off under this situation the employee would not be able to receive the full eligible vacation time-off as contemplated in the Vacation Section.
The Corporation recognizes the desirability of providing vacation time-off up to the employee's eligibility for vacation entitlement as of the end of the current eligibility year. Accordingly, the Union was advised that in situations described above an employee would be eligible lor an additional day cd absence for vacation purposes to be scheduled in accordance with local practice. This would not apply to holidays falling within the Christmas Holiday Period as defined in Paragraph (102).

During the current negotiations the Union complained about improper administration of Paragraph (84) by local managements.
These complaints centered around the hiring of skilled trades employees as journeypersons without sufficient checking by local Management of the documents presented by the applicants to assure they quality for such status in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph (84). They also complained that in same instances Management shifted the blame to the Union when such an employee had to be released because, upon further investigation, the information upon which Management relied to hire the individual did not meet the criteria of Paragraph (84).
In response to these complaints the Corporation stated it would inform local managements that when proof of journeyperson status is not clearly established, such documentation will be furnished to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the matter will be thoroughly investigated before an employee is hired. Additionally, the Corporation assured the Union that any explanation concerning the reasons a newly hired journeyperson employee must be terminated because of failure to meet the requirements of Paragraph (84) is to be based on those factual reasons and not on the fact that the Local Union may have questioned the matter.

Dear Mr. Clark:
During the recent negotiations, there were discussions concerning subcontracting which resulted from inadequate communication about such matters. As a result of these talks, Management reaffirmed the commitment which was made in an A. S. Warren, Jr. letter to General Managers in 1987 as follows;
During the current agreement we have experienced many labor relations problems in the plants in handling subcontracting matters.
In many of these instances the root cause of the. problem is lack of communication. Inadequate communication has occurred at the Divisional and' local plant levels. The Delnhi-IUE-CWA National * Agreement currently requires timely meetings in advance of tbe decision to subcontract work normally and historically performed by Delphi Corporation skilled trades employees. 1 am informed, however, that some meetings relative to major die construction are not held at all or not in advance of the subcontracting associated with the program.
fa addition, plant level meetings with local union representatives relative to routine maintenance . contracting are often held after the contract has been let and insufficient useful information is provided to the union for them to consider and make appropriate comments relative to Management's plans.

This approach to managing the business should be utilized throughout the Corporation at all levels: production, skilled and technical. Obviously such discussions should be held in a timely manner with -. -appropriate managementand Tinian personnel!
Accordingly, please assure that an appropriate . representative of management in each personnel department is responsible lor having adequate information about each subcontract for the performance of skilled'trades work covered by the subcontracting' provisions of the agreement. After determining that required discussions have been held this representative would approve the contract prior to its being let to an outside firm. This .will require complete understanding and cooperation of . our contractual requirements by the plants engineering and purchasing personnel. '
The restructuring of the Corporation has resulted in different people and a variety of teams now having responsibility far advance model die construction. Please assure that all executives or others involved with product teams are made aware of our . contractual requirements. A specific member of each team should be given the responsibility of informing, the personnel director well in advance of the actual , beginning of die construction. The objective is to enable the personnel director to inform the union in advance of any impact on the bargaining unit in ' accordance with Document 31 in the National ' Agreement.	J	■	”

terms of quality, cost and timeliness. The result has been a feeling of pride of accomplishment shared by '	the union, employees and the managers.
Plant relationships can only be improved by open, frank communications in all areas, particularly in carrying out out subcontracting responsibilities.
Mr. Battenberg and the Strategy Board are in complete agreement that extraordinary attention must be given to our managerial responsibilities in this area. I have been assured by the International Union that we will have the full assistance of the IU£z CWA Automotive Conference Board Staff in bringing about improved plant relationships when we have installed full, advance communications relative to ;	business decisions involving subcontracting.
Furthermore, with regard to tool, die and represented engineering work, including prototype and preprototype work, several local Managements and Unions have implemented a process of advanced notification, review, and competitive analysis which has enabled the parties to consider and serve the interest of skilled tradespersons in job security, as well as Managements' needs for competitive and timely performance of this kind of work. Therefore, the Corporation and the International Union are in agreement that they will expect other locations to implement this approach in order to avoid conflicts over the subcontracting of such work.

Dear Mr. Clark
।	During the current negotiations the Union
I	complained there has been inconsistent
administration of the "normal warranty" provisions of Paragraph (86b) of the National Agreement. The Union indicated that plant managements insist on warranties beyond normal periods of time and that our skilled employees are not assigned to the new equipment or machinery until long after it has been l	in the plant. This does not provide the opportunity for
our own skilled trades to learn how to keep such equipment operating effectively.
The Corporation informed the Union that good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that the equipment purchased by the Corporation perforins according to ,	specifications required by the purchase contract.
The Corporation agreed to remind the Divisions that '	the training and expertise that will be required of our
>	own skilled trades must also be kept in mind as an
,	important business consideration. The transition
from vendor to our employees and the training and ,	timing of the transition are important parts of that

Dear Mr. Clark
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed and noted that in many instances the early indicators of an employee suffering from medical and personal problems such as those associated with substance abuse, for example, are manifested in disciplinary situations involving violations of the Shop Rules. In those initial stages it is generally the first line . supervisor and the district committeeperson who are first exposed to the potential of such underlying causes behind employee behavioral problems.
Although the parties acknowledge Management's responsibility to maintain discipline and to invoke disciplinary measures where violations of the Shop Rules occur, it is also recognized that local management and union representatives at all levels are necessarily charged with the responsibility to exercise their best efforts toward the objective of early identification of employees whose behavioral problems may be linked to medical and personal causes and to strongly encourage them to seek assistance. In many cases this could be accomplished through referral to the local Employee Assistance Program Committee..

With regard to the Skilled Trades classification structure, the Union expressed concern over appreniiceable Skilled Trades classifications being consolidated. In this regard, the Corporation observed that it will not’dictate consolidation of appreniiceable Skilled Trades classifications to its plants. The Corporation advised, however, that they intend to rely on the cunent and future apprenticeable Skilled Trades classifications as the ,, basis for our Skilled classification structure moving forward. Competitive advantages of a review of existing Skilled Trades classifications at any Delphi-TUE-CWA facility must be weighed and determined by the local parties in view of all attendant circumstances at that location, consistent with the intent of the National Parties. Appropriate training plans necessary to accomplish any consolidation must be' submitted in a timely manner for approval by the Delphi-TUE-CWA Skilled Trades and 1	'
Apprentice Committee.
Due to the nature and sensitivity of this subject the parties agree that if such Skilled Trades classification structure cannot be accomplished during current Local Negotiations, the local parties
396
Doc. No. 79
WORK ASSIGNMENTS - SKILLED TRADES
will enter good faith discussions as soon as practicable thereafter, regarding specific Skilled Trade classifications. These discussions should concentrate on competitiveness, while protecting the integrity of the Skilled Ttades classifications.
To attain this goal the Delphi Labor Relations Staff and the IUE-CWA Automotive Conference Board Staff will, upon invitation of the Local parties, support these good faith discussions to attain the goals which would be beneficial to both Delphi and the IUE-CWA Skilled Trades workforce. The onset of these discussions should take place no later than 90 days from the conclusion of the current National and Local Negotiations. Any exceptions to the above must be approved by the Delnhi-IUE-CWA Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee.
With regard to work rules and past practices, the Corporation stated that many plants feel hampered in their efforts to enhance competitiveness in today's environment by historical practices which originated at a time when competition was less threatening. Therefore, the National parties concur that local Management and the Local Unions will review existing work rules and practices with today's competitive environment in mind. Lines of Demarcation between Skilled Trades classifications which allow for incidental, overlapping and other minor access-type work is strongly encouraged and will be discussed and handled locally by mutual agreement consistent with sound business judgment. To accomplish this task, the local parties should establish a Unes of Demarcation Committee, to meet on a regular basis, to address the issues outlined in this paragraph.

If either of the local parties feel that abuses of the spirit and intent of this document exist, they will request the issue be reviewed, via plant entry, by the IUE-CWA Automotive Conference Board Staff and the Delphi Labor Relations Staff.

Dear Mr. Clark:
Subject: . Job Security - Apprentice Training and . ■ .
Joumeypernon Development	'
During these negotiations, the Union and the -Corporation acknowledged that skilled trades personnel provide vital support to operations, and that there is a direct relationship between the . effectiveness of skilled trades personnel and the success and viability of the operations they serve.
Establishing new levels of competence within the apprenticeable trades through training and retraining will permit the Union and the Corporation to pursue the critical objective of continuous improvement in quality, flexibility, operational effectiveness and in turn, enhance job security.
Consistent with these discussions and in response to current skilled trades demographics, potential future retirements, and attrition, the Corporation has agreed to continue to place primary reliance on the Delphi-lUE-CWA Apprentice Program as the training source for future skilled trades employees. Exceptions to this must be approved by the Delphl-IU&CJKA Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee. Integral to this job security-related commitment would be actions to enhance the flexibility of both future , apprentice graduates and cunent joumeypersohs.

JOB SECURITY - APPRENTICE TRANING AND
JOURNEYPERSON DEVELOPMENT
With regard to the utilization of the Apprentice Program, business conditions permitting, the objective would be to indenture an aggregate of 120 apprentices Corporation-wide (at Delphi-IUE-CWA locations) in the apprenticeable trades, and will make a good faith effort to increase the aggregate to 145. These additional apprentices will be added by October, 2007. provided that qualified candidates can be found who meet all the selection criteria and —affirmative action goals can be met. Whila tha placement of apprentices will depend on a variety of business condition factors such as attrition, business sector performance, future product plans and product allocation, the general economy and sales and market trends, Delphi Corporation intends to pursue the objective to place apprentices during each of the next four (4) years. Requests for apprentices, the rate of placement, and forecasted requirements will continue to be reviewed by the National Parties consistent with other understandings regarding skilled trades job security.
It is understood that in cases where the above goals cannot be met, or there is an immediate need for . Joumeypersons’ skills at a particular location, it may be necessary to hire Joumeypersons and/or	: ■ - -
Upgraders in place of the apprentices agreed upon in this letter, In that case, the Corporation will inform the International Union of the number of Joumeypersons hired and the reasons.1 Also, in these discussions the parties reviewed the need to give priority consideration to the placement of laid-off Delohi-IUE-CWA skilled tradespersons (Joumeypersons, Upgraders, Apprentices) as well as those assigned to a JOBS Bank.
Furthermore, where changes in the type of operation, volume, product life cycle, or other reasons, have , caused an excess number of Joumeypersons in a . particular Skilled Trade classification and placement in their trade classification is not possible, the parties will pursue, where feasible and practical, the retraining of Joumeypersons to qualify them in

another Skilled Trade. Such retraining could be done within or outside the Delnhi-IUE-CWA Apprenticeship Program. In any event, any such retraining programs must be approved by the Delphi-IUE-CWA Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee.
It is anticipated that progress in the goals set iorth in this letter will be reviewed periodically in regular meetings of the Delphi-IUE-CWA Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee. Progress will be reported annually to the Chairman of the IUE-CWA Automotive Conference Board and the Vice President of Human Resource Management for Delphi, for review and adjustment where necessary.

Dear Mr. Clark
During the discussions that led to the 1993 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the parties held lengthy discussions regarding the grievance procedure and its proper implementation. Both parties acknowledged that the Grievance Procedure has worked well over the years in resolving problems when it was properly administered as outlined in the National Agreement. ■
The Union claimed that in some instances, the Grievance Procedure provisions have not been properly applied relative to the intent of the National Agreement. Specifically, the Union remarked that at some locations, grievances were allowed to accumulate at the various steps of the Grievance Procedure and/or were not answered in a timely manner al the lower steps of the procedure. The Union further claimed that in some cases Management representatives were not available for or were unwilling to schedule regular grievance meetings. The Corporation stated their concern that at times, Union Representatives demanded answers to grievances before Management had an opportunity to investigate the charges contained in the grievance.
As a result of the foregoing, the parties reviewed the contents of Document No. 26 and Document No. 27 and reaffirmed their mutual desire and intention to assure that grievances will not be unduly delayed nor allowed to accumulate at any step in the

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Grievance Procedure in any plant. Furthermore, it was recognized that both parties have the responsibility to meet regularly on grievances in accordance with the terms of the National Agreement and that such meetings should not unnecessarily be postponed or delayed. In this regard, the parties '*■’ agreed that complaints in this area will be handled ' under the provisions of Paragraph (la) of the National Agreement. Before such problems are referred from the plant, however, the situation will be discussed between the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, the President of the Local Union, the Chairman of the IUE-CWA Automotive Conference Board and the Plant Manager and Personnel Director.

Dear Mr. Clark:
The parties to this agreement recognize the critical impact outsourcing proposals have on the parties' relationship at both the National and local level. In ■ this regard, when potential outsourcing is under consideration, the local parties should have sufficient time to evaluate the proposal to insure that they have the opportunity to develop a plan to retain the work. During the discussions leading to the cunent Agreement, the sourcing process was modified to . provide a more meaningful role for the Union in . sourcing decisions through involvement in the request for quotation process. Under this process, which provides for earlier involvement, the Union will generally have as much time to evaluate
■	methods to retain the work as the ISO day notification
f	process provided under the 1993 National Agreement.
।	In those instances where it is anticipated that less
[	than 150 days will be required to complete the
।	sourcing process, the Chairperson of the Shop
j	Committee will be so advised.
However, in such instances where the Union believes [	that insufficient time has been provided for input into
a pending sourcing decision, the matter should be [	referred to the National Parties for further discussion,
