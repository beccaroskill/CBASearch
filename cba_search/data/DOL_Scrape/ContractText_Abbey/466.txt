RE: Grievance on behalf of all HL&P Helpers
Dear Mr. Childers:
This is a proposal regarding the resolution, without precedent as to any other grievance or dispute, and without prejudice to the position of either party in any other grievance or dispute, of the referenced grievance filed by the Union dated June 25, 1998. The Company agrees to upgrade a helper, to truck driver when the employee is trained, licensed, and qualified to drive a truck rated more than 26,000 GVW when the employee is assigned by his supervision to drive the truck (with or without supervision present) because of operational requirements such as work load, and crew status. He will not be upgraded if he is permitted to drive out of desire to practice to otherwise volunteers to drive, or if he drives in a training capacity; as assigned by his supervision.
The Union will withdraw the grievance referenced above, both without precedence as to any other grievance or dispute, and without prejudice to the position of either party in any other grievance or dispute.
If the foregoing correctly reflects our understanding, please execute the attached copy and return to me retaining this copy for your file.
Sincerely,

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
August 24, 1999
RE: Reliant Energy, Shared Services, Logistics Division New Warehouseman Position
A.	BACKGROUND
This Memorandum of Agreement between Reliant Energy, Shared Services Logistics Division ( "Company") and the IBEW Local Union 66 ("Union") represents good-faith voluntary effort by the Parties to apply the Interest-Based (IBB) process, begun by the Company and Ihe Union during the 1998 Labor Negotiations, to the new position of Warehouseman.
As such, this document represents a continuation of the "Letter of Agreement" (attached), dated October 1, 1998, that established the foundation for the new position and that directed a Labor-Management Forum team to develop the specific duties associated with this new position.
The Parties further agree that this IBB effort applies to this issue alone and does not affect the rights, positions, and obligations of the Company and/or the Union with regard to any provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement or with regard to any aspects of the Labor-Management relationship itself.
B,	ESSENTIAL JOB FUNCTIONS
(attached)
C.	INTENT OF THE COMPANY AND THE UNION
The Labor-Management Forum team who collaborated on this Memorandum of Agreement focused heavily upon the mutual interests of both Parties to reach consensus on exactly what a Warehouseman should or should not do. It is important to the success of this process that some of these key mutual interests (listed in no particular order) be understood by other employees who did not directly participate in these discussions.
1)	Job Security
The new Warehouseman position is created for the purpose of helping to relieve some of the labor cost pressure on the Logistics Division. It is not created as a scheme to eliminate the present incumbent Material Handlers. Thus, the Material Handlers of record as of the date of this document are not to be displaced by new employees in the Warehouseman classification. The minimum ratio of 3 to 1 (Material Handlers to Warehouseman) was established as a bargaining-unit wide target to reflect this mutual interest.
Neither is the new Warehouseman position and this Memorandum of Agreement an assurance of any specific crew size within the Logistics Division. The numbers of Warehouseman and Material Handler employees needed will continue to be determined by the requirements of the Company and its strategic business units.
2)	Promotion and Progression
a.	Since the Warehouseman position is intended to be entry level, it is designed for new employees who eventually may progress into a Material Handler position at some future date. As such, it is not expected to be as attractive a position (financially or otherwise) as the Material Handler.
b.	If a Material Handler position is posted and no employee bids on the job, a Material Handler ("I11 6 months") will be posted prior to posting for a Warehouseman (this position may be temporarily filled by a Warehouseman until a Material Handler Training class is begun).
3)	Training
Some fundamentals training will be necessary in order for an employee in the Warehouseman position to be
successful. The Company and the Union pledge to jointly provide this training where and when needed.
4)	Decision-Making Responsibility
By the very nature of the job, a Warehouseman should not be making the same kinds of decisions as a Material Handler. Generally, a Warehouseman is not expected to have the same degree of knowledge and skill and is not expected to exercise the same degree of judgment.
If, due to changes in the work process, the business, or technology, this degree of responsibility needs to be modified, the Company and the Union pledge to revisit this matter and to change the job accordingly.
5)	Mentoring by Journeyman Material Handlers
While not "supervised" per se by the Journeyman Material Handlers, each individual Warehouseman is nevertheless "mentored" to the extent that training is provided, direction is given, and general assistance is available as needed. The determination of the amount and degree of this mentoring "oversight" is the responsibility of the Supervisor and/or Team Leader and the Head Material Handler and/or Material Handler.
6)	Cost Effectiveness and Flexibility
a.	While the Company and the Union have collaborated to identify various combinations of duties and responsibilities to be assigned to the new Warehouseman, the need to be flexible and cost-effective is an important mutual interest and, depending upon the circumstances and the situation at a particular time and location, may require that exceptions be made from time to time.
b.	These exceptions are to be noted and monitored by the Parties and discussed on an ongoing basis as part of
the joint effort to assess the effectiveness of this Memorandum.
c.	Temporary Warehouseman may be assigned to locations as follows:
>	to replace another employee who is absent due to illness, permission, or a temporary or special assignment
>	to add to the crew size because of a special job or project
>	due to alternate work schedule
>	due to needed experience or training
D. SUMMARY
The Parties understand the nature of the competitive pressures facing the Logistics Division as well as the need to continue to respond cost effectively and efficiently to the needs of Reliant Energy's internal clients. As future business requirements change, the ability of the Logistics Division to respond accordingly will determine its success.
The Company and the Union mutually pledge to jointly monitor the effectiveness of the Logistics Division and its workforce on an ongoing basis and to focus particularly upon teamwork dynamics such as trust, integrity, reliability, and communication.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
SUBJECT: Expansion of skill area 10 to include Warehouseman 4/3/2, Warehouseman
Because ot competitive market pressures, there is a need to expand the current skill area. 1998 contract discussions have resulted in development of a Warehouseman job level. It is specifically understood that the position of Warehouseman is intended for new hires, or transfers into the Purchasing and Materials Management Department; no incumbent Material Handler will be placed into this position. Company and Union agree there will be no forced effort to reduce Material Handlers in order to reach the desired ratio. The desired ratio is as follows: To the extent possible, the ratio of Material Handlers (including Heads) to Warehouseman should be equal to, or more than 3 to 1, and that ratio will be determined based on the total number of Material Handlers (including Heads) and Warehouseman Company wide. This is a good faith target, as experience and changing business needs evolve, this ratio will be reviewed by the Labor/Management Forum and adjusted as appropriate. The Warehouseman job level is an entry level position into the Material Handler skill area.
Entry requirements:
High school diploma or equivalent knowledge of reading, writing, English grammar and mathematics and a valid Texas Drivers License.
Duties:
The particular duties and progression will be developed by a .abor/Management Forum, immediately after contract ratification. The iuties will generally be manual labor oriented, under the oversight of it least a Journeyman Material Handler and require neither MMS (or :s successor system) access nor decision making that would impact iccounting records or create a liability for the company. It is inderstood that the bar code system will be utilized in some duty reas.
Training:
The Warehouseman position is intended to support the Material Handler job level and does not include a formal apprenticeship or training program. A Warehouseman must accept the placement into the Material Handler Training Program if offered.
Physical Requirements:
Ability to bend, lift, carry, climb, and perform work at above ground elevations. Potential exposure to hazardous conditions such as moving machinery, flammable solvents, hazardous materials, etc.

OFFICE MEMORANDUM
To:	Substation Performance Personnel
5/22/97
From: M.B. White
Subject: Switching Performed by One Employee
Recently, concerns about one employee performing routine switching at substations was brought to my attention. A committee was formed with the charge to review our switching practices and make recommendations that would satisfy all parties concerns and business needs.
COMMITTEE:
Wayne Alsup
Randy Bain
Fred Naranjo
Don Oliver
In summary of their findings, one employee may be required to perform substation switching duties, but careful consideration will be taken when switching equipment as noted in the attached committee report. As in the past, any employee feeling he needs assistance in performing his switching duties, will always have the option of requesting that assistance. Whenever conditions allow, two or more employees will be utilized to perform routine switching.
Also, hand held radios (one per service center) will be made available for employees use while performing switching duties alone. This measure is to improve communication capabilities with the dispatcher in the event of an emergency.
These general guidelines do not change the policy of "call out“ related switching. If the need for assistance arises during call out switching, contact the duty Crew Leader.

CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS
CONTRACT REFERENCE; Article 1, Section 5(Recognition)
PURPOSE OF COMMUNICATION: To increase understanding of the duties, roles, rights, and responsibilities of Stewards (or employees fulfilling responsibilities of Stewards)
COMMUNICATION SUMMARY;
1.	Any Bargaining Unit employee who reasonably believes that an investigatory interview may lead to disciplinary action has the right to representation by a Union Steward. The employee has the right to refuse to participate in the interview when denied Union representation.
The Steward has the right to;
1.	Conduct a pre-interview conference with the employee to determine the subject and purpose of the investigatory interview
2.	Take an active role in the employee's investigatory interview
3.	Request any and all information relied upon by management in making a decision
2.	A Steward has the right to initiate meetings with management to discuss situations concerning contract or policy interpretation or application. The purpose ol such a meeting is to avoid or preempt disputes; therefore, Supervisory personnel should respond to the meeting request as soon as possible.
3.	Stewards should in no way disrupt on-going work for the purpose of investigations or when performing their routine Stewardship responsibilities.
CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS
CONTRACT REFERENCE:	Article 4
PURPOSE OF COMMUNICATION:	Contracting Work
COMMUNICATION SUMMARY;	Contracting Work (T&D and Shared Services Supporting T&D only)
Before any voluntary/involuntary separation program, the Company and Union agree to work together to address work proposed to be done by contractors, to actively pursue alternatives to contracting work and to effectively utilize the Bargaining Unit workforce.
CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS
CONTRACT REFERENCE:	Article 7 (Safety)
PURPOSE OF COMMUNICATION; To clarify the intent of the 4th and 6th paragraphs of Article 7.
COMMUNICATION SUMMARY:
1.	"Major Emergencies" are defined as: Any time the public or employees are in imminent danger of serious injury or death.
2.	The intent of the "assistance" provision (paragraph 4) in Article 7 is to provide a safe environment for employees to work. This should not be used to avoid, exclude or categorize particular job responsibilities as safe or unsafe. The discretion is given to the employee as a safe working measure, and if this discretion is used accordingly and with prudent consideration, there should be no disciplinary or evaluation ramification. Also, should any employee ask for assistance, the assistance given will be from someone skilled tn the area or, where applicable, someone , qualified to provide the assistance, in which the work is to be performed.
3.	The intent of the 6tN paragraph is not to nullify the 5th paragraph. When energized work is being performed, the crew make-up should be of such that a helper is not placed in a position that is beyond his scope of training and qualifications which in turn could endanger him, the public or fellow employees. However, when certain occasions arise where the Head Journeyman and the Crew Leader agree that a helper (because of his training and skills) can safely contribute to the crew make-up, then such make-up is allowed.
CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS
CONTRACT REFERENCE:	Article 11 (Call Outs)
PURPOSE OF COMMUNICATION: To explain the intent of the call out language changes and the expectations.
COMMUNICATION SUMMARY:
The Company and Union realize that acceptance of calls and the prompt execution of work is needed. The expectation is that premium pay (double time for first 4 hours) will increase the acceptance of call outs, improve the response time on call outs, and result in prompt execution of work.
COURTESY CALLS
The intent of the Article 11 language on courtesy calls (calls for delayed response) is to benefit both the employee and the Company. By making courtesy calls within the designated time period, the Company is able to schedule the resources needed with minimal adverse impact on employees. To reinforce this intent and to curb abuses, a call which is not either lor immediate response or within the courtesy call time period will result in additional compensation to the employee and the ability to track these incidents.
. The additional one hour of pay at one and one-half times the employee's regular straight time rate of pay is considered a penalb for failure to observe the agreed upon time period for courtesy calls The penalty shall be paid in addition to any pay for hours worker and shall not be considered pyramiding.
. A bargaining unit employee who is contacted and instructed t assemble a crew will be paid at the prevailing rate for the houi spent making calls to assemble the crew. Pay will be determined i 30 minute increments for actual time spent making phone calls. Th is considered "time actually worked" and is counted toward 16 hou worked in a 24 hour period.
