Dear Mr. Quinlan:
This will document our discussions on Pattern Bargaining and Medical Self-Insurance.
Pattern Bargaining: Collective Bargaining Agreements between Celestica and the IBEW for Celestica’s Denver and Little Rock facilities expire in May of2006. It is our expectation that the pattern set in bargaining related to these CBAs will be extended to the CBAs for the Columbus and Oklahoma City facilities which expire in 2006.
Medical Self-Insurance: Celestica is currently planning to become self-insured for employee medical benefits. It is our expectation that the self-insurance process will be developed during 2002, and put in place in 2003.
