The parties agree that employees must possess the skills necessary to satisfactorily perform the required job and further acknowledge the desirability of allowing any employee unable to perform his/her job in a satisfactory manner a reasonable opportunity to correct these deficiencies. The Company and the Union recognize that it is the intent of Article XU, Section 2,
-61 •
“Discharge Due to Inability to Perform Satisfactorily” that management will endeavor to fully acquaint an employee of work deficiencies precipitating inability to perform satisfactorily. As a usual procedure this will be accomplished by first contacting the employee. This contact would be a formal review between supervision and the employee, at which time the employee’s deficiencies would be thoroughly discussed and an attempt would be made to provide the employee reasonable supplementary job developmental assistance. Should the employee continue to demonstrate inability to perform satisfactorily, the employee would be disciplined in accordance with the Company’s Positive Discipline Program. This contact between supervision and the employee (as well as a Local Union steward if requested by the employee) will reemphasize the seriousness of the situation and that continued inability to perform satisfactorily will result in discharge. Again, as a usual procedure, the positive discipline will be designed to make the employee filly aware of his/her deficiencies and an additional attempt would be made to provide the employee reasonable supplementary job developmental assistance.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
between
VERIZON FLORIDA INCORPORATED
and
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS
LOCAL UNION 824 (IBEW)
NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
This agreement between Verizon Florida Incorporated and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 824 (IBEW) covers all understandings between the parties concerning union organizing; access to employees and code of conduct applicable to union organizing efforts.
The Union and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to enhance the success and image of the Company, to acknowledge the Union as a valued partner, and to foster the pride and commitment of the employees. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development. As a means to enhance these goals, the parties will mutually support regulatory and legislative efforts, marketing/sales and service efforts and other business initiatives leading to employment security and Verizon's business success.
The parties also recognize that the Union's goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to
-142 ■
avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies" (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics). This shall be the exclusive means by which the Union, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize eligible employees in the covered Verizon's former "GTE Network Services Companies" (Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers and Logistics) as defined by the National Labor Relations Act.
1.	Employee Choice	.
Both the Union and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties' mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage and nurture an environment during a union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner.
VERIZON FLORIDA INCORPORATED
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
Page 2
All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct and voting will be performed by Verizon Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local management and designated Union representatives.
2.	Neutrality
The Company and the Union agree that an organizing drive will be met by a neutral position by the Company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. It should follow that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging; Neutrality means the following:
(a)	Management will not be anti-Union nor will the * Union be antimanagement.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should not vote for a Union to represent them.
(c)	The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to employees to get their message communicated.
(d)	Management will respond to employee questions and is obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a “third party" or "outsider".
-143-
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor Union representatives will be personally attacked.
(i)	Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
VERIZON FLORIDA INCORPORATED
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
Page 3
(j)	The Company will not conduct meetings for the sole purpose of discussing organizing activities without inviting appropriate Union representatives to attend.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement
3.	Rules
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show a minimum of 50% + 1 show of interest on signature cards of the appropriate unit.
(b)	A vote of 50% + 1 of those votes, validated by the Third Party Neutral (TPN), will determine the outcome.
(c)	If the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots in similar fashion to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) process.
4.	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The Union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this
-144-
notification will “start the clock". The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in 90 days. It is the intent of the parties that the 90-day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process exceed 120 days. If employees vote not to be represented, the Union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same wort: group for 12 months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the local Union from having contact with the workers in the group. If employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining-over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within 60 days and will be limited to the agreed upon unit.
VERIZON FLORIDA INCORPORATED MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION Page 4
5.	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of Union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a Labor Union. Management’s role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries;
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including obligations and responsibilities; and
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies, misstatements or misunderstandings disseminated by the Union.
6.	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union or any other party or parties. One way to ensure this objective is to have a NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process that is called “Consent Election.” This process will work as follows:
(1)	As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use “Consent Election".
(2)	The Unions shall initiate the consent election process by providing to a -145 -
I
TPN proof of support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The TPN will then notify Verizon Labor Relations Staff and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within Five working days. The Union will also be furnished with the list. The “show of interest” cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the TPN determines that the Union has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
VERIZON FLORIDA INCORPORATED
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
Page 5
(3)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected TPN, whose role is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two weeks of the submission of the Union’s show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference tn a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The TPN will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this agreement, a vote of 50% + 1 of those who vote will control. The parties may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(4)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within 14 days of receipt and verification of the Union’s show of interest cards by the TPN. In those cases where there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of using a neutral site will be split equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to composition of the unit, the TPN shall decide the issue within an additional seven days.	*
7.	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the Union for access, Verizon Labor Relations Staff, in conjunction with local management and Union representatives, will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by the Union representatives.
The Union will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to Verizon facilities. It is the intent and commitment of Verizon and IBEW that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of Verizon generally, and specifically, the selected
-146 -
unit. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee nonworking times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, an uneventful access, such as a prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected.
If Verizon and IBEW are unable to agree on reasonable access, the TPN will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. Verizon and IBEW commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.

Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, Labor Relations Staff in conjunction with local Verizon management and appropriate IBEW representatives. It is the intent and desire of Verizon and the IBEW that such matters are dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The TPN will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. Either Verizon or IBEW can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen TPN by providing three working days’ written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide concise statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between them.
(c)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.) the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the TPN will be final and binding and the parties agree to - 147 -
abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than 15 days unless the parties agree otherwise.

(d)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The TPN shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the NLRB and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
(e)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the TPN, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their .	positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any
opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the TPN without the concurrence of all parties. Verizon and IBEW believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
Verizon and IBEW agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(f)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(g)	All expenses, resulting from the use of the TPN process, shall be split equally by Verizon and IBEW.
9.	The parties recognize the rapidly changing nature and structure of the communications industry. Verizon may acquire (or be acquired by) another entity.
, It has and may in the future form joint ventures or strategic alliances, may license its brand or technology, or may be a financial investor in other entities. The -148-
employees in those entities may be non-represented, represented in whole or in the part of the Union, or represented tn whole or in part by some other labor organization. It is not possible to structure a single rule which will apply to all such circumstances and the Company cannot compel other entities to abide by this agreement.

OVERTIME
The Company and Union recognize the continuing issue of overtime assignment that exists between the parties. This complicated issue has many different facets to consider.
As a result, the parties agree to establish a Task Force to review all facets of this issue and create solutions which balance the concerns of the Union and employees while allowing the Company to provide quality/timely service to its customers without increasing costs.
Due to the importance of this issue, the Company and Union agree to dedicate four (4) members each for a period not to exceed forty-five (45) days to identify solutions. The Region President and Union Business Manager will co-chair the committee.
Any work rules, policies, etc. that affect the assignment of overtime can be evaluated by the Task Force Team. Additionally, in an effort to ensure the Task Force maximizes the use of the time allowed, the Company and the Union agree to provide professional facilitation and training to members of the Task Force Team to assist them in identifying and recommending mutually agreed upon solutions to this important issue.
The Task Force is not restricted in its pursuit of solutions by local policies or practices, labor contracts or other “traditional" barriers, which may have limited the scope of review in the past. Further, the Team is encouraged to look at creative non-traditional approaches that provide excellent customer service at no increased cost.	.

PENSION PLAN SURVIVOR BENEFITS
1.	Verizon Florida Incorporated and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 824 (IBEW) agree to modify the Plan for Hourly Employees' Pensions. Such modifications will be effective January 1, 2003, and are subject to applicable law.
2.	The existing pre-retirement survivor pension benefit provisions of the Pension Plan shall be amended to provide a pre-retirement survivor pension benefit for an employee who dies, either during active service or prior to commencing a pension benefit, at a time when he or she is unmarried and has accrued at least five years of vesting service.
3.	An unmarried employee may, at any time prior to commencing a pension benefit or dying, designate any living person as the designated beneficiary for the preretirement survivor pension benefit. The employee may likewise revise the beneficiary designation at any one or more times prior to commencing a pension benefit or dying. A valid beneficiary designation must be on file for the preretirement survivor benefit to be paid.
4.	For married employees, the spouse will automatically be considered the beneficiary. However, subject to the requirements regarding non-spouse beneficiaries and with spousal consent, a married employee may name a beneficiary other than the spouse. A single individual must be named as beneficiary; an estate or trust may not be named, nor may multiple individuals.
-151 -
5. Subject to the provisions of the Plan regarding when the benefit is payable, the pre-retirement survivor pension may be distributed as a 65% survivor annuity, or the lump sum equivalent, based upon the beneficiary's election. However, if the beneficiary is not the participant's spouse and is more than 25 years younger than the participant, the survivor benefit will be the 50% survivor annuity or the lump sum equivalent.

6. If a vested employee terminates employment on or after the effective date, the named survivor will be eligible for the survivor pension payable on the date the employee would have reached the age 65. An actuarially reduced benefit may be payable before age 65 if the vested employee would have been eligible for an earlier commencement.
7. In addition, the Pension Plan shall be amended to allow an employee, at the time of commencing a pension benefit, to designate any living person as the beneficiary for any of the forms of joint and survivor annuity offered under the Pension Plan or any of the term-certain forms of benefit. In the case of an employee who is married at the time of commencing a pension, the employee may not designate any beneficiary other than the spouse without complying with the spousal consent rules of the Plan.
8. This Memorandum of Agreement is effective on January 1, 2003 and shall expire on July 30, 2005. The parties specifically agree that all the terms and conditions set forth in this Memorandum of Agreement shall also expire on July 30, 2005 and shall not survive the expiration of this Memorandum of Agreement, unless agreed to by the parties in writing.

The payout ranges from 0% to 120% of an established target.
The range of the Team Performance Award payout is as follows:
Plan Year	Target Award*		Payable 1st Quarter
	Min	Target	Max	
2002	0%	4%	4.8%	2003
2003	0%	4%	4.8%	2004
2004	0%	4%	4.8%	2005
* Range is from 0% to 120% based on achievement of objectives.
The payout percentage is applied to an employee's highest hourly basic rate of pay during the 26 pay periods of the calendar year.
Employees transferring between teams shall have their award prorated according to the time on each team.
In the event of reorganization which results in employees changing teams, awards shall be prorated based upon each team's performance.
An employee who resigns, is laid off, terminated, dies or retires during the calendar year is eligible for a prorated Team Performance Award if
• all other eligibility requirements have been met, *
*	In case of Termination for Cause the individual situation will be reviewed to determine if the individual is eligible for an award.
*	Temporary and seasonal employees are eligible for a prorated Team Performance award if all other eligibility requirements are met.
Employees on approved military leave of absence who have one year or
-169-
more service will be given full wage credit up to three months toward the Team Performance Award. Employees on any other unpaid leave will have cumulative leave time excluded from award computation.
4.	TIME OFF FOR UNION ACTIVITIES
Excused time off for union activity will be counted as time worked when computing Team Performance Awards.
5.	BENEFITS TREATMENT
Team Performance Award payments are recognized in the calculation of Pension Plan benefits, Group Life Insurance, and the Hourly Savings Plan. Such payments will be applicable in the year payment is received. This is in accordance with benefit plan definitions.
All other benefits are in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement and are based on rates shown in the hourly wage schedules.
6.	TAXES, PERSONAL ALLOTMENT
Deductions for federal, state, and local tax liabilities will be made in accordance with lump sum distribution tax laws.
Personal allotments such as savings bonds, and United Way contributions will not be made.	'
7.	OVERTIME	’
The Team Performance Award payouts are for hours worked and must be included in overtime payments.
The overtime payment will be calculated as follows:
The Team Performance Award payout divided by the total hours worked equals the award hourly rate. This rate is then multiplied times .5 x number of overtime hours in the same calendar year for which the Team Performance Award was paid. The result of this calculation is the award overtime payment due the employee.
EXAMPLE:
Team Performance Award	$500
divided by
Total Hours Worked	1,880
equals
-170-
Award Hourly Rate times
Overtime Rate (1/2) equals Hourly Overtime Rate of Pay times Total Overtime Hours equals Award Overtime Payment
$0.2659
. 5
$0.1329
100
$13.29
The overtime-incentive payment is not included in benefit plan calculations.
8.
A Team Performance Award overtime payment will be included in the award payout.
OBJ ECTIVES/MEAS URES
All hourly employees normally will be assigned to teams based on their functional area of responsibility. Teams may consist of a few employees or many.
Each team will be given a set of objectives linked to, but not limited to, one or more of these performances areas:
Quality/Value of services delivered
Productivity
Expense Budget	,
Revenue
Teams that satisfy a minimum level of performance will receive an incentive payment. If that minimum level of performance is exceeded, the incentive payment will be larger. Each member of a team will receive the same percentage of target award that the team achieved. An example would be as follows:
Level of Performance Below Minimum Minimum to Target Target
Over Target to Maximum
Percentage of Target Award
0%
10 -99%
100%
101 -120%
9.	The Company reserves the right to establish objectives and determine performance results. The objectives, the performance results, or any part of the Team Performance Award shall not be subject to the grievance or arbitration provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
-171 -
10.	Prior to the announcement of objectives and performance targets for the
applicable year, company representatives will meet with Union representatives to review the rationale for such objectives and targets.
11.	MODIFICATION OF THE TEAM PERFORMANCE PLAN
Verizon may at any time modify, in part or in whole, the Team Performance Award Plan. Any modification shall not affect awards already earned under this plan. The Company reserves the right to modify team structure as may be necessary.
12.	TERMINATION OF THE TEAM PERFORMANCE PLAN
The suspension or termination must be by mutual agreement of the parties.

WORKING PRACTICES - OPERATOR SERVICES (EXCLUDING CLERICAL)
When traffic in one (1) or more Operator Services Manager's Unit(s) in a work center is transferred to another Operator Services Manager’s Unit(s), and this traffic transfer involves the elimination of all night tours and/or all six-hour evening tours, operators with five (5) or more years of seniority will be given the opportunity to be reassigned, at the time of the initial transfer, to the Unit(s) with all-night tours and/or six- hour evening tours remaining. The number of employees granted transfer will not exceed the equivalent number of employees for the traffic being transferred. Where more transfer requests are received than transfers available, seniority shall be the determining factor.
Eight (8) hour standard tours may be assigned to commence between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. Standard tours may commence on any fifteen (15) minute interval.
