Section 2.	When an employee requests a leave of absence for reasons of health such leaves shall be granted for a period not to exceed that medically required for his or her recovery, provided the employee presents evidence satisfactory to the Company of the need for such leave. Such leaves may be extended upon application therefor to the Company.
Employees who receive a leave of absence under the provisions of this Section 2, for reason of non-occupational sickness or injury shall earn service credit for pension purposes up to the length of time such an employee would retain his or her seniority on layoff under the provisions of Appendix A, Section 1, Subsection (d).
Section 3.	A Leave of Absence of up to four (4) months shall normally be granted upon request of a pregnant employee for childbirth. The leave may begin two (2) months prior to the anticipated delivery date or earlier if medically required.

Written notice from a licensed physician must be furnished to the Company a reasonable time in advance of the expected delivery date. An employee must return to work at the end of her leave or any authorized extension.

ib
Weekly Indemnity benefits for the duration of her new unrelated disability for a maximum period of twenty-six (26) weeks. This period will begin with the first day of the accident or, in the case of illness, the earlier of the eighth day of the new disability or the first day of hospitalization, resulting from the new unrelated disability.
The leave of a woman who is not disabled but is on unpaid maternity leave prior to delivery granted under this Article XII, Section 3 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement who becomes totally disabled by injury or sickness will receive Weekly Indemnity benefits as provided by the plan for the duration of such total disability, for a maximum period of twenty-six (26) weeks beginning with the start of such payments.

The payment of Weekly Indemnity benefits for a second disability will not extend the maximum twenty-six (26) week period for which benefits are payable for a previous disability. Thus, for example, a maternity disability occurring in the 25th week of payment of benefits for disability resulting from an accident will not postpone expiration of the twenty-six (26) week maximum period for payment of benefits for the accident disability. Rather the woman would receive benefits only for so long as she was unable to work because of her maternity disability, to a maximum of twenty-six (26) week period.

The following letter agreements were negotiated by Honeywell International and the Local 1145 Negotiating Com-nittee dtrHg *hs 197g negotiations as can of the genera' connect se^'e^ent,

Dear Bill:
This letter w'll document o'ir d'scuss’nnp in mgard ’o Aor>engiv 3. gec*inn ■ the General Agreement,
The Section reads as follows:
"The grading of a job covered by this Section 1 shall not be changed by the Company and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure by the Union unless there is a substantial change in the duties of the job after the last anniversary of this Agreement. The change in duties shall not be considered a substantial change unless it is sufficient to result in a change of a labor grade. The question of whether or not a substantial change in duties, within the meaning nf this paragraph, has occurred shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
As new jobs covered by this Section 1 are established, such job shall be graded. Disputes regarding proper gradings for new jobs shall be subject to the grievance procedure. This paragraph sha11 nof be aon’icabie to the jobs cnve-ed under Section 2,3, and 4 below."
The Company’s interpretation of this Section is:
1.	If there is no change in the job since the last anniversary date of the Agreement, the grading shall not be changed.
2.	If the change in duties sine the last anniversary date is not a substantial one; that is, sufficient to result in a change of a labor grade as the Agreement states, the grading shall not be changed. However a job could change to the extent that the point total will change up or down but the job will still remain in the same labor grade. T^ese points will be added to the job description of the job.
This new point total shall then be the point total for the job. If the job changes again so as to raise the point total into the next labor grade, then the job rating shall be raised. This will occur whether or not the next change occurs in the same contract year.

This letter will document our discussion during negotiations in regard to Union proposal number 19A, and supersedes the letter dated February 1. 1980 regarding Worker Compensation Weekly ^dem^ty inte^ace 0'K ’■’ew no^cv w:" be as follows:
Upon notification of a work-related injury nr illness Honeywell will ommotly process a Worker's Compensation claim.
A Worker's Compensation claim which is not denied within 14 days of receipt of notice of the injury or illness by Honeywell will be paid subject to later denial after further investigation. Weekly Indemnity will not be pa:d until any claim for Worker's Compensation has been denied or for any oenod Wooer's Co^nensaf;on is being oaid.
Where a Worker's Compensation claim is initially paid, but upon subsequent Investigation denied, the injury or illness will be retroactively treated as a Weekly Indemnity claim, but any Weekly Indemnity payments due will be reduced by the amount of the Worker’s Compensation payments made prior to the denial of the Worker’s Compensation claim. If there is any remaining overpayment of Worker's Compensation, it will be handled through payroll deduction.
Where a Worker’s Compensation claim is denied with the 14 day period, the injury or illness will be treated as a Weekly Indemnity claim if the employee signs an "Indemnity Agreement" to permit repayment of the duplicate Weekly Indemnity payments, should his Worker’s Compensation c'a'm iAtm he accented Ropav-ment w'li be handled through payroll deduct’on.

Gentlemen;
This letter will serve to document the Company’s agreement with the Union proposal regarding Quality, productivity, competitive position and education and training ;nit!atf''es.
Section 1.
The Company and Union recognize: 1) the need for a continuously increasing priority on the development of the human resources within the bargaining unit in order to improve productivity, quality, provide job opportunities and to facilitate the Company's ability to compete; 2) the need for employees to experience on a continuing basis changes in technology, automation, government regulation and competitive improvements which are accompanied by opportunities for each employee to maintain employment security in the bargaining unit and 3) the need to improve the comoetit’ve position of the factories.
Section 2.
The Joint Labor/Management Overall Steering Committee shall organize and direct the operation of the Honeywell-Teamsters Local 1145 quality, productivity, education and training initiatives for the purpose of addressing additional areas that adversely affect the Company and tHe Union's ab'i’tv to furt^er 'mp^ove competitive p0S't'0n and job sectrity.
Section 3.
The provisions of this letter shall in no way operate to limit, modify or reduce rights of an employee or the Company under the Collective Bargaining Agreement or the supoiementary agreements.

Gentlemen;
This letter will serve to confirm the agreement reached in negotiations with Local 1145 on January 29, 1988, effective contingent on agreement on a "single” bargaining unit wide seniority system, miatix/e to a ■'estatemeN nf ’-inneywe"*s ooi*cv with respect to subcontracting.
When a layoff occurs in the bargaining unit we will take immediate steps to call back any subcontract work which is outstanding and which has previously been performed by bargaining unit employees. We will not let out pending subcontract orders for such work. Whether or not this policy can be adhered to in each 'nd;-v'duai case will depend upon many factors, some of which are listed below:
We, of course, must have available the equipment, tools, machines and materials necessary for the assembly or manufacturing processes involved. We must have the technical "know how" to do the work. There are instances when we subcontract because we do not have or have not perfected the necessary assembly or manufacturing processes or techniques which are required.
The cancellation of outstanding subcontracting orders cannot be handled by any formula due to the many variables involved. Order sizes may be reduced, orders not started may be cancelled. On the other hand where an order has been started it may be entirely impractical to cancel it. For instance, where we have contracted for Operations 1,2, and 3 it may be entirely out of order to stop the process at the vendors and pick up the interrupted sequences in our shop. Another example would be where we have let out as a package the manufacture and assembly of a device or component. In most instances, such a package subcontract would not permit us to take back the assembly or manufacturing phase of the order because a layoff has occurred. By and large, we must give consideration to the vendor’s right. based on our commitment to fimsh the cu^ent order.

Gentlemen:
This letter will document the Company's position regarding the ejects on Honeywell employees represented by Teamsters Local 1145 in the even* efforts to sell a Honeywe'i Division results in a divestiture from Honeywell.
It is the Company's intent that the buyer(s) will, subject to the agreement of the union as the lawful representative of the transferring employees, assume the terms and conditions, or their equivalent, of the collective bargaining agreement and nension agreement between Honeywell and Teamsters Local 1145 at the closing date as the agreements would apply to the transferring employees.
With such an assumption, an employee working in or who is on layoff or leave (other than an employee receiving benefits for permanent disability under the Long Term Disability Plan or the Honeywell Pension Plan) from a divested business, who fs offered a comparable job or continuation of his/her layoff or leave, will be transferred to the new company with the seniority he/she had on the closing date. If an employee in a divested unit is not offered a comoarable job or a continuation of his/her lavoff or leave, such emolovee win be treated as a surplus employee by Honeywell under the coi'ective bargaining agreement.
If a transferred employee who is actively employed by the new company on the closing date is later involuntarily laid off by the new comoany, the employee may. for a period equal to his/her seniority on the closing date, with a minimum of two (2) years and maximum of five (5) years after the closing date, resign his/her employment with the new company and exercise his/her cumulative seniority previously earned at Honeywell and with the new company to return to Honeywell, with such seniority, and displace the least senior Honeywell employee, to whom he/she is senior, on whose job ho/shc is qualified to perform.
An employee displacing the least senior employee under the above paragraph, wilt be eligible for the pay protection provided in Appendix B. Section 7 of the then current collective bargaining agreement.
If, on the closing date, a transferred employee of a divested business is on layoff status from the business, and not actively employed elsewhere in Honeywell, his/her employment shall transfer to the new company. However, if he/she is not recalled by the new company within the applicable time period set out above, the employee may at any time within such time period resign his/her employment status with the new company and exercise his/her combined seniority at Honeywell as provided above.
If, on the closing date, a transferred employee of a divested business is on leave of absence, his/her employment shall transfer to the new company. However, if he/she is not reinstated to active employment by the new company upon the expiration of such leave, he/she may resign employment status with the new company and exercise his/her crm-b^ed sew'ce as orovided above. regardless of the time the 'eave expires

This letter w:ll document our discussions in 2001-02 general c/^tmct "egn^afinns in regard to Union proposal #29 and Company o-onosal #8.
The Company and the Union are interested in improving the process for appointive job selection under the terms of Article XIV, Section 3 of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement. It is understood that such an improved process must not provide for a dilution of selection standards. Accordingly, the Company and the Union agree to charter a Joint Labor-Management Team to develop improvements to the appointive job selection process. The Secretary-Treasurer and President of Local 1145 along with the Director of Factory Human Resources will be responsible for selecting the Team members and kicking off the Team Process. Within 90 days aTer the conclusion of general negotiations this joint labor-management team is expected to submit recommendations to the Joint Labor-Management Overall Steering Committee for approval. These recommendations are expected to include a method for calculating a time and attendance deviation rate for appointive jobs, generic requirements for appointive positions and training and/or educational requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of people assigned to appointive jobs. We believe that a joint-labor management approach would be in our mutual interests in order to improve the competitive position of the Minneapolis Operations.
