PREAMBLE REGARDING SO-CALLED “POSSESSIVE CREDITS”
Purpose of Preamble
In the negotiations leading to the 1995 Minimum Basic Agreement, the Companies and the Guild confirmed their jointly held view that the making of film and television is a collaborative art and business venture in which the contributions of many persons are essential, and without which motion pictures cannot be made. The AMPTP and the Guild sought to reach an agreement to meet the Guild’s long-standing objection to the use of possessive credits. It was concluded that a comprehensive resolution of the issues involved would not be reached prior to the end of the negotiation, but that a comprehensive resolution would be sought in the future. The bargaining parties further agreed to the inclusion of this PREAMBLE as a means of highlighting the Writers Guild’s strong, continuing, long-standing opposition and objections to the use of so-called “Possessive Credit(s).”
Defining Possessive Credit(s)
The term “possessive credits” refers to such credits as are generally regarded as such in the film and television industry and which attribute, impute and/or which could be reasonably construed to credit a person with the authorship of a film. It is understood that the term “possessive credits” does not include any forms of writing or source material credits. Examples of such credits are:
“A Film By”
”Pat Brown’s [title of film]”
“A Robin Smith Film”
The PREAMBLE is in two parts:
1.	Statement by the Writers Guild of America.
2.	Acknowledging statement by each Company signatory to this MBA.
- xvi -
STATEMENT OF THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA
Writers Guild Objections to Possessive Credits
Since its founding, the Writers Guild has opposed the use of the so-called “possessive credit” on screen and in advertising and promotion when used to refer to a person who is not the sole author of the screenplay.
The Guild’s historic, current and ongoing opposition is based upon beliefs and principles which include the following:
Credits should, as far as possible, accurately reflect each individual’s contribution.
The granting of a possessive credit to a person who has not both written and directed a given motion picture inaccurately imputes sole or preeminent authorship.
The proliferation of the number of unnecessary credits on screen and in advertising devalues credits in general.
The widespread use of the credit denigrates the creative contributions of others.
ACKNOWLEDGING STATEMENT BY EACH COMPANY
Each Company acknowledges that the Guild holds the foregoing strong objections and beliefs regarding die use of the “possessive credit,”
The Companies believe that the best way to address the foregoing objections is through tripartite discussions among the Companies, the WGA and the DGA and, therefore, commit to their full participation in that process.

ARTICLE 6	GUILD SHOP (GENERAL)
A.	Except as provided below, in both theatrical and television motion pictures each writer employed by Company on the effective date of this Basic Agreement who is then a member of the Guild in good standing shall remain a member in good standing, and each writer so employed who is not a member shall, on or before the thirtieth day following the effective date of this Basic Agreement, become and remain a member of the Guild in good standing. Each writer employed hereunder by Company after the effective date of this Basic Agreement shall, not later than the thirtieth day following the beginning of his/her first employment, as hereinafter defined, in the motion picture and television industry, become and remain a member of the Guild in good standing.
The term “first employment,” as referred to above, shall mean the first such employment to which the provisions of this Basic Agreement apply as a writer for a motion picture by an employer in the motion picture and television industry, on or after the effective date of this Basic Agreement.
B,	The provisions of Paragraph A, of this Article 6 shall not apply:
1,	If a writer is not a member of the Guild at the time of his/her employment and although required by the provisions of his/her employment agreement to do so, fails or refuses to become a member of the Guild in good standing within the thirty (30) days above-mentioned, provided that within fifteen (15) days after written notice thereof from the Guild to the Company, the Company shall either terminate such employment or shall pay or cause to be paid the initiation fees and dues of the writer in the manner, within the time, and subject to the provisions of subparagraph E,2. hereof relating to the payment of dues. If the Company elects to and does pay such initiation fees and dues, such writer shall be deemed to be a member of the Guild in good standing, but only for the period necessary to permit him/her to complete the performance of his/her services in connection with the then current assignment.

2.	To a writer whom the Company is required to employ as a condition of the sale, license or option of material, provided that within fifteen (15) days after written notice from the Guild to the Company that such writer is not a member of the Guild in good standing, the Company shall either terminate such employment, or shall pay or cause to be paid the initiation fees and dues that the writer would otherwise be required to pay hereunder during such employment, in the manner, within the time, and subject to the provisions of subparagraph E.2. hereof relating to the payment of dues. However, the writers employed by the Company within the exception provided for in this subparagraph 2. shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total number of writers in the employ of the Company. For the purpose of such computation, if the Company has in its employ at any time less than ten (10) writers, then one (1) of such writers so employed may fall within this exception. Promptly following the employment of any writer claimed by the Company to be within this exception, the Company will notify the Guild in writing of the name of the writer employed, the date of the employment agreement and the fact that the Company claims that such writer is an exception hereunder. For the purpose of such computation, a writer who is employed under an exclusive contract by a Company shall be regarded as being employed by the Company at all times during the term of such contract, including periods during which the writer may be on layoff and periods during which such contract may be suspended by reason of illness or default of the writer or otherwise. The writer shall be regarded as continuing in the employ of the Company by which he/she is employed regardless of the fact that his/her services may be loaned to another Company.
C.	The term “dues,” as used herein, shall not include fines or initiation fees.
D.	Promptly after request by any person designated by the Company, the Guild will admit such person to membership in the Guild upon terms and conditions not more burdensome to such person than those then applicable to other applicants. Membership shall be effective as of the date of such request. Guild agrees that during the term it will not impose any unreasonable initiation fee as a condition to admission to

It is agreed that the Guild shall not close its membership books or otherwise prevent any person who wishes to become or remain a writer from becoming a member of the Guild, but on the contrary (subject to the provisions hereof relating to waivers as to members suspended or expelled) will make available the privileges of membership to any and all writers employed by the Company. The Guild will reinstate or readmit to membership any writer who applies for reinstatement or readmission, after being declared to be not in good standing or after suspension, expulsion, or resignation for any reason whatsoever, provided the writer will apply for such reinstatement or readmission and with such application tender to the Guild unpaid dues permitted by law, and upon such tender the Company may employ or continue to employ such writer. Instead of readmitting or reinstating such writer, the Guild may, at its option, grant to the Company a waiver as to such writer, in which event, for the purpose of determining the Company’s compliance with the provisions of this Article 6, such writers shall not be considered as being employed by the Company.
E.	If, during any time that a writer is employed by the Company under a contract of employment, such writer is or becomes a member of the Guild in good standing and if such writer shall subsequently and before his/her employment under such contract terminates, cease to be a member of the Guild in good standing then:
1.	If such writer has ceased or shall cease to be a member for any reason other than his/her failure to pay dues, such writer shall, for the purposes of this Basic Agreement, be deemed to remain a member of the Guild in good standing throughout the writer’s employment under said contract of employment as the same may be extended or renewed pursuant to any provisions or options therein contained.
2.	If he/she has ceased or shall cease to be a member in good standing by reason of his/her failure to pay dues, and if the Guild gives the Company written notice of that fact within three (3) business days after such writer is first named on the

If, prior to the expiration of said fifteen (15) day period, payment of said dues in fact due and owing and specified in said notice shall be made by the writer or the Company, then, for the purposes of this Basic Agreement, such writer shall not lose his/her status as a member in good standing. To the extent that it may be lawful for the Company to do so, the Company may require, as a condition of employment, that any writer become and/or remain a member of the Guild in good standing, and may also . require such written consent or consents as may be necessary
so that, if the Company elects, it may pay to the Guild any dues of any writer and the Company shall have the right, insofar as its obligations to the Guild and to any writer under the terms and provisions of this Basic Agreement are concerned, if it elects, to deduct the amount of such dues from any compensation then or thereafter due or to become due to the writer. If, prior to the expiration of said fifteen (15) day period, payment of said dues in fact due and owing as specified in said notice shall not be made, the Company shall terminate the ' employment of such writer. •
Every personal service contract of employment shall provide that if the writer fails or refuses to become or remain a member of the Guild in good standing, as above provided, the Company shall have the right at any time thereafter to terminate such employment agreement with such writer.
If the Company is required or directed by any decision of a court of competent jurisdiction or any proper governmental authority to refund to any writer, in whatsoever form the same may be recovered, any dues deducted and paid to the Guild by the Company under the provisions of subparagraph 2. of this Paragraph E., the Guild agrees to repay to the Company the amount of such dues so refunded. The Guild will cooperate with the Company in obtaining the necessary

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraph B. of this Article 6 or in this Paragraph E., if the payment of initiation fees or dues (in the case of Paragraph B.), or if the payment of dues (in the case of this Paragraph E.). or the deduction thereof from the compensation of the writer, is or shall become contrary to law, or any statute, or is declared by any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California or by any Federal Court or the National Labor Relations Board or its General Counsel, or by any other board or individual having jurisdiction over the matter, to be in violation of any applicable law or statute and if, by reason thereof, the Company fails to deduct and pay to the Guild such initiation fees or dues, as the case may be, as aforesaid, and shall notify the Guild thereof in writing within the fifteen (15) days after any notice from the Guild above-mentioned, then although such initiation fees or dues, as the case may be, are not paid within the fifteen (15) day period, for the purposes of this Basic Agreement, such writer shall nevertheless be deemed to remain a member of the Guild in good standing throughout the term of the writer’s assignment.
F.	The Guild will facilitate employment of its members by the Company and will at all reasonable times promptly furnish to the Company in writing information concerning the status of any of its members, and the Company shall be entitled to rely upon such information so furnished by the Guild.
G.	The Guild represents and warrants that discipline, resignation, admission, reinstatement, readmission and all other matters relating to membership status will at all times during the term hereof be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Guild.

I.	If a person who has not been listed by the Company as a writer in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 hereof shall receive, or shall have been entitled to receive, a writing credit in the form of "Story by," "Written by," "Screenplay by," or "Teleplay by," and if the period during which the person performed his services in the writing of the literary material has exceeded a period of thirty (30) days from the commencement of such services, then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice from the Guild to the Company, the writer or the Company shall pay or cause to be paid the initiation fee, if any, and the dues which otherwise would have been payable to the Guild and such person shall be deemed to have been a member of the Guild in good standing during the time that he/she was so performing his/her services as a writer. For such purpose, the person receiving or entitled to such credit or the Company may apportion, on a reasonable basis, salary payable to such person during the period he/she was employed as a writer.

Upon such payment, such writer shall be

K.	In relation to investigations by the Guild of compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Guild, through its authorized representatives, shall have access to the Company’s premises at reasonable times during normal business hours for the purpose of interviewing the Company’s employees whose employment is covered by this Agreement, provided that such interviews shall not interfere with the normal conduct of the Company’s business.
ARTICLE 7	NO STRIKE, NO LOCKOUT CLAUSE (GENERAL)
A.	The Guild agrees that during the term hereof it will not call or engage in any strike, slowdown or stoppage of work affecting theatrical or television motion picture production against the Company.
B.	If, after the expiration or other termination of the effective term of this Basic Agreement, the Guild shall call a strike against any Company, then each respective then current employment contract of writer members of the Guild (hereinafter for convenience referred to as “members”) with such Company shall be deemed automatically suspended, both as to service and compensation, while such strike is in effect, and each such member of the Guild shall incur no liability for breach of his/her respective employment contract by respecting such strike call, provided such member shall promptly, upon the termination of such strike, and on the demand of the Company, perform as hereinafter in this paragraph provided, and the member shall be deemed to have agreed as follows:
1.	That if the writer has been assigned to the writing of any material at the time any such strike is commenced, he/she will, after the termination of such strike and upon the request of the Company, report to the Company and perform his/her services in the completion of such assignment at the same salary and upon the same terms and conditions as were agreed upon prior to the commencement of said strike.
ARTICLE 6 J.
GUILD SHOP
(GENERAL)
-52-
2.	That he/she will immediately, after the termination of such strike and upon the request of the Company, execute a new contract on the same terms and conditions, and at the same salary or other compensation as provided in the employment contract which was in effect at the time the strike commenced, except that such new contract shall be for a period or periods, including options, equivalent to the unexpired term of the contract which was in effect when such strike was commenced.
3.	That he/she will, in lieu of subparagraph 2., after the termination of such strike, at the option of the Company, and upon its demand, execute an agreement in writing with the Company extending the term or period of such personal service contract in effect when such strike was commenced for a period of time equal to the period of any suspension by such strike.
C.	If the member shall fail to perform the foregoing, or if he/she shall fail actually to finish his/her services in the assignment mentioned in subparagraph B. 1(except by reason of his/her death, physical disability, or default by the Company), then the waiver of liability by the Company heretofore given shall be null and void.
D.	The member further agrees that the statute of limitations as a defense to any action by the Company against the member for his/her failure to perform during such strike is extended by a period equivalent to the duration of such strike. If the member asserts any claim or defense by reason of the expiration of time during which he/she can be required to perform services by virtue of any statute (such as the seven-year statute), which claim or defense is based in whole or in part on the lapse of time during such strike, the waiver by the Company is ineffective thereupon, and the statute of limitations as to the Company’s rights is waived by the member automatically.
E.	The automatic suspension provisions of this Article 7 shall not affect the Company’s right to sue any individual writer for breach of contract arising during the period of such strike, unless such writer shall have complied with his/her obligations under the provisions of this Article 7. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to deprive the Company of its right to terminate the employment contract at any time after such member shall strike or otherwise fail or refuse to perform services.

I.	The Guild is a corporation. Nothing in this Paragraph I. shall enlarge the liability of its officers, directors, agents, and members, this Paragraph I. being an additional limitation thereon. The Guild will not be held liable for unauthorized acts of its officers, agents, directors, or members; neither the Guild, nor its officers, directors, agents, or members not participating in the actions hereinafter mentioned shall be liable for any strike, slowdown, or work stoppage, unless the same be authorized by the Guild in accordance with its by-laws, but the foregoing exemption of this sentence shall not apply unless the Guild, upon request from the Company affected thereby, shall proclaim promptly and publicly that such strike, slowdown or work stoppage is unauthorized and follows such pronouncement within a reasonable time thereafter, if requested so to do by the Company affected, with disciplinary proceedings in accordance with its by-laws against the participants in such unauthorized action.
J.	The Company agrees that it will not call or engage in any lockout of members.
K.	In accordance with and to the extent required by Articles 11 and 12 of this Basic Agreement as to any matter arbitrable thereunder, the Guild has the right to strike Company so long as the Company’s wrongful failure to participate in grievance and arbitration procedures continues.

ARTICLE 9	MINIMUM TERMS (GENERAL)
The terms of this Basic Agreement are minimum terms; nothing herein contained shall prevent any writer from negotiating and contracting with any Company for better terms for the benefit of such writer than are here provided, excepting only credits for screen authorship, which may be given only pursuant to the terms and in the manner prescribed in Article 8.

Basic Agreement by the Guild or the Company.
3.	Any claim by the Guild and a writer, on the one hand, against the Company, on the other hand, for unpaid compensation under the writer’s individual employment agreement or loan-out agreement with the Company, or for payment under a purchase agreement with the Company in the case of a professional writer, excluding, however, any claim not related to the writer’s services as a writer or not related to the sale of literary material. (Claims for compensation or payment under an employment, loan-out or purchase agreement shall be referred to hereafter as “compensation claims” or “claims for compensation.”) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the grievance committee and arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction to render an award for compensation or payment exceeding the sum of four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000.00) for a theatrical or television employment or purchase. (This amount is herein referred to as the “jurisdictional maximum.”) If a compensation claim exceeds the jurisdictional maximum, the claim may nevertheless be submitted to grievance and/or arbitration, but by such submission the Guild and writer waive any award exceeding the jurisdictional maximum and shall have no further claim or right with respect to any amount in excess of the jurisdictional maximum. A claim for compensation cannot be split nor may more than one (1) grievance or arbitration proceeding be brought for the purpose of avoiding the jurisdictional maximum.
4.	In any grievance or arbitration proceeding with respect to a claim for compensation brought under subparagraph 3. of this Article 10.A., the Company may, but need not, assert any and all defenses, including defenses based on an alleged right of suspension or termination, and any counterclaim or setoff (hereinafter referred to as “cross-claim”). A cross-claim is either mandatory or permissive. A mandatory cross-claim is

Provided that the Company has obtained knowledge of the facts upon which the cross-claim is based, the Company shall assert any and all mandatory cross-claims in any arbitration proceeding involving a compensation claim. If the amount claimed by the Company in a cross-claim exceeds the jurisdictional maximum of four hundred thousand dollars ($400,000.00), the Company shall have the option of submitting such cross-claim to grievance and (whether or not submitted to grievance) to arbitration or to institute an action at law or in equity with respect to such cross-claim. The Company may, but need not, assert any permissive cross-claim.

Any decision in grievance or award in arbitration purporting to determine or affect any of the aforementioned matters shall, to that extent, be of no force or effect whatsoever; provided, however, that if the Company asserts in any grievance or arbitration any defense or cross-claim involving or based upon the alleged exercise of a right of suspension or termination, the same shall be determined in such grievance and arbitration proceeding.
2,	The grievance committee and the arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to determine only such disputes as are submitted for grievance or arbitration under this Basic Agreement, subject to the limitations upon the powers of said grievance committee and arbitrator under this Basic Agreement.

1.	Any dispute as to whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction or whether any matter is arbitrable, provided, however, that the arbitrator may not order an arbitration of any matter not arbitrable as provided above.
2.	Any dispute concerning the credit provisions of this Basic Agreement. Such disputes are subject to the procedures set forth in Article 11 .E. of this Basic Agreement.

D.	REFUSAL TO ARBITRATE
A failure or refusal by any party to go to grievance on a matter subject to grievance or to arbitrate an arbitrable matter, including disputes as to jurisdiction and arbitrability pursuant to this Article 10, is a substantial breach of this Basic Agreement. A failure or refusal by any party to go to grievance on a matter subject to grievance or to arbitrate an arbitrable matter shall not limit, impair or divest the jurisdiction and powers of the grievance committee or arbitrator provided notice of grievance or arbitration has been served as provided herein. Grievance and arbitration may proceed despite the failure of a party to appear and the grievance committee or arbitrator may enter an award against such a party.

In the event of a television remake, the writer of the original material, if accorded credit, will be entitled to share, in accordance with such credit, in any additional compensation for television reruns or theatrical exhibition which may become due. Said minimum compensation shall not be diminished by virtue of any sharing of credit by said writer for the remake, (but this provision shall not be construed as affecting the rule that a bona fide team shall be considered a unit as provided in subparagraph B.l. of this Article).

A.	DEFINITION
The parties acknowledge that it is customary in the television industry to employ persons to render services as writers under the terms of this Basic Agreement, and the same persons to render services in other capacities which are not subject to this Basic Agreement. For the purposes of this Article 14, a person employed as a writer (as defined in Article 1 .C. 1 ,a. of this Basic Agreement) and also as an executive producer, producer, associate producer or story editor (as such terms are customarily used and understood in the television industry) is referred to as a “writer also employed in additional capacities,” or “such person” or “such writer.” Because of the difficulty of ascertaining the amount, duration, nature and extent of the services rendered by such person as a writer, and for the purpose of avoiding disputes concerning those matters and concerning the extent of such person’s contributions as a writer to the programs with respect to which he/she renders his/her services, the parties agree that the duration or term of such person’s employment as a writer in relation to a particular series, during a particular production season, shall be no less than the duration or term of his/her employment in the additional capacity in relation to such series, during such production season (except as provided in Paragraphs C. and I. of this Article 14), and that such person shall be employed as a writer in relation to such series, during such production season only in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14.
B.	CONTRACTS OF EMPLOYMENT
1.	The contract of employment of a writer also employed in additional capacities may cover both the employment as a writer and the
* employment in additional capacities, or there may be a separate contract covering the employment as a writer and a separate contract covering the employment in additional capacities, provided that in the latter case (i.e., when there are separate contracts) separate

compensation shall be provided for the services as a writer from the services in additional capacities, and such separately stated compensation for such person’s services as a writer shall not be less than the appropriate minimum compensation for a writer also employed in additional capacities as provided in Paragraph K. of this Article 14. Similarly, when the employment as a writer and in additional capacities is covered by the same contract, and the compensation as a writer is segregated from the compensation for the additional services, such compensation as a writer shall not be less than the appropriate minimum compensation for a writer also employed in additional capacities as provided in said Paragraph K. When the contract of employment of a writer also employed in additional capacities under such contract does not segregate his/her compensation as a writer from his/her compensation for his/her additional services, the Company shall have the right to allocate to his/her services as a writer not less than the appropriate minimum compensation for a writer also employed in additional capacities as
. provided in said Paragraph K, Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, none of the compensation due such person for his/her services in a capacity or capacities other than as a writer shall be offset or credited against any compensation due such person for his/her services as a writer.
C.	FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT
A writer also employed in additional capacities may be employed as a writer only on a week-to-week or term basis, (which employment may be exclusive), at no less than the appropriate minimum compensation provided in Paragraph K. of this Article 14 and subject to all of the provisions of this Basic Agreement; provided, however, that if the Company employs two (2) such persons, then the Company may employ other individuals (referred to in this Article 14 for convenience as “additional writers”) as writers also employed in additional capacities, in relation to the respective series, and such additional writers may be employed as writers on a week-to-week, term or freelance basis, and the duration or term of their employment need not be coterminous with the duration or term of their employment in additional capacities.

D.	AMOUNT, NATURE AND EXTENT OF SERVICES
Because of the difficulty of determining the amount, nature and extent of the services as a writer performed by a writer also employed in additional capacities and his/her contribution as a writer to any specific program of a series, it is agreed that, for the purposes of Paragraph G. of this Article 14, such writer (other than die additional writers referred to in Paragraph C. of this Article 14) shall be deemed to have performed services as a writer on each program of the series for which he/she is employed for which writing is done during the respective production season; provided, however, that if the employment of such writer has been suspended for cause, or terminated for cause (and for this purpose, any termination of employment of a writer employed on a week-to-week basis shall be deemed to be termination for cause), the number of programs of the respective series for which such writer shall be compensated pursuant to said Paragraph G. shall be proportionately reduced. In the case of suspension, the reduction shall be in the proportion that the length of the suspension bears to the overall period of employment of such writer during the respective production season; in the case of termination, the reduction shall be in the proportion that the length of the period from the date of termination to the completion of principal photography of the series during such production season bears to the period from the commencement of such person’s employment as a writer during such production season to the date of completion of principal photography of the series during such production season. If such calculation results in a fraction, no payment shall be made with respect to a fraction of less than fifty percent (50%), and full payment of one (1) program fee shall be made with respect to a fraction of fifty percent (50%) or more. An additional writer (as such is referred to in Paragraph C. above) who is employed on a week-to-week, term or freelance basis, need not be deemed to have performed services on each program of the series for which he/she is employed, but shall be entitled to a program fee (or to a share thereof) pursuant to Paragraph G. for each program for which he/she did render writing services during his/her employment. The Company shall notify the term or week-to-week writer that he/she is an additional writer at the time of his/her employment, or (as to a writer already employed) when he/she is assigned as an additional writer.

All writing services rendered by a writer also employed in additional capacities up to and including rewrites shall be deemed to be compensated by the minimum compensation provided for such writer pursuant to Paragraph K. of this Article 14.
2.	All formats, stories and teleplays written by such writers during their employment as writers also employed in additional capacities shall be separately compensated, without any offset, credit or allocation of any kind against or by any other compensation of any kind due said individual.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any writer hereunder who is guaranteed compensation of at least one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) for up to fifty-two (52) weeks of employment for both writing and non-writing services, the Company shall have the right to credit such compensation freely against the compensation which otherwise would be due to said writer for the writing of any literary material during such employment (but not against residuals or the program fees provided for in Paragraph G. below) or for non-writing services. In the event of such crediting, the applicable minimum compensation for writing services set forth in Paragraph K. below shall be credited at no less than one hundred ten percent (110%) thereof, and the compensation for the writing of stories and teleplays for non-pilot one-time programs ninety (90) minutes or longer shall be credited at no less than one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the applicable minimum therefor (but this provision shall not be construed to increase the writer’s compensation for any other purpose under this Basic Agreement, such as, but not limited to reruns and theatrical uses). In such event, the base amount upon which the Company shall compute Pension and Health contributions with respect to such employment shall be two hundred two thousand dollars ($202,000.00).

In any case in which a writer is employed to write one or more formats, stories or teleplays, or any combination (with or without options) of formats, stories or teleplays, on a freelance basis, concurrently with his/her employment as a producer, executive producer, associate producer or story editor, and whether or not such freelance employment is entered into at the same time as he/she enters into his/her employment in such other capacity or at a different time or times, such person shall not, by reason of such freelance employment, be deemed to be a “writer also employed in additional capacities” for any of the purposes of this Article 14, and this Article 14 shall in no way apply to such employment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 14.
F.	1. Becoming a “Writer Also Employed in Additional Capacities” After Initial Employment
If an individual is initially employed as an executive producer, producer, associate producer or story editor, but not as a writer, so that at the time of such employment such individual is not a “writer also employed in additional capacities” as defined in Paragraph A. of this Article 14, but if, during such employment, such individual, with the knowledge and consent of the Company, performs services as a writer for the series for which he/she is employed in such additional capacity, such individual shall, from the time he/she starts to perform such services as a writer, be deemed to be employed as a “writer also employed in additional capacities” for the purposes of this Article 14, except that: (a) if such writing services are limited to those described in subparagraphs (a) to (h), inclusive, of Article 1 .C.l.a. of this Basic Agreement and to those described in subparagraph E.3. of this Article 14; or (b) if such person is not a “writer,” by reason of the provisions of the third

With respect to contracts in existence on the date of execution of this Agreement, providing for employment as an executive producer, producer, associate producer or story editor, but not for employment as a writer, and which do not contain an express provision that the employee shall not render services as a writer, or is not employed to render services as a writer, such contracts shall be deemed to include such a provision for the purposes of this Paragraph F., if the Company serves written notice on such person to the effect that such person shall not render services as a writer (other than the excepted services referred to above in this subparagraph 1, and in subparagraph E.3. of this Article 14).
2.	Duration of Services
A person who becomes a writer also employed in additional capacities pursuant to subparagraph 1. of this Paragraph F. shall continue to be employed as a writer in connection with the respective series on a term contract basis for a period coterminous with the remainder of the duration or term of his/her employment in the other capacity or capacities in relation to such series during the respective production season or until the completion of principal photography of all programs of such series produced during such production season, whichever is the earlier, subject to the following provisions of this Paragraph F. and to the provisions of Paragraph I, of this Article 14. In such case, the Company shall have the right to allocate to his/her services as a writer no less than the appropriate minimum compensation for a writer also employed in additional capacities as provided in Paragraph K. of this Article 14.
3.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Paragraph F., if such person is an “additional writer,” as defined in Paragraph C. of this Article 14, then such person shall be deemed to be employed as a writer and also in additional capacities, pursuant to tiiis Paragraph F., only during the period during which

b.	the rate of compensation payable to such substitute
writer for writing shall be no less than the appropriate minimum rate of compensation provided for in Paragraph K. of this Article 14, or the rate paid to the replaced writer for writing, whichever is higher;
c.	the term of employment of the substitute writer shall be no less than the remainder of the term of employment of the replaced writer during the respective production season.
Subparagraph a. of this subparagraph 4. is to be interpreted as meaning that the Company shall pay the writer’s compensation but shall not be obligated to use such writer's services as a writer, and may employ other writers to perform such services. This subparagraph 4. does not apply to any "additional writer” referred to in subparagraph 3. of this Paragraph F.

a.	If such person, without the Company’s knowledge and consent, nevertheless does perform services as a writer on the series for which he/she is employed in the other capacity or capacities (other than the excepted writing services referred to in subparagraphs E.3. and F.L), then promptly after the Company or the Guild becomes aware of that fact, it shall notify the other party, and said parties shall jointly and cooperatively take appropriate steps designed to prevent such person from further performing unauthorized writing services. If the Guild believes that the Company knows of and condones such person’s unauthorized writing, or that it was originally the intent of the Company and its employee to evade the provisions of this Article 14, the Guild may bring the matter to arbitration (but not to grievance) pursuant to Articles 10 and 11 of this Basic Agreement. If the arbitrator rules in favor of the Guild, the arbitrator shall have the power to make a monetary award to the Guild, no part of which shall be paid or otherwise applied to the benefit of the writer, directly or indirectly. In determining the amount of such award, if any is granted, the arbitrator may consider, among other things, the amount of the minimum compensation which would have been paid to such writer had he/she initially been employed for the particular series during the particular production season as a writer and in additional capacities pursuant to this Article 14.

Program fees may not be prepaid nor may they be offset or credited against or by any other compensation of any kind due the respective writers and must be paid not later than the first regular payroll date following completion of principal photography of the respective program. Program fees shall not be included in “applicable minimum compensation’* for the purposes of Article 15.B. of this Basic Agreement, but shall be included in "initial compensation" for the purposes of Article 17 of this Basic Agreement.
H.	SUSPENSION, TERMINATION AND/OR OFFSET
Nothing in this Article 14 shall be interpreted as precluding the Company from exercising rights of suspension for cause or termination for cause under individual employment contracts, nor from exercising rights of offset, if any, in relation to an indebtedness of the writer to the Company pursuant to law, subject, however, to the provisions of Article 11. A.9. of this Basic Agreement.

3.	Payment
As to each such theatrical motion picture referred to in subparagraph 2. above (herein sometimes called "Such Picture"), except as provided in Article 64, the Company will pay to each participating writer (as such term is hereinafter defined) as additional compensation, a pro rata share of two percent (2%) (hereinafter referred to as the "percentage payment") of the Company's accountable receipts from the distribution of Such Picture on free television, computed as hereinafter provided and subject to the following conditions:
' a. The term "Producer’s gross," as used herein, means the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of Such Picture (who may be the Company or a distributor licensed by the Company) from licensing the right to exhibit Such Picture on free television; provided, however, that in the case of any Such Picture which is produced outside of the United States, if Such Picture is subject to this Basic Agreement and if such production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a "foreign production deal") pursuant to which a foreign producer or distributor provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of Such Picture or furnishes any other consideration for such production and a foreign distributor acquires one or more foreign territories for the distribution of Such Picture on free television, then no monies from any such distribution in any such foreign territory shall be included in Producer's gross except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Company or to the distributor of Such Picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom,

If the distributor of Such Picture does not distribute Such Picture directly to free television, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute Such Picture, then the "Producer's gross" shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit Such Picture on free television. In case of an outright sale of the free television distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the "Producer's gross." If any such outright sale shall include free television exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Company shall allocate to the free television exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the "Producer's gross." In reaching such determination, Company may consider the current market value of free television exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures.
If the Guild shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided. If the arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, he/she shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated. If the outright sale includes free television distribution rights to more than one motion picture, Company shall likewise allocate to each Such Picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the free television rights. If the Guild contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as above provided. If the arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and reasonable, he/she shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each Such Picture.

Guild’s right to elect. The parties further agree with reference to Article 15.A.3.: If, in the upcoming negotiations with SAG and DGA, the Company agrees to modify the basic substantive provisions regarding licensing of theatrical motion pictures for exhibition on free television, Company will so notify the Guild and accord it the opportunity to elect that this subparagraph be modified in the same manner, as of the date on which the Guild so notifies the Company. Adjustments which statistically maintain the relative allocations of proceeds derived from post-1960 theatrical motion pictures licensed to television among SAG, DGA and WGA as established in 1960 (i.e., the ratio of 6, 2 and 2 of accountable receipts, respectively) will not activate this provision, but an increase in the relative allocations to SAG or DGA in such proceeds will activate this provision, with any such increase to be accorded proportionately to WGA. Upon request, the Guild shall be provided with the statistics upon which the adjustments have been made, and the Guild's right to activate this provision shall be arbitrable. The Guild shall give notice of its election within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Company’s notice or after being provided with the statistics referred to, whichever is later. The election shall be limited to accepting the entire agreement reached with SAG or DGA on licensing theatrical motion pictures for exhibition on free television, and only such entire agreement, but with appropriate equivalent adjustment for writers for provisions peculiar to actors or directors, as the case may be.

"Accountable Receipts"
The term "accountable receipts,” as used herein, means the balance of the Producer's gross after deducting an arbitrary forty percent (40%) of the Producer's gross for distribution fees and expenses, except that in the case of an outright sale of free television distribution rights, there shall be deducted only an arbitrary ten percent (10%) of the Producer's gross for sales commissions and expenses of sale.
c. When Payment Obligation Accrues
Company's obligation shall accrue hereunder only after accountable receipts are received by Company, but as to foreign receipts such obligation shall accrue only when such receipts can be freely converted to U.S. dollars and are remitted to the United States and until such time, no frozen foreign receipts shall be included in accountable , receipts. Payment of amounts accruing hereunder shall
be made quarterly on the basis of quarterly statements, as hereinafter provided. Upon request, and if permitted by the authorities of a foreign country, the Company will transfer to any writer, in the currency of such foreign country, his/her share, if any, of frozen foreign receipts in such country, provided the writer will bear any costs involved; and such transfer shall be deemed to be

Concurrently with such transfer, the writer will pay to the Company in U.S. dollars the total amount the Company is required to withhold from such payment under all applicable laws. If the Company utilizes frozen foreign currencies derived from exhibition of Such Picture on free television by conversion thereof to properties that may be freely exported and turned to account, the amount so utilized by the Company shall be deemed to have been converted to U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category determined as above provided. Frozen foreign

receipts from free television shall be deemed to be released on a first-in, first-out basis, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved designate a specific period that would render such basis inapplicable. Such released funds shall be allocated between Such Picture and other motion pictures distributed by the distributor on free television in the same ratio that receipts, derived from the distribution of Such Picture on free television within the foreign country, bear to the total receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture and all other motion pictures on free television within the foreign country, during the applicable period, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved require another method of allocation, in which case such other method shall be used. Foreign receipts shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which such receipts are actually converted and remitted, and should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter shall be included in accountable receipts. Company shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Company. The Guild and the writers shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Company or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Company may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Company. No sums received by way of deposits or security need be included in Producer's gross until earned, but when the Company is paid a non-returnable advance by a distributor, such advance shall be included in the Producer's gross.
A "non-returnable advance" is to be included in "accountable receipts" when Such Picture is "available” and "identifiable" and the amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable."
ARTICLE 15.A.3.

Such Picture is "available” when the first of the following occurs:
(1)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise
exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
7)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
Such Picture is "identifiable" when the Company first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
The amount of the advance payment is "ascertainable" if:
(1)	the advance is for one (1) motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(2)	the total amount of the advance is for more than one (1) motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Company shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in "Producer's gross" for that quarter. The Company shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of "Producer's gross," which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an MBA arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If Such Picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount

An advance received by a Company's parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Company or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Company.
d.	If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to Such Picture on free television includes as a part thereof any iccordcd commercial or advertising material, the Company shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in Producer's gross hereunder.

If Such Picture is a remake of a prior motion picture, and if any of the writers of the prior motion picture receives writing credit for the remake, such writers shall be deemed to be "participating writers" for the purposes of this Article 15.A., but then only if their employment as writers for the prior motion picture, or if the purchase of literary material from them for the prior motion picture, was

As used herein, the term "Distributor's Foreign Gross" shall mean, with respect to any television film, the absolute gross income realized by the distributor of Such Picture from the foreign telecasting thereof and including, in the case of a "foreign territorial sale" by any such distributor, the income realized from such sale by such distributor but not the income realized by the "purchaser" or "licensee." The phrase "absolute gross income" shall not include:
(1)	Sums realized or held by the way of deposits or security, until and unless earned, other than such sums as are non-returnable.
"[S]uch sums as are non-returnable" are to be included in the "Distributor's Foreign Gross" when such television motion picture is "available" and "identifiable" and the amount of the non-returnable sum is "ascertainable."
Such television motion picture is "available" when the first of the following occurs:
(a)	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the

(b)	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
Such television motion picture is "identifiable" when the Company first knows or reasonably should have known that a given television motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
The amount of the non-returnable sum is "ascertainable" if:
(a)	the non-returnable sum is for one (1) television motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
(b)	the total amount of the non-returnable sum
is for more than one (I) motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Company shall fairly and reasonably allocate such sum among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable sum is to be included in Distributor's Foreign Gross for that quarter. The Company shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of Distributor's Foreign Gross, which includes the non-returnable sum, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an MBA arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.

A non-returnable sum received by a Company’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the payment is directed by the Company or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as a non-returnable sum received by the Company.

If there is a dispute as to whether rights have reverted, the Guild, if it is aware of such dispute prior to making such payment, will hold the amount applicable to such dispute in escrow in a trust account pending the resolution of such dispute.
In the case of such dispute, the writer may elect to submit the matter to arbitration under the procedures set forth in Article 11 .C. in lieu of any other remedy. The only parties to such arbitration shall be the writer and the

f.	The Company, at its option, may make the additional payment for theatrical exhibition at the time of the employment of the writer or at any time prior to the time the same is due (but only if the agreement between the Company and the writer with respect thereto is set forth in the writer's individual contract); provided that only such part of the compensation initially paid to the writer as shall exceed twice the applicable minimum compensation may be applied in prepayment of additional compensation for theatrical exhibition.

2.	Initial Qualification
The Company agrees that if a writer, while in the employ of the Company, writes an original story (or original story and screenplay), including a complete and developed plot and character development, he/she shall be initially qualified for separation of rights hereunder. A writer shall be deemed to have written a complete and developed plot and character development if he/she does so himself/herself or if the product of the work of such writer and writers previously (but after June 13, 1960) employed hereunder together constitute such a complete and developed plot and character development. Company also agrees that if it purchases from a professional writer such a story (or story and screenplay) written by such person, such person shall be initially qualified for separation of rights hereunder. If at the time of the transfer of rights to the material so purchased there is in existence a valid agreement for the publication or dramatic production of such material, then, for the purpose of this Article 16. A., such material shall be deemed to have been published or exploited.
With respect to a writer employed by the Company, if there is assigned material then:
a.	If the employment agreement (or written assignment delivered by the Company to the writer, in the case of a term contract, week-to-week contract, or multiple picture type employment) designates as the assigned material upon which the motion picture is to be based, or from which it is to be adapted, a story contained in a book, magazine, screenplay, play or other dramatic composition, treatment or story in any other form, then the writer, or any other writer working thereon, shall not be qualified for separation of rights unless:
(1)	With the knowledge and prior or subsequent consent of the Company the writer departed from
ARTICLE 16.A.2.
SEPARATION OF RIGHTS
(THEATRICAL)
-227-
the story contained in such assigned material and created an original story (or original story and screenplay) of the nature first described in this subparagraph 2., to the extent that there is no longer any substantial similarity between such story written by the writer and such story contained in the assigned material; or
(2)	The assigned material designated in the employment agreement or written assignment was not actually available to the writer, and the writer creates a story (or story and screenplay) of the nature first described in this subparagraph 2.
If the writer makes either of such contentions and the Company and writer cannot agree thereon, either the writer or the Company may submit the issue to arbitration and if it is determined by arbitration that the facts were as described in subparagraphs (1) or (2) above, then such writer shall be initially qualified for separation of rights hereunder.
b.	If a character or characters furnished by the Company is intended by the Company to be a principal character in the motion picture, and if such character was taken from material of any nature theretofore published or exploited in any manner or by any medium, and if such character is used in the screenplay as a principal character, then the writer shall not be qualified for separation of rights hereunder. If, however, any such character furnished by the Company as aforesaid was a minor character in previously published or otherwise exploited material, and with the prior or subsequent consent of the Company was converted by the writer into a principal character in the story (or story and screenplay) of the nature above described in this subparagraph 2., written by the writer, and if no minor character as furnished by the Company (as distinguished from such character or characters as developed by the writer) constitutes a substantial contribution to the final screenplay, and if no principal character furnished by the Company remains a principal

If such character or characters furnished by the Company were not taken from material theretofore published or exploited in any manner or by any medium, and if the writer were otherwise qualified for separation of rights hereunder, the writer shall not be deprived of such separation of rights, unless such character or characters furnished by the Company constitute a substantial contribution to the final screenplay, in which latter event such writer shall not be qualified for separation of rights hereunder.
3.	Final Qualification

(b)	Expedited Procedure
(i)	The Company may request the Guild at any time to specify the “negotiating writer” and the writer(s) who will write the novelization.

A.) and except for such musical compositions interpolated in the dramatic work (but not contained in whole or in part in the story, screenplay, or motion picture nor acquired in whole or in part from the Company), which neither contributes to nor forms a part of the story line of the dramatic work. With respect to the musical compositions in which the Company acquires rights under the preceding sentence, nothing contained in such sentence shall be construed to grant to Company any rights in any such musical compositions which are greater than the maximum rights therein at any time acquired or controlled by the writer.
(5)	If the Company, within the period above mentioned, exploits the dramatic rights, the Company will pay or cause to be paid to the writer sums equal to fifty percent (50%) of the minimum amounts payable to an “Author” under the terms of the Minimum Basic Production Contract recommended by the Dramatists Guild of the Authors League of America, Inc., in effect upon the commencement of the dramatic performance, unless the writer is the “Author” of the dramatic work, in which case the writer shall only be entitled to the minimum amounts payable pursuant. to such Minimum Basic Production Contract in effect when the writing services as such “Author” of the dramatic work are performed.

The payments to be made under this subparagraph (5) to the writer shall be made when, as and if percentages of gross box office receipts are paid to the “Author” by the “Producer” under such Minimum Basic Production Contract, or would otherwise be payable to such “Author,” as aforesaid, except by reason of the deferment thereof because of prepayment against such percentages. For purposes of this subparagraph (5), there shall not be offset against the minimum percentages of such gross box office receipts otherwise payable to such “Author” by such “Producer” under such Minimum Basic Production Contract payments set forth in “THIRD (a)” or “FOURTH (a)” of the Minimum Basic Production Contract now in effect (or comparable payments set forth in any Minimum Basic Production Contract hereafter in effect) which such “Producer” may have made thereunder to such “Author,” nor shall any percentages of any such payments be payable hereunder to the writer.

If the Company requests the writer to do so, the writer agrees to use the title of the motion picture as the title of the dramatic work. If, prior to the release of the motion picture by the Company, it is . determined that the writer is entitled to separation of rights in the manner hereinafter provided and, if, prior to such release, the writer exercises any dramatic rights licensed hereunder, the Company may, but shall not be required to, use the title of the dramatic work or any translation or adaptation thereof as the title of the motion picture.

If, within such period, the Company notifies the writer that it does not elect to provide such financing, or fails within the thirty (30) day period to respond to the writer’s notice, then the writer may obtain the required financing elsewhere, but the writer agrees that he/she will not offer to any lender or investor terms or conditions more favorable in any respect to such lender or investor than those set forth in writer’s notice to the Company, without again notifying the Company of such more favorable terms or conditions, and permitting the Company a period of thirty (30) days within which to accept or reject the writer’s proposal in the manner above provided.

(If such writer is unable to perform such services or waives his/her right, the Company may engage another writer.) If the writer performs the rewrite and Company thereafter contemplates replacing the original writer, a senior production executive who has read the material shall discuss with the writer the Company’s view and give the writer a reasonable opportunity to discuss continuing to perform services on the project.
In addition, the Company shall offer such writer the opportunity to perform one (1) additional set of revisions, if any are required by the Company, because of a changed or new element (e.g., director or principal performer) assigned to the development or production of the writer’s screenplay. The Company’s obligation to make such an offer shall exist for a period of three (3) years after delivery of the writer’s first or final set of revisions, whichever occurs later.

Within seven (7) days (excluding non-business days as provided in Article 43) after receipt of such notice, Company may, by written notice to the writer, elect to purchase, license or otherwise acquire the rights involved on the terms set forth in writer’s notice, in which case Company and writer will enter into an agreement upon such terms. If, within the seven (7) day period, Company notifies the writer that it does not elect to exercise its right of first refusal, or fails to give writer any written notice, the writer shall be free to enter into an agreement with such third party, but may not do so on terms more favorable to the third party than those set forth in the notice to the Company without again submitting the more favorable terms to the Company for first refusal, as herein provided.

If at any time the Company wishes (1) to secure protection against a competitive use for which no period of non-competitive use is prescribed in subparagraph 3.b. above, or (2) to extend any period of non-competitive use prescribed in subparagraph 3.b. above, or (3) to extend the four (4) year period of the right of first refusal prescribed in subparagraph 3.c. above, or (4) to secure a right of first refusal on reserved dramatic or publication rights, it will negotiate therefor through the Guild.
It is understood that in acquiring any reserved right the Company may designate related or subsidiary rights that it wishes to acquire and negative covenants concerning the use of competing rights that it wishes to secure. The Guild will include such related and subsidiary rights and negative covenants in the price quoted for the reserved right acquired. For example, if the Company desires to acquire the dramatic rights, it may include limited publication, radio and television rights for advertising and publicizing the play, and may also require the writer to agree that he/she will not use or license or grant to others the right to use his/her reserved live and film television rights.

In regard to the reserved theatrical motion picture rights in any material to which the separation of rights provisions of this Article 16.B. apply, if the writer commences the production of a theatrical motion picture based thereon, or has sold, licensed or otherwise disposed of the theatrical motion picture rights in such material (as permitted herein) and shall notify the Company thereof in writing, then, unless prior to receipt of such notice Company has commenced the production of a television motion picture which is a remake of the television motion picture initially based upon such material, the Company will not thereafter exercise or sell, license or otherwise dispose of the television remake rights in such material. If the Company acquires the theatrical motion picture rights in such material prior to the time the writer has commenced the production of a television motion picture based thereon, or has sold, licensed or otherwise disposed of his/her non-exclusive television rights in such material, the writer will not thereafter exercise or sell, license or otherwise dispose of his/her non-exclusive television rights in such material.

in this Article shall limit the submission of original stories or prevent the Company from discussing with any writer any ideas suggested by such writer, or discussing with any writer any ideas or any material suggested by the Company in order to determine the writer’s thoughts and reactions with respect to any such idea or other material to determine the writer’s suitability for an assignment, provided, however, that any such discussion relating to an assignment shall be subject to the provisions of subparagraph 3. hereof.
a.	A writer’s initial interview with the Company concerning employment in connection with an assignment may only be with (1) a person who is empowered to make, subject to the negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions, the final creative decision to engage a writer for an assignment, or (2) a person designated by the Company to interview writers with rcgaid to the particular program, except that a writer’s initial interview with the Company at the Company’s request concerning employment in connection with an assignment for an episodic series may only be with a producer or other person who is empowered to make the final creative decision to engage a writer for an assignment,
b.	Unless a commitment was made by the Company in such initial interview, a second interview by the writer with the Company concerning the same assignment may only be with a person who, without reference to or consultation with any other person, firm or corporation, including but not limited to, network or sponsor, is empowered to make, subject to the negotiation of mutually acceptable terms and conditions, the final decision to engage a writer for an assignment. In no event may a third interview by the writer with the Company take place concerning such assignment, nor may the Company request the writer to render any writing services, unless there has first been a business meeting between the writer, his/her agent or representative, and the business affairs executive or other executive of the Company charged with responsibility for negotiating the terms and conditions of a proposed

However, if a time emergency does not permit such business meeting to precede such third interview, such business meeting may take place after such third interview if there has been agreement prior thereto as to the monies to be paid the writer.
For the purpose of this subparagraph 3., an interview shall not be deemed to include (1) a telephone request by Company addressed either to the agent or the writer solely for information concerning the writer’s availability for employment or as to his/her credits, or (2) an appointment solicited by the writer, the purpose of which is to inform Company of the writer’s availability for employment or as to his/her credits, or (3) motion picture screenings. It is expressly understood that the writer may in no event be required to deliver any material written by him/her until all the terms and conditions relating to his/her employment in connection with such material have been agreed upon.
c.	If in the first interview the writer gives a story, then a second meeting at the request of the Company concerning that story shall constitute a story commitment at minimum compensation.
d.	If, at the request of the Company, the writer gives a story, either by telephone or in person or otherwise, then a meeting on that story at the request of the Company is a commitment. The parties hereto agree that the use of a telephone call, initiated by an authorized representative of the Company, as a method of circumventing a meeting in person to discuss the story is a violation of the provisions of the preceding sentence.
e.	(1) With respect to an episodic series or once-per-week serial for which more than six (6) episodes, excluding the pilot, have been ordered, Company shall have the option of interviewing not less than one (1) freelance writer for each stoiy commitment

The number of such interviews may be reduced by one (1) for each freelance assignment made. It is understood that the requirement for such interview shall not be deemed to imply in any way a commitment for employment.
Company shall furnish the Guild, upon request, written reports containing the name of the Company, the name of the particular series, the date of and number of episodes in the network order, the number of story commitments in the network order, the names of the freelance writers interviewed, the dates of such interviews, and the names of all freelance writers employed by Company as a result of such interviews.

(3)	Company shall elect either subparagraph e.(l) or e.(2) above for each broadcast season of a series. However, if Company elects subparagraph e.(l) above and does not generate the levels of freelance employment specified in subparagraph e.(2) above, then Company must comply with subparagraph e.(2) in the subsequent season of such series. Subparagraph e.(l) would thereafter be available only if the levels of employment specified in subparagraph e.(2) were fulfilled in the immediately prior season of such series.
(4)	The foregoing access provisions under this Article 20.B.3. are not applicable to programs produced under Appendix B of this Agreement.
During the 1988 negotiations, the Guild raised concerns about increasing employment for freelance writers by strengthening the provisions of the existing contract with respect to such employment. According to the statistics provided by the Guild, on most series, freelance writers have, in fact, been employed at the levels proposed by the Guild.
In recognition of the Guild’s desire to encourage Companies to continue to employ freelance writers at those levels during the term of this Agreement, the parties have agreed as follows: In the event the Guild finds that a particular Company is not employing freelance writers at those levels, the Company, upon request of the Guild, will participate in a meeting with the Guild to discuss the Guild’s concerns. The Company will invite the persons responsible for making script assignments on the series in question to such meeting.

NON-DISCRIM INATION
H.	The affirmative action provisions contained in this Article 38 are adopted in reliance upon the EEOC’s affirmative action guidelines, codified in Title 29 CFR Part 1608. The Company and the WGA have conducted a reasonable self-analysis with respect to the employment of writers covered by this Agreement. This analysis has indicated that minorities (defined for purposes of Article 38 only as all persons not properly identified as “while (not Hispanic origin)” on EEO-1 reporting forms) constitute an undesirably low percentage of individuals who have worked under this Agreement. The Company and the WGA desire to maximize all protected groups’ access to the employment opportunities covered by this Agreement. Based on the aforementioned statistical analysis, the Company and the WGA conclude that there is a reasonable basis to take affirmative action. This affirmative action will insure that all groups have access to said employment opportunities. This affirmative action plan was initially dated June 2, 1982, and was modified as of March 1, 1985, as of August 8, 1988, as of May 2, 1992, as of May 2, 1995, as of May 2, 1998 and as of May 2, 2001. The plan is temporary, will be reexamined with each successive collective bargaining agreement, is not intended to maintain a racial balance, is not intended to require the employment of any particular person or person of any particular race or national origin for any particular employment opportunity, but is simply designed to create training and employment opportunities for persons of all protected groups. This plan is voluntarily entered into by the Company and the WGA. It is under no circumstances designed to require the Company to hire unqualified persons.
ARTICLE 39	PILOT SCREENING (TELEVISION)
If more than five (5) writers are invited to the screening, the Company will give the Guild the names of the writers invited and will inform the individual writers merely of the number invited. Company will also inform the writer or his/her agent of the approximate number of assignments open to the best of the Company’s knowledge at the time such a writer is invited.

It is the policy of the Company to encourage such participation. With respect to discussions not covered under Paragraph A. below, if the writer of the screenplay or teleplay notifies the Company he/she wishes to participate in such discussions, Company shall in good faith invite such participation to such extent as may be feasible under the circumstances, it being understood that the Company shall have the right to determine who shall or shall not be present at a particular conference.

“Shopping” is defined to mean submitting the literary material to a third party or parties and specifically does not include submitting the material to individuals within the Company. If the Company has an option to acquire motion picture or television rights in literary material, or has acquired motion picture or television rights in literary material, the Company may submit such literary material to any third party or parties without restriction or penalty, except as may be otherwise provided in the agreement granting such option or rights.
ARTICLE 50	COPYRIGHT (TELEVISION)
Company agrees that as to each television motion picture based upon literary material which is subject to the provisions of Article 16 hereof, prior to the first public broadcast by television or other public exhibition thereof for profit, and in order that such motion picture and its underlying material shall (to the extent that such motion picture or material is capable of copyright by the affixation of such notice) be protected for copyright purposes, it will place upon such motion picture a notice, which may be one of the following:

proper indemnification from the writer, the Company or copyright owner of a motion picture will join in any suit for infringement of any of the rights reserved to the writer hereunder, if the writer is advised by counsel that the Company or such copyright owner is a proper or necessary party to any such lawsuit, but failure to join in any such suit shall not constitute a default by the Company or a breach of this Basic Agreement, unless the writer is thereby deprived of the opportunity to prosecute such suit. Company and writer agree, at request of the other, to join in the execution of any documents which either may deem reasonably necessary to protect the rights reserved or which revert to it or him/her hereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company agrees to execute and deliver to writer an assignment under the copyright of all rights in the copyright reserved or which may revert to writer pursuant to the provisions hereof, such assignment to be in the form of a quitclaim except that the delivery and acceptance of such quitclaim shall not be deemed to have relieved Company of any of its obligations herein elsewhere contained with respect to the protection of the rights reserved to the writer.
Within twelve (12) months from the commencement of the term hereof, a committee composed equally of representatives of the Guild and the Alliance of Motion Picture & Television Producers, Inc. shall meet to reach mutual agreement as to the proper copyright procedure to be followed in order to assure protection of literary material contained on videotape.
Either party may reopen with respect to this Article 50 if the Copyright Act is revised during the term of this Basic Agreement and the parties agree to bargain in good faith.

ARTICLE 51	SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
A.	The provisions of this Article 51 relate and apply only to motion pictures as defined in Article l.A.l. and I.A.2.:
1.	produced by the Company or within the provisions of subparagraph C.8.a. of this Article 51, and
-359-
ARTICLE 51 .A. 1.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
2.	the principal photography of which commenced on or after May 2, 2001, which motion pictures are, either during the term hereof or at any time thereafter, released in Supplemental Markets (as defined below), and
3.	based upon a story or screenplay (the word “screenplay” shall be deemed to include teleplay, for the purposes of this Article) written by a writer while in the employ of the Company or in the employ of the actual producing Company as described in subparagraph C.8.a. of this Article 51 (to which employment the provisions of this Basic Agreement apply as provided in Article 5 hereof) or acquired by the Company (or such actual producing Company) from a professional writer (to which acquisition the provisions of this Basic Agreement apply as provided in Article 5 hereof), which writer or professional writer received or receives screen credit for authorship of such story or screenplay, as provided in the appropriate Theatrical or Television Schedule A, as the case may be.
B.	DEFINITIONS. The term “Supplemental Markets,” as used in this Agreement, means only: The exhibition of motion pictures by means of cassettes (to the limited extent provided in subparagraph B.l.), pay-type CATV, or pay television, as those terms are hereafter defined in this Article 51.B., and the exhibition of television motion pictures on any commercial carrier such as commercial airlines, trains, ships, and buses (referred to herein as “in-flight”).
■ I. The term “videodisc/videocassette," as used in this Article 51, shall mean disc, cassette, cartridge and/or other device serving a similar function which is sold or rented for play on a hometype television screen in the home or in closed circuit use such as in hotel rooms.
2. The term “pay television” or “pay-type CATV,” as used in this Article 51, shall mean exhibition on a home-type television screen by means of telecast, cable, closed circuit, satellite to home or CATV where substantially all licensed systems meet the following tests:
a.	A separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a substantial charge
-360-
ARTICLE 51.A.2.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel;
and/or
b.	The subscriber pays for the program or programs selected (except that a program or programs selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television);
and/or
c.	The subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a substantial charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television systems.
The term “Supplemental Markets” does not include the exhibition of a motion picture by cassette or otherwise over a television broadcast station in free television, or in theatrical exhibition and, for this purpose, “theatrical exhibition” includes what has previously been considered to be the educational market, the exhibition of theatrical motion pictures on any commercial carrier (referred to herein as “inflight”), such as commercial airlines, trains, ships and buses, and other uses which have been traditionally considered theatrical exhibition of theatrical motion pictures. Whenever reference is made in this Agreement to pay-type CATV or pay television, such reference shall be deemed to include only those uses of motion pictures as to which a charge is actually made to the subscriber (which may be a hotel, motel or other accommodation) for the program viewed, or for which the subscriber or viewer has the option, for a payment, to receive special programming over one or more special channels.
With respect to theatrical motion pictures, the Company has agreed to the inclusion of pay-type CATV and pay television in the “Supplemental Markets” because under the present pattern of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, pay-type CATV and pay television are supplemental to the primary market. The Company
-361 -
ARTICLE 51.B.2.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
reserves the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that pay-type CATV and/or pay television are no longer a “Supplemental Market” but constitute or are a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical motion pictures, and that, therefore, no additional payment pursuant to this Article should be made with respect to the release of theatrical motion pictures (including those covered by this Agreement) in said markets. The Guild reserves the right to contend in future negotiations that the method of employment and payment provided for in this Basic Agreement for writers of motion pictures are applicable and appropriate to employment and payment to writers of literary materials written directly for motion pictures intended primarily for release on pay-type CATV, pay television or cassettes, and that the provisions of this Agreement with respect to all kinds of “Supplemental Markets,” whether they are or have become primary markets or not, shall be improved for the benefit of the writers of literary materials for said markets. Nothing herein shall limit the scope of negotiations on said subjects.
C. 1. a. As to each such motion picture referred to in Article 51 .A. above, (herein sometimes called “Such Picture”), the Company will pay to each participating writer (as defined in Article 51.C.5.), as additional compensation, a pro rata share of one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) (hereinafter referred to as the “percentage payment”) of the Company’s accountable receipts from the distribution of Such Picture to pay-type CATV or pay television (as defined in this Article 51) or the in-flight exhibition of television motion pictures, computed as hereinafter provided and subject to the following conditions:
The term “Producer’s gross,” as used herein, means the worldwide total gross receipts derived by the distributor of Such Picture (who may be the Company or a distributor licensed by the Company) from licensing the right to exhibit Such Picture on pay-type CATV or pay television (as defined in Article 51 of this Basic Agreement). The Producer’s gross shall not include sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on
ARTICLE 5 l.B.2.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
-362-
any monies to be remitted to or by the Producer, but there shall not be excluded from Producer’s gross any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Producer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business.
The term “accountable receipts” as .used herein, means one hundred percent (100%) of the “Producer’s gross.”
If the distributor of Such Picture does not distribute Such Picture directly on pay-type CATV or pay television as defined in Article 51 of this Basic Agreement, but employs a subdistributor to so distribute Such Picture, then the “Producer’s gross” shall be the monies defined above in this Article 51 ,C. 1 .a. derived by such subdistributor from licensing the right to exhibit Such Picture on pay-type CATV or pay television.
b.	As to each Such Picture, the Company will pay to each participating writer (as defined in Article 51.C.5. of this Basic Agreement), as additional compensation, apro rata share of one and five-tenths percent (1.5%) (hereinafter referred to as the “percentage payment”) of the “Producer’s gross,” as defined below, derived from the distribution of Such Picture on videodiscs or videocassettes until the Producer’s gross equals one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). Thereafter, the Company shall pay a pro rata share of one and eighttenths percent (1.8%) of the Producer’s gross in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) derived from distribution of each Such Picture on videodiscs or videocassettes.
If the Company is the Distributor or the Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Company, the “Producer’s gross” derived from the distribution of Such Picture on videodiscs or videocassettes shall be twenty percent (20%) of the worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor. In such cases, if the Distributor is also the retailer, a reasonable allocation of the retail gross receipts shall be made as between the
• 363-
ARTICLE 5LC.1.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
Distributor as distributor and the Distributor as retailer, and twenty percent (20%) of the former only shall be deemed to be “Producer’s gross.” The reasonableness of such allocation shall be subject to arbitration and, in such arbitration, generally prevailing trade practices in the videodisc and videocassette industry with respect to dealings between non-related companies shall be relevant evidence. Such worldwide wholesale receipts shall not include:
(1)	Rebates, credits or repayments for cassettes returned (and, in this connection, the Producer shall have the right to set up a reasonable reserve for returns);
(2)	Sums required to be paid or withheld as taxes, in the nature of turnover taxes, sales taxes or similar taxes based on the actual receipts of such motion picture or on any monies to be remitted to or by the Producer, but there shall not be excluded from Producer’s gross any net income tax, franchise tax or excess profit tax or similar tax payable by the Producer or such Distributor on its net income or for the privilege of doing business.
If the Distributor is not the Company and is not owned by or affiliated with the Company, the term “Producer’s gross” shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the fees received by the Company from licensing the right to distribute each Such Picture on videodiscs or videocassettes.
c.	Provided, however, with respect to Article 51 .C. 1 .a. and b. above, that in the case of any Such Picture which is produced outside of the United States, if Such Picture is subject to this Basic Agreement and if such production is under an arrangement (herein referred to as a “foreign production deal”) pursuant to which a foreign producer or distributor provides or guarantees any of the financing for the production of Such Picture or furnishes any other consideration for such production and a foreign
ARTICLE 5 l.C.l.	-364-
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
distributor acquires one or more foreign territories for the distribution of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets, then no monies from any such distribution in any such foreign territory shall be included in Producer’s gross except to the extent such foreign producer or foreign distributor is obligated to account to Company or to the distributor of Such Picture for such monies, and except for gross receipts received by such foreign distributor from such distribution in the United Kingdom.
In case of an outright sale of the Supplemental Markets distribution rights for the entire world, or any territory or country, the income derived by the seller from such sale, but not the income realized by the purchaser or licensee of such rights, shall be the “Producer’s gross.”
If any such outright sale shall include Supplemental Markets exhibition rights and other rights, then (but only for the purpose of the computation required hereunder) the Company shall allocate to the Supplemental Markets exhibition rights a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price which shall, for the purpose hereof, be the “Producer’s gross.” In reaching such determination, Company may consider the current market value of Supplemental Markets exhibition rights in comparable motion pictures. If the Guild shall contend that the amount so allocated was not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration as herein provided. In the event the arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not reasonable and fair, the arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated. If the outright sale includes Supplemental Markets distribution rights to more than one motion picture, Company shall likewise allocate to each Such Picture a fair and reasonable portion of the sales price of the Supplemental Markets rights. If the Guild contends that such allocation is not fair and reasonable, the question may be determined by submission to arbitration as above provided. If the arbitrator shall find that such allocation was not fair and
- 365 -
ARTICLE 51.C.1.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
reasonable, the arbitrator shall determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated to each Such Picture. Nothing with respect to the price received on the outright sale of only Supplemental Markets distribution rights in a single Such Picture shall be subject to arbitration except that, in the event of a dispute, there may be arbitrated the question of whether the price reported by the Company to the Guild as having been received by the Company on such outright sale is less than the amount actually received by the Company on such outright sale.
d.	If Such Picture, in whole or in substantial part, is used in
an interactive program, the provisions of Article 64 shall apply.
2.	[Inserted as the next to last unnumbered paragraph of Article 51.C.l,a.]
3.	Company’s obligation shall accrue hereunder only after Producer’s gross is received by Company but, as to foreign receipts, such obligation shall accrue only when such receipts can be freely converted to U.S. dollars and are remitted to the United States, and, until such time, no frozen foreign receipts shall be included in Producer’s gross. Payment of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made quarterly on the basis of quarterly statements, as hereinafter provided.
Upon request, and if permitted by the authorities of a foreign country, the Company will transfer to any writer, in the currency of such foreign country, his/her share, if any, of frozen foreign receipts in such country, provided the writer will bear any costs involved. Such transfer shall be deemed to be payment to the writer of an equivalent number of U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category as determined by the Company. Concurrently with such transfer, the writer will pay to the Company in U.S. dollars the total amount the Company is required to withhold from such payment under all applicable laws. If the Company utilizes frozen foreign currencies derived from exhibition of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets by conversion thereof to
ARTICLE 5 l.C.1.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
-366-
properties that may be freely exported and turned to account, the amount so utilized by the Company shall be deemed to have been converted to U.S. dollars at the then current free market rate for blocked funds of that category determined as above provided. Frozen foreign receipts from Supplemental Markets shall be deemed to be released on a first-in first-out basis, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved designate a specific period that would render such basis inapplicable. Such released funds shall be allocated between Such Picture and other motion pictures distributed by the distributor in Supplemental Markets in the same ratio that receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets within the foreign country bear to the total receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture and all other motion pictures in Supplemental Markets within the foreign country, during the applicable period, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved require another method of allocation, in which case such other method shall be used. Foreign receipts shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which such receipts are actually converted and remitted, and should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter shall be included in accountable receipts. Company shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Company. The Guild and the writers shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Company, or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Company may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Company. No sums received by way of deposits or security need be included in Producer’s gross until earned, but when the Company is paid a non-returnable advance by a distributor, such advance shall be included in the Producer’s gross.
A “non-returnable advance” is to be included in “Producer’s gross” when Such Picture is “available” and “identifiable” and the amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable.”
ARTICLE 51.C.3.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
-367-
Such Picture is “available” when the first of the following occurs:
a.	The product first may be exhibited or otherwise exploited by a specified method of distribution and in a territory under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement, or
b.	It first may be sold or rented by a retailer under the terms of the applicable license or distribution agreement.
Such Picture is “identifiable” when the Company first knows or reasonably should have known that a given motion picture is covered by a particular license or distribution agreement for its exploitation in the applicable market.
The amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable” if:
a.	the advance is for one (1) motion picture, means of exhibition, and territory, or
b.	the total amount of the advance is for more than one (1) motion picture, means of exhibition and/or territory, in which case the Company shall fairly and reasonably allocate such advance among the licensed motion pictures, exhibition markets and/or territorial markets. As each of these pictures becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable advance is to be included in Producer’s gross for that quarter. The Company shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of “Producer’s gross,” which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an MBA arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If Such Picture is available in any territory or by any means of exhibition, and is identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Company does not provide the WGA with the information required by the MBA and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in “Producer’s

gross” no later than six (6) months after the Company receives it.
An advance received by a Company’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the Company or license or distribution agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the Company.
4.	If any license or outright sale of exhibition rights to Such Picture in Supplemental Markets includes as a part thereof any recorded commercial or advertising material, the Company shall be permitted to allocate a reasonable amount (in accordance with then current standard charges in the industry) to such commercial or advertising material, and the amount so allocated shall not be included in Producer’s gross hereunder.
5.	The term “participating writer,” as used herein, means a writer who, while in the employ of the Company or in the employ of the actual Producing Company of Such Picture as described in subparagraph C.8.a. (to which employment the provisions of this Basic Agreement apply), or a professional writer from whom the Company (or such actual producer) acquired literary material (to which acquisition the provisions of this Basic Agreement apply), participated in the writing of and received credit pursuant to Theatrical Schedule A hereof or Television Schedule A hereof, as the case may be, for the writing of the story or screenplay, or story and teleplay, as the case may be, upon which Such Picture was based. If Such Picture is a remake of a prior motion picture, and if any of the writers of the prior motion picture receives writing credit for the remake, such writers shall be deemed to be “participating writers” for the purposes of this subparagraph 5., but only if their employment as writers for the prior motion picture, or if the purchase of literary material from them for the prior motion picture, was covered by and subject to a collective bargaining agreement with the Guild. The “pro rata share” payable to each participating writer shall be as follows:
Seventy-five percent (75%) thereof shall be payable to the credited screenplay writer or writers and twenty-five percent
ARTICLE 51.C.5.
SUPPLEMENTAL MARKETS
-369-
(25%) thereof shall be payable to the credited story or screen story writer or writers. In the event there is a minor credit, such as adaptation, the writer or writers receiving such minor credit shall be paid ten percent (10%) thereof, which sum shall be deducted from the screenplay or teleplay writers’ share. The writer or writers receiving a “Written by” credit shall be entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the monies.
Any participating writers receiving the same screen credit referred to above shall share equally in such percentage amount specified.
If there are one (1) or more participating writers who receive screenplay or teleplay credit and no credit is given for story or screen story, then the pro rata share which would have been payable to a participating writer had he/she received such story or screen story credit shall, subject to the provisions of the next following paragraph, be paid to the participating writers who receive such screenplay or teleplay credit.
If the writer’s services in Such Picture are performed for the Company on a loan-out basis, then, for the purposes of this Article, the Company shall be deemed to be the employer, and the lender shall not have any responsibility hereunder with respect to Such Picture. With respect to any Such Picture, if there are one (1) or more participating writers who receive credit as aforesaid and one (1) or more writers who perform services in connection with the writing of the story or teleplay or screenplay and receive screen credit in connection with Such Picture, but who are not subject to this Basic Agreement, then that portion of the applicable percentage payment as defined in this Article 51 which would otherwise have been payable to such one (1) or more writers not subject to this Basic Agreement may be retained by Company, and the Company shall not be obligated to pay such portion to any such participating writer receiving credit as aforesaid.
6.	Within a reasonable time after the expiration of each calendar or fiscal quarter, but not exceeding sixty (60) days, Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Guild a written report showing the Producer’s gross during the preceding

quarter from the distribution of each Such Picture by Company in Supplemental Markets with respect to which Company is required to make payments hereunder (whether distributed by the Company or through another distributor). The quarterly reports required in this Article 51.C.6. shall separately set forth the Producer’s gross from distribution of each Such Picture on videodiscs or videocassettes and the Producer’s gross from distribution of each Such Picture on pay-type CATV and/or pay television.
Concurrently with the furnishing of each quarterly report, the Company will make the payments shown to be due by such report. All payments shall be made by check payable to the order of the writers entitled thereto and shall be delivered to the Guild for forwarding to such writers. Compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the writers.
No such reports need be furnished with respect to any period during which there was no such Producer’s gross. The Company shall make available for inspection by the Guild all distributor’s statements and exhibitor’s statements which are available to the Company insofar as they relate to such Producer’s gross, and all the financial terms of contracts pertaining to such Producer’s gross, and the Guild shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of the Company as to such Producer’s gross pertaining to such distribution of any Such Picture, at whatever place or places such records are customarily kept by the Company. If the Guild requests that it be informed of the license fee paid under a license for the exhibition of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets, or if the Guild requests that it be sent an extract of the financial terms of such a license, and if such information is not extensive in nature, the Company will forward such information or extract without making it necessary for the Guild to send a representative to the offices of the Company. In general, the Company will cooperate in furnishing such information to the Guild by mail or telephone, where doing so is not unreasonable or burdensome. If more than one (1) picture is licensed in a single license agreement, the Company shall inform the Guild, at its request, of the identity of the pictures covered by the license, and shall make available to

Company agrees to cooperate in responding to reasonable inquiries from the Guild as to whether any Such Picture is currently being distributed for telecasting on pay television or in any other Supplemental Market as herein defined. An inadvertent failure to comply with the reporting provisions of this subparagraph 6. shall not constitute a default by the Company hereunder, provided such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Guild is received by the Company.
Company shall make all social security, withholding, unemployment insurance, and disability insurance payments required by law with respect to the additional compensation provided for in this Article 51.
If the Company shall fail to make any payment provided for in this Article 51 to be made to the writer when and as the same becomes due and payable, it shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1 ’/z%) per month on the unpaid balance thereof commencing to accrue on the earlier of:
a.	seven (7) days after notice in writing to Company from the Guild of such delinquency, or
b.	sixty (60) days after such payment becomes due and payable.
The compensation payable under this Article 51 shall be excluded from the gross compensation upon which the Company contributions are to be made to the Pension Plan.
If a participating writer’s employment agreement with the Company requires that the writer’s compensation shall be based, in whole or in part, upon, or measured by, a percentage of the gross receipts derived from the distribution of Such Picture, then such percentage compensation shall be credited against any amounts payable to the writer hereunder, and likewise any payment due to the writer hereunder shall be

For the purpose of applying such provisions of said Basic Agreement, the writer or writers of such material shall be treated in all respects as though the said material were written by such writer or writers while in the employ of the Buyer.
It is expressly understood and agreed that the rights of the Buyer to exhibit or license the exhibition of any motion picture based upon said material shall be subject to and conditioned upon the payment to the writer or writers involved of additional compensation, if any, required under Section C.

The Company agrees to give notice to the Guild of such sale, transfer or assignment of the nature above mentioned, with the name and address of the Buyer, and to deliver to the Guild an executed copy of such assumption agreement. An inadvertent failure on the part of the Company to comply with any of the provisions of this subparagraph 9. shall in no event constitute a default by the Company hereunder or a breach of this Basic Agreement, provided that such failure is cured promptly after notice thereof from the Guild.
Upon delivery of such assumption agreement, Company, or any subsequent owner obtaining the execution of such an assumption agreement, shall not be further liable to the Guild or any writer for the keeping of any such records or the payment of such additional compensation, or for compliance with credit obligations insofar as they relate to the exhibition of Such Picture in Supplemental Markets; and the Guild agrees to look exclusively to the party last executing such an assumption agreement for the keeping of such records, payment and compliance with credit obligations. If a company with headquarters outside the United States is a subsidiary of the Company, or the Company is the distributor of Such Picture for such a company, then, for the purposes of this subparagraph 9., such company shall be deemed to be headquartered only in the United States. The provisions of this Paragraph C. shall not apply to the distribution or exhibition in relation to Supplemental Markets of trailers or advertising a motion picture by shots, etc., substantially in the nature of a trailer, or to the use of stock shots.

D. If, in the upcoming negotiations with SAG and DGA, the Company agrees to modify the basic substantive provisions regarding Supplemental Markets, Company will so advise the Guild and accord it the opportunity to elect that this Article be modified in the same manner, as of the date on which the Guild so notifies the Company. Adjustments which statistically maintain the relative allocations of proceeds derived from Supplemental Markets among SAG, DGA and WGA as established in existing collective bargaining agreements will not activate this provision, but an increase in the relative allocations to SAG or DGA in such proceeds will activate this provision, with any such increase to be accorded proportionately to WGA. Upon request, the Guild shall be provided with the statistics upon which the adjustments have been made, and the Guild’s right to activate this provision shall be arbitrable. The Guild shall give notice of its election within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Company’s notice or after being provided with the statistics referred to, whichever is later. The election shall be limited to accepting the entire agreement reached with SAG or DGA on Supplemental Markets, and only such entire agreement, but with appropriate equivalent adjustment for writers for provisions peculiar to actors or directors, as the case may be.

A.	GENERAL
The Company shall make available for inspection by the Guild all the financial terms of contracts relevant to the determination of the accuracy of any payments due to a writer pursuant to this Agreement and the records showing the receipts and deductions to be accounted for. (For example, if the writer is to receive twenty-five percent (25%) of the Company’s net receipts from publishing the writer’s screenplay, the Company must make available for inspection by the Guild the financial terms of the agreement with the publisher and its records with respect to the receipts from the publisher.) The Guild shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine all such records at whatever place or places such records are customarily kept by the Company. If the Guild requests that it be sent an extract of such financial terms, and if such information is not extensive in nature, the Company will forward such extract, without making it necessary for the Guild to send a representative to the offices of the Company. In general, the Company will cooperate in furnishing such information to the Guild by mail or telephone, when doing so is not unreasonable or burdensome.
B.	RESIDUALS AUDITS
With regard to audits conducted by the Guild, sometimes in conjunction with other labor organizations, the Company shall provide access to its books and records which pertain to its obligation under the Basic Agreement to pay residuals. Such documents shall be made available for the audit at the Company’s business offices or other place or places where such records are customarily kept.
In connection with such an audit, the Company shall be deemed to have asserted that license agreements or other business records contain highly sensitive, competitive, confidential and proprietary information. Without the Guild conceding that such assertions are necessarily appropriate in all instances, the Guild and the Companies agree as follows:
Prior to the date of audit entry, the Guild will designate its employees, officers, directors or agents (hereinafter “representatives”) to act as

liaisons with the auditors and provide the representatives’ names and positions to the Company. The Guild’s representatives will be persons with a “need to know” audit-related information.

1.	to review, investigate or enforce claims against the audited Company arising under the MBA or applicable law,
2.	pursuant to legal process, or
3.	after obtaining the Company’s consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.
Any notes taken and/or workpapers prepared by the auditors also shall be subject to these provisions; however, the Guild may assert a claim of privilege as to such notes and/or workpapers.
Employees and representatives of the Guild may in their discretion discuss the audit findings, including the Company’s position, if known, with WGA-represented writers. By doing so, the Guild would not be violating a duty of confidentiality, if any, owed to the Company so long as the Guild’s communications are related to its obligation to review, investigate or enforce claims against the audited Company arising under the MBA or applicable law, pursuant to legal process, or after obtaining the Company’s consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.
If the Guild is required by legal process to disclose information obtained in a residuals audit, the Guild shall provide prompt written notice to the Company to permit the Company to object or to seek an appropriate protective order.
At the election of the Company, the auditors and other Guild representatives shall be required to sign an agreement duplicating the confidentiality provisions in the preceding paragraphs of this Paragraph B., but without any modifications to these provisions unless consented to by the Guild.

ARTICLE 64	REUSE OF MBA-COVERED MATERIAL IN INTERACTIVE PROGRAMS
A. Definitions and Coverage
1.	Definition of interactive program. An “interactive program” is a non-linear program that allows the individual viewer/ user(s) to control and/or manipulate in real time the output of the program elements via an interactive device. A “non-linear” program is a program in which the material embodied therein is intended to be viewed by the viewer/user(s) in such order selected by the viewer/userfs) and which does not have a predetermined “beginning” and “end” (although it may have an opening “default” menu or resting position from which selection of the order of viewing is determined by the viewer/ user(s)), as opposed to a “linear” program in which the material embodied therein is intended to be viewed (in its entirety or in

segments) in a predetermined order, but such material may be accessed randomly by the viewer/user(s). Such capability of random access shall not affect the status of such program as a “linear” program.
2.	Definition of interactive device. An “interactive device” is a device which is necessary in order to control and/or manipulate an interactive program. An interactive device may thus be a locally-operated device a single device that both reads the data from the storage medium and permits the viewerZuser(s) to control and/or manipulate the interactive program) or a remotely-operated device (i.e., a device that reads the data from the storage medium at a centrally-based location but which enables the viewer/user(s) to control and/or manipulate the interactive program from a remote location via wired or wireless transmission).
3.	Interactive rights license.
a.	Definition of interactive rights. See Articles 1 .B.9. and l.C.14.1.
b.	Definition of interactive rights licensee. An “interactive rights licensee” is the entity that first exploits, directly or indirectly, the interactive rights (such as by developing, producing or publishing an interactive program or performing similar functions, but not by reselling only).
An entity which both resells interactive rights and adds value to those rights by developing, producing, publishing or performing similar functions may qualify as an interactive rights licensee if the value thus added constitutes exploitation of the rights by making a substantial creative and/or technical contribution to the development, production or publication of the interactive program.
c.	Definition of interactive rights licensor; definition of interactive rights license. An “interactive rights licensor” is an entity that grants a license for interactive

rights to an “interactive rights licensee." An “interactive rights license” or an “interactive rights license agreement” includes a license (written or oral) or other permission to exploit interactive rights of, or granted by, an interactive rights licensor.
Applicable gross. “Applicable Gross” is the aggregate of all monies remitted by the interactive rights licensee to the interactive rights licensor in respect of a license of interactive rights, subject to the following:
a.	Unaffiliated licensee. If the interactive rights licensee is not an affiliated entity of the interactive rights licensor, then the Applicable Gross shall be the monies actually received by the interactive rights licensor in respect of the license of interactive rights.
b.	Affiliated licensee. If the interactive rights licensee is an affiliated entity of the interactive rights licensor, then the Applicable Gross shall be the monies actually received by the interactive rights licensor in respect of the license of interactive rights, provided the monies actually received by the interactive rights licensor in respect of the license of interactive rights are not less than the fair market value of the interactive rights. If such monies are less than the fair market value, then the Applicable Gross shall be the fair market value of the interactive rights.
c.	Licensor as producer, et al. If the interactive rights licensor is also the producer, developer, publisher and/or distributor of the interactive program, then the Applicable Gross shall be the fair market value of the interactive rights.
d.	Selling or reselling. No monies attributable to the functions of selling or reselling of the interactive rights, or earned thereby, shall be deducted from, or otherwise used to reduce, the Applicable Gross.

e.	Licensor as investor. If the interactive rights licensor invests in the production, development, publication and/or distribution of the interactive program or in the entity which performs such functions, any monies which are a recoupment of such investment by the interactive rights licensor shall not be included in the Applicable Gross. Monies received by way of investment recoupment shall be separate from monies received for the licensing of the interactive rights so long as the Applicable Gross, as reported to the Guild, is the fair market value of the interactive rights.
f.	Fair market value of the interactive rights. The fair market value of the interactive rights shall be determined by ascertaining the monies which would have been paid by an unaffiliated licensee to an interactive rights licensor for the license of the interactive rights.
g.	Licensing of multiple rights/multiple pictures. If, as part of the same or related transaction(s) for the license of interactive rights, other rights (e.g., theatrical exhibition and/or television distribution rights) are licensed, then a fair and reasonable allocation of the aggregate monies remitted shall be made in respect of the interactive rights. No deductions or expenses or other costs related to the license of other rights shall be deducted from this allocation and this allocation shall be the Applicable Gross.
Similarly, when interactive rights to more than one motion picture are licensed as part of the same or related transact! on (s), a fair and reasonable allocation of the aggregate monies remitted shall be made in respect of the interactive rights to each motion picture.
If, as part of the same or related transaction(s), excerpts exempt from payment and excerpts requiring payment pursuant to Article 64.B.2. below are licensed, a fair and reasonable allocation of the aggregate monies remitted shall be made in respect of the exempt and non-exempt excerpts.

When a covered motion picture is a remake of a prior motion picture, any writers of the prior motion picture who receive writing credit for the remake shall also be entitled to share in payments under this Paragraph B., but only if their employment as writers for the prior motion picture, or the purchase of their literary material for the prior motion picture, was covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the Guild.
For purposes of Article 64.B., the Company is deemed to have been the employer of a writer whose services were performed for the Company on a loan-out basis.

Payment of amounts accruing hereunder shall be made quarterly on the basis of quarterly statements, as hereinafter provided.

Upon request, and if permitted by the authorities of a foreign country, the Company (or Licensor, if applicable) will transfer to any writer, in the currency of such foreign country, his/her share, if any, of frozen foreign receipts in such country, provided the writer will bear any costs involved. Such transfer shall be deemed to be payment to the writer of an equivalent number of U.S. dollars at the then-current free market rate for blocked funds of that category as determined by the Company (or Licensor, if applicable). Concurrently with such transfer, the writer will pay to the Company (or Licensor, if applicable) in U.S. dollars the total amount the Company (or Licensor, if applicable) is required to withhold from such payment under all applicable laws. If the Company (or Licensor, if applicable) utilizes frozen foreign currencies derived from the license of interactive rights, as provided herein, by conversion thereof to properties that may be freely exported and turned to account, the amount so utilized by the Company (or Licensor, if applicable) shall be deemed to have been converted to U.S. dollars at the then-current free market rate for blocked funds of that category determined as above provided. Frozen foreign receipts from the license of interactive rights, as provided herein, shall be deemed to be released on a first-in first-out basis, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved designate a specific period that would render such basis inapplicable. Such released funds shall be allocated between the license of interactive rights, as provided herein, and other licenses of interactive rights granted by the licensor in the same ratio that receipts derived from the license of interactive rights, as provided herein, within the foreign country, bear to the total receipts derived from the license of interactive rights, as provided herein, and all other licenses of interactive rights within the foreign country, during the applicable period, unless the authorities of the foreign country involved require another method of allocation, in which case such other method shall be used.
Foreign receipts shall be accounted for in U.S. dollars at the rate of exchange at which such receipts are actually converted and remitted, and should any discounts, taxes, duties or charges be imposed in connection with the receipt or remittance of foreign funds, only so much of such funds as remain thereafter

shall be included in Applicable Gross. Company (or Licensor, if applicable) shall not be responsible for loss or diminution of foreign receipts as a result of any matter or thing not reasonably within the control of the Company (or Licensor, if applicable). The Guild and the writers shall be bound by any arrangements made in good faith by the Company (or Licensor, if applicable), or for its account, with respect to the deposit or remittance of foreign revenue. Frozen foreign receipts shall not be considered trust funds and the Company (or Licensor, if applicable) may freely commingle the same with other funds of the Company (or Licensor, if applicable). No sums received by way of deposits or security need be included in Applicable Gross until earned, but when the Licensor is paid a non-returnable advance for interactive rights by a licensee, such advance shall be included in the Applicable Gross. A “non-returnable advance” is to be included in Applicable Gross when interactive rights, as provided herein, are “available” and “identifiable” and the amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable.”
Interactive rights are “available” when the rights first may be exploited under the terms of the applicable license agreement.
Interactive rights are “identifiable” when the Company first knows or reasonably should have known that the interactive rights to a given motion picture and/or literary material are covered by a particular license.
The amount of the advance payment is “ascertainable” if:
a.	the advance is for interactive rights to one motion picture and/or literary material for one motion picture and territory, or
b.	the total amount of the advance is for multiple rights or interactive rights to multiple motion pictures and/or territories, in which case a fair and reasonable allocation of such advance shall be made among the licensed rights in accordance with subparagraph A.4. of this Article 64. As each of these interactive rights becomes identifiable and available, the allocated portion of the non-returnable

The Company shall notify the Guild of its allocation when the report of Applicable Gross, which includes the advance, is to be filed. The Guild has the right to challenge in an MBA arbitration a failure to allocate or any allocation that it contends is not fair and reasonable.
If interactive rights are available and identifiable and the amount of the advance is ascertainable, but the Company does not provide the WGA with the information required by the MBA and applicable law, then the advance shall be deemed includable in Applicable Gross no later than six (6) months after the licensor receives it.
An advance received by a Licensor’s parent, subsidiary or any other related or affiliated entity or successor-in-interest, or by any other entity to which the advance payment is directed by the licensor or license agreement, shall be considered as an advance payment received by the licensor.
Within a reasonable time after the expiration of each calendar or fiscal quarter, but not exceeding sixty (60) days, the Company will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Guild a written report showing the Applicable Gross during the preceding quarter from the licensing of interactive rights, as provided herein, with respect to which Company is required to make payments under this Article 64. These quarterly reports shall: (1) separately set forth the Applicable Gross from licensing interactive rights under Articles 64.B. 1., 64.B.2., 64.C., 64.D. 1. and 64.D.2. and (2) state whether the Applicable Gross used is monies received by the Licensor or fair market value.
Concurrently with the furnishing of each quarterly report, the Company will make the payments shown to be due by such report. All payments shall be made by check payable to the order of the writers entitled thereto, and shall be delivered to the Guild for forwarding to such writers. Compliance herewith shall constitute payment to the writers.

No such reports need be furnished with respect to any period during which there was no Applicable Gross.
An inadvertent failure to comply with the reporting provisions of this Article 64.E. shall not constitute a default by the Company under this Agreement, provided such failure is cured promptly after notice from the Guild is received by the Company.
The Company shall make available for inspection by the Guild all licensing statements which are available to the Company insofar as they relate to Applicable Gross, and all the financial terms of contracts pertaining to such Applicable Gross. The Guild shall have the right, at reasonable times, to examine the books and records of the Company as to such Applicable Gross, pertaining to such licensing of interactive rights, at whatever place or places such records are customarily kept by the Company. If the Guild requests that it be informed of the 1	fpp nniH nnrlpr rtn
or if the Guild requests that it be sent an extract of the financial terms of such a license, and if such information is not extensive in nature, the Company will forward such information or extract without making it necessary for the Guild to send a representative to the Company’s offices. In general, the Company will cooperate in furnishing such information to the Guild by mail or telephone, where doing so is not unreasonable or burdensome.
When interactive rights to more than one picture are licensed in a single license agreement, the Company shall inform the Guild, at its request, of the identity of the motion pictures, the interactive rights to which are covered by the license, and shall make available to inspection by the Guild in the office where such license agreement is customarily kept a copy of the terms of such license showing the titles of the motion pictures and/or literary material, the interactive rights to which are covered by the license, and the license fee for each. The Company agrees to cooperate in responding to reasonable inquiries from the Guild as to whether the interactive rights to any motion picture or literary material, as provided herein, are currently being licensed.

If the Company shall fail to make any payment provided for in this Article 64 to the writer when and as the same becomes due and payable, it shall bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance thereof commencing to accrue on the earlier of: (a) seven (7) days after notice in writing to Company from the Guild of such delinquency, or (b) sixty (60) days after such payment becomes due and payable.
The compensation payable under this Article 64 shall be excluded from the gross compensation upon which the Company’s contributions are to be made to the Pension and Health Plans.
2.	Crediting
If a writer's employment agreement with the Company requires that the writer’s compensation shall be based, in whole or in part, upon, or measured by, a percentage of the gross receipts derived from the licensing of interactive rights, then such percentage compensation shall be credited against any amounts payable to the writer hereunder, and likewise any payment due to the writer hereunder shall be credited against such percentage compensation. When all or a part of a writer’s compensation is a specified sum of money, commonly known and referred to as a “deferment,” such deferment may not be credited against amounts payable by the Company to such writer hereunder.
3.	Assumption Agreements
With respect to the interactive rights in any literary material or motion picture for which payment is due under this Article 64, the following provisions of subparagraphs 3.a., b. and c. shall apply.

There is no obligation under subparagraphs 3.a. or 3.c. for a Company to obtain an assumption agreement when the Company either does not own the interactive rights, the Company is the licensor of the interactive rights, or the Company exploits the interactive rights (i.e., the Company meets the definition of licensee in Article 64.A.3.b.).
a.	Licensor/Licensee’s Assumption Agreement
Prior to the commencement of principal photography of each motion picture, the reuse of which is governed by Article 64, if the Company (or Licensor, if applicable) is not also the licensor/licensee of the interactive rights to such literary material and/or motion picture, the Company (or Licensor, if applicable) shall obtain from the licensor/licensee having such rights and deliver to Guild a separate written agreement entitled “Licensor/ Licensee's Assumption Agreement.” This Assumption Agreement shall be made expressly for the benefit of the Guild as representative of the writers involved, by which such licensor/licensee agrees to assume and pay the amounts payable under this Article 64 when and as the same become due.

1,	Acknowledgments
The Guild and the Companies acknowledge that it is difficult to reach agreement on new or different terms and conditions in the Basic Agreement covering markets or areas of exploitation which are in the early stages of development. The market for reuse of MBA-covered material in interactive programs is in its infancy.
The Guild and the Companies have agreed to this Article 64 with the knowledge that distribution patterns for interactive programs not fully known, anticipated or appreciated at the time of the 1995 negotiations may well arise during the term of this Agreement or later.
2.	Cooperative Covenant
The parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve issues attributable to the factors acknowledged in subparagraph 1. above, including the settlement of disputes concerning contract interpretation. To assist in accomplishing the foregoing and to facilitate successful negotiations in the future (including in the CAC), the Guild and the Companies, through the AMPTP, will cooperate by sharing information, upon request, about the market for interactive programming, subject to appropriate protection for proprietary information.
A committee shall be formed to discuss definitions for the terms “news” and “promotional,” as used in the excerpt provisions of Article 64.B.2,

The parties agree to establish a joint Interactive Media Committee, composed of representatives from the Companies and the WGA, to discuss issues related to the appropriateness and/or administration of these provisions and any other issues related to interactive media that any party wishes to discuss.

The same notice must be given to a writer if the agreement to give source material credit is made while the writer is rendering his/her services. Notice shall include the wording of the source material credit if known to the Company. The Company shall not be
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A

thereby limited from making subsequent contractual obligations to give source material credit, as above provided, in connection with such photoplay. Neither the existence of any form of credit obligation nor the giving of any such credit information shall relieve a writer from his/her obligation to render services and otherwise perform as provided in his/her employment agreement. A Company which furnishes a writer hereunder with inaccurate or incorrect credit information shall not be deemed to be in breach of this Basic Agreement or its employment agreement with such writer, if the Company at the time of giving such credit information believes in good faith such information is correct.
The Company shall be deemed to be contractually obligated in any of the cases above mentioned if the Company in good faith considers itself so obligated.
Nothing herein contained shall limit the Company from using and purchasing source material, from entering into agreements to give source material credit therefor, as above provided, or from carrying out such credit obligations as may be therein provided.
3.	Screen credit on motion pictures on which one or more writers or teams has written both the story and the screenplay shall be worded "Written by. "
If a writer is entitled to "Written by" credit on a motion picture which he/she also produces or directs, unless the writer objects, nothing herein shall prevent according credit on the screen and/or in paid advertising in the following forms;
"Written and Produced by_________________________________, " or
"Written and Directed by, ” or "Written, Produced, and Directed by. "
4.	Screen credit for screenplay will not be shared by more than two (2) writers, except that in unusual cases, and solely as the result of arbitration, the names of three (3) writers or the names of writers constituting two (2) writing teams may be used. A writing team is two (2) writers who have been assigned at about the same time to the same script, or three (3) writers when employed pursuant to the provisions of Article 13.A.9., and who work together for approximately the same length of time on the script. The intention and spirit of the award of credits being to emphasize the prestige
-472-
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 2.e.
and importance of the screenplay achievement, the one (1), two (2) or at most three (3) writers, or two (2) teams, chiefly responsible for the completed work will be the only screen writers to receive screenplay credit. Story credit will not be shared by more than two (2) writers.
5.	The limitation on the number of credits provided for in Paragraph 4 shall apply to all feature-length motion pictures except episodic pictures (such as “Tales of Manhattan ” and “If I Had a Million ") and revues. A revue is a feature-length motion picture in which the story is subordinate to specialties, musical numbers or sketches, and in connection with which star or featured billing is given to the actors, singers, dancers, or musicians appearing in these separate specialties, musical numbers or sketches.
6.	Unless the story and/or screenplay writing is done entirely without any other writer, no designation of tentative story or screenplay credit to a production executive shall become final or effective unless approved by a credit arbitration as herein provided, in accordance with the Guild rules for determination of such credit.
7.	When more than one writer has participated in the authorship of a motion picture, then all participants will have the right to agree unanimously among themselves as to which of them shall receive writing credits on the screen, provided that: (a) the form of credit agreed upon is in accordance with the terms of this Schedule A; (b) the agreement is reached in advance of arbitration; and (c) the form of such credit is not suggested or directed by the Company. If such unanimous agreement is communicated to the Company before a final determination of credits hereunder, the Company will accept such designation of credits, and such agreed credits shall become final hereunder. The Company will confirm such agreed credits by sending notice thereof to all participants and the Guild, in the manner hereinafter provided in Paragraphs 11 and 12 hereof.
In any case in which a foreign law or government regulation applicable to the employment of a writer requires credit to be given, Company shall furnish the Guild with a copy of such law or governmental regulation together with the tentative notice of credit and the Guild agrees that credits determined shall include the minimum credit necessary to comply with such legal requirements.
8.	Writing credits as finally determined hereunder shall appear on the screen. If the writing credits appear in the main titles, they shall appear on a title
-473-
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 8
card immediately preceding the card on which appears credit to the director of the motion picture, provided such writing credits shall not be more than the second personal credit prior to the beginning of the motion picture.1 If there are no personal names or portions of personal names whatsoever in the main titles, except as part of the name of an entity, which name or portion of personal name does not appear in any other capacity on the motion picture, then the writing credits as finally determined hereunder may appear as the first credit in the end titles or immediately following the card on which appears the credit to the director and the writing credits may not appear in a position later than the second credit in the end titles after the body of the motion picture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the director is also the only person receiving "Produced by ’’ credit on the motion picture, the credit to the director may be combined in the form "Produced and Directed by" or "Directed and Produced by" on a single card.1 Writing credit shall appear on a separate card, except that when the sole credited writer of the screenplay is also the author of the source material, the source material credit may appear on the same card immediately below the "Screenplay by " credit.
Source material credits (if they appear on the screen) and writing credits finally determined hereunder shall, subject to the foregoing, appear only in the following manner:
a.	On one (1) title card on which there appear only writing and source material credits.
b.	On separate title cards on each of which there may appear any one (1) or more of such credits, and no other credits.
c.	On the main title card of the motion picture on which there may
appear any one (1) or more of such credits together with other credits.

PARAGRAPH 8
-474-
Screen credit for the writer of the screenplay shall be accorded in the same style and size of type as that used to accord screen credit to the individual producer or director of the motion picture, whichever is larger.
Whenever source material credit appears on the same title card as the “Screenplay by ” credit as described above, the screenplay credit must be the initial credit and must occupy not less than fifty percent (50%) of the credit card in type at least as large in all respects as that accorded the source material credit.
Whenever story credit, but no source material credit, appears on the same title card as the screenplay credit, the story credit and screenplay credit shall be in the same size type, the screenplay credit shall be the initial credit and shall occupy the top fifty percent (50%) of the card, and the story credit shall occupy the bottom fifty percent (50%) of the card, except that the requirements of this sentence shall not apply when there is a contrary contractual commitment entered into prior to March 2, 1977. The Company shall have the right to place the source material credit on another card so long as such other card is not inserted between the screenplay credit and the director’s credit. The foregoing provisions of this subparagraph and the preceding subparagraph shall not be applicable to contract commitments entered into prior to December 13,1963 which contain terms contrary thereto.
With regard to on-screen credits, the words “Written by, ” “Screenplay by, " “Story by, ” “Adaptation by ” or "Screen Story by” shall be at least one-half of the size of type used for the name(s) of the writer(s).
The Company shall submit to the WGA for review proposed on-screen credits (main and end titles) before prints are prepared. If, within five (5) days after such submission, the Guild protests in writing to the Company that such credits do not conform to the provisions of Theatrical Schedule A, then the Guild may, within twenty-four (24) hours after making such protest, submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 26 of Theatrical Schedule A. The arbitrator shall make his/her decision and deliver it to the respective offices of the Guild and the Company within twenty-four (24) hours after the dispute has been submitted to him/her. In the event of an emergency and upon the Company’s request, the Guild agrees to cooperate as fully as possible to review the main and end titles within twenty-four (24) hours.

In the event that the Company fails to submit its proposed on-screen credits to the Guild, the remedy for a third failure to do so shall be a payment of $500 to the credited writer(s) of the picture for which credits were not submitted; for a fourth failure, a payment of $ 1,000 to the credited writer(s) of the picture, and for each subsequent failure, a payment of $2,000 to the credited writer(s). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company fails to submit proposed on-screen credits and the on-screen credits violate the provisions of Theatrical Schedule A, the Guild may seek applicable remedies pursuant to Articles 10, 11 and 12.
9.	A writer who has participated in the writing of a screenplay, or a writer who has been employed by the Company on the story and/or screenplay, or who has sold or licensed literary material subject to this Basic Agreement, shall, for the purpose of this Basic Agreement, be considered a participant. As a participant, the writer shall be entitled to participate in the procedure for determination of screen credits. In addition, in the case of a remake, any writer who has received credit under this Agreement or a predecessor agreement to this Agreement for story or screenplay or teleplay in connection with a prior version of the motion picture previously produced for theatrical release, for free television or basic cable exhibition or for pay television or the videocassette/videodisc market shall also be considered a participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply if it conflicts with contractual commitments entered into prior to March 2, 1981.
10.	Prior to the final determination of screen credits, as provided herein, the work of participants not receiving screen credit may be publicized by the Company. After such a determination of screen credits, only persons receiving screen credits or source material credit may be so publicized.
11.	Before the writing credits for a motion picture are finally determined and as soon as practicable following completion of principal photography of such motion picture, the Company will send to each participant, or to the current agent of a participant if that participant so elects, and to the Guild concurrently a written notice which will state the Company’s choice of credit on a tentative basis, together with the names of all participants, their addresses last known to the Company, and if a participant is then also a director or producer of the motion picture, the notice will so indicate. A copy of the final shooting script (or if such script is not available, the latest revised script available) will be sent with the notice of tentative credits to each of the participating writers, or to the current agent of a participant if that participant so elects. When the Company deems its record of

participants incomplete, it may comply with the foregoing by giving notice to each writer whose name and address is furnished by the Guild within five (5) days after the Company’s request for such information, in addition to giving notice to each participant shown on its own records:
If there is confusion as to the identity of a participating writer listed on the Company’s notice of tentative credits because two (2) or more writers have the same first and last name, then Company shall, upon request of the Guild, furnish to the Guild such writer’s Social Security number, if known to the Company, or the employer identification number of such writer’s loan-out company.
The Company shall on such notice of tentative credits, for the information of the Guild and participants, state the form of any source material credit which Company intends to use in connection with the motion picture. Such credits shall not be subject to the provisions for protest and arbitration as hereinafter provided, but the Guild shall have the right to object to the form of such a credit.

When a Guild determination is so made, it shall be considered a final determination.
At the request of the Guild made to the Company on commencement of principal photography of such motion picture, the Company shall furnish the Guild with a list of all persons who, to the best of the Company's knowledge, are or were participants (see Paragraph 9 above) with respect to such motion picture. If, thereafter, any other writer is engaged by Company to render writing services on or in connection with such motion picture during principal photography, the Company will promptly notify the Guild of that fact. If the motion picture involved is a remake of an earlier motion picture produced by Company, the list of writers to be supplied by the Company pursuant to this paragraph shall include the name of any writer employed by the Company to render writing services with respect to the most recent prior production by Company of such earlier motion picture and who received screen credit for such writing services.
A casual or inadvertent failure by the Company to forward the notices, list, names or other information to the Guild or persons specified at the times or places designated pursuant to this Paragraph 11 shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Basic Agreement.
12.	The notice specified in Paragraph 11 hereof will be sent by telegraph to writers outside of the Los Angeles area or by telegram, messenger ur special delivery mail to writers in such area. In the case of a remake, the Company shall not be under any obligation to send any notice to any writer contributing to the screenplay or story of the original production unless such writer received screen credit in connection with such original production.
Notices may be sent by mail, telegram or personal delivery as above provided. If the notices are mailed, registered or certified mail shall be used, with return receipt requested; the failure of the addressee to sign or return the receipt shall not invalidate the notice.
13,	The Company will keep the final determination of screen credits open until a time specified in the notice by the Company, but such time will not be earlier than 6:00 p.m. of the tenth business day following the next day after the dispatch of the notice above specified; provided, however, that if, in the good faith judgment of the Company, there is an emergency requiring earlier determination and the Company so states in its notice, such time may be no earlier than 6:00 p.m. of the fifth business day following the next day
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 13
-479-
after the dispatch of the notice above specified. In the event of an emergency and on Company’s request, the Guild may reduce such “fifth business day’’ period. The Guild agrees to cooperate as fully as possible in considering such requests.
If, within the time specified, a written protest of the tentative credits has not been delivered to the Company from any participant or from the Guild, the tentative credits shall become final. Every protest^ including that of the Guild, shall state the grounds or basis therefor in the notice thereof. The Guild agrees not to use its right of protest indiscriminately.
14.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an arbitration has been conducted pursuant to the Basic Agreement to determine preliminary separation of rights, and if no additional writing is done thereafter, then the credits determined in the preliminary separation of rights arbitration shall become the final writing credits without the need for an additional credits arbitration. The Company nonetheless is required to submit a notice of tentative writing credits concurrently to the Guild, to each participating writer or to the current agent of each participating writer pursuant to Paragraph 11 of this Schedule A.
15.	Upon receipt of a protest, the Company shall notify the participants and the
Guild by telegraph informing them of the name of the protesting party and the new time set for final determination.
16.	If a unanimous designation of credits as provided for in Paragraph 7 hereof
or a request for arbitration as hereinafter provided is not communicated to the Company within the time limit set for the final determination of credits, the Company may make the tentative credits final.
17.	Any notice specified in the foregoing paragraphs shall, unless a specified form of service thereof is otherwise provided for herein, be sent by the Company by telegraphing, mailing or delivering the same to the last known address of the writer or may be delivered to the writer personally. If the notices are mailed, registered or certified mail shall be used with return receipt requested; the failure of the addressee to sign or return the receipt shall not invalidate the notice.
18.	Unless a unanimous agreement has been reached in accordance with Paragraph 7 hereof, any participant or the Guild may, within the period provided for in Paragraph 13 hereof, file with the Company at its studio and
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 13
-480-
the Guild at its Los Angeles or New York office a written request for arbitration of credits. In any case in which automatic credit arbitration is required under this Schedule A, the Guild will be deemed to have made a written request for arbitration of credits at the time the Company submits the notice of tentative credits and, in such case, Company will immediately make available to the Guild the material as provided for under this subparagraph.
The Guild, through its arbitration committee, shall make and advise the Company of its decision within the limitations of this Schedule A. Said decision shall be made and advised within twenty-one (21) business days of the request(s) for arbitration referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. If, in the good faith judgment of the Company, there is an emergency requiring an earlier decision and the Company so notifies the Guild, said decision shall be made and advised within ten (10) business days of the request(s) referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. If the arbitration committee does not render a decision within said period, as the same may have been extended by the Company, the Company may make the tentative credits final, provided the terms and provisions of this Paragraph 18 have been fully complied with by the Company.
In the event of an emergency and upon the Company’s request that the time for arbitration be shortened, the Guild agrees to cooperate as fully as possible. If the material is voluminous or complex, or if other circumstances beyond the control of the Guild necessitate a longer period in order to render a fair decision, and the Guild requests an extension of time for arbitration, the Company agrees to cooperate as fully as possible. The Company will not unreasonably deny the Guild’s request for an extension of time. Agreement for extensions of time shall be in writing and shall specify the new date by which the Company will be advised of the arbitration decision.
Prior to the rendition of the decision, a special committee of writers may make such investigations and conduct such hearings as may seem advisable to it. Immediately upon receipt of a request for arbitration, the Company shall make available to the Guild three (3) copies of the script, and three (3) copies of all available material written by the participants and three (3) copies of all available source material. In addition, the Company shall cooperate with the arbitration committee to arrive at a just determination by furnishing all available information relative to the arbitration. Upon request of the arbitration committee, the Company shall provide the committee with
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 18
-481 -
a copy of the cutting continuity if it is available at the time of arbitration. If no final shooting script is available, Company will provide the Guild with a videocassette or print of the motion picture.
The decision of the Guild arbitration committee, and any Policy Review Board established by the Guild in connection therewith, with respect to writing credits, insofar as it is rendered within the limitations of this Schedule A, shall be final, and the Company will accept and follow the designation of screen credits contained in such decision and all writers shall be bound thereby.
19.	The decision of the Guild arbitration committee may be published in such media as the Guild may determine. No writer or Company shall be entitled to collect damages or shall be entitled to injunctive relief as a result of any decision of die committee with regard to credits. In signing any contract incorporating by reference or otherwise all or part of this Basic Agreement, any writer or Company specifically waives all rights or claims against the Guild and/or its arbiters or any of them under the laws of libel or slander or otherwise with regard to proceedings before the Guild arbitration committee and any full and fair publication of the findings and/or decisions of such committee. The Guild and any writer signing any contract incorporating by reference or otherwise or referring to this Schedule A, and any writer consenting to the procedure set forth in this Schedule A, shall not have any rights or claims of any nature against any Company growing out of or concerning any action of the Guild or its arbiters or any of them, or any determination of credits in the manner provided in this Schedule A, and all such rights or claims are hereby specifically waived.
20.	In the event that, after the screen credits are determined as hereinabove provided, material changes are made in the literary material, either the Company or a participant and the Guild jointly may reopen the credit determination by making a claim to the Guild or Company, as the case may be, within forty-eight (48) hours after completion of the writing work claimed to justify the revision of credits. The procedure for determining revised credits in such cases will be the same as that provided for the original determination of credits.
The Company agrees to make revisions in advertising material previously forwarded to the processor or publisher to reflect such redetermined credits, provided that: (a) such revisions can physically and mechanically be made prior to the closing date of such processor or publisher and at reasonable
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 18

expense; and (b) the processor or publisher has not yet commenced work on that part of the material which the change would affect,
21,	No writer shall claim credit for any participation in the screen authorship of any motion picture for which the credits are to be determined by the procedure herein provided prior to the time when such credits have in fact actually been so determined, and no writer shall claim credits contrary to such determination.
22.	a. In any publicity issued or released prior to the final determination of credits as herein provided, the Company may include such screenplay or screenplay and story credits as the Company may in good faith believe to be a fair and truthful statement of authorship. After such final determination of credits, the Company shall not issue or release any publicity which shall state screenplay or screenplay and story authorship contrary to such determination. No casual or inadvertent breach of the foregoing shall be deemed to constitute a breach by the Company.
b.	Writing credit, but not necessarily in the form specified in this Schedule A, shall be included in publicity releases issued by the Company relating to the picture when the producer and the director are mentioned, whether in the form of a “production” or “presentation” credit or otherwise, except when such release is restricted to information about such individual or individuals. The writing credit shall also be included in all other publicity and promotional matter, including screening invitations issued by the Company, when the credit of the producer or director is included, whether in the form of a “production” or “presentation” credit or otherwise. Prior to a final determination of credits, the Company shall include those credits which it in good faith believes to be a fair and truthful statement of authorship.
In addition to the requirements of subparagraphs a. and b. above, and in recognition of the writer’s essential contribution to the creative process, the Company will include the identity, background and filmography of the credited writer(s) in standard print and electronic press kits for the picture, if such information about the director is also included. Each participating writer shall supply a copy of his/her filmography to the Company’s advertising/publicity department at the time of final submission of his/her literary material to the Company.
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 22,b.
-483 -
' It is understood that the Company may edit the writer’s filmography for use in such press kits.
Unless notified otherwise by the Company, each credited writer will be interviewed for the purpose of including material about the credited writer(s) in the standard electronic and print press kits for the motion picture or on DVDs or laserdiscs containing the motion picture, if the Company interviews the director for the same purpose. The Company shall not be required to provide transportation or accommodations for interview sessions for such writers. (If interviews are conducted prior to the final determination of writing credits, the writer(s) whom the Company in good faith believes will be entitled to writing credit will be interviewed.) However, the decision to include or exclude all or any part of the interview material, and the form of the material to be included, shall rest solely within the discretion of the Company, except that the Company will not include interview material with uncredited writers in press kits issued after a final determination of credits, if practicable, and the Company will not include interview material with uncredited writers on DVDs or laserdiscs.
The second and third unnumbered paragraphs of this subparagraph are subject to the Article 48.E. “Hot Line Dispute Resolution” mechanism, but are not subject to grievance or arbitration.
c.	If the Company has submitted the Notice of Tentative Writing Credits to the Guild within ten (10) business days after completion of principal photography, and if there is a good faith emergency which requires the Company to print the cover or sleeve of a sound track album, cassette or compact disc prior to the final determination of writing credits, then Company may include thereon the name of the writer whom the Company in good faith believes to be the writer of the motion picture. After the final determination of credits, the Company shall not print any such covers or sleeves which do not comply with subparagraph p. of this Paragraph 22.
d.	If the Company has submitted the Notice of Tentative Writing Credits to the Guild within ten (10) business days after completion of principal photography, and if there is a good faith emergency which requires the Company to print the cover, jacket or title page of any novel prior to the final determination of writing credits, then
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 22.b.

Company may include thereon such writing credit(s) as the Company may in good faith believe to be a fair and truthful statement of authorship, rather than the credits as finally determined. After the final determination of credits, the Company shall not print any such covers, jackets or title pages which do not comply with subparagraph m. of this Paragraph 22.
e.	Screenplay or screenplay and story credit in accordance with the final determination of such credit will be given on any paid advertising issued anywhere in the world, provided such advertising is prepared by the Company in the continental United States and is controlled by the Company when such advertisement is used; it being understood that in such advertising prepared prior to final determination of screenplay and story credits, the Company shall include such screenplay or screenplay and story credit as the Company may in good faith believe to be a fair and truthful statement of authorship. After final determination of credits, the Company shall not prepare for issuance any advertising which shall state screenplay or screenplay and story authorship contrary to such final determination.
f.	When there is only a single writer on a project and if a paid advertisement is issued in which that writer would have received credit hereunder had there been a final determination of credit at that time, then such writer shall be given credit in such advertisement in accordance with the credit requirements of this Schedule A.
g.	In forms of advertising covered hereunder, the names of the individual writers accorded screenplay or screenplay and story credit for the motion picture will appear in the same size and style of type as that in which the name of either the individual producer or the director of the motion picture shall appear in such advertising, whichever is larger. Provided, however, that:
(1)	If three (3) or more writers share screenplay credit, then the
Company shall not be required to use, for the advertising credit to which such three (3) or more writers are entitled, an area in excess of the minimum area that would be occupied by the names of the first two (2) of such writers, if only such first two (2) writers were entitled to share screenplay credit; it being ' understood that for such purpose, the Company may diminish height of the type in which the names of the three (3) or more
THEATRICAL SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 22.g.

writers appear in addition to narrowing from side to side the names of such three (3) or more writers; it being further understood that for the purpose of determining which of the writers are the first two (2), the order in which such writers appear in the notification of the Guild’s determination reached in its credit arbitration proceedings shall control; and
(2)	When a writer entitled to screenplay credit is also entitled to credit as the director and/or producer of the motion picture, then the name of such writer need only be mentioned once in such advertising, provided, however, that he/she receives credit as a writer; provided further, that the order of credit as between writer, producer and director shall be the same as the order with respect to which such credits are given on the screen; and
(3)	In giving such credit on twenty-four (24) sheets, the names of the individual writers shall in no event appear in type less than three and one-half (3/2) inches in height, or if the screenplay or story credit is shared by more than two (2), in type less than two and one-half (2‘A) inches in height; and
(4)	In giving such credit in forms of advertising covered hereunder, other than on twenty-four (24) sheets, the names of the individual writers shall in no event appear in type of a height less than fifteen percent (15%) of the height of type used for the title of the motion picture, or if there are two (2) titles of the motion picture, the larger title. The Company may seek a waiver of the double billing provision, in particular cases such as the "Beau Geste” ads and the Guild will not unreasonably withhold such waivers.
(5)	Writing credits shall be given as provided herein in advertising which features a quotation(s) from a review(s) of the motion picture if the name of an individual producer or director appears in any of the quotations; provided, however, if the name of individual producer or director in the quotation(s) shall be in the same size and style of type as the remainder of the quotation(s), then the writing credit need not conform in size or style of type to the name in the quotation, but shall otherwise conform in size and style of type as provided in this Paragraph 22.

h.	In all cases, the location of the credit accorded to any writer under this Paragraph 22 shall be discretionary with the Company.
i.	When the title of the motion picture is in letters of varying sizes, the percentage above referred to shall be based on not less than the average size of all the letters in such title,
j.	The foregoing obligation to accord credit in paid advertising shall be limited to story, screenplay, or screen story, adaptation and written by credits and shall not apply:
(1)	To so-called “teaser” advertising, except that if a "Produced by ” or ‘‘Directed by " credit is included, the writing credit shall also be included,
(2)	To advertisements less than four (4) column inches in size, but if such advertising contains a "Produced by" or “Directed by" credit, the writing credit shall also be included,
(3)	To radio or the audio portion of television advertising.
(4)	When credit is given neither to the individual producer nor director of the motion picture.
(5)	To special advertising relating only to the source material on which the picture is based, or author thereof, any member or members of the cast, the director, individual producer, or other personnel concerned in its production, or similar matters.
k.	In any case in which there would be an obligation to accord an advertising credit to a writer if credit were given to the producer or the director, such obligation shall also exist if credit is given to the executive producer as an individual.
1.	Advertising shall be deemed to have been prepared hereunder when the Company has forwarded the finished copy therefor to the processor or publisher.

b.	Writing credit, including source material credit, if given, may appear on a separate card or cards immediately following the title card of the particular episode; or
TELEVISION SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 5
- 504 -
c.	Writing credit, including source material credit, may appear immediately prior to or following immediately after the director’s credit. Writing credits placed pursuant to this subparagraph c. shall not be more than the second personal credit prior to the beginning or subsequent to the ending of the teleplay, as the case may be. For this purpose, however, if source material credit appears on a separate card from the other writing credits, these two (2) separate cards immediately succeeding each other shall count as one (1) credit. Commercials or a credit to the production company shall not be deemed to be a “personal credit” for the purposes of this provision.
When two (2) or more episodes of the same series or serial are exhibited back-to-back, whether in the medium of original exhibition or in a subsequent medium of exhibition, the Company may place all writing credits before the first episode or program, so long as the writing credits: (1) are clearly identified with the correct episode or program name or a designation such as Part I or Part II, (2) appear on * the same card as the episode or program name or designation, and (3) appear in the same relative position as otherwise required. If there are more than two (2) episodes exhibited back-to-back or the directing credit of each episode appears on separate cards, the writing credits of each episode must appear on separate cards.
d.	Credit for Anthology Series. With respect to anthology series only, the Company shall give the writing credits in either of the positions set forth in subparagraph a. or b. above unless the initial sponsor of the series having the right to do so pursuant to its agreement with the Company requires the Company to refrain from placing the credit in either of such positions. In such case, however, the Company shall place the writing credits as provided in subparagraph c. above.
e.	The credit given to a television writer or writers pursuant to this Schedule A shall precede (but need not immediately precede) source material credit except that:
(I)	the obligation imposed by this sentence should be subject to contractual commitments, heretofore or hereafter entered into by the Company with any source material author, requiring that source material credit precede television writing credit;
-505 -
TELEVISION SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 7.e.
(2)	the Company shall in any event have the right to give precedence to source material credit if the source material author’s name has marquee value.
For purposes of illustration, a few examples of names having marquee value are: Kathleen Norris, Paddy Chayefsky, Ernest Hemingway, Erle Stanley Gardner, George Axelrod, Ogden Nash and John Van Druten.
If roller-type credits are used, the Company, in lieu of the use of a separate card, shall set the writing credits in such fashion that when they are centered on the screen, no other credit shall be visible. Source material credit may be given on the same card on which other writing credits appear provided that writing credit (other than source material credit) shall be the first credit appearing on such card and, provided further, that the source material credit shall not occupy more than forty percent (40%) of the space on such card and is not displayed more prominently than the other writing credits appearing thereon; provided, however, that this provision shall be subject to and not affect any individual personal service agreements in effect on March 18, 1957. In no event, however, shall source material credit be included on the card on which the other writing credits appear with the title of the particular episode.
Teleplay credit shall precede story credit, it being understood that if both are on the same card, teleplay credit shall be the first credit and both credits shall be in the same style and size.
8.	A Company shall not enter into any contract to give credit to any writer or writers hereunder for reasons of the writer’s prestige or for any reasons other than earned credit, and writing credit for any writer or writers shall be assigned solely on the basis of actual contribution to the story or teleplay as determined in the event of question by the credits arbitration machinery of the Guild.
9.	[Deleted.]
10.	A writer who has participated in the writing of the teleplay or of the story (other than source material) with respect thereto, and, in the case of a remake, any writer who has received credit under this Agreement or under a predecessor Agreement to this Agreement for either story (other than source material) or teleplay or screenplay in connection with a prior version of the motion picture previously produced for theatrical release, for free or basic
TELEVISION SCHEDULE A

cable television exhibition or for Supplemental Markets, shall, for the purpose of this Basic Agreement, be considered a participant. As a participant, the writer shall be entitled to participate in the procedure for determination of writing credits. The Guild shall cooperate with the Company when possible by providing information when requested relating to the writers of the prior version(s) of the motion picture. This paragraph shall not apply if it conflicts with contractual commitments entered into prior to March 2, 1981, if said commitments were valid at the time the contractual commitment was made.
11.	Before the writing credits are finally determined, the Company will send concurrently to each participant and to the Guild written notice, which will state the Company’s choice of credits on a tentative basis, together with the names of all participants and their addresses last known to the Company. Said notice will be sent as soon as practicable following completion of principal photography. When the Company deems its record of participants incomplete, it may comply with the foregoing by giving notice to each writer whose name and address are furnished by the Guild within two (2) days after the Company’s request for such information, in addition to giving notice to each participant shown in its own records.
If there is confusion as to the identity of a participating writer listed on the Company’s notice of tentative credits because two (2) or more writers have the same first and last name, then Company shall, upon request of the Guild, furnish to the Guild such writer’s Social Security number, if known to the Company, or the employer identification number of such writer’s loan-out company.
The Company shall on such notice of tentative credits, for the information of the Guild and participants, state the form of any source material credit which the Company intends to use in connection with the motion picture. Such credits shall not be subject to protest and arbitration as hereinafter provided but the Guild shall have the right to object to the form of such credit.
At the Company’s request, the Guild may, but shall not be obligated to, make a tentative determination of screen credits and send out the notice.
12.	The notice specified in Paragraph 11 hereof will be sent by telegram to writers outside of the Los Angeles or New York area, depending on the place of production, or by telegram, messenger or special delivery mail to
- 507-
TELEVISION SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 12
writers in such areas. No notice will be sent to writers outside of the United States or writers who have not filed a forwarding address with the Company. In case of remakes, the Company shall not be under any obligation to send any notice to any writer contributing to the teleplay or story of the original production, unless the writer has received credit.
Notices may be sent by mail, telegram or personal delivery as above provided. If notices are mailed, registered or certified mail shall be used, with return receipt requested; the failure of the addressee to sign or return the receipt shall not invalidate the notice.
13.	The Company will keep the final determination of screen credits open until a time specified in the notice by the Company, but such time will not be earlier than 6:00 p.m. of the fifth business day following the next day after the dispatch of the notice above specified; provided, however, that if, in the good faith judgment of the Company, there is an emergency requiring earlier determination and the Company so states in its notice, such time will not be earlier than 6:00 p.m. of the next business day following the next day after the dispatch of the notice above specified. If, within the time specified, a written protest of the tentative credits has not been delivered to the Company from any participant or from the Guild, the tentative credits shall become final. Every protest, including that of the Guild, shall state the grounds or basis therefor in the notice thereof. The Guild agrees not to use its right of protest indiscriminately.
14.	If a written protest of the tentative credits is received by the Company from
a participant or the Guild within said period, the Company will withhold final determination of credits until a time to be specified by the Company, which time will not be earlier than eight (8) business days after the Company delivers to the Guild all of the scripts involved; provided, however, that if, in the good faith judgment of the Company, there is an emergency requiring earlier determination and the Company so states in its notice, said time may be no earlier than one hundred forty-four (144) hours after the Company delivers to the Guild all of the scripts involved, except that if all the scripts are delivered to the Guild on a Friday before twelve noon, the time shall be no earlier than one hundred twenty (120) hours after the time the Company delivers to the Guild all the scripts involved.
In any case in which the Guild’s arbitration committee is required to read more than four (4) scripts pursuant to a protest hereunder, the Company shall be required to add to the eight (8) business days, one hundred
TELEVISION SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 12
-508-
forty-four (144) hours or one hundred twenty (120) hours above provided a period of twenty-four (24) hours for each additional script or fraction thereof.
If the material is voluminous or complex, or if other circumstances beyond the control of the Guild necessitate a longer period in order to render a fair decision, and the Guild requests an extension of time for arbitration, the Company agrees to cooperate wherever practicable. The Company will not unreasonably deny the Guild’s request for an extension of time. Agreements for extension of time shall be in writing and shall specify the new date by which the Company will be advised of the arbitration decision.
15.	Upon receipt of a protest, the Company will deliver three (3) copies of the
final script and three (3) copies of all material written by the participants and three (3) copies of all available source material to the Guild offices in Los Angeles or New York and the Company shall notify the participants and the Guild by telegram informing them of the name of the protesting party and the new time set for final determination.
16.	Any notice specified in the foregoing paragraphs shall, unless a specified form of service thereof is otherwise provided for herein, be sent by the Company by telegraphing, mailing or delivering the same to the last known address of the writer or may be delivered to the writer personally, and to the Guild at the last known address of the Guild in Los Angeles or New York.
17.	Unless a unanimous agreement has been reached in accordance with Paragraph 6 hereof, any participant or the Guild may, within the period provided for in Paragraph 13 hereof, file with the Company at its studio and the Guild at its Los Angeles or New York office, as the case may be, a written request for arbitration of credits. In any case in which automatic credit arbitration is required under this Schedule A, the Guild will be deemed to have made a written request for arbitration of credits at the time the Company submits the notice of tentative credits and, in such case, the Company will immediately make available to the Guild the material as provided for under Paragraph 15 of this Schedule A. The Guild through its arbitration committee shall, within the time limit specified by the Company, make and advise the Company of its decision within the limitations of this Schedule A. In the event the decision of the arbitration committee is not rendered within said period, as the same may have been extended by the Company, the Company may make the tentative credits final, provided the
- 509-
TELEVISION SCHEDULE A
PARAGRAPH 17
terms and provisions of this Schedule have been fully complied with by the Company.
Prior to the rendition of the decision, a special committee of writers may make such investigations and conduct such hearings as may seem advisable to it. The Company shall cooperate with the arbitration committee to arrive at a just determination by furnishing all available information relative to that arbitration. Upon request of the arbitration committee, the Company shall provide the committee with a copy of the cutting continuity if it is available at the time of arbitration.
The decision of the Guild arbitration committee with respect to writing credits, including any Policy Review Board established in connection therewith, insofar as it is rendered within the limitations of this Paragraph 17, shall be final, and the Company will accept and follow the designation <jl screen credits contained in such decision and all writers shall be bound thereby.
If the matter is referred to a Policy Review Board of the Guild, the Guild shall have an additional five (5) business days within which to render its credit arbitration decision; provided, however, that if, in the good faith judgment of the Company, there is an emergency and the Company so states in its notice, the Guild’s time shall not be extended except as provided in Paragraph 14.
18.	The decision of the Guild arbitration committee may be published in such
media as the Guild may determine. No writer or Company shall be entitled to collect damages or shall be entitled to injunctive relief as a result of any decision of the committee with regard to credits. In signing any contract incorporating by reference or otherwise all or part of this Basic Agreement, any writer or Company specifically waives all rights or claims against the Guild and/or its arbiters or any of them under the laws of libel or slander or otherwise with regard to proceedings before the Guild arbitration committee and any full and fair publication of the findings and/or decisions of such committee. The Guild and any writer signing any contract incorporating by reference or otherwise referring to this Schedule A, or any writer consenting to the procedure set forth in this Schedule A, shall not have any rights or claims of any nature against any Company growing out of or concerning any action of the Guild or its arbiters or any of them, or any determination of credits in the manner provided in this Schedule A, and all such rights or claims are hereby specifically waived.

19.	In the event that after the screen credits are determined as hereinabove provided, material changes are made in the script, either the Company or a participant and the Guild jointly may reopen the credit determination by making a claim to the Guild or Company, as the case may be, within forty-eight (48) hours after completion of the writing claimed to justify the revision of credits, in which case the procedure for determining such revised credits will be the same as that provided for the original determination of credits.
The Company agrees to make revisions in advertising material previously forwarded to the processor or publisher to reflect such redetermined credits, provided that such revisions can physically and mechanically be made prior to the closing date of such processor or publisher and at reasonable expense and provided the processor or publisher has not yet commenced work on that part of the material which the change would affect.
20.	No writer shall claim credit for any participation in the screen authorship of any teleplay or story for which the credits are to be determined by the procedure herein provided for prior to the time when such credits have in fact actually been so determined, and no writer shall claim credits contrary to such determination.
21.	Writing credit for movies-of-the-week and television specials such as mini-series, multi-part series and “long form” television programs (but not necessarily in the form specified in Schedule A), shall be included in publicity releases issued by the Company relating to the television motion picture when the producer and the director are mentioned, whether in the form of a “production” or “presentation” credit or otherwise, except when such release is restricted to information about such individual or individuals. Prior to a final determination of credits, the Company shall include those credits which it in good faith believes to be a fair and truthful statement of authorship.
In addition to the requirements set forth above, the Company will include the identity, background and filmography of the credited writer(s) in standard print and electronic press kits relating to a long-form television motion picture, if such information about the director is also included. Each participating writer shall supply a copy of his/her filmography to the Company’s advertising/publicity department at the time of final submission of his/her literary material to the Company. It is understood that the Company may edit the writer’s filmography for use in such press kits.

Unless notified otherwise by the Company, each credited writer on a long-form television motion picture will be interviewed for the purpose of including material about the credited writer(s) in the standard electronic and print press kits for the motion picture, or on DVDs or laserdiscs containing the motion picture, if the Company interviews the director for the same purpose. The Company shall not be required to provide transportation or accommodations for interview sessions for such writers. (If interviews are conducted prior to the final determination of writing credits, the writer(s) whom the Company in good faith believes will be entitled to writing credit will be interviewed.) However, the decision to include or exclude all or any part of the interview material, and the form of the material to be included, shall rest solely within the discretion of the Company, except that the Company will not include interview material with uncredited writers in press kits issued after a final determination of credits, if practicable, and the Company will not include interview material with uncredited writers on DVDs or laserdiscs.
The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs are subject to the Article 48.E. “Hot Line Dispute Resolution” mechanism, but are not subject to grievance or to arbitration.

In connection with an anthology or episodic series, or serial, if advertising credit is given to a producer or a director (or an executive producer as an individual) only in connection with advertising the entire series, the writer shall be given credit in such advertising when the number of scripts contributed by such writer shall equal the number of programs produced or directed by the producer, director or executive producer receiving such advertising credit. If spoken credits are accorded to the producer or director (or executive producer as an individual), they shall also be accorded to the writer. Oral selfidentification by a producer or director or executive producer shall not be deemed to be a spoken credit for the purpose hereof.
With regard to advertising in Los Angeles or New York trade publications for a television series, or any individual episode of a series, if credit is given to a director, producer or executive producer with reference to the series, the

In the event that the Company licenses or grants to any third party the right to make any of the uses of serial or episodic series material specified in Article 15.B.14., it shall use its best efforts, in contracting with such third party, to require such third party to accord to the writer or writers of such material credit therefor which is appropriate to the field or medium for which such material is licensed. If Company itself uses such material pursuant to Article 15.B.14.a. or e., it will accord appropriate credit to such writer or writers in connection therewith, but, in the event of any dispute concerning the appropriateness of such credit, the Company’s decision shall be final.
The Company shall require that all writing credits as they appear on the screen appear in any published version of the whole or substantial part of a teleplay. The credit on a novel based on a teleplay shall indicate that the novel is based on that teleplay. Such writing credit shall appear on the title page in the same size and style of type used for the writer of the novel. If the name of the writer of the novel appears on the cover, the “Teleplay by" or “Written by” credit shall also appear on the cover in the same size and style of type as the writer of the novel; provided, however, that the writing credit need not so appear if the writer of the teleplay is the writer of the novel.

No casual or inadvertent breach of any of the foregoing shall be deemed to constitute a default or a breach by the Company of this Basic Agreement.
The Guild agrees to discuss with the Companies its policy regarding issuance of waivers for the inclusion of names of corporate employers in paid advertisements.
If the domestic version of the laserdisc or DVD containing the long-form television motion picture, or the Internet web page dedicated to the specific long-form television motion picture, contains a filmography of the director, then it will also contain a filmography of the credited writer(s). Each participating writer shall supply a copy of his/her filmography to the Company’s advertising/publicity department at the time of his/her final submission of literary material to the Company. It is understood that the Company may edit the writer’s filmography for inclusion on the laserdisc, DVD or Internet web page. The provisions of this paragraph are subject to the Article 48.E. “Hot Line Dispute Resolution” mechanism, but are not subject to grievance or arbitration.
22.	No commercial or advertising matter, audio or visual, shall appear on or above the writer’s card either as background or otherwise. The following uses of a sponsor’s name, mark, slogan, product or package shall not be deemed to involve an appearance of “commercial or advertising matter:”

Anything in this Paragraph 22 to the contrary notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed that, on any particular program, the writer will be given parity of treatment with the director insofar as the appearance of commercial or advertising matter on their respective cards is concerned.
23.	A credit on the screen in the form "Created by" shall be given on each episode of an episodic series or serial to the writer when such writer has separated rights and is entitled to sequel payments for such episode under Article 16.B.2.a. Such credit ("Created by") shall be on a separate card and shall be contiguous to a writing credit or, if the writer(s) entitled to the "Created by ’’ credit gives (give) written approval, such credit may be placed on a single card immediately following the main cast of actors in the main titles. The Company may contract to give such credit to any person, but such contract shall provide that in the event another writer is determined to be entitled to such credit, as above provided, that writer shall be given the "Created by" credit and the person whose contract provided for such credit may be given a "Developed by " credit or other similar credit.

Re: Appendix A - Writers Guild of America 1981 Theatrical and Television Basic Agreement
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This letter relates to the following exclusions from the definition of “literary material” contained in the 1968 Live MBA, referred to in the signed Memorandum of Agreement between the Writers Guild of America and the Network Companies dated as of July 3,1973, and contained in Article l.A.5. of the 1977 draft Agreement between the parties:
(b)	commercial copy;
(c)	advertising, promotion and publicity material;
(d)	political speeches, public addresses, or commemorative speeches, unless incorporated in a dramatic script;
(e)	religious services and sermons, except sermons incorporated in a dramatic script or written by a writer who performs services otherwise covered by this Agreement in connection with the program;
(i)	talks, forums, lectures;
(k)	choreography or stage or technical directions.
This will confirm that despite the elimination of such exclusions from Appendix A to the 1981 WGA Theatrical and Television Minimum Basic Agreement, neither such Agreement nor any of its predecessors has ever covered or was ever intended to cover such material, and that such types of material are accordingly excluded.
In view of the foregoing, specific exclusion of the above types of material is unnecessary.

Re: Appendix A; Article 13.B.5. (Daily Writing Credit)
Dear Brian:
During the 1988 negotiations, the parties agreed to amend the provisions of Appendix A, Article 13.B.5. ("Serials - Other than Prime Time”) to add “Other Non-Prime Time Dramatic Strip Programs.” Extending the rates and structure of serials to these “other” programs reflected a previously'granted waiver from the WGA which had committed the Company to give writing credit on such programs on a daily basis. With that in mind, the Companies agreed to continue to give daily writing credit on such “Other Non-Prime Time Dramatic Strip Programs.”

APPENDIX B
PRODUCTION FOR THE PAY TELEVISION AND THE VIDEODISC/VIDEOCASSETTE MARKETS
A.	Introduction and Scope
This Appendix B is applicable to the employment of writers and the acquisition of literary material for all programs, except as otherwise provided below, produced principally for the pay television and/or videodisc/videocassette markets. (The terms “writer” and “literary material” are as defined in Article 1 .A. and 1 .C. of the MBA or, when applicable, Appendix A.) The provisions of Appendix A which modify the Basic Agreement shall, as to material for programs covered by Appendix A, be deemed part of the Basic Agreement for purposes of this Appendix B. The following types of programs are excluded from the coverage of Appendix B: sporting events, cartoons, industrial and religious programs, other informational programs not covered by the Basic Agreement, commercials, advertising shorts, trailers and travelogues. Educational and instructional programs are excluded except when produced for the home videodisc/videocassette market and, in any event, such programs are excluded when written and performed by the same person. Programs to which this Appendix B are applicable are hereinafter referred to as “covered programs.”
B.	Definitions
1.	The term “videodisc/videocassette,” as used in this Appendix B, shall mean disc, cassette, cartridge and/or other device serving a similar function which is sold or rented for play on a home-type television screen in the home.
2.	The term “pay television,” as used in this Appendix B, shall mean exhibition on a home-type television screen by means of telecast, cable, closed circuit, satellite to home or CATV when substantially all licensed systems meet the following tests;
a.	A separate channel is provided for which the subscriber pays a separate fee (which fee is a substantial charge relative to other charges made to the subscriber) for that channel
-625 -
APPENDIX B
SECTION B.2:
and/or
b.	The subscriber pays for the program or programs selected (except that a program or programs selected for which only a token charge is made shall not be considered pay television)
and/or
c.	The subscriber pays a fee for an encoded telecast, which fee is a substantial charge relative to other fees paid for encoded telecasts.
The foregoing tests cover those systems which exist in the industry today and are commonly understood in the industry today to be pay television systems.
3.	If a different definition of pay television is negotiated by the Companies with SAG or DGA during the term of this Agreement, Companies will promptly notify the Guild of such definition and the Guild may, upon thirty (30) days written notice, substitute in its entirety such new definition for the pay television definition set forth in Section B.2. of this Appendix B.
4.	The terms “film” and “tape” shall be understood as they are commonly understood in the industry today. Should a different method of recordation develop which, in the judgment of either party to this Agreement, differs from both film and tape, such party may notify the other that it wishes to bargain concerning the Recoupable Amount, herein “break amount,” for such method of recordation. The parties agree to commence such negotiations within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice. If no agreement is reached within sixty (60) days after bargaining has commenced, the Guild may, upon written notice to the Company, instruct its members to refuse to render services with respect to programs using such method of recordation.
APPENDIX B
SECTION B.2.
-626-
C.	Compensation for Covered Programs (other than Dramatic Programs of a Type Generally Produced for Prime Time Network Television Which are Produced Principally for Pay Television)
1.	Initial Compensation
The minimum initial compensation for a writer employed for a covered program shall be the same as the applicable minimum initial compensation set forth in Article 13.B. or Article 14 or Appendix A for the program category involved. Covered programs, for purposes of this Section C. 1do not include:
a.	educational or instructional programs; and
b.	dramatic programs of a type generally produced for prime time network television which are produced principally for pay television (see Section D. 1. below).
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph 1., the second paragraph of Article 13.B.7.r. shall not apply to covered programs.
2.	What Initial Compensation Covers
The minimum initial compensation set forth in subparagraph 1. above for a covered program described in that subparagraph, or the initial agreed compensation in the case of a covered educational or instructional program produced principally for the videodisc/ videocassette market, shall constitute payment in full for any use in pay television and/or on videodiscs/videocassettes until the Company’s Receipts, as defined in Section C.3. below, exceed the following break amounts.

b.
For programs other than those covered by Section D. below: When the applicable minimum initial compensation for a program differs from the applicable minimum initial compensation for a program of comparable length covered by Section D. below, the break amount during the term of this Basic Agreement for that program shall bear the same relationship to the base break amount above as the applicable minimum for story and teleplay (or the equivalent) for such program bears to the applicable minimum for story and teleplay for a prime time network program of comparable length. The break amounts for each type of program referred to in this subparagraph b. are computed in accordance with the following formula:
■ Applicable minimum initial compensation for story and teleplay (or the equivalent) for program covered by subparagraph b. = Applicable minimum initial compensation for story and teleplay for program covered by subparagraph a.

APPENDIX B
SECTION C.2.
(I)	Aggregate Minimums
(a)	When an aggregate minimum initial compensation applies (e.g., to comedy-variety programs produced pursuant to a minimum variety show commitment, or to serials for other than prime time broadcast five (5) times per week), the aggregate applicable minimum initial compensation for such programs (prorated when the aggregate applies to more than one program) shall be used to compute the applicable break amount for such program. Said aggregate applicable minimum shall include any additional minimum initial compensation applicable to writing services on such program, viz., for sketches and lyrics.
(b)	If more than one writer is employed on a comedy-
variety program broadcast once per week or less which is not subject to a minimum variety show commitment, the break amount shall be computed in the aggregate pursuant to subparagraph (a) above as though such commitment applied, i.e., shall be increased by fifty percent (50%) for the first additional writer and an additional twenty-five percent (25%) for each writer thereafter.
(2)	Discounts. If one or more discounts apply pursuant to any of the provisions of Appendix A to reduce the applicable minimum initial compensation, the applicable break amount shall be reduced by the same percentage(s) as the percentage discounts) permitted under Appendix A.
(3)	Applicable Time Period. When the Company has used the “applicable time period” concept pursuant to Article 13 of Appendix A in determining the writer’s compensation, the applicable break amount is that which applies to a program length equal to that of the applicable time period.

a.	In addition to initial compensation, for use in the pay television and/or videodisc/videocassette markets of a covered program, other than a dramatic program of a type generally produced for prime time network television which is produced principally for pay television, the Company shall pay as additional compensation (hereafter “residuals”) to the credited writer(s) an aggregate total of two percent (2%) of the “Company’s Receipts” which exceed the applicable break amount. In no event shall the Company be required under the provisions of this Section C.3. to pay more than a total of two percent (2%) of the “Company’s Receipts” to the writers. Such residuals shall be subject to Pension Plan and Health Fund contributions pursuant to Article 17. Company’s Receipts consist of.
(1)	For release to pay television, the Company’s accountable receipts from the distribution of the program for exhibition according to Article 51 .C. (Pay television networks such as HBO and Showtime are not deemed to be distributors for this purpose. However, license or other fees paid to the Company for the right to exhibit the program by such pay television networks shall be included in Company’s accountable receipts.)

In such a case, the payment set forth above shall be based on either (ij the fee or other payment received by the subsidiary, division or other department of the Company which serves as the production branch, as distinguished from the subsidiary, division or other department of the Company which serves as the distribution branch, or (ii) when no separate subsidiary, division, or other department serves as the production branch, a reasonable allocation of the gross receipts of the Company from covered sales and/or rentals attributable solely to fees or other payments which would be made to a production subsidiary, division or other department of the Company if one existed, or would be made to an outside producer. The reasonableness of such allocation in (ii) above, or of the fee or other payment received by the production subsidiary, division, or other department in (i) above, shall be determined by its license fee payments to outside producers for comparable disc units, or in the absence of such practice, by generally prevailing trade practice in the disc industry.

WRITER-DIRECTOR COLLABORATION - THEATRICAL
The following guidelines with respect to the collaborative relationship between writers and directors on theatrical motion pictures are offered with the expectation of enhancing the collaborative process through their implementation. They are adopted by the Committee on the Professional Status of Writers as an expression of the Committee’s sense as to appropriate industry practice.
The guidelines have been included as an Appendix to the MBA in order to make them easily accessible to those who employ writers and to encourage their examination, review, dissemination and implementation. Notwithstanding their inclusion in the MBA, the guidelines are voluntary, not contractual, provisions. They are not subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions, nor are they to be used in interpreting any other provision of the MBA.
A.	Writer-Director Collaboration on Theatrical Motion Pictures
1.	General Statement *
Although writers and directors have distinct responsibilities, the creative process is enhanced by a good working relationship between them which is based upon mutual respect and derived from a common recognition of the creative contribution and responsibility of each.
The filmmaking process often begins with the writing of the script and the writers’ work is vital to the success of a production. Among other things, writers structure the screenplay and write the scenes, sequences, dialogue and characters. Directors are responsible for making the best possible film within the production’s budgetary and other practical constraints, by applying their personal creative vision to this task within the collaborative process of filmmaking. As part of the production process, directors have responsibility at a minimum for preparing a film for production, running the set during production, communicating notes to cast and crew, presenting the first cut of the film, and participating in post-production.
-645-
APPENDIX D
COLLABORATION - THEATRICAL
2.	Writers’ Involvement - Generally
A good working relationship between writers and directors is the ideal. Each should look upon the other as a natural ally, united in the joint pursuit of excellence. Writers may have a unique contribution to make throughout the filmmaking process, but their participation as part of the production team must not infringe upon the duties of either the director or the producer, nor interfere with their working relationships with others on the production.
3.	Writers’ Involvement - Development and Pre-production and Production
a.	Shortly after a director is assigned to a film based upon an existing screenplay, the director will meet with the currently-employed writer (or, if no writer is currently employed, a previously-employed writer of the director’s choosing). This meeting will take place prior to a decision to hire a new writer.
b.	There is often value in inviting the currently-employed writer to the first cast reading. A writer’s attendance at the cast reading may trigger ideas that will improve the script and circumvent problems that would otherwise emerge during
'	production. Accordingly, the preferred practice is for the
director to invite the writer to the first cast reading. Because this reading is a delicate moment for both director and performers, the director must be able to exercise the discretion to include or exclude the writer.
When the writer attends the first cast reading, he/she should share any comments only with the director and this should be done privately.
c.	A writer may wish to visit the set and may desire to bring with him/her a reasonable number of guests. The preferred practice is for the Company, in response to a request from the writer, to arrange for such a visit at an appropriate time. Because of the nature of the material being shot, confidentiality considerations, personal dynamics of the cast or other key personnel or for a variety of other reasons, visits may not be
APPENDIX D	- 646 -
COLLABORATION - THEATRICAL
appropriate at all times on some sets. For that reason, the director must retain the discretion to approve any such visit.
B.	Facilitating the Collaborative Process
1.	In order to further the collegial relationship between writers and directors on theatrical motion pictures, the WGA and DGA agree to form a Joint Creative Rights Committee - Theatrical comprised of three (3) representatives from the writer members of the WGA’s Committee on the Professional Status of Writers - Theatrical and three (3) director members of the DGA - Employers Creative Rights Committee. The Joint Committee will meet at least two (2) times per year to discuss matters of mutual concern in the area of creative rights and collaboration on theatrical motion pictures. In addition, the Joint Committee will meet annually with the senior level creative executives who usually meet as part of the WGA Committee on the Professional Status of Writers and the DGA Creative Rights Standing Committee to discuss issues of concern to both Guilds.

APPENDIX E
WRITER-DIRECTOR COLLABORATION - TELEVISION
The following guidelines with respect to the collaborative relationship between writers and directors in television are offered with the expectation of enhancing the collaborative process through their implementation. They are adopted by the Committee on the Professional Status of Writers as an expression of the Committee’s sense as to appropriate industry practice.
The guidelines are included as an Appendix to the MBA in order to make them easily accessible to those who employ writers and to encourage their examination, review, dissemination and implementation. Notwithstanding their inclusion in the MBA, the guidelines are voluntary, not contractual, provisions. They are not subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions, nor are they to be used in interpreting any other provision of the MBA.
A.	Writer-Director Collaboration in Long-Form Television
1.	General Statement
The history of long-form television has been one of a unique and productive collaborative effort among producer, writer and director that has frequently proved successful and rewarding. Although producers, writers and directors have distinct responsibilities, the creative process is enhanced by a good working relationship among these individuals which is based upon mutual respect and derived from a common recognition of the creative contribution and responsibility of each.
The filmmaking process often begins with the writing of the script and the writers’ work is vital to the success of a production. Among other things, writers structure the screenplay and write the scenes, sequences, dialogue and characters. Directors are responsible for making the best possible film within the production’s budgetary and other practical constraints, by applying their personal creative vision to this task within the collaborative process of filmmaking. As part of the production process, directors at a minimum have responsibility for preparing a program for production, running the set during production, communicating notes to cast and crew, presenting the first cut of the film, and participating in post-production.
APPENDIX E	- 648 -
COLLABORATION - TELEVISION
2.	Writers’ Involvement - Generally
A good working relationship between writers and directors is the ideal. Each should look upon the other as a natural ally, united in the joint pursuit of excellence. Writers may have a unique contribution to make throughout the filmmaking process, but their participation as part of the production team must not infringe upon the duties of either the director or the producer, nor interfere with their working relationships with others on the production.
3.	Writers* Involvement - Development and Pre-production and Production
a.	Shortly after a director is assigned to a film based upon an existing teleplay, the executive producer and director shall meet with the currently employed writer (or, if no writer is currently-employed, a previously-employed writer of the Company’s choosing) and share their understanding of the creative thrust of the script. The Company will encourage further communication between the director and the writer.
b.	There is often value in inviting the currently-employed writer to the first cast reading, if there is one. A writer’s attendance at the cast reading may trigger ideas that will improve the script and circumvent problems that would otherwise emerge during production. Accordingly, the preferred practice is for the writer to be invited to the first cast reading by the executive producer and director, in consultation with the licensee.
Because this reading is a delicate moment for those involved in the production, the director, as well as the executive producer, must be able to exercise the discretion to exclude the writer.
When the writer attends the first cast reading, he/she should share any comments only with the director, and executive producer if he or she is present and/or available, and this should be done privately.
c.	A writer may wish to visit the set and may desire to bring with him/her a reasonable number of guests. The preferred practice is for the Company, in response to a request from the writer, to arrange for such a visit at an appropriate time, after
-649-
APPENDIX E
COLLABORATION - TELEVISION
consultation with the director. Because of the nature of the material being shot, confidentiality considerations, personal dynamics of the cast or other key personnel, or for a variety of other reasons, visits may not be appropriate at all times on some sets. For that reason, the director, in consultation with the executive producer, must retain the discretion to approve any such visits.
B.	Writer-Director Collaboration in Episodic Television
1.	General Statement
Episodic television is a medium which requires collaboration among producers, writers and directors. As with long'form television, episodic television production is enhanced by a good working relationship among these individuals which is based upon mutual respect and derived from a common recognition of the creative contribution'and responsibility of each.
Writers also employed as producers have overall responsibility for developing and maintaining the consistency of stories and characters from show to show and season to season. Directors have the responsibility for directing the component parts of the production. For example, only the director calls “action” and “cut,” and the director is responsible for deciding which takes to print.
All too often, writer-producers, in pursuit of their responsibilities, take inadvertent discourteous actions which impinge upon the authority necessary for directors to fulfill their artistic responsibilities, which in turn threatens the overall excellence to which all the collaborators aspire. Adherence to the following guidelines is intended to allow both the writer-producer and the director to enjoy a more productive collaboration.
2.	General Guidelines
a.	A successful collaboration among producer, director and writer is more likely to result if the completed shooting script is ready before the director begins his/her preparation period.
Accordingly, preparation of the script must be a first priority for writer-producers. This will also enable the Companies to
APPENDIX E	- 650 -
COLLABORATION - TELEVISION
comply with their contractual obligation to furnish the director with a completed shooting script the day before the director starts preparation.
b.	Writers should be aware that directors should be consulted about all substantive script changes, if at all possible. Besides the value of the director’s creative input, script changes may have production consequences unforeseen by the writers.
c.	Any changes and suggestions made by the producer(s) or executive producer(s) with respect to the manner in which the director will direct the production should be made to the director. In the situation comedy genre, following the table read and run-through, when notes are given collectively, the director should be a participant in all note sessions.
d.	The DGA Basic Agreement gives the director the right to participate, subject to his/her availability, in all creative decisions, including casting, and in all post-production operations. The Company should make writer-producers aware of its obligation under that Agreement to notify the director of the scheduling of each post-production operation.
C.	Facilitating the Collaborative Process
1.	In order to further the collegial relationship between writers and directors in long-form television, the WGA and DGA agree to form a Joint Creative Rights Committee - Long-Form Television comprised of three (3) representatives from the writer members of the WGA’s Committee on the Professional Status of Writers - Television and three (3) director members of the DGA - Employers Creative Rights Committee. The Joint Committee will meet at least two (2) times per year to discuss matters of mutual concern in the area of creative rights and collaboration in long-form television. In addition, the Joint Committee will meet annually with the senior level creative executives who usually meet as part of the WGA Committee on the Professional Status of Writers and the DGA Creative Rights Standing Committee to discuss issues of concern to both Guilds. This meeting shall count as one of the required meetings of the DGA Creative Rights Standing Committee and the WGA Committee on the Professional Status of Writers.

Re: Long-form Television Motion Pictures; Payment for Writing Steps
Dear Mr. Walton:
Discussions among the Guild, Companies which produce television motion pictures ninety (90) minutes or longer, and licensees of such programming led to the following provision being added as the last paragraphs of Article 13.B.7.f. of the 1995 WGA Theatrical.and Television Basic Agreement ("MBA"):
“If the writer of a television motion picture ninety (90) minutes or longer has negotiated a salary sufficient to allow for three (3) revisions of the teleplay as follows, and the writer’s contract provides for such revisions, the first draft teleplay shall be delivered to the producer (or other executive) designated in the writer’s deal memorandum or contract and such producer shall be authorized to give notes to the writer and the writer shall utilize such notes in the first revision.
“Payment for such writing steps would be as follows:
(1)	commencement (10% of agreed compensation);
(2)	delivery of story (20% of agreed compensation);
(3)	delivery of first draft teleplay to producer (40% of agreed compensation);
(4)	(a) delivery of first set of revisions to producer, based on producer’s notes, if
any (10% of agreed compensation); or
(b) if producer has not requested a revision, delivery of first set of revisions to network or licensee (10% of agreed compensation);
(5)	delivery of second set of revisions (10% of agreed compensation); and
(6)	delivery of polish (10% of agreed compensation).
SIDELETTER TO ARTICLE 13,B.7.f.	- 666 -
"SPECIAL COMPANY AFFIRMATIVE COVENANT OF TIMELY PAYMENT IN LONG-FORM TELEVISION
"The following is without derogation of any other payment obligation in this Agreement.
"Given that industry practice in long-form television includes situations in which the Company (which employs the writer) receives payments, sometimes in stages, from a licensee, and that the licensee may contract with the Company for a number of drafts of a script prior to a production commitment, it is understood, and the Company hereby affirms that:
“(1	) The obligation to make timely payment to the writer pursuant to this Article 13,B.7.f. and Article 13.B.9., including with respect to step 4(a) hereof, or otherwise, is an obligation of the Company regardless of any funding arrangement with a licensee of the motion picture; and
•	“(2) Lack of receipt by Company of payment from a licensee is not, and shall not be used as, an excuse for failure to pay the writer on a timely basis.”
As participants in the discussions leading up to the addition of this new provision, we understand that in certain circumstances a producer employed or affiliated with a Company signatory to the MBA may request that the writer perform a set of revisions prior to submission of the first draft teleplay to the licensee. This would result in the licensee being entitled to one fewer draft of a teleplay than would have been the case prior to the addition of this provision, and licensees agree to adjust the time of their payment to the Company accordingly. We also understand that this provision was added to remove pressures upon the writer to perform uncompensated writing.
It was further discussed during the above-described discussions that should a licensee wish to preserve for itself the right to see all drafts, as contemplated under paragraph (4)(b) of Article 13.B.7,f., the licensee shall make appropriate contractual arrangements with the employing Company.
Each of the undersigned will instruct its employees on the meaning of this new provision and conduct its affairs,accordingly.
Very truly yours,
[Insert signatures from ABC, CBS, NBC and other licensees]

Re: Waiver re Domestic Free Television Residuals for One-Hour Network and FBC Prime Time Dramatic Series
Ladies and Gentlemen:
A.	Revenues Contracted For: The Writers Guild of America hereby grants a limited waiver from the provisions of Article 15.B. 1 ,b.(2)(c) of the 2001 WGA-AMPTP MBA, and the comparable provisions of all prior MBAs, to ail Companies signatory hereto with regard to residuals payable pursuant thereto (“fixed residual payments”) to the credited writer(s) of episodes of one-hour network prime time dramatic series, which series have not been exhibited in syndication prior to March 1, 1988, and episodes of one-hour prime time dramatic series produced for initial broadcast on Fox Broadcasting Company (“FBC”), which series have not been exhibited in syndication prior to May 2, 2002,
Residuals for episodes of such series shall be computed by multiplying the fixed residual amount otherwise due by a ratio, the numerator of which is the revenue contracted for by the distributor, as may be adjusted below, and the denominator of which is six hundred fifty thousand dollars ($650,000,00). As subsequent payments are made for any episode, appropriate payments or credits shall be made to bring earlier residual payments into conformity with any increase or decrease in the multiplier. In no event, however, shall any payment made pursuant to this limited waiver exceed one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the fixed residual payment otherwise due. Similarly, any such payment shall not be less than fifty percent (50%) of the fixed residual payment otherwise due, except in the case of series licensed only in markets representing fewer than one-third of all United Slates television households.
B.	Combination Sales: If a series qualifying hereunder is sold in combination with any other series or other program, the Company shall allocate to each episode of the series qualifying hereunder a fair and reasonable portion of the revenues contracted for and shall include such amount in the numerator referred to above. The Company shall notify the Guild when a series qualifying hereunder is sold in combination with another series or program and in such notice identify the other series or program involved. If the Guild contends that the amounts so allocated
-669-
SIDELETTER NO. 1 TO
ARTICLE 15,B.l,b.(2)(c)
were not fair and reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration and the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the fair and reasonable amount to be so allocated.
C.	Barter Syndication: If any series qualifying hereunder is syndicated with advertising time withheld by the distributor (i.e., barter syndication), the fair market value of the amount allocated to the “barter” portion of the deal shall be included in the numerator referred to above. The Company shall notify the Guild when a series qualifying hereunder is syndicated in any barter arrangement. If the Guild contends that the amount so allocated does not represent the fair market value of the “barter,” such claim may be determined by submission to arbitration and the arbitrator shall have the authority to determine the fair market value to be so allocated.
D, Reporting:
1.	The Company shall make the foregoing payments within the time period set forth in Article 15.B.l.b.(5) and in the manner required by Article 15.B.4. Simultaneously with each payment due hereunder, the Company shall Submit to the Guild a statement showing per-episode market-by-market1 revenue amounts used to compute the multiplier for the episode. In calculating the numerator of each multiplier, the revenue contracted for by the distributor shall be adjusted by the Company to take into account uncollected revenues, to the extent that such are evidenced by bankruptcy, contract restructuring (including amendments and cancellations), reorganizations or accounts that are more than 270 days delinquent. In its statement to the Guild, the Company shall notify the Guild of any such adjustment and the basis therefor.
2.	If the Company excludes any amounts not collected with respect to contracts with any party whose debts have been discharged or whose contracts have been modified in a bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding, the Company shall notify the Guild of the exclusion and, upon request, shall promptly provide the Guild with copies of court documents, including those which substantiate the discharge, reorganization or contract modification.
1 The Guild agrees to maintain such information on a strictly confidential basis. The regular practice required by this Agreement is for the Company to send the Guild the market-by-market information in the statement; however, it is recognized that in certain limited instances, the Company may have business reasons, unrelated to compliance with this Basic Agreement, for believing that the inclusion in the written statement of specific market revenues contracted for, or some of them (as distinguished from the total revenues contracted for), may not be appropriate. In such instances, the Company will advise the Guild that such figures are being omitted from its statement and the reasons therefor. In such cases, Company will meet promptly to provide such figures in a confidential setting, limited to appropriate executives of the Guild and the Company.
-670-
SIDELETTER NO. 1 TO
ARTICLE 15.B.lb.(2)(c)
3.	Upon collection of any revenues previously treated as “uncollected” under this section D., the Company shall add such collected revenues back into the numerator of the multiplier. Any increased amounts shall be due with the next payment otherwise required hereunder, but in no event later than four (4) months from recovery or collection of such revenue by the Company. In its statement to the Guild, the Company shall notify the Guild of the amounts of such a collection and the basis therefor.
4.	In any dispute over a decrease in the numerator alleged to have been made under this section D., the burden of proof shall be on the Company to establish that such decrease comports with the terms and conditions hereof.
5.	The Company affirms its obligations under Article 15.B.5. and Article 53. Upon written request of the Guild, the Company shall promptly send to the Guild copies of those parts of the contracts showing the financial terms relevant to the determination of the accuracy of the payments to be made hereunder.1 The Company shall also, upon request of the Guild, provide the Guild promptly with access to any and all documents or records reasonably necessary to confirm compliance with the foregoing terms and conditions and, thereafter, upon written request of the Guild, the Company shall provide the Guild with copies of such documents and records. If the Company in good faith contends that any of such documents or records are proprietary and/or confidential, the Guild shall in good faith seek to address appropriate Company concerns. The Company may withhold copies pending an agreement with the Guild on how the Guild shall maintain appropriate confidentiality. If such an agreement is not reached, the Company may withhold such documents pending action by an arbitrator.
E. Termination of Waiver: If the Guild desires to terminate this limited waiver, it may, once during the term of this Agreement, so advise the AMPTP not later than June 1 of any year of this Agreement. In such event, the parties shall promptly submit the issue of whether the economics of the off-network domestic syndication market for one-hour dramatic programs produced for network prime time have recovered sufficiently to justify the expiration of this limited waiver to a neutral fact-finder for an expeditious determination. The neutral fact-finder, who shall be chosen by mutual agreement of the parties or, absent such agreement of the parties, from a panel of arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with AAA rules, shall issue his/her findings in writing prior to the commencement of the fall television season.
2 The Guild agrees to maintain such information on a strictly confidential basis. It is recognized that in certain limited instances the Company may have business reasons, unrelated to compliance with this Basic Agreement, for believing that sending copies of financial terms of certain contracts to the Guild may not be appropriate. In such instances, the Company may confer with the Guild to explain its concerns. The Guild shall in good faith consider the Company’s concerns and, if it concurs with the Company, it shall so indicate in writing and the Company shall not be required to send such items.
-671 -
SIDELETTER NO. 1 TO
ARTICLE 15.B.1 .b.(2)(c)
The parties hereto agree that such written findings constitute an arbitration award for the purpose of proceedings to enforce, modify or vacate an arbitration award in any court of competent jurisdiction.
In the event the neutral fact-finder determines that the syndication market has recovered sufficiently to justify the expiration of the limited waiver, the Guild shall have the option to terminate this limited waiver as to the next fall television season and, in lieu thereof, to reinstate the fixed residual formula, as provided in Article 15.B. 1 .b.(2)(c). In the event the Guild elects to terminate the waiver, such election shall apply to series premiering on a network in the fall season(s) following the Guild’s request for fact-finding.

Re: Experiment in Syndication of Half-Hour Series in Markets Representing 50% or Fewer of U.S. Television Households
Dear Nick:
Reference is made to the provisions of Article 15.B. l.b.(2)(c) of the 2001 WGA Theatrical and Television Basic Agreement. During the 2001 negotiations, the Companies expressed a concern that if a series could only be syndicated in markets representing 50% or fewer of the U.S.
television households, residuals payable pursuant to Article 15.B.l.b.(2)(c) would render such syndication fiscally untenable. The Companies asserted that the payment of any residuals in such circumstances would benefit both the Company and the individual writers since no payments are presently made.
While the WGA expressed concern that an accommodation might be subject to abuse or otherwise reduce overall syndication residuals, the parties agreed to an experiment for the term of this MBA, to be reviewed by May 1, 2004 to determine its effectiveness and whether or not it should be extended. In such regard, the Companies agree to provide the WGA with license fee information at the time of the first payment hereunder.
When a half-hour series is syndicated in markets representing in the aggregate fifty percent (50%) or fewer of U.S. television households, residuals for such series shall be payable at twenty percent (20%) of the “applicable minimum” pursuant to Article 15,B.l.b.(3) for each such run but shall not constitute a “run” for purposes of Article 15.B.l.b.(2)(c).
If the series is further syndicated and the aggregate of the markets in which the series is syndicated exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the U.S. television households, the payments required pursuant to Article 15.B. 1 .b.(2)(c) shall be due on any subsequent runs.
-673 -
SIDELETTER NO. 2 TO
ARTICLE 15.B.l.b.(2)(c)
This experiment will only apply to series that have not yet been placed into syndication as of May 2, 2001.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
The parties acknowledge that during the 1988 MBA negotiations disputes arose concerning certain alleged ambiguities in the provisions of prior MBAs relating to reacquisition in screen and TV (hereinafter “the disputes”). As to the disputes, the WGA and the Companies expressly reserved their positions.
In addition, the parties agreed that the provisions of Article 16.A.8.a), b) and c)1 shall not apply to Article 16.A.8.d)* 2 of the 1988 MBA, except as specifically provided therein.
The parties participated in several “side bar” discussions during June, July and August, 1988, with respect to Articles 16.A.8. and 16.B.2. In connection with these side bar discussions, as with all other side bars, the parties agreed not to introduce into evidence in any legal proceeding arising under a prior MBA the proposals or counterproposals made in such side bars, or any oral statement made by any party during such side bars, concerning the disputes.
The parties further agreed that in any legal proceeding arising under a prior MBA, the parties will not introduce into evidence Article 16,A.8.d) or Article 16.B.2. of the 1988 MBA concerning issues of interpretation of reacquisition provisions in prior MBAs.

Dear Nick:
Reference is made to Article 16.A.B.d)1 of the 1988 WGA MBA, which governs the reacquisition of literary material written or acquired on or after August 8, 1988. In drafting that provision, the parties agreed to structure that clause in a manner that is different from the structure of subparagraphs a), b) and c) of Article 16.A.8.,1 on which subparagraph d) is in large part based. This “restructuring" involved the addition of contract language, lettering and numbering and subtitles and was designed to provide a more convenient and precise means of referencing portions of the language in the new reacquisition clause.
By this letter, the parties reaffirm their agreement that the language so added was not intended, and should not be construed, as effecting any substantive difference between Article 16.A.8.d) and the language in Articles 16,A.8.a), b) and c) upon which it is based. To avoid any possible confusion in identifying substantive and non-substantive language changes in Article l6.A.8.d), the parties have agreed to the following list specifying the language added to Article 16.A.8.d) solely for the purpose of accomplishing the restructuring:
(1)	The addition of the subtitle “Reacquisition under the 1988 Basic Agreement” at the beginning of subparagraph d).
(2)	The addition of the subtitle “Procedures for Reacquisition” after the second full paragraph of subparagraph d).
(3)	The addition of “(i),” “(ii),” “(iii),” “(iv),” “(v),” “(vi)” and “(vii)”* 3 * 5 as paragraph identifications before the first through seventh paragraphs, respectively, immediately following the “Procedures for Reacquisition” subtitle.
' This provision has been redesignated as Article 16.A.8.d. in the 1998 MBA.
3 These provisions have been redesignated as Article 16.^.8.a., b., and c., respectively, in
the 1998 MBA.

Re: New MBA Provision Modifying Article 48.B,; 1995 WGA-AMPTP MBA
Dear Brian:
This will summarize certain understandings regarding the revisions to Article 48.B. of the 1995 WGA-AMPTP MBA.
The new “Affirmations” paragraph in Article 48.B. is a statement of policy and intent. Although it may be used by the parties to interpret what follows, it does not in and of itself create specific obligations. Those are in the paragraphs that follow in Article 48.B.
With respect to the obligations under paragraph 2, the CEOs described perceived problems with applying these provisions to “each participating writer.” They described circumstances in which they believe it would be impracticable if not impossible to extend an invitation to “each.” The CEOs would have preferred that the obligation pertain only to “credited” writers, meaning, in this instance, those writers who would be proposed for credit in the Company’s notice of tentative writing credits. The CEOs decided not to hold up agreement on this point. The waiver procedure described in Article 48.B. is available in instances such as these.
Lastly, the CEOs asserted that they cannot ensure that writers see a cut of the picture if they grant the director final cutting authority. The WGA disagrees and has reserved its position in regard to such assertion. The CEOs pointed out that the grant of final cutting authority occurs infrequently since the Company has a strong interest in reserving that authority for itself. Disputes in individual cases may be referred to the “hot line” procedures and this subject may be revisited in the Committee on the Professional Status of Writers.

Re: The Writer's Viewing Period; Article 48.B, — 1995 AMPTP-WGA MBA
Dear Nick:
The final language of Article 48.B. provides, inter alia, that “each” participating writer has the right to a Writer’s Viewing Period and that the scheduling of the Writer’s Viewing Period shall be at the sole discretion of the Company. In a situation in which there are multiple participating writers, the fact that the right to the Writer’s Viewing Period is individual to each writer does not preclude the Company from scheduling one screening, so long as in so doing each writer is “given a reasonable opportunity" to view the cut in a timely manner.
The parties deliberately declined to spell out notice and time requirements and the like for screenings of the cut. The new provision is to be interpreted so as to give effect to the right granted in a reasonable and good faith manner consistent with the legitimate and reasonable needs of the Company. As Article 48.B. acknowledges, processes will differ from film to film.
It is anticipated that in most instances a timely invitation from the Company to a writer to view the cut at a reasonable time and place will be sufficient to ensure that the writer has been “given an opportunity to see a cutbut both the writer and the Company are expected to cooperate so that the writer’s right is fulfilled in a manner consistent with the Company’s legitimate and reasonable business needs.

Ladies and Gentlemen:
This letter clarifies the meaning of the terms "Distributor” (of video cassettes and video discs) and “worldwide wholesale receipts derived by the Distributor” as used in Article 51.3. a.(i i)' of the 1985 Writers Guild of America Theatrical and Television Basic Agreement (“1985 MBA”) when the “Distributor” is the Company or owned by or affiliated with the Company.
Background
Prior MBAs
Article 51 of the 1973,1977 and 1981 Writers Guild of America Theatrical and Television Basic Agreements provided that the “gross receipts derived by the distributor of Such Picture (who may be the Company or a distributor licensed by the Company) from licensing the right to exhibit Such Picture in Supplemental Markets...” would constitute the Producer’s gross. It further provided that if the distributor did not itself distribute Such Picture directly in Supplemental Markets, but employed a “subdistributor” to "distribute Such Picture, then the ‘Producer’s gross’ shall be the worldwide total gross receipts derived by such subdistributor'from licensing the right to exhibit Such Picture in Supplemental Markets.”
1985 Negotiations
During the negotiations for and the drafting of the 1985 MBA, it was agreed that the method of calculating “Producer’s gross” would be as now set forth in Article 51 of the 1985 MBA. It provides that twenty percent (20%) of the receipts of the Distributor would constitute the “Producer’s gross” when the Distributor is owned by or affiliated with the Company.
The Companies’ position was that the sentence dealing with subdistributors (as it relates to video cassettes) should be deleted in order to conform with said agreement as to “Producer’s gross” and in any event that sentence is not applicable since the owned or affiliated home video companies are “Distributors,” not “subdistributors.” The Guild expressed a number of concerns, including that an unexplained deletion of the subdistributor language, among other things, could be the basis of an attempt to dilute the receipts used in the calculation of the Producer’s gross by,
1 This provision has been redesignated as Article 51.C.l.b. in the 1998 MBA.
SIDELETTER TO
ARTICLE 51
-688-
among other things, a Company calling an owned or affiliated distribution company a subdistributor as opposed to a Distributor, and/or declining to include the receipts of such a "subdistributor" in the calculations of “Producer’s gross."
By way of example and illustration, the following clarifications are made to satisfy the concerns of the Guild and prevent misunderstanding by all signatories to the 1985 MBA as to the receipts from the sale or license of video cassettes and video discs to be included in “Producer’s gross."
It is the understanding of the parties signatory to the 1985 MBA that:
1.	Paramount Home Video, for example, is the "Distributor” of "Such Pictures” for Paramount Pictures Corporation, and that CBS-Fox Home Video, for example, is the "Distributor” of “Such Pictures” for Twentieth Century-Fox. The "Producer’s gross" is and shall be twenty percent (20%) of one hundred percent (100%) of the worldwide receipts derived by Distributors such as Paramount Home Video and CBS-Fox Home Video from the sale or license of videocassettes or videodiscs.
2.	Distributors currently utilize and in the future will utilize various methods of delivering video cassettes and video discs to retail outlets (“such methods”) including, without limitation, (a) wholesalers (such as Comtron and Ingram) whb act as “middle men” in selling or licensing video cassettes or video discs to retail outlets, (b) rack jobbers (such as Handleman) who deliver video cassettes or video discs to retail outlets, (c) direct sales or licenses from the Distributors to large “chain-retailers" (for example, Tower Records, The Wherehouse or Erols), (d) direct sales or licenses from the Distributors to specialty “mass merchandisers” (for example, K Mart), and (e) direct sales or licenses to direct mail outlets (for example, Columbia House). Twenty percent (20%) of one hundred percent (100%) of the receipts of the Distributor derived from such methods constitute the “Producer’s gross."
3.	Should, for example, Paramount Pictures Corporation or the Distributor
■ Paramount Home Video establish or acquire an affiliated company or companies, whether a subdivision, subsidiary or otherwise (for example, without limitation, the establishment of a Paramount Home Video, East and/or a Paramount Home Video, West to service different geographical areas), which perform some or all of the functions of a Distributor, then “Producer’s gross” is twenty percent (20%) of one hundred percent (100%) of the total receipts of Paramount Home Video and such affiliated company or entity derived from licensing or selling video cassettes or video discs.
4.	Should, for example, Paramount Pictures Corporation or the Distributor 'Paramount Home Video either establish or acquire an affiliated company or companies, whether a subdivision, subsidiary or otherwise, which performs functions in addition to those of a Distributor (for example, without limitation, those of a wholesaler, a rack jobber or by other "such methods”) and/or should a
-689-
SIDELETTER TO
ARTICLE 51
company such as the Distributor Paramount Home Video perform functions in addition to those of a Distributor (for example, without limitation, those of a wholesaler, a rack jobber or by other “such methods”) and/or should Paramount Pictures Corporation perform some or all of the functions of a Distributor, twenty percent (20%) of one hundred percent (100%) of the receipts derived from the Distribution function (as opposed to the non-distribution functions) of all such entities shall be allocated to and included in the “Producer’s gross.”
5.	It is agreed and understood that if the Guild shall in the future contend that any amount allocated in situations such as those hypothecated in paragraph 4 is not fair or reasonable, such claim may be determined by submission to grievance/arbitration in accord with Articles 10,11 and 12 of the 198S MBA. Each Company signatory to the ! 985 MBA agrees, for itself, its Distributors and affiliated companies, that the Guild shall, upon request, have access to the books and records of the Distributors and other affiliated Companies that are relevant and necessary to the Guild’s ability to evaluate the merits of such a claim or potential claim, or to process such a claim in grievance/arbitration proceedings. This provision for Guild access to books and records does not expand or restrict the rights or obligations of the Company or the Guild with regards to information access in any subject area except that covered in this paragraph.

Re: Literary Material Written for Programs Made for the Internet
Dear Nick:
This Sideletter confirms the understanding of the WGA and the Companies (collectively “the parties”) concerning the application of this Basic Agreement to literary material written for the Internet or other similar delivery systems (“Internet”). With respect to literary material written under employment, or optioned or acquired from a professional writer, intended for initial use on the Internet, the parties agree as follows:
Part A - Letter of Adherence
•	Part A of this Sideletter authorizes a letter of adherence for Companies producing audiovisual entertainment programs made for the Internet of the type that have traditionally been covered under the WGA Basic Agreement as well as other types of programs made for the Internet.
•	A Company, at its option, may execute this letter of adherence to cover the writing of literary material for any such program or multiple programs, at the Company’s election, made for the Internet. The terms of the letter of adherence shall be binding upon the Guild and the Company, and shall require the Company to make contributions on behalf of writers employed on such program(s) to the Pension Plan and Health Fund at the rates set forth in Article 17 of the 2001 WGA Basic Agreement. The provisions of Article 6, “Guild Shop,” also shall apply. No other terms of the Basic Agreement shall apply to the employment of such writer, or to the sale or option of such literary material, unless agreed in writing between the Guild and the writer, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand.
Part B - Motion Pictures Based on Material Written for or Initially Used on the Internet
If a writer is employed by the Company to write for the Internet a presentation of a series or program primarily intended for television or theatrical exploitation, then, should the Company exercise its right to produce such pilot, series or theatrical motion picture, the Company shall not

MATERIAL WRITTEN

be permitted to contend that the writer of the television pilot, series or theatrical motion picture is disqualified from having separated rights under Article 16. A. or 16.B. solely because the presentation has been published or exploited by virtue of its exhibition on the Internet.
Part C - Mutual Reservation of Rights
Nothing contained in this Sideletter shall be deemed a waiver of any party’s legal position with respect to the application of this or any prior Basic Agreement to material written for the Internet. The parties reserve all of their legal positions with respect to such material.

Re: Exhibition of Motion Pictures Transmitted Via the Internet
Dear Nick:
This Sideletter confirms the understanding of the Guild and the Companies (collectively “the parties”) concerning the application of the MBA to the exhibition of covered theatrical and television motion pictures, the principal photography of which commenced on or after July 1, 1971, on or by means of the Internet or other similar delivery systems (“Internet”).1
1.	License for Limited Period or Fixed Number of Exhibitions. Where the subscriber pays for the program either on a subscription or per-picture basis, and where the payment is in exchange for the right to view the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or a fixed number of exhibitions, the Company shall pay to the credited writer(s) an aggregate sum equal to one and two-tenths percent (1.2%) of the license fee paid by the licensee for the right to exhibit such picture on the Internet.* 2
When the Company’s receipts from the licensing of such exhibition are received from an entity which acts as the exhibitor and in which the.Company has a financial interest, the reasonableness of the fee received by the Company from the licensing of such exhibition shall be determined by the exhibitor’s license fee payments to unrelated entities for comparable motion pictures.
‘The parties reserve their respective legal rights and positions as to the applicability of Article 64 to interactive programs transmitted via the Internet.
2As bargaining history, this language is based upon the following model: studio licenses to Moviefly the right to transmit the motion picture on the Internet to the viewer who pays Moviefly on a subscription or per-picture basis. Such payment would enable the viewer to view the motion picture for a fixed and limited period of time or limited number of exhibitions. For example, if Columbia Pictures, through Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment, licenses to Moviefly the right to exhibit a Columbia Pictures film, the residuals shall be based upon 100% of the license fee paid by Moviefly to Columbia-TriStar Home Entertainment for such picture.
- 693 - SIDELETTER ON EXHIBITION OF
MOTION PICTURES TRANSMITTED
VIA THE INTERNET
The parties agree that the residuals due to writers under this paragraph 1 shall be payable in the same manner and to the same extent as applicable to pay television and pay-per-view as provided in the following MBA provisions (subject to conforming changes as necessary):
•	Article 51 .C.3. (foreign receipts and non-returnable advances);
•	Article 51.C.5. (allocation of pro raia shares of residuals among writers);
•	Article 51 .C.6. (time of payment, payment requirements, reporting, and exclusion
from pension and health requirements);
•	Article 51.C.7. (gross participations);
*	Article 51 .C. 8. (transfer and assumption);
•	Article 51.C.9. (assumption agreement);
•	Article51.C.10. (continuingobligations); and
•	Article 65 (financial responsibility).
2.	Other Exhibitions. For all other Internet-transmitted exhibitions (“other exhibitions”), including a sale of or license of the right to view the motion picture for an unlimited time, the parties acknowledge that the markets for such other exhibitions are evolving, and that the basis for payment of residuals shall be determined at a later time. Accordingly, in the event the AMPTP negotiates a residual formula with either SAG or the DGA with respect to other exhibitions of covered motion pictures, either: (a) the Guild shall have the right io elect the entire agreement reached with SAG or DGA with respect to the licensing of such other exhibitions, and only such entire agreement, but with appropriate equivalent adjustment for writers for provisions peculiar to actors or directors, as the case may be; or (b) alternatively, the Guild may reopen this agreement as to such other exhibitions on or after December 1, 2002.
The parties reserve all of their respective legal positions with respect to such other exhibitions.
With respect io theatrical and television motion pictures, the Company has agreed to a separate payment for this use on the Internet because Internet exhibition is at this time outside the primary market. The Company reserves the right in future negotiations to contend that the pattern of release has changed so that this use constitutes or is a part of the primary market of distribution of theatrical or television motion pictures, and that, . therefore, no additional payment pursuant hereto should be made with respect to the exhibition of theatrical or television motion pictures (including those covered by this Agreement) on the Internet. The Guild reserves the right in future negotiations to contend to the contrary, and further to assert that regardless of whether other exhibitions

are or have become part of the primary market, payment provisions for writers of motion pictures so exhibited should be improved.

Re: Article 64 Applicable Credits Provisions of the MBA
Dear Mr, Counter:
The following credit requirements shall apply when motion pictures and/or literary material as described in Article 64 are reused in interactive programs:
(1)	If the reuse is of the whole or a substantial part of a theatrical or television motion
picture which can be viewed in a linear fashion and is governed by Article 64.B.1, or 64.D, 1,, ail writing credits1 of the motion picture as they appeared on the screen shall appear in the interactive program. If such reuse is of a television motion picture on which a "Created by" credit was required pursuant to the terms of this or any prior MBA, then the “Created by" credit, as it appeared on the screen, also shall appear in the interactive program. If such reuse is of a television motion picture on which a "Developed by" credit was given pursuant to the terms of this or any prior MBA, then the Company shall obligate the licensee (which may include the Company) to accord "Developed by" credit, as it appeared on the screen or in the form "Developedfor Television by" in the interactive program.
(2)	If the interactive program includes publication of the script of a theatrical or television motion picture, in whole or in substantial part, or a novelization of any such script, and such reuse is governed by Article 64.C, [literary material], 64.D.1. [combination of motion picture and literary material] or 64.D.2. [combination of excerpts and literary material], all writing credits of such theatrical or television motion picture as they appeared on the screen shall appear in the interactive program. If such publication is of a teleplay on which a "Created by" credit was required pursuant to the terms of this or any prior MBA, then the writer entitled to such credit shall be given appropriate source materia! credit in interactive program publications arising out of the series. With respect to any novelization based on

the screenplay or teleplay, the credits shall indicate that such novelization is based on such screenplay or teleplay. Such writing credit shall appear on the “title page,” or on the equivalent thereof, in the same size and style of type used for the writer of the novelization. If the name of the writer of the novelization appears on the “cover,” or on the equivalent thereof, the “Screenplay by’1 or “Teleplay by' or “Written by" credit shall also appear on the “cover,” or on the equivalent thereof, in the same size and style of type as the writer of the novelization; provided, however, that the writing credit need not so appear if the writer of the screenplay or teleplay is the writer of the novelization. The contract with the publisher shall provide that this provision is for the express benefit of the writer and the Guild, and that the publisher will comply with such requirements. However, the failure of a publisher to comply with any of such requirements shall not constitute a breach by the Company.
No casual or inadvertent breach of any of the foregoing in this paragraph (2) shall be deemed to constitute a default or a breach by the Company of this Basic Agreement.
(3)	If the reuse is governed by Article 64.B.2. [excerpts], 64.C. [literary material], 64.D.1. [combination of motion picture and literary material] (and the reuse is not included in paragraphs (1) or (2) above), or 64.D.2. [combination of excerpts and literary material], (and the reuse does not include publication of the script or novelization), then the WGA reserves its position that the credits provisions of the MBA would apply and the AMPTP-represented Companies reserve their position to the contrary.
(4)	If the reuse is of the whole or a substantial part of a theatrical or television motion picture which can be viewed in a linear fashion and is governed by Article 64.B. 1. or 64.D.1., then the WGA reserves its position that the provisions of the MBA governing credits in advertising and publicity also would apply and the AMPTP-represented Companies reserve their position to the contrary.
(5)	With respect to the instances described above in paragraph (3) only, the WGA and the AMPTP-represented Companies agree that the issues of whether or not writing credits provisions of the MBA should apply and, if so, in what form and manner the writing credits should be accorded, shall be referred to the Interactive Media Committee. Disputes as to whether credits are required to be accorded in the instances described in paragraph (4) above shall be subject to the Hot Line procedure under Article 48.E., except that if they are not resolved within the time specified, they shall be referred to the Interactive Media Committee, rather than to grievance/arbitration, for resolution. Only disputes under paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall be subject to grievance and/or arbitration under Articles 10, 11 and 12.

Re: New Technologies Cooperative Education Program
Ladies and Gentlemen:
This will affirm the following agreement reached between the Guild and the Companies in the negotiation of the 1995 WGA - AMPTP MBA:
1.	The Guild and the Companies will establish, pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Labor Management Cooperation Act, 29 U.S.C. 175a, a labor-management cooperation committee known as the "New Technologies Cooperative Education Program” (the "Program”) to support the education of writers in the creation of specialized material for the new media technologies. The purpose of the Program is to increase employment opportunities for writers in the new media technologies, and as a result, to improve their job security and enhance economic development in this growing field. Program activities will focus on both the technical and creative demands of various interactive multimedia platforms.
2.	Through the auspices of the AMPTP, the Companies shall contribute an aggregate sum of fifty thousand dollars (550,000.00) to a Guild-administered fund (“the Fund"), which shall make expenditures for the purposes of the Program. The Companies’ contribution shall be paid into the Fund by June 1, 1995.
3.	The Fund shall be used to reimburse fees and expenses only upon receipt of proper documentation showing that the fees or expenses have been incurred by the Program for the purposes described in this Sideletter.
4,	The parties have agreed that the Program shall be structured so as not to be subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as

Re: Informational Programs
Ladies and Gentlemen:
As a result of the 1988 negotiations between the Writers Guild of America and the Companies represented by the AMPTP, it was agreed that this sideletter would be added to the MBA, to serve as a letter of adherence for Companies in the business of producing and selling informational programs. For purposes of this sideletter, informational programs include, but are not limited to, training, industrial, motivational, public relations, educational and instructional programs, but exclude educational and instructional programs covered by Appendix B of the MBA and promotional programs and sales presentations.
Any Company may elect to execute this letter of adherence to cover the making of any individual informational program. The terms of this letter shall be binding upon the Company for that project only and shall require the Company to make contributions on behalf of writers employed on such informational program to the Pension Plan and the Health Fund at the rates set forth in Article 17 of the 2001 WGA-AMPTP Basic Agreement.

Re; Methods of Encouraging Original Writer’s Continued Performance of Writing Services - Television
Dear Brian:
During the negotiations leading to the 1995 WGA-AMPTP MBA, the Guild sought a provision which would contractually obligate a Company which contemplates replacing the writer of an original teleplay ninety (90) minutes or longer, so that a creative executive or producer who has read the material and who has decision-making authority on behalf of the Company shall discuss the Company’s view and give the writer a reasonable opportunity to discuss continuing to perform services on the project.
It is agreed that the Committee on the Professional Status of Writers will seek mutually acceptable provisions in this area.
Sincerely,

Re: WGA’s Commitment to Industry-Wide Talks Concerning Credits Issues in Screen and Television
Ladies and Gentlemen:
During the negotiation of the 2001 MBA, members of the WGA, west and East,’met. on several occasions with CEOs of the major studios and networks to engage in a serious'discussion of various creative rights and credits proposals in both feature films and television. It became clear at the conclusion of negotiations that certain credits issues in screen and television should be discussed on an industry-wide basis.
To address these matters in a meaningful way, the WGA and the Companies commit to enter into talks on an industry-wide basis no later than October 1, 2001. The WGA and the Companies further commit to participate in these talks in good faith with the intent to achieve industry-wide solutions.
The Companies will join with us to invite other interested guilds and unions to participate fully in these talks.
The WGA and the Companies agree that the forum agenda should include the following issues:
1.	the "Film by” and other possessive credits in film and long-form television;
2.	the "Created by” credit and “Developed by” credit in episodic television;
3.	the proliferation of unwarranted credits in feature films and television programs
(both long-form and episodic), in particular producer credits; and
