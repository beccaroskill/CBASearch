CITY OF CHICAGO AGREEMENT WITH CARPENTERS - LOCAL NO. 13 INSPECTORS
This Agreement is entered into by and between the City of Chicago, an Illinois Municipal Corporation (hereinafter called the "Employer") and the Carpenters - Local No. 13 - Inspectors, (hereinafter called "the Union"), for the purpose of establishing, through the process of collective bargaining certain provisions covering wages, and other terms and conditions of employment for the employees represented by the Union.
In recognition of the above, the Employer and the Union agree as follows:
ARTICLE l RECOGNITION
Section 1.1	Recognition
The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all employees in the following job classifications:
Building Inspector
Construction Inspector
Supervisor of Building Inspectors Construction Inspector Supervisor Zoning Investigator Supervisor of Zoning Investigator The Union is authorized to bargain collectively for such employees with respect to rates of pay, wages, hours and other
1
356634.1
terms and conditions of employment. The term "employee" as used herein, refers to the above job classifications, unless specified to the contrary.
Section 1.2	Job Titles
The Employer will notify the Union of any change in job title. If the Employer makes any substantial change in job duties it will discuss such changes with the Union prior thereto. If the Employer changes a job title without substantially changing the duties of the job, the Union will retain its existing jurisdiction over the new job title. The Employer will not permanently assign bargaining unit work to the jurisdiction of another bargaining unit without the mutual agreement of the unions involved.
Section 1.3	Traditional Work
Any work which has been traditionally performed by employees who are represented by the Union shall continue to be performed by said employees, except where non-unit employees have in the past performed unit work, or in emergencies, to train or instruct employees, to do layout, demonstration, experimental, or testing duties, to do troubleshooting or where special knowledge is required, provided however, where employees do not report to work because of vacations, or other absences or tardiness, or for personal reasons during the course of the day, or because all of the employees are or will be occupied with assigned duties, or to complete a rush assignment, employees of any other unit represented by another union will not perform the work of said employees. For example, if a Building Inspector is
2
356634.1
on vacation, a Clerk shall not be assigned as a replacement Building Inspector. The Employer shall not arbitrarily extend the period of any emergency beyond the need for that emergency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that it shall not be a violation of this Agreement if the following functions are performed by members of management, regardless of whether they are also performed by the bargaining unit: (a) crew assignment and scheduling; (b) work inspection; (c) discipline; (d) ordering of equipment and materials from vendors. Nothing herein shall deprive members of the bargaining unit of the right to perform historical and traditional unit work; nor shall the City lay-off a bargaining unit employee for the purpose of replacing that person with a member of management.
Section 1.4	New Work
Whenever the City intends to establish a new job classification or undertakes to perform new work that may not be within the duties of a bargaining unit classification, the City will advise the union in writing at least forty-five (45) days in advance, describing the new title/duties and providing a job description or equivalent description of duties.
The City shall first consider whether such work is within the scope of work that has traditionally been performed by a bargaining unit classification or member. If the City, after determining that the work is not within the scope of work traditionally performed within the bargaining unit, decides not to include the new work therein and a dispute arises, the
3
356634.1
dispute shall be submitted to the Illinois Local Labor Relations Board for resolution.
If the City determines that the new work belongs to and is to be included within a bargaining unit classification, the Union shall be notified in writing. If a proposed new classification is or becomes a classification within the unit, the Employer shall meet with the Union to discuss the new classification and the rate of pay assigned by the Employer. If the Employer and the Union cannot agree on such rate of pay within thirty (30) days of notification to the Union, the rate of pay for such new classification will be arbitrated in accordance with the arbitration provisions of this Agreement. Pending the arbitrator's decision, the Employer may fill the classification and temporarily assign a rate of pay.
The arbitrator shall review the rate of pay by comparing it to pay rates, responsibilities and working conditions of other bargaining unit and Employer classifications, the labor market and any factors the arbitrator determines to be relevant. The arbitrator shall decide whether the pay rate decision of the Employer was reasonable. If the arbitrator decides to increase the rate of pay, the increase shall be made retroactive to the date the new classification was established. If the arbitrator decreases the rate of pay, such decrease shall become effective as of the next pay period following the arbitrator's decision.
4
356634.1
ARTICLE 2 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
The Union recognizes that certain rights, powers, and responsibilities belong solely to and are exclusively vested in the Employer, except only as they may be subject to a specific and express obligation of this Agreement. Among these rights, powers, and responsibilities, but not wholly inclusive, are all matters concerning or related to the management of the Employer's operations and the administration thereof, and the direction of the working forces, including (but not limited to) the right to suspend, discipline, or discharge for just cause; to layoff by reason of lack of work, by reason of lack of funds or work, or abolition of a position, or material changes in duties or organization of the Employer's operations, or other economic reasons; to hire, classify, transfer and assign work, promote, demote, or recall; to make and enforce reasonable rules and regulations; to maintain order and efficiency; to schedule the hours of work, to determine the services, processes, and extent of the Employer's operation, the types and quantities of machinery, equipment and materials to be used, the nature, extent, duration, character and method of operation, including (but not limited to) the right to contract out or subcontract; the right to determine the number of employees and how they shall be employed, the quality and quantity of workmanship and work required to insure maximum efficiency of operations; to establish and enforce fair production standards; and to determine the size, number and location of its departments and facilities. All of the provisions of this Article are vested
5
356634.1
exclusively in the Employer, except as expressly abridged by a specific provision of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 3 NON-DISCRIMINATION
Section 3.l	Equal Employment Opportunities
The Union and the Employer agree to work cooperatively to insure equal employment opportunities as required by law in all aspects of the Employer's personnel policies, and nothing in this agreement shall be interpreted to cause a negative effect in said efforts. It is understood and agreed that this Article shall neither affect nor be interpreted to adversely affect the seniority provisions of this Agreement.
Section 3.2	No Discrimination
Neither the Employer nor the Union shall discriminate against any employee covered by this Agreement in a manner which would violate any applicable laws because of race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex, marital status, mental and/or physical handicap or membership or non-membership in or activity on behalf of the Union.
Section 3.3	Grievances
Grievances by employees alleging violations of this Article shall be resolved through Step II of the grievance procedure of this Agreement, but shall not be subject to arbitration unless mutually agreed to by the parties, except that grievances alleging discrimination as a result of activity on behalf of the union may be forwarded to arbitration. Nothing shall preclude an employee who is appealing a disciplinary action of ten (10)
6
356634.1
days or less in accordance with the review procedures described in Article 18 from contending that disciplinary action has resulted from discrimination.
Section 3.4	Reasonable Accommodation
In the event the Employer shall be required to make a reasonable accommodation under the Americans With Disabilities Act ("ADA") to the disability of an applicant or incumbent employee that may be in conflict with the rights of an employee under this Agreement, the Employer shall bring this matter to the attention of the union. The provisions of Article 11 of this Agreement shall be available, and the Arbitrator may balance the Employer's obligations under the ADA and this Agreement and the employee's rights under this Agreement, provided that no incumbent employee shall be displaced by such decision of the Arbitrator.
ARTICLE 4 WAGES
Section 4.1	Prevailing Wage Rates
Effective July 1, 2007, employees covered by this Agreement shall continue to receive the hourly rate being paid to crafts or job classifications doing similar kinds of work in Cook County pursuant to the formula currently used by the United States Department of Labor in administering the Davis-Bacon Act as currently being paid to said employees as set forth in Appendix A appended to and made a part of this Agreement.
7

Section 4.2	Prevailing Rate Adjustments

In the event the hourly wage rates effective July of each year covered by this Agreement are established at an effective date later than July 1, then such rates, when established, shall be paid as of said effective date. In no event will the Employer adjust said wage rates more than one time in any calendar year.

9
356634.1
in any contract year higher than the increase set forth above in any such year, employees in non-prevailing rate classifications covered by this Agreement shall have their wage adjustment set forth above increased by the difference between the above increase and the higher across-the-board percentage increase in any such year. Similarly, if a majority of City unionized employees in non-prevailing wage rate classifications** receive a lump sum payment in any contract year, employees in nonprevailing rate classifications covered by this Agreement shall receive the same lump sum payment in any such year. The parties agree to confer regarding the timing, amount and implementation of any wage adjustment or lump sum payment under this Section prior to such adjustment being paid.
**Exclusive of sworn employees of the Chicago Police Department and uniformed members of the Chicago Fire Department.
Section 4.5	Retroactivity
The increases set forth in Article 4, Sections 4.1 and 4.3, are payable to affected employees who, as of August 2, 2008, are either on the payroll, or are on approved leave, or are on layoff with recall rights, or are seasonal employees who are eligible for rehire, or are former employees who retired effective between July 1, 2007 and the date of final ratification of the Agreement by the City Council, inclusive.
10
356634.1
Section 4.6	Payment of Wages
(a)	All regular base wages will be paid to employees not later than the next regular pay day following the end of the payroll period in which it is earned. All overtime or premium pay shall be paid to employees not later than the second regular pay day following the end of the payroll period in which it is earned. In the event of an arbitration involving a dispute arising solely under this Section, the losing party will pay the entire amount of the arbitrator’s fee.
(b)	In the event an employee's pay check, at the time specified in paragraph (a) above, fails to include all of the regular base, overtime and/or premium pay to which he/she is entitled, the Department will correct that shortage provided the employee promptly notifies the Department's timekeeper in writing. Employees shall submit a payroll dispute to the Department timekeeper on the “Employee Payroll Inquiry Form” attached hereto as Appendix B. The employee’s submission of such Form shall toll the period for processing a grievance filed by the employee or Union over such dispute. If the Department concludes that there is a shortage in the employee's paycheck, and if the amount in question exceeds $100.00, the Department will submit a supplemental payroll to the Comptroller to cover the shortage, and will issue the employee a check in that amount on the next scheduled check/deposit advice delivery date after the timekeeper is notified of the employee's
11
356634.1
complaint. Shortages less than $100.00 will be added to the employee's next regular pay check.
(c)	Should an employee not receive this supplemental check (for a sum greater than $100.00) within the aforementioned check/deposit advice delivery date period, the Employer will pay to the employee the sum of $5.00 for every pay period thereafter until the full supplemental check is received.
(d)	It is understood that pay shortages relating to newly-hired employees, persons returning from leaves of absence (including but not limited to duty disability), overtime earned under the City's emergency snow removal program, and inaccuracies due to changes in payroll deductions, are excluded from the provisions of this Section. This paragraph does not supersede any other payment obligations with respect to the payments referred to in this paragraph which may be contained elsewhere in this Agreement.
(e)	In order to provide a basis for ongoing discussion concerning the City's payroll practices, the parties will form a Labor Management Committee consisting of four (4) persons appointed respectively by the City and by the Coalition. The City's members of the Committee will consist of representatives from the Department of Personnel, the Office of Budget and Management, the Comptroller and the Director of Labor Relations.	The
Coalition, as it shall determine, shall select four (4) representatives to serve as members of the Committee. The
12
356634.1
Committee will meet not less than quarterly, or more frequently as the need may arise, to review ongoing issues regarding payroll, compliance with this Section, or other issues of mutual concern which may arise during the life of the parties' Agreement. In addition, at the request of the Coalition, the City may include from time-to-time a representative of the Coalition at the Comptroller’s weekly staff meetings with Department heads to review and address pending payroll inquiries from bargaining unit employees.
Section 4.7	Acting in Higher-Rated Job
Any employee covered by this Agreement who is directed or permitted to perform substantially all of the duties of a higher classification for five (5) consecutive days shall be paid at the higher rate for all such time, retroactive to the first day of the assignment. Such payment shall be made on the next regular payday or as soon thereafter as is possible, but in no event later than the pay period following the pay period in which the payment was earned.
The time limits for such individual assignments to higherrated jobs shall be ninety (90) days, except where a regular incumbent is on leave of absence, in which case the time limit shall be six (6) months. The time limits may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. To the extent the Employer continues to require the performance of the duties of the higher-rated job beyond the time limits set forth herein, the assignment shall be treated as a “permanent vacancy” within the
13
356634.1
meaning of Article 17 of this Agreement, and shall be subject to the applicable posting and bidding provisions of that Article.
Section 4.8	Reporting Pay
When an employee reports for his or her regularly scheduled shift, the employee shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours work or pay at the employee's regular straight time hourly rate, unless the employee was told at least three hours prior to his or her normal starting time not to report for work, except for reasons beyond the Employer's control. To be eligible for pay under this provision, employees must advise the designated person within the Department of his or her current telephone number.
If the employee works more than two (2) hours, he or she shall receive a minimum of four(4) hours work or pay for that day. If the employee works more than four (4) hours, he or she shall be guaranteed eight (8) hours work or pay for that day. An employee who does not complete a normal eight (8) hour shift because he or she is sent home by the Employer shall have the option of using a portion of accrued vacation, personal or compensatory time for that day upon notice to the Employer. Section 4.9 Call In Pay
Except as otherwise agreed in writing, employees called in outside of their regular working hours shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours pay at the appropriate overtime rate from the time that they arrive at their workplace.
The term “call-in pay” as used in this Section shall refer to an employee being brought back to work outside of his/her
14
356634.1
normal work day, and shall not refer to any situation where the employee is brought into work or required to stay at work during periods which are contiguous to his/her regularly scheduled shift.
Section 4.10	Emergency Call Pay
In the event a General Foreman or Foreman is directed by the Employer to respond to emergency calls from home and outside of his or her regular working hours, he or she will be granted compensatory time at the appropriate rate for all verified time spent responding to the emergency from home, with a minimum of 15 minutes of compensatory time to be granted in any calendar day on which any such emergency responses were required, up to a maximum of two hours of compensatory time in any calendar day.
ARTICLE 5 HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 5.1 Work Day and Work Week
This Article shall be to calculate overtime and shall not be a guarantee of work or hours for any day or week.
The normal work week shall consist of five (5) consecutive 8-hour days Monday through Friday, except where the Employer's operations require different scheduling needs. The Employer will notify the Union of these exceptions.
The work week shall be a regular recurring seven (7) day period beginning at 12:00 midnight (one minute after 11:59 p.m. Saturday) Sunday and ending at 12:00 midnight the following Sunday. The normal work day shall begin at 8:00 A.M. and end at 4:30 P.M., as determined by the Employer.
15
356634.1
The Employer may change the time of its normal work day or work week upon reasonable notice to, and upon request, discussion with the Union, with the approval of the Director of Labor Relations. Such changes shall not be made solely to avoid the payment of overtime.
Such notice shall be given in writing to the Union at least ten (10) days in advance of the proposed change. The Employer will not implement its proposed change until the Union has had a reasonable opportunity within said ten (10) day period to present its views and discuss the changes with the Employer. Section 5.2 Overtime
All work performed in excess of forty (40) hours worked per week; or in excess of eight (8) hours worked per day where the employee has forty (40) hours of work or excused absences; or on Saturday as such, when Saturday is not part of the employee's regular work week; or on the sixth day worked, shall be paid for at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular straight time hourly equivalent rate of pay. All work performed on Sunday, when Sunday is not part of the employee's regular work week; or the seventh consecutive day worked, shall be paid for at two (2) times the regular hourly equivalent rate of pay. Employees exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act shall not be eligible for overtime under this Section. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime and/or premium pay. Daily and/or weekly overtime and/or premium pay shall not be paid for the same hours worked.
16
356634.1
Section 5.3 Overtime Distribution
(a)	Overtime and/or premium time referred to in this Agreement shall be offered first to the employee performing the job and thereafter by seniority to the most senior employee in the job classification at the work location being given the opportunity to work, provided the employee has the present ability to perform the work to the satisfaction of the Employer without further training. A reasonable amount of overtime shall be a condition of continued employment, provided however, that in the event such offers of overtime are not accepted by such employees, the Employer may mandatorily assign such overtime by reverse seniority.
(b)	Employees in the classification at the work location who have been given the option to work the overtime and/or premium time, whether the option was accepted or rejected, will not be afforded the option to work subsequent overtime and/or premium time until all employees in the classification at the work location have been reasonably afforded the opportunity to work the overtime and/or premium time, subject to the same provision as in Section 5.3(a).
(c)	During the Emergency Heat Program, the Employer shall wherever possible and practical assign overtime equally by work units to the extent this can be done.
17
356634.1
ARTICLE 6 HOLIDAYS
Section 6.l	Current Holidays
Full-time salaried employees shall receive the following days off without any change in their regular salary, provided the employee is in pay status the full scheduled workday immediately preceding and the full scheduled workday immediately following such holiday, or is absent from work on one or both of such days with the Employer's permission. Such permission shall not be unreasonably denied.

Employees who return from said medical leaves of absence promptly after their doctor's release within one (1) year shall be reinstated to their former job classification if the Employer determines it is vacant or if it is then occupied by an employee with lower seniority. If the employee's former job is not available because the employee would have been laid off if the employee had not been on a leave of absence, the employee may exercise seniority rights in accordance with and subject to layoff, recall and break-in-service provisions in this Agreement. If the employee returns to work promptly after their doctor's release after more than one (1) year on a medical leave of absence, the employee shall be returned to his/her former job classification if the Employer determines it is vacant.

38
356634.1
subsequent payment will be made twice a month. If duty disability is denied, and such denial is later reversed, the employee shall be paid up to date the amount the employee was eligible to receive, less any other disability payments received by the employee subject to the same terms and conditions identified in this paragraph. Employees who return from said leaves shall be reinstated to their former job classification, if there is a vacancy in said classification or if a position in said classification is then occupied by an employee with lower seniority. If the employee's former job classification is not available because the employee would have been laid off if the employee	had not been on	a leave	of absence, the	employee may
exercise	seniority rights	in accordance	with and subject	to the
layoff, recall and break-in-service provisions of this Agreement. An employee	granted	duty	disability	leave	shall
continue	to receive full	benefits	for	any period	he/she	is on
said leave in accordance with current practice.
Section 10.9	Family and Medical Leave

39
356634.1
(3)	to care for the employee's spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition;
(4)	due to a serious health condition affecting the employee.
Such leave shall be without pay unless the employee determines to substitute accrued paid leave for which the employee is eligible.

Any employee desiring to take a leave under this Section shall provide reasonable advance notice to the Employer on a form provided by the Employer, which form shall be approved by the Union. Reasonable advance notice shall be no less than ten (10) days; and where advance notice cannot be provided, the employee shall provide notice within forty-eight (48) hours after the employee is able to do so.

There shall be no interruption of the operation of the Employer. It is agreed that the time limitations set forth herein are of the essence and that no action or matter not in compliance therewith shall be considered the subject of a grievance unless said time limitations are extended by written agreement of both parties to this Agreement.
Failure of the Employer to answer a grievance within the time limits herein shall permit the Union to advance the case to the next Step. The Union will be informed of and allowed to be in attendance at all grievance or disciplinary hearings.

Failure to post and so notify the union will permit immediate advancement to arbitration unless corrected within two (2) working days of notice of failure to post.
B.	The Department Head or the Department Head’s designee shall meet with the Union’s representative at least once each month to discuss all pending grievances that have been advanced to Step II. The purpose of the Step II meeting will be for the Department and the Union to share relevant information and discuss their
42
356634.1
respective positions with respect to each grievance pending at Step II, and attempt to amicably resolve as many grievances as possible. The Department Head or the Department Head’s designee shall have the requisite authority to resolve grievances during the Step II meeting. No grievances will be discussed at more than one Step II meeting, unless the City and the Union mutually agree that further meeting and discussion would be beneficial. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve the City and the Union from their obligations to otherwise process and respond to grievances in accordance with this Article.
C.	The Department Head or the Department Head's designee will notify the employee and Union in writing with a copy to the Union of his/her decision within seven (7) working days of the completion of the Step II meeting. The response to the grievance shall state the Department’s position with respect to the grievance together with a brief statement of the facts and reason(s) supporting that position.
D.	Any settlement at Step I or II shall be binding upon the Employer, Union and the aggrieved employee or employees. Grievances may be withdrawn without prejudice at any Step of the grievance procedure if mutually agreed.
43
356634.1
E.	If the grievance is not settled at the second Step, the Union or the Employer, but not an individual employee, may request final and binding arbitration by serving written notice on the other within ten (10) working days from receipt of the Employer's Step II decision or the date it was due.
F.	If the grievance or arbitration affects more than one employee, it may be presented by a single selected employee representative of the group or class. A class action shall be identified to the Employer at Step I or as soon as practicable. The resolution of a grievance filed on behalf of a group of employees shall be made applicable to all of the affected employees within that group.
G.	Even though a grievance has been filed, employees are obligated to follow instructions or	orders of
supervisors or the	Employer, except	where	the
instruction or order is so inherently dangerous to the employee that it could cause death or serious physical harm. The Employer agrees that by following instructions or orders the employee does not waive his/her right to process the grievance. Refusal to follow instructions or orders shall be cause for discipline.
H.	Upon request, at any Step of the grievance procedure prior to arbitration the Union shall be given specific documents, books and papers reasonably available and
44
356634.1
pertinent to the grievance under consideration to which the Union is legally entitled.
Step III - ARBITRATION
If the matter is not settled in Step II the Union or the Employer, but not an individual employee or employees, may submit the dispute to arbitration by serving a written request to arbitrate to the designated representative from the Employer’s operating department, with copies of the request to the designated law department representative and counsel for the Coalition Unions, setting forth the facts and specific relief requested, within ten (10) working days after the answer is given or due at Step II hereof.
Either party may submit the grievance to arbitration by serving a written request to arbitrate to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service under the rules of that tribunal with a copy to the other party. The foregoing shall not prevent the Employer and Union from mutually agreeing to the selection of an arbitrator.
Arbitrators will advise the parties of their fees and expenses prior to selection and such fees and expenses shall be borne equally between the Union and Employer. The Arbitrator shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents at the request of either party. Each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representative and witnesses. The cost of a transcript shall be shared if the necessity of a transcript is mutually agreed upon between the parties. Arbitrators shall submit their decision
45
356634.1
within thirty (30) days following the close of the hearing. The parties may agree to submit more than one (1) grievance to a selected arbitrator.
An arbitrable matter must involve the meaning and application or interpretation of a specific provision of this Agreement or a document incorporated by reference thereto. The provisions of this Agreement and any other document incorporated by reference in this Agreement shall be the sole source of any rights which either party may assert in arbitration. Questions of arbitrability shall be decided by the arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall have no power to amend, add to, subtract from, or change the terms of this Agreement, and shall be authorized only to interpret the existing provisions of this Agreement and apply them to the specific facts of the grievance or dispute. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be based wholly on the evidence and arguments presented to him by the parties in the presence of each other. No arbitration hearing shall be held unless both parties are present. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute, including the employee or employees involved. Where timeliness is in dispute, it shall be decided by the arbitrator.
C.	EXPEDITED ARBITRATION
The Employer and the Union may mutually agree to submit any grievance to expedited arbitration. Pursuant to expedited arbitration, the parties shall mutually select an arbitrator from a group of arbitrators approved by the parties. The expedited arbitration hearing shall be scheduled as early as
46
356634.1
possible from the date the parties agreed to submit the grievance to expedited arbitration. The parties agree to waive the stenographic recording of the hearing and the filing of post-hearing briefs. Pursuant to the parties’ agreement, the arbitrator shall issue either an oral decision at the close of the hearing or a written decision within twenty (20) days of the date of the hearing. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute.
D.	MANAGEMENT OF ARBITRATION DOCKET
A representative from the Employer’s law department and counsel for the Coalition Unions shall meet at least quarterly, or more frequently as necessary, in order to discuss the scheduling of specific cases for available hearing dates. At these meetings, the parties shall designate at least one preestablished hearing date per month for the arbitration of grievances.
ARTICLE 12 NO STRIKES-NO LOCKOUT

47
356634.1
any such acts take place or are engaged in by any employee or group of employees in the Union's bargaining unit, the Union further agrees it will use its best efforts to cause an immediate cessation thereof. If the Union immediately takes all necessary steps in good faith to end any stoppages, strikes, picketing, intentional slowdown or suspension of work, including:
(a)	publicly disclaiming such action as not called or sanctioned by the Union, and;
(b)	posting notices in conspicuous places which notify involved employees that the action was not called or sanctioned by the Union, in addition to instructing employees to immediately cease such activity, the Employer agrees that it will not bring action against the Union to establish responsibility for such unauthorized conduct.
Section 12.3

356634.1
members of the Union, a semi-monthly amount as certified by the Union and shall remit such deductions to the Union at the same time that the dues check-off is remitted.
It is understood that the amount of deductions from said non-member bargaining unit employees will not exceed the regular monthly union dues and represents the employee's fair share cost of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.
Section 13.3
Nothing in this Agreement shall be inconsistent with Section 6(g) of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act in protecting the right of non-association of employees based upon the bona fide religious tenets or teachings of a Church or other religious body of which such employees are members.

Disputes as to the accuracy of such lists may be brought to the Employer's attention by the Union, in writing, and shall be resolved promptly by the Director of Labor Relations.
53
356634.1
ARTICLE 15 LAYOFFS AND RE-EMPLOYMENT
Section 15.1	Notice
a.	Preliminary Notice. Whenever the Employer becomes aware that a layoff may be necessary and begins to make actual plans to layoff, the Union shall be notified. Such notice shall state the classifications which may be affected and other details as known. Upon request from the Union, the Employer will meet to discuss the proposed layoff.
b.	Notice of Layoff.

Section 15.2	Order of Layoffs
Probationary employees with more than ninety (90) days of service shall be laid off first. Thereafter, the least senior employee in the affected job classification in the department shall be laid off first, provided senior employees retained have the ability to perform the required duties of the job. Seniority shall mean, for purposes of this Section, the employee's continuous service in any bargaining unit titles. In the event of a layoff, all employees acting as Union Stewards in accordance with Section 16.1 shall be the last laid off in the affected classification, provided the Union Steward has the then present ability to perform the job without further training.
54

Section 15.4	Recall
Employees shall be recalled (primary) in the reverse order of layoff, provided the employee has the then present ability to perform the required work without further training after a reasonable period of orientation. Employees on a recall list shall also be eligible for recall (secondary) on a seniority basis to an equal or lower-rated job vacancy in their department, provided the employee has the then present ability to perform the required work without further training after a reasonable period of orientation. Employees recalled to equal or lower-rated jobs shall retain recall rights to the initial job from which they were laid off.
The duration of an employee’s recall rights is governed by Section 8.4 (Break in Service).

Section 16.1	Stewards
The Union will advise the Employer in writing of the names of the Union's eleven (11) Stewards and one Chief Steward and their department or area agreed upon with the Employer and shall notify the Employer promptly of any changes. Absent such written notification, the Employer shall have no obligation to deal with an employee as a steward.
Stewards will be permitted a reasonable amount of time to handle and process grievances referred by employees at the appropriate steps of the grievance procedure during normal working hours, without the loss of pay, where this does not substantially interfere with the efficient operation of the Department, and provided that this does not unreasonably interrupt the work of employees. Stewards shall notify their immediate supervisors in advance of their intention to handle and process grievances, it being understood that the operation
56
356634.1
of the Department takes precedence unless there is an emergency, such permission shall not be unreasonably denied.
Employees acting as Stewards shall not be discriminated against because of their activities on behalf of the Union, nor shall they be involuntarily transferred from their job assignments or locations except temporarily in emergencies, or upon agreement by the Union. Transfer of Union Stewards in an emergency will be discussed with the Union in advance of any such transfer.
Section 16.2	Union Rights
The Union shall have the right and responsibility to represent the interests of all employees in the Unit, to present its views to the City on matters of concern, either orally or in writing, and to consult and be consulted with, in respect to the formulation, development and implementation of policies and programs affecting working conditions.
Section 16.3	Right of Access
Duly authorized Officials of the Union will be permitted during normal hours, to enter Employer facilities for purposes of handling grievances, observing conditions under which employees are working, attending meetings authorized by this Agreement or for the administration of this Agreement. The Union will not abuse this privilege, and such right of entry shall be consistent with current practices, and shall at all times be conducted in a manner so as not to interfere with normal operations. The Employer may be able to change or set rules of access, provided that any change in current practices
57
356634.1
must be reasonable and subject to the grievance procedure. By mutual agreement between the Union and the Employer, the Union may call a meeting during working hours to prevent misunderstandings, resolve or clarify a position or ratify this Agreement. The Employer agrees to make available conference or meeting rooms for meetings under this Article or authorized by this Agreement upon request of the Union and subject to the Employer's reasonable rules relating to the Union's use of its premises.
Section 16.4	Negotiating Team
Up to three (3) employees designated as being on the Union's negotiating team who are scheduled to work on a day on which negotiations will occur, shall, for the purpose of attending scheduled negotiations, be excused from their regular duties without loss of regular straight time pay.
ARTICLE 17 FILLING OF VACANCIES
Section 17.1 Declaration of Vacancy
The Employer shall determine if there is a permanent vacancy to be filled and, at any time before said vacancy is filled, whether or not said vacancy shall be filled. Section 17.2 Transfer Requests on File
Employees within a department who desire a change in location of their job assignment shall request such change in writing on the Employer's Form. Employees may file such requests in December for the period beginning in January and continuing through June of the following year and in June for
58
356634.1
the period beginning in July and continuing through December. Employees filing multiple requests and accepting a transfer shall only be allowed a single transfer in the six (6) month period.
When filling a vacancy, the Employer shall select the most senior employee in the job classification in the department who has such a request on file, provided the employee has the present ability to perform the required work without further training after a reasonable amount of orientation. Section 17.3 Recall or Reinstatement
When filling a vacancy and there are no said employees who have requests on file, the Employer shall select the employee in the job classification in the department from the recall or reinstatement list, if any, in accordance with the primary and secondary recall provisions of Article 15 of this Agreement. Section 17.4 Bidding
When filling a vacancy and there are no said employees who have transfer requests on file and no eligible employees on said lists, the Employer shall post the job for bidding and forward a copy to the Union.
The posting of an Employer determined permanent vacancy shall be on bulletin boards at each Employer physical site in the department and at other appropriate locations as determined by the Employer. Said vacancy shall be posted for fourteen (14) days. The posting shall contain at least the following: job title, qualifications, hours, work location if known, and rate of pay.
59
356634.1
Section 17.5	Selection
Bargaining Unit employees may bid on jobs the Employer determines to be permanently vacant for promotion or transfer to equal or lower-rated jobs. All applicants and Bargaining Unit bidders for such jobs shall be considered as one group for purposes of selection.
All bidders shall meet the minimum qualifications for the job in order to be considered for selection by the Employer. In making selections, the Employer shall give preference to Bargaining Unit bidders over non-bargaining unit applicants unless the non-bargaining unit applicants have demonstrably greater skill and ability to fulfill the needs determined by the Employer.
If bargaining unit bidders are selected, however, where bargaining unit bidders are relatively equally qualified to perform the work required, the Employer shall select the most senior employee bidder based on continuous service in the bargaining unit. Preference shall be given to bidders within the department. The Employer shall determine whether employees are "relatively equally qualified" based upon evidence of performance and qualifications.
Bidders who are not selected shall be so notified by the Department Head. A successful bidder may not bid for another Employer determined vacancy for one (1) year unless such employee is involuntarily moved to another location from a position into which he had bid.
60
356634.1
During the bidding and/or selection process set forth in this Section, the Employer may temporarily fill said vacancy consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
When an employee is deemed to have successfully filled a permanent vacancy and is reclassified to another position at a higher rate of pay, or in a higher pay grade, such employee shall receive the higher rate of pay or a pay increase of one step, or the entrance rate for the new position, whichever is applicable.
The successful bidder for any jobs under this Section shall have an evaluation period, not exceed sixty (60) days, to demonstrate that he or she can perform the job. If the Employer has just cause based upon the employee's job performance at any time during that period that the successful bidder cannot perform the job, then the successful bidder shall be returned to the job he/she held just prior to the awarding of the bid, displacing, if necessary, any employee who has been placed into said job.
Section 17.6	Involuntary Transfer
Where a vacancy remains unfilled after application of Sections 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, and 17.5, the Employer may involuntarily transfer the least senior employee in the same classification and department to fill said vacancy where an experienced employee rather than a new hire is necessary.
61
356634.1
Section 17.7	Detailing
Detailing is the temporary transfer of an employee to a work assignment within his/her job classification geographically removed from the employee's normal work site.
Employees shall not be detailed for more than thirty (30) days, unless the Employer gives notice to the Union of its need to do so and confers with the Union upon request. In any event, no such assignment may extend beyond ninety (90) days without the agreement of the parties.
The Employer shall notify the employees of the requirements for said detailing and before detailing shall seek volunteers among the employees who have the then present ability to perform the work required without further training. If there are more volunteers then there are assignments, selections shall be made on the basis of seniority. If there are insufficient volunteers, the Employer shall assign the detailing by inverse seniority, starting with the least senior first, and attempt to rotate such assignments within each calendar year.
ARTICLE 18 DISCIPLINE
Section 18.1	Procedure
Suspensions over 10 days and discharges shall be governed exclusively by the City of Chicago's Personnel or Police Board Rules, whichever may be applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, suspensions of 11 days or more may be appealed to arbitration in lieu of the Personnel or Police Board upon the written request of the Union. Disciplinary cases which are
62
356634.1
converted from a discharge to a suspension as a result of decision of the Personnel or Police Board do not thereafter become arbitrable as a result of said decision. The grievance procedure provisions herein and the Personnel or Police Board appeals procedure are mutually exclusive, and no relief shall be available under both.
Section 18.2	Types of Discipline/Information
The Employer within its discretion may determine whether disciplinary action should be an oral warning, written reprimand, suspension or discharge, depending upon various factors, such as, but not limited to, the severity of the offense or the employee's prior record. Demotions shall not be used as a part of discipline. Transfer shall not be part of an employee's discipline. Such discipline shall be administered as soon as practical after the Employer has had a reasonable opportunity to fully investigate the matter.
In cases of oral warnings, the supervisor shall inform the employee that she/he is receiving an oral warning and the reasons therefore. For discipline other than oral warnings, the employee's immediate supervisor shall meet with the employee and notify him/her of the accusations against the employee and give the employee an opportunity to answer said accusations. Specifically, the supervisor shall tell the employee the names of witnesses, if any, and make available copies of pertinent documents the employee or union is legally entitled to receive, to the extent then known and available. If the employee requests the presence of a Union representative at such meeting,
63
356634.1
one will be provided, if conveniently available, who shall be given the opportunity, if the employee requests, to rebut the discipline and request further pertinent information.
The Employer shall not have to unreasonably defer or avoid its intended disciplinary action because of the unavailability of an employee representative, taking all of the circumstances into account. The Employer is not obligated to meet with the employee prior to taking disciplinary action where the employee is unavailable or in emergency situations. The Employer's failure to satisfy this Article 18.2 shall not in and of itself result in a reversal of the Employer's disciplinary action or cause the employer to pay back pay to the employee.
In the event disciplinary action is taken, the employee and the Union shall be given, in writing, a statement of the reasons therefore. The employee shall initial a copy, noting receipt only, which shall be placed in the employee's file.
Any record of discipline may be retained for a period of time not to exceed eighteen (18) months and shall thereafter not be used as the basis of any further disciplinary action, unless a pattern of sustained infraction exists. A pattern shall be defined as at least two (2) substantially similar offenses during said eighteen (18) month period.
In any disciplinary investigation of a non-egregious offense conducted by the investigative staff of the Office of Budget and Management, the Employer shall notify the employee who is the subject of the disciplinary investigation of the pendency of the investigation and its subject matter, within
64
356634.1
thirty (30) calendar days of the Employer being made aware of the alleged rule violation. For the purposes of this Section, the term "non-egregious offense" shall not include indictable criminal offenses, gross insubordination, residency issues, or drug and alcohol violations. Thereafter, the employee shall be granted a predisciplinary hearing if requested within thirty (30) days. Any discipline given in violation of this notice provision shall be null and void.
Section 18.3	Procedure For Department Review of Disciplinary Action Including Suspension For Ten (10) Days Or Less
Step 1. Within five (5) working days after an employee receives written notice of any proposed disciplinary action, including a suspension for ten (10) days or less, which is not appealable to the Personnel or Police Board, the Employer shall conduct a meeting with the union and employee. Thereafter, discipline shall be administered as soon as possible after the employer has had a reasonable opportunity to further investigate the matter as appropriate. If disciplinary action is taken after the meeting or further investigation, the employee may request in writing to the Department Head for review of the said disciplinary action on a form provided by the Employer. Said request for review shall be in writing and submitted within three (3) working days of receipt of written notice of discipline. Said review form shall be printed on the back of or attached to the notice or discipline together with instruct-ions for appeal. The failure to submit a
65
356634.1
written request for review of disciplinary action within three (3) working days of receipt of notice of disciplinary action will preclude the employee's right to review.
Step 2. Within three (3) working days or any mutually agreed upon extension after the Department Head or designee receives the employee's request for review, the Department Head or designee shall conduct a meeting to review the discipline. Failure to conduct said meeting in three (3) days will result in automatic advancement to Step 4 and the Union shall so notify the Employer. At the meeting, the Department will give the basis for its action and the employee and union representative, if any, will be heard and provided the opportunity to ask questions. The Department Head or designee shall render a written decision within two (2) working days of the meeting, except where both parties agree a further investigation is required. The absence of such agreement or failure to decide and communicate such decision will result in automatic advancement to Step 4 and the Union shall so notify the Employer. A copy of such decision shall be sent to the employee and the Union.
Step 3. Where further investigation is agreed upon, a second meeting shall be held between the Department Head or designee and the employee and the Union representative to discuss the results of the investigation. Said meeting shall be conducted within five (5) working days of the close of the Step 2 meeting, unless otherwise agreed by the
66
356634.1
parties. The Department Head or designee shall render a written decision within two (2) working days of the second meeting. A copy of such decision shall be sent to the employee and the Union. If the parties fail to meet within five (5) working days or a written decision is not submitted within two (2) working days, the appeal shall automatically proceed to Step 4 and the Union shall so notify the Employer. Except where otherwise indicated, the time limits set forth herein are to encourage the prompt reviews of said disciplinary action and failure to comply with these time limits will not affect the validity of the said disciplinary action. This procedure shall be the employee's exclusive remedy for all said disciplinary action, including suspension for ten (10) days or less.
Step 4. If the matter is not settled in Steps 2 or 3, the Union may submit the matter to arbitration under the terms of this Agreement or any local Union agreement. The rules governing procedure for arbitration shall be the same as in Step 3 of Article 11 of this Agreement.
Section 18.4	Conduct of Disciplinary Investigations
Supplementing all rights and processes due employees covered by this Agreement who may be the subject of a disciplinary investigation by the Inspector General, the interview will be conducted in the following manner:
67
356634.1
A.	The interview of the employee shall be scheduled at a reasonable time, preferably while the employee is on duty, or if feasible, during day shift hours.
B.	The interview, depending upon the allegation, will take place at the employee's location of assignment, normal department location or other appropriate location.
C.	Prior	to an interview,	the employee under
investigation shall be informed of the person in charge of the investigation, the identity of the interviewer and all persons present during the interview. When a formal statement is being taken, all questions directed to the employee shall be asked by and through one interviewer at a time.
D.	The length of the interview sessions will be reasonable, with reasonable interruptions permitted for personal necessities.
E.	At the beginning of the interview, the employee shall be informed of the nature of the matters to be discussed.
F.	An employee under investigation shall not be threatened with transfer, dismissal or disciplinary action, or promised a reward, as an inducement to provide information relating to the matter under investigation, or for exercising any rights contained
68
356634.1
in this Agreement, provided, however, that this Section shall not prohibit or prevent an accurate reading of the employee's administrative rights, or the imposition of discipline in accordance therewith.
G.	An employee under investigation will be provided without unreasonable delay with a copy of any written statement the employee has made.
H.	(1) If the allegation under investigation indicates a recommendation for discipline is probable against the employee, said employee will be given the statutory administrative proceedings rights prior to the commencement of the interview. (2) If the allegation indicates that criminal prosecution may be probable against said employee, the provisions of this Section shall be inapplicable and said employee will be afforded his constitutional rights concerning selfincrimination prior to the commencement of the interview. An employee will not be read his/her administrative and Miranda rights during the same interview.
I.	At the request of the employee under investigation, an employee who may be subject to discipline shall have the right to be represented in the interview by a representative of the Union. The employee shall be told that he/she has the right to Union representation before commencement of the interview. The interrogation shall be suspended until representation
69
356634.1
can be obtained, provided the suspension is not for an unreasonable time and the Employer does not have the interview unduly delayed.
J.	The Employer shall not compel an employee under investigation to speak or testify before, or to be questioned by, any non-governmental agency relating to any matter or issue under investigation.
K.	The results of a polygraph examination shall not be used against an employee in any forum adverse to the employee's interests. The Employer will not require a polygraph examination if it is illegal to do so. If an employee is asked to take a polygraph examination, he/she will be advised in writing 24 hours prior to the administration of the examination. The results of any polygraph examination shall be known to the employee within one week.
L.	This Section shall not apply to employee witnesses.
M.	The identity of an employee under investigation shall not be made available to the media during the course of an investigation until charges are filed by the Employer and the employee has the opportunity to respond thereto. If an employee is exonerated after the City initially informed the media of the charges against the employee, the City will make that fact available to the media where the employee requests it.
N.	In the event that disciplinary action is taken against an employee, any allegations of violations of this
70
356634.1
Section shall be heard in connection with, and in the same forum as, grievances which protest said disciplinary action, except as provided in paragraph O(2) below. If no disciplinary action is brought against the employee following the conclusion of the Inspector General's investigation, no grievance concerning the conduct of the investigation shall exist.
O.	(1) Any evidence or information including employee statements that is obtained in violation of the rights enumerated in this Section, shall be suppressed and shall not be used by the Employer for any disciplinary action against the employee, or in the case of promotions or transfers.
(2)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph N above, at the option of the Union, a claim that the Inspector General has violated the provisions of this Section may be raised in a suppression hearing before a member of the permanent hearing panel listed herein, rather than in the disciplinary hearing as required in paragraph N above.
(2)(b)(1) The Union may exercise this option by notifying the employee's Department Head and the Employer's Law Department in writing not later than ten (10) calendar days before an arbitration or the Personnel or Police Board hearing, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Agreement. The appeal
71
356634.1
shall specify the particular contract provisions allegedly violated, together with a factual summary of the conduct alleged to have violated the Agreement. It is understood that by exercising this option, any and all time limits set forth in Chapter 2-74-060 of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago regarding the Personnel Board hearing shall be tolled until the arbitrator renders a decision as provided below.
(2)(b)(2) Upon receipt of said notice, the parties will select in order of rotation one of the three permanent hearing panel members who are chosen as follows. To be eligible for service on this panel, members must be willing to convene a suppression hearing within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of his or her selection. To select the initial panel, or should any member of the panel resign or be removed upon mutual agreement of the parties during the life of this Agreement,	the	parties will	meet to reach
agreement on new panel member who must be an arbitrator listed	with	the Federal	Mediation and
Conciliation Service.	If	no agreement	can be reached,
the Employer will	request a panel	of seven (7)
arbitrators from FMCS, all of whom must be members of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Thereafter, the parties will meet to strike names from the list, with the Employer striking first, until one name remains, which person shall be named to the panel.
72
356634.1
2(c) The suppression hearing shall be convened within thirty (30) calendar days of the selection of the panel member, or at such other time as the parties may mutually agree. The arbitrator's jurisdiction shall be limited to determining if the Inspector General obtained evidence or statements in violation of paragraph O(1) above, and if such evidence should be suppressed. The arbitrator shall have no authority to rule on the merits of any underlying discipline or take any other action beyond that specifically set forth in this subparagraph.
2(d) The panel member shall render an expedited decision which shall be final and binding upon the parties. It shall not be subject to collateral attack in any further disciplinary proceeding involving the employee in question.
P.	Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section to the contrary, no interview by the Inspector General will be conducted at a police station or other correctional facility unless the employee works at the police station or correctional facility, or if the employee has been incarcerated for more than 72 hours.
73
356634.1
ARTICLE 19 MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT
Section 19.1 Automobile Reimbursement
Employees who are required by the Employer to use their own automobiles in the performance of their job shall receive mileage reimbursement at the then effective rate recognized by the Internal Revenue Service, with a maximum of $250 per month. On the effective date of this Agreement, following its ratification by all parties, the maximum reimbursement will increase to $350.00 per month. Effective February 1, 2008, the maximum reimbursement will increase to $450.00 per month. Effective February 1, 2009, the maximum reimbursement will increase to $550.00 per month.	Thereafter, the maximum
reimbursement will increase effective each February 1 by the percentage increase in the Transportation Expenditure Category of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U.S. City Average for the previous year, as rounded to the nearest $5 increment. Employees seeking mileage reimbursement must submit that request on a form provided by the Employer. Payment for mileage expenses will be made on a monthly basis. In the event that during the life of this Agreement the Employer shall implement for any group of employees an automobile expense reimbursement program which is more favorable to employees than the provisions of this paragraph, upon notice from the Union, the Employer will meet and discuss with representatives of the Union the possible application of said new program to employees covered by this Agreement.

75
356634.1
evidence becomes admissible before the Personnel or Police
Board.
ARTICLE 22 PERSONNEL RECORDS AND FORMS
Section 22.1	Attendance Records
An employee upon reasonable advance notice shall have the right to review his/her time and pay records on file with the Employer but shall not be able to review the time and pay records of other employees.
Section 22.2	Personnel Files

The Employer's personnel files and disciplinary history files relating to any employee shall, upon reasonable advance notice, be open and available for inspection by the affected employee and/or authorized Union representative, during regular business hours, except for information which the employer deems confidential; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the employee from exercising the employee's statutory rights to inspect documents. Upon request of the Union, the Employer will make available disciplinary records which are relevant to the Union's right to process grievances or administer this Agreement. Material and/or matter not available for inspection shall not be used in any manner or forum adverse to the employee's interests.
Disciplinary records and files may be retained for a period of time not to exceed three (3) years and shall thereafter not be used to support an adverse employment action unless a pattern of sustained similar infraction exists.
76
356634.1
Any information of an adverse employment nature which is unfounded, exonerated or otherwise not sustained, shall be removed from the personnel files.
Section 22.3	Employee Notification
No information may be used against an employee in any disciplinary proceeding until it has been made part of the official personnel file or provided for inspection.
The employee may have placed in his/her personnel file a rebuttal to anything placed in said file.
A copy of any disciplinary action or material related to employee performance which is placed in the official personnel file shall be served upon the employee in person (the employee so noting receipt) or sent by certified mail (return receipt requested) to the employee's last address appearing on the records of the Employer. It is the obligation of such employee to provide the Employer with his/her current address.
Section 22.4	Telephone Numbers
The Employer shall not release an employee's phone number and/or address to non-work related sources without the employee's permission. The City Council of the City of Chicago and its committees in the exercise of its legislative authority shall be considered a work related source within the meaning of this Section.

ARTICLE 24 DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROGRAM
Section 24.1	Policy Statement
The City of Chicago's essential mission is to provide services to its citizens in a safe and economic manner. The
78
356634.1
parties to this Agreement recognize that drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace has a deleterious effect on the health and safety of employees, as well as their morale and productivity, all of which creates an undue burden on the persons which the City and the employees under this Agreement serve. Furthermore, the economic cost of providing health care services to employees who abuse drugs and alcohol has put an increasing burden on the City's finances.
The Employer and the Union maintain a strong commitment to protect people and property, and to provide a safe working environment. To this end, the employer has also established its confidential Employee Assistance Program for employees with personal problems, including alcohol and substance abuse, and the parties to this Agreement urge employees who have such problems to utilize the Program's services.
To maintain a workplace which provides a safe and healthy work environment for all employees, the following drug and alcohol program is also established.
Section 24.2	Definitions
(a)	Alcohol: Ethyl alcohol
(b)	Prohibited Items & Substances: all illegal drugs and controlled substances, alcoholic beverages, and drug paraphernalia in the possession of, or being used by, an employee on the job or the premises of the Employer.
(c)	Employer Premises: all property, facilities, land, buildings, structures, automobiles, trucks and other vehicles
79
356634.1
owned, leased or used by the Employer as job sites or work locations and over which the Employer has authority as employer.
(d)	Employee: all persons covered by this Agreement.
(e)	Accident: an event resulting in injury to a person requiring medical attention or causing significant damage to property to which an employee contributed as a direct or indirect cause.
(f)	Reasonable Cause: erratic or unusual behavior by an employee, including but not limited to noticeable imbalance, incoherence and disorientation, which would lead a person of ordinary sensibilities to conclude that the employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
(g)	Under the Influence: any mental, emotional, sensory or physical impairment due to the use of drugs or alcohol.
(h)	Test: the taking and analysis of any body component sample, whether by blood, breath, urine, or in any other scientifically reliable manner, for the purpose of identifying, measuring or quantifying the presence or absence of drugs, alcohol or any metabolite thereof.
Section 24.3	Disciplinary Action
(a)	All employees must report to work in a physical condition that will enable them to perform their jobs in a safe manner. Further, employees shall not use, possess, dispense or receive prohibited items or substances on or at the Employer's premises, nor shall they report to work under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
80
356634.1
(b)	When, based upon the direct observation of two (2) supervisors, the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of a prohibited substance, the Employer shall have the right to subject that employee to a drug and alcohol test. At the Employer's discretion, the employee may be placed on administrative leave with pay until test results are available. If the test results prove negative, the employee shall be reinstated. In all other cases, the Employer will terminate all employees who:
(i)	test positive for drug and/or alcohol use;
(ii)	refuse to cooperate with testing procedures;
(iii)	are found to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol while on duty and on the Employer's premises;
(iv)	are found in possession of alcohol, drugs or drug paraphernalia, or are found selling or distributing drugs or drug paraphernalia, on the Employer's premises.
(c)	All adverse employment action taken against an employee under this program shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures of this Agreement.
Section 24.4	Drug and Alcohol Testing
(a)	The Employer may require drug and/or alcohol testing under the following conditions:
(i)	a test may be administered in the event that
two supervisors have reasonable cause to believe that an employee has reported to work under the influence of or is at work under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
81
356634.1
(ii)	a test may be required if an employee is involved in a workplace accident or fighting;
(iii)	a test may be required as part of a followup to counseling or rehabilitation for substance abuse for up to a one year period.
(b)	Employees	to be	tested will	be required to	sign a
consent	form and	chain	of custody	form, assuring	proper
documentation and accuracy. If an employee refuses to sign a consent form authorizing the test, he or shall will be subject to termination.
(c)	Drug and alcohol testing will be conducted by an independent laboratory accredited by the relevant agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Service ("DHHS"), and may consist of either blood or urine tests, or both. The Employer reserves the right to utilize a breathalyzer to test for the presence of alcohol, in lieu of other clinical testing.
(d)	Laboratory testing procedures will conform to the procedures specified in the DHHS guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs dated June 9, 1994 and as may be amended hereafter by DHHS.
(e)	Initial and confirmatory test results which meet or exceed the cutoff levels for drugs set forth in the DHHS guidelines (and as they may be amended) shall be regarded as "positive," and shall presumptively establish that the tested employee was under the influence of drugs.
(f)	Initial and confirmatory (or breathalyzer) test results which meet or exceed the level of blood alcohol
82
356634.1
established in the Illinois Motor Vehicle Act as legal intoxication shall presumptively establish that the tested employee was under the influence of alcohol.
(g)	The cost of initial and confirmatory testing will be borne by the Employer.
(h)	Drug and alcohol test results shall be reported to the Commissioner of Personnel or his designee in the manner to be prescribed by the Commissioner. The applicant or incumbent shall be notified of the test results in writing. The Commissioner will inform the applicable department head of any employee who tests positive for alcohol or drugs, who in turn will initiate disciplinary proceedings under Section 24.3 above.
(i)	All urine or blood samples shall be taken in sufficient quantity as to allow for retesting. Any portion not used in the test will be preserved by scientifically reliable means for one (1) year following the test. Any employee whose test result is positive may elect, at his or her expense, to be retested by the same or other laboratory satisfactory to the Commissioner of Personnel, provided that the Employer's testing laboratory shall arrange for transmitting said sample to the second laboratory. Positive results of said retesting shall be conclusive as to the presence of alcohol or drugs. The failure to take a sufficient sample, or to preserve such sample, to allow for retesting, shall not affect the removal from eligibility of an applicant or personnel action, including discharge, of any employee.
83
356634.1
(j)	No laboratory report or test results shall appear in the incumbent's personnel file unless they are part of a personnel action under this program, but shall be placed in a special locked file maintained by the Commissioner of Personnel, except as such disclosure may be required by this policy, law or ordinance.
Section 24.5	Employee Assistance Program
Employees are encouraged to seek help for a drug or alcohol problem before it deteriorates into a disciplinary matter and may participate if they wish in the voluntary Employee Assistance Program.
ARTICLE 25 SUBCONTRACTING
It is the general policy of the Employer to continue to utilize its employees to perform work they are qualified to perform where practicable. The Employer may, however, subcontract for reasons of efficiency and economy.
The Employer will give the Union notice of any intent to request bid(s) from or otherwise employ a contractor at the same time as made public or conveyed to potential contractors. Bid specifications or guidelines which will be used by or required from contractors will be provided to the Union as well, along with a description of the work to be performed, any contemplated impact upon Bargaining Unit employees, and other relevant data necessary for the Union to discuss the contemplated action with the Employer. Prior to accepting a private contract, the Employer and the Union will meet ninety (90) days in advance of
84
356634.1
the intended start date to review any proposals of the Union and compare such proposals to any bid or contract being considered for acceptance.
The Employer will work with the Union in making every reasonable effort to place adversely affected employees into other bargaining unit positions.
In the event that the Employer determines to subcontract unit work under this Agreement, and as a result bargaining unit employees would be laid off by the proposed subcontracting, the Employer shall make available, on a seniority basis, equal-rated permanent jobs which the Employer has declared to be vacant in the affected Department, or other departments, as the case may be, in that order, provided the laid off employees have the then present ability to perform the required work without further training. However, the employee shall be provided with a reasonable amount of orientation to allow him or her to perform the work.
Prior to sub-contracting of bargaining unit work, the Employer, the Union, and the proposed sub-contractor shall meet to discuss the employment of employees subject to layoff. During that meeting the Employer will request and urge that the subcontractor hire laid off employees.
ARTICLE 26 JOINT APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING PROGRAM INITIATIVE
Section 26.1
The City of Chicago and each Coalition Union (the “Parties”) agree to create a Joint Apprenticeship and Training
85
356634.1
Program Initiative (“Initiative”) in conjunction with certain third parties including, but without limitation, the Chicago Public Schools (“CPS”), the City Colleges of Chicago (“City Colleges”) and External Contractors. The purpose of the Initiative is to increase the opportunities for participation of graduates of CPS and/or City Colleges in Union apprenticeship and training programs and to provide expanded postapprenticeship and training employment opportunities for such graduates. In conjunction with the execution of each Coalition Union’s collective bargaining agreement with the City of Chicago, the Parties shall enter into a supplemental memorandum of understanding regarding the structure, implementation, monitoring and enforcement of this Initiative. Said memorandum shall be attached to this Agreement as Appendix D.
Section 26.2
The Initiative shall generally include the following:
a.	A commitment by each Coalition Union to establish or otherwise expand available apprenticeship and training opportunities; a commitment by the Coalition to fill at least 100 apprenticeship slots across Coalition Unions with CPS students, graduates or former students with a GED and/or City College students and graduates by June 30 of each year of this Agreement.
b.	A commitment by the Coalition and the City to
86
356634.1
collaborate with the Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges of Chicago and External Contractors to prepare CPS and City Colleges students to enter Union apprenticeship and training programs. In particular, the Coalition and the City will cooperate with the Chicago Public Schools, City Colleges of Chicago and External Contractors to publicize available building and trades apprenticeship and training programs and subsequent careers; to consider establishing training programs as appropriate; and to expand postapprenticeship and training employment opportunities.
c.	The Parties shall appoint a Chair and an Auditor to oversee this Initiative and ensure that the parties take appropriate steps to fulfill the commitments set forth in this Article and supplemental memorandum attached hereto.
ARTICLE 27 RATIFICATION AND TERMINATION
The terms of this Agreement shall be subject to ratification by the City Council of the City of Chicago and concurrent adoption in ordinance form. The Employer and the Union will cooperate to secure this legislative approval.
This Agreement shall be effective as of said date of ratification by the City Council and shall remain in full force and effect from July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2017. Thereafter, it shall automatically renew itself from year to year unless at least sixty (60) days and not more than one-hundred twenty (120) days prior to the termination date or anniversary thereof,
87
356634.1
either party gives written notice to the other by Certified Mail, return receipt requested, of a desire to amend, add to, subtract from, or terminate this Agreement.
In the event such notice of a desire to amend, add to, or subtract from the terms of this Agreement is given, the parties shall, within a reasonable time thereafter, enter into negotiations concerning the request. If such notice is given, the parties shall meet promptly to negotiate a new Agreement.
This Agreement constitutes the entire contract between the Employer and the Union and settles all demands and issues with respect to all matters subject to collective bargaining. The Employer and the Union, therefore, voluntarily waive the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any matter which is subject to collective bargaining whether or not such matter is specifically referred to herein, and even though such matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of the parties at the time this Agreement was negotiated or signed.
In the event the City of Chicago agrees to or authorizes additional vacation, holiday or other paid time off, or voluntary unpaid time off with any other bargaining unit (excluding police and/or fire) during the term of this Agreement, such additional time off shall be granted to all employees covered by this Agreement.
88

LABOR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND COUPE
SIDE LETTER
FOUR 10-HOUR DAY WORKWEEK
Agree to the following in a side letter to this Agreement:
Since the Arbitrator issued his Opinion and Award dated June 21, 2007 in the Matter of Arbitration between the City of Chicago and Laborers Local 1001/Teamsters Local 726 (“Award”), the City and affected Coalition Unions have explored various approaches to resolving their dispute over the scope of the Award and the application of Section 3(a) of the Memorandum of Understanding dated July 18, 2005 entered into between the City and Coalition (“Section 3(a)”). In addition to amending Section 3(a) to reflect the Unions’ preferred approach to the four 10-hour workweek, the parties, in return, have discussed an agreement by the Unions to waive some or all of the monetary make whole remedies directed by the Arbitrator in his Award. Although the City is willing to amend Section 3(a) as requested by the Unions in order to conclude negotiations at the Coalition level, such willingness is contingent on the expectation that the affected Unions will reach agreement with the City to waive some or all of the monetary make whole remedies. Until such an agreement is reached, the affected Unions agree that the City shall not be obligated to implement the monetary make whole remedies in the Award. In addition, if such an agreement is not

reached by December 1, 2007, the parties shall submit the issues of the Unions’ proposed amendment to Section 3(a) to reflect the Unions’ preferred approach to the four 10-hour workweek and the City’s proposed relief from the monetary make whole remedy to an
arbitrator for resolution.
