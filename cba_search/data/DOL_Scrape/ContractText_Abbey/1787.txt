16	Art. 7(b)(4) An employee who receives
17	less than forty (40) hours of work (from the 18 date of hire to date of termination), through 19 no fault of his own, shall receive overtime 20 pay for all hours worked in excess of eight 21	(8) hours per day.
22
23	Art. 7(c) If any other craft employed by
24	the same Employer or its subcontractor is 25 receiving double-time wages in lieu of time 26 and one-half wage rate as set forth in this 27 Agreement, the Boilermaker employees 28 will automatically be entitled to the double-29 time rate of pay during the period that the 30 aforementioned crafts are employed. The 31 Chairmen of the Agreement, in accordance 32 with Article 30(c) determined on March 16, 33	2004, that ... during the period that the

very specific in that, Boilermaker employees would only be entitled to double-time during the period of time that other craft or crafts were receiving double-time. An example of this would be, if another craft received double-time on the day shift of a two (2) day job for one (1) day of eight (8) hours, then the Boilermakers would be entitled to double-time for one (1) day of eight (8) hours for that shift only. The Chairmen of the Agreement drew the essence of their determination from the National Maintenance Agreement, Article XV-6 interpretation.
Art. 7(d) Emergency Service Maintenance Agreement within Locals 107 & 647. A mutually-signed letter of assent regarding emergency services may supplement this Agreement.

Appendix “A” NCA Work Rules
Apdx. A(a) The selection of craft foremen and general foremen shall be entirely the responsibility of the Employer, it being understood that in the selection of such foremen the Employer will give primary consideration to the qualified men available in the local area. After giving such consideration the Employer may select such men from other areas. Foremen and general foremen shall take orders from individuals designated by the Employer.
Apdx. A(b) There shall be no limit on production by workmen nor restrictions on the full use of tools or equipment. Craftsmen using tools shall perform any of the work of the trade and shall work under the supervision of the craft foremen. There shall be no restrictions on efficient use of manpower other than as may be required by safety regulations, provided, however, legitimate manning practices that are a part of national or local agreements shall be followed.
Apdx. A(c) Security procedures for control of tools, equipment, and materials are solely the responsibility of the Employer.
Apdx. A(d) Workmen shall be at their place of work at the starting time and shall remain at their place of work performing
1 their assigned functions under the supervi-2 sion of the Employer until the quitting time.
3 The parties reaffirm their policy of a fair 4 day’s work for a fair day’s wage.
5
6	Apdx. A(e) Practices not a part of terms
7	and conditions of collective bargaining 8 agreements will not be recognized.
