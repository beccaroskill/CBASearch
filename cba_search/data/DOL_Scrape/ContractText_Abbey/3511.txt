The following are the Community College Districts:
Bellevue College
Cascadia Community College
Clark College
Columbia Basin College
Edmonds Community College
Grays Harbor College

Olympic College
Pierce College District

Article 1
Union Recognition
1.1	The State and the Employer recognize the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative for the employees described in Appendix A.
1.2	This Agreement covers the employees in the bargaining units described in Appendix A, entitled “Bargaining Units Represented by the Washington Public Employees Association,” but does not cover any statutorily-excluded positions, or any positions excluded in Appendix A. The titles of the jobs listed in Appendix A are listed for descriptive purposes only.
1.3	If the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) certifies the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative during the term of this Agreement for a bargaining unit covered by RCW 41.80 in any of the Employer’s Community College Districts, the terms of this Agreement will apply.
Article 2
Non-Discrimination
2.1	Under this Agreement, discrimination against employees on the basis of religion, age, gender, sex, marital status, race, color, creed, national origin, political affiliation, military status, status as an honorably discharged veteran, a disabled veteran or Vietnam era veteran, sexual orientation, or the presence of any sensory, mental or physical disability, genetic information, or because of the participation or lack of participation in union activities is prohibited, and no unlawful harassment will be tolerated.
2.2	Employees who feel they have been the subjects of unlawful discrimination, harassment or hostile work environment are encouraged to bring such issues to the attention of their supervisor or the Human Resources Office, or to file a complaint in accordance with college/district policy. In cases where an employee files both a grievance and an internal complaint regarding the same alleged discrimination, harassment or a hostile work environment, the grievance will be suspended until the internal complaint process has been completed.
2.3	Both parties agree that nothing in this Agreement will prevent the implementation of an approved affirmative action plan.
2.4	Both parties agree that nothing in this Agreement will prevent an employee from filing a complaint with the Washington State Human Rights Commission, Office of Civil Rights, or the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission.

Article 3
Workplace Behavior
3.1	The Employer and the Union agree that all employees should work in an environment that fosters mutual respect and professionalism. The parties agree that inappropriate behavior in the workplace does not promote a college’s/district’s business, employee well being, or productivity. All employees are responsible for contributing to such an environment and are expected to treat others with courtesy and respect.
3.2	Inappropriate workplace behavior by employees, supervisors and/or managers will not be tolerated. If an employee and/or the employee’s union representative believes the employee has been subjected to inappropriate behavior, the employee and/or the employee’s representative is encouraged to report this behavior to the employee’s supervisor and/or the Human Resources Office.	Inappropriate
workplace reports will be identified as such. The Employer will investigate the reported behavior and take appropriate action as necessary. The employee and/or union representative will be notified upon conclusion of the investigation. Upon request, the Employer will provide the employee and the union representative with a copy of the investigation report.
3.3	Supervisors, managers and Human Resource Office staff will receive training on processing inappropriate workplace behavior reports.
3.4	The procedural aspects of this Article are subject to Step 2 of the grievance procedure only. No other grievance steps apply.
Article 4
Hiring and Appointments
4.1	Filling Positions
A.	The Employer will determine when a position will be filled, the type of appointment to be used when filling the position, and the skills and abilities necessary to perform the duties of the specific position within a job classification. The Employer can fill a position on a full-time or parttime basis. When filling positions, the Employer will consider employees on the appropriate layoff list and the most senior candidate on the internal layoff list with the required skills and abilities who had indicated an appropriate geographic availability will be appointed to the position. If there are no names on the internal layoff list, the Employer will consider internal promotional candidates and employees who are requesting a transfer or voluntary demotion prior to considering other candidates. In all cases consideration will be limited to employees who have the skills and abilities required for the position. Positions will be posted for at least ten (10) calendar days.
WPEA HE - 2012-13
2
B.	An internal promotional candidate is an employee who applies for appointment with his or her college/district to a class with a higher salary range maximum.
C.	A transfer candidate is an employee who applies for appointment with his or her college/district to a position in the same class or to a different class with the same salary range maximum.
D.	A voluntary demotion candidate is an employee who applies for appointment with his or her college/district to a class with a lower salary range maximum.
4.2	Types of Appointment
A.	Regular Employment
The Employer may fill a position with a regular employment appointment for positions scheduled to work twelve (12) months per year.
B.	Cyclic Year Employment
The Employer may fill a position with a cyclic year appointment for positions scheduled to work less than twelve (12) full months each year, due to known, recurring periods in the annual cycle when the position is not needed. At least fifteen (15) calendar days before the start of each annual cycle, incumbents of cyclic year positions will be informed, in writing, of their scheduled periods of leave without pay in the ensuing cycle. Such periods of leave without pay will not constitute a break in service.
C.	Project Employment
1.	The Employer may appoint employees into project positions for which employment is contingent upon state, federal, local, grant, or other special funding of specific and of time-limited duration. The Employer will notify the employees, in writing, of the expected end date of the project employment.
2.	Employees who enter into project employment without previously attaining permanent status will serve a probationary period. Employees will gain permanent status upon successful completion of their probationary period.
Project employees with permanent status will serve a trial service period when they:
a.	Promote to another job classification within the project; or
b.	Transfer or voluntarily demote within the project to another job classification in which they have not attained permanent status.
WPEA HE - 2012-13
3
3.	The Employer may consider project employees with permanent status for transfer, voluntary demotion, or promotion to non-project positions. Project employees will serve a trial service period upon transfer, voluntary demotion, or promotion to a non-project position.
4.	When the Employer converts a project appointment into a permanent appointment, the employee will serve a probationary or trial service period.
5.	The layoff and recall rights of project employees will be in accordance with the provisions in Article 36, Layoff and Recall.
D.	In-Training Employment
1.	The Employer may designate specific positions, groups of positions, or all positions in a job classification or series as intraining. The Employer will document the training program, including a description and length of the program.
2.	A candidate who is initially hired into an in-training position must successfully complete the job requirements of the appointment. The Employer may separate from classified service, any employee who has completed the probationary period for an in-training appointment but does not successfully complete the subsequent trial service periods required by the in-training program. Employees who are not successful may be separated at any time with prior written notice from the Employer.
3.	An employee with permanent status who accepts an in-training appointment will serve a trial service period or periods, depending on the requirements of the in-training program. The Employer may revert an employee who does not successfully complete the trial service period or periods at any time. The employee’s reversion right will be to the job classification that the employee held permanent status in prior to his or her in-training appointment, in accordance with Subsections 4.5.B.3 and 4.5.B.4 of this Article.
The in-training separation of an employee will not be subject to the grievance procedure in Article 30.
4.	A trial service period may be required for each level of the intraining appointment, or the entire in-training appointment may be designated as the trial service period. The Employer will determine the length of the trial service period or periods to be served by an employee in an in-training appointment.
WPEA HE - 2012-13
4
5.	If a trial service period is required for each level of the in-training appointment, the employee will attain permanent status upon successful completion of the training program at each level.
6.	If the entire in-training program—meaning all levels within the in training appointment—is designated as a trial service period, the employee will attain permanent status upon successful completion of the training requirements for the entire in-training program.
4.3	Employee Status
A.	Classified Service
An employee will attain permanent status in the classified service upon completion of a probationary review period. For positions designated intraining, Article 4.2 D will govern when permanent status is attained.
B.	Job Classification
An employee will attain permanent status in a job classification upon his or her successful completion of a probationary, trial service, or transition review period.
4.4	Certification of Applicants
The Employer will determine the number of applicants to be certified to the hiring official for consideration. All employees on the internal layoff list for the classification, and all promotional, transfer and voluntary demotion candidates, who have the skills and abilities to perform the duties of the position will be certified and will be considered by the Employer, prior to consideration of other candidates.
4.5	Review Periods
A.	Probationary Period
1.	All employees, including part-time or full-time, will serve a probationary period of six (6) months following his or her initial appointment to a permanent or project position. The Employer may extend the probationary period for an individual employee or for all employees in a class as long as the extension does not cause the total period to exceed twelve (12) months.
2.	The Employer may separate a probationary employee at any time during the probationary period, whether or not the Employer has evaluated the probationary employee. Probationary separation will not be subject to the grievance procedure in Article 30.
3.	The Employer will extend an employee’s probationary period, on a day-for-a-day basis, for any day(s) that the employee is on leave without pay or shared leave, except for leave taken for military service.
WPEA HE - 2012-13
5
4.	An employee who transfers or is promoted prior to completing his or her initial probationary period will serve a new probationary period. The length of the new probationary period will be in accordance with Subsection 4.5.A.1, unless adjusted by the Employer for time already served in probationary status. However, in no case will the total probationary period be less than six (6) months.
B.	Trial Service Period
1.	Except for those employees in an in-training appointment, all other employees with permanent status who are promoted, or who voluntarily accept a transfer or demotion into a job classification for which they have not previously attained permanent status, will serve a trial service period of six (6) consecutive months. The Employer may extend the trial service period for an individual employee or for all employees in a class as long as the extension does not cause the total trial service period to exceed twelve (12) consecutive months. Employees in an in-training appointment will follow the provisions outlined in Article 4.2 D.
2.	An employee serving a trial service period will have his or her trial service period extended, on a day-for-a-day basis, for any day(s) that the employee is on leave without pay or shared leave, except for leave taken for military service.
3.	With prior written notice by the Employer, all employees that have not successfully completed a trial service period may be offered an opportunity to revert to a position in the same institution that is:
a.	Vacant and is within the trial service employee’s previously held job classification; or
b.	Vacant at or below the employee’s previous salary range.
In either case, the employee being reverted must have the skills and abilities required for the vacant position. If the employee has not attained permanent status in the job classification of the vacant position, the employee will be required to complete a trial service period.
4.	An employee who has no reversion options or does not revert to the classification he or she held prior to the trial service period may request the Human Resources Office to place his or her name on the layoff list for positions in job classifications where he or she had previously attained permanent status.
WPEA HE - 2012-13
6
5.	An employee serving a trial service period may voluntarily revert to his or her former position within fifteen (15) calendar days after the appointment, provided that the position has not been filled or an offer has not been made to an applicant. The Employer may consider requests after the fifteen (15) day period. After fifteen (15) days and at the discretion of the Employer, an employee serving a trial service period may voluntarily revert at any time to a vacant position in the same college/district that is:
a. Within the employee’s previously held job classification; or b. At or below the employee’s previous salary range.
If the employee has not attained permanent status in the job classification, the employee will be required to complete a trial service period.
The reversion of employees who are unsuccessful during their trial service period is not subject to the grievance procedure in Article 30.
C.	Transition Review Period
In accordance with Article 36, Layoff and Recall, the Employer may require an employee to complete a transition review period.
Article 5
Temporary Appointments
5.1	Temporary Appointments
The Employer may make temporary appointments. An individual in a temporary appointment is limited to one thousand fifty (1,050) hours of work in any twelve (12) consecutive month period from the individual’s date of hire.
A.	Represented Individuals
Excluding students, individuals in temporary appointments who work between three hundred fifty (350) hours and one thousand fifty (1,050) hours in the twelve (12) consecutive month period defined above who are members of the bargaining units identified in Appendix B represented by the Union, are governed by the specific terms of this Article. Unless identified in Section 5.8, below, no other Articles in this Agreement apply to represented individuals.

Article 16
Family and Medical Leave
16.1	A. Consistent with the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and any amendments thereto and the Washington State Family Leave Act of 2006 (WFLA), an employee who has worked for the state for at least twelve (12) months and for at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the twelve (12) months prior to the requested leave is entitled to up to twelve (12) workweeks of family medical leave in a twelve (12) month period for one or more of the following reasons 1 - 4:
1.	The birth of and to care for a newborn child or placement for adoption or foster care of a child and to care for that child;
2.	Personal medical leave due to the employee's own serious health condition that requires the employee's absence from work;
3.	Family medical leave to care for a spouse, son, daughter, parent or state registered domestic partner as defined by RCWs 26.60.020 and 26.60.030 who suffers from a serious health condition that requires on-site care or supervision by the employee. Because the FMLA does not recognize state registered domestic partners, an absence to care for an employee’s state registered domestic partner in accordance with the WFLA will not be counted towards the twelve (12) workweeks for FMLA; and/or
4.	Family medical leave for a qualifying exigency when the employee’s spouse, child of any age or parent is on active duty or call to active duty status of the Reserves or National Guard for deployment to a foreign country.
Qualifying exigencies include attending certain military events, arranging for alternate childcare, addressing certain financial and legal arrangements, attending certain counseling sessions, and attending post-deployment reintegration briefings.
B.	Military Caregiver Leave will be provided to an eligible employee who is the spouse, child of any age, parent or next of kin of a covered servicemember to take up to twenty-six (26) workweeks of leave in a single twelve (12) month period to care for the covered servicemember or veteran who is suffering from a serious illness or injury in the line of duty.
During the single twelve (12) month period during which Military Caregiver Leave is taken the employee may only take a combined total of twenty-six (26) workweeks of leave for Military Caregiver Leave and leave taken for other FMLA qualifying reasons.
WPEA HE - 2012-13
35
The single twelve (12) month period to care for a covered servicemember or veteran begins on the first day the employee takes leave for this reason and ends twelve (12) months later, regardless of the twelve (12) month period established for other types of FMLA leave.
C.	Entitlement to family medical leave for the care of a newborn child or newly adopted or foster child ends twelve (12) months from the date of birth or the placement of the foster or adopted child. Pregnancy disability leave will be granted for the period of time an employee is sick or temporarily disabled because of pregnancy and/or childbirth and will be in addition to any leave granted under family medical leave or Washington state family leave laws.
D.	The one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hour eligibility requirement noted above does not count vacation leave, sick leave, personal holidays, compensatory time off, or shared leave.
16.	2 The family medical leave entitlement period will be a rolling twelve (12) month period measured forward from the date an employee begins family medical leave. Each time an employee takes family medical leave during the twelve (12) month period, the leave will be subtracted from the twelve (12) workweeks of available leave. The Employer will respond in writing to family medical leave requests as soon as practicable but no later than seven (7) calendar days of receipt of a properly completed request.
16.	3 The Employer will continue the employee's existing employer-paid health insurance benefits during the period of leave covered by family medical leave. The employee will be required to pay his or her share of heath care premiums.
16.	4 The Employer has the authority to designate absences that meet the criteria of the family medical leave. The use of any paid or unpaid leave (excluding leave for work-related illness or injury covered by workers’ compensation and compensatory time) for a family medical leave qualifying event will run concurrently with, not in addition to, the use of family medical leave for that event. Any employee using paid leave during a family medical leave qualifying event must follow the notice and certification requirements relating to family medical leave usage in addition to any notice and certification requirements relating to the paid leave.
16.	5 The Employer may require certification from the employee’s, family member's, or covered servicemember’s health care provider for the purpose of qualifying for family medical leave.
16.	6 Personal medical leave, serious health condition leave, or serious injury or illness leave covered by family medical leave may be taken intermittently when certified as medically necessary. Employees must make reasonable efforts to schedule leave for planned medical treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the Employer’s
WPEA HE - 2012-13
36
operations. Leave due to qualifying exigencies may also be taken on an intermittent basis.
16.	7 Upon returning to work after the employee’s own family medical leave qualifying illness, the employee will be required to provide a fitness for duty certificate from a health care provider.
16.	8 The employee will provide the Employer with not less than thirty (30) days’ notice before family medical leave is to begin. If the need for the leave is unforeseeable thirty (30) days in advance, then the employee will provide such notice as is reasonable and practicable.
16.	9 An employee returning from family medical leave will have return rights in accordance with FMLA and WFLA.
16.1	0 Definitions used in this article will be in accordance with the FMLA and WFLA. The parties recognize that the Department of Labor is working on further defining the amendments to FMLA. The Employer and the employees will comply with existing and any adopted federal FMLA regulations and/or interpretations.

30.2	Filing and Processing
A.	Filing
A grievance must be filed within thirty (30) days of the occurrence giving rise to the grievance, or the date the grievant knew or could reasonably have known of the occurrence.
B.	Processing
Step 1: Human Resources Office Designee
If the issue is not resolved informally, the Union may present a written grievance to the Human Resources Office, within the thirty (30) day period described above. The Human Resources Office will designate who will hear the grievance at Step 1. The designee will meet in person or confer by telephone with a shop steward and/or staff representative, and the grievant within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the grievance, and will respond in writing to the Union within twenty-one (21) days after the meeting.
Step 2: President/Chancellor or Designee
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the Union may move to the next step by filing it with the Human Resources Office, within fifteen (15) days of the Union’s receipt of the Step 1 decision. The President/Chancellor or designee will meet in person or confer by
WPEA HE - 2012-13
57
telephone with a shop steward or staff representative and the grievant within twenty-one (21) days of receipt of the appeal, and will respond in writing to the Union within twenty-one (21) days after the meeting.
Step 3: Mediation or Pre-Arbitration Review Meetings (PARM)
1.	Disciplinary Grievances
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the Union may file a request for mediation with the Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) in accordance with WAC 391-55-020, with a copy to the Office of Financial Management/Labor Relations Office (OFM/LRO) and the Human Resources Office within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Step 2 decision. In addition to all other filing requirements, the request must include a copy of the grievance and all previous responses.
2.	Non-Disciplinary Grievances
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the Union may request a PARM by filing a copy of the grievance and all responses attached with the Director of OFM/LRO and the Human Resources Office within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Step 2 decision. Within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of all of the required information, the OFM/LRO will either:
i.	Notify the Union in writing that a PARM will be scheduled with the OFM/LRO Director or designee, the College’s Human Resource Office representative, and the Union’s representative to review and attempt to settle the dispute; or
ii.	Notify the Union in writing that no PARM will be scheduled.
The proceedings of any mediation or PARM will not be reported or recorded in any manner, except for written agreements reached by the parties during the course of the mediation or PARM. Unless they are independently admissible, statements made by or to the mediator, or by or to any party or other participant in the mediation or PARM, may not be:
1.	Later introduced as evidence;
2.	Made known to an arbitrator or hearings examiner at a hearing; and/or

If the matter is not resolved at mediation or a PARM, or the OFM/LRO Director or designee notifies the Union in writing that no PARM will be
WPEA HE - 2012-13
58
scheduled, the Union may file a demand for arbitration. The demand to arbitrate the dispute must be filed with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) within fifteen (15) days of the mediation session, PARM, or receipt of the notice that no PARM will be scheduled. Simultaneous with filing, copies of the demand for arbitration will be provided to the Human Resources Office and OFM/LRO.
C.	Selecting an Arbitrator
The parties will select an arbitrator by mutual agreement or by alternately striking names supplied by the AAA, and will follow the Labor Arbitration Rules of the AAA unless they agree otherwise in writing.
D.	Authority of the Arbitrator
1.	The arbitrator will:
a.	Have no authority to add to, subtract from, or modify any of the provisions of this Agreement;
b.	Be limited in his or her decision to the grievance issue(s) set forth in the original written grievance unless the parties agree to modify it;
c.	Not make any award that provides an employee with compensation greater than would have resulted had there been no violation of this Agreement; and
d.	Not have the authority to order the Employer to modify his or her staffing levels or to direct staff to work overtime.
2.	The arbitrator will hear arguments on and decide issues of arbitrability before the first day of arbitration at a time convenient for the parties, immediately prior to hearing the case on its merits, or as part of the entire hearing and decision-making process. If the issue of arbitrability is argued prior to the first day of arbitration, it may be argued in writing or by telephone, at the discretion of the arbitrator. Although the decision may be made orally, it will be put in writing and provided to the parties.
3.	The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the Union, the Employer and the grievant.
E.	Arbitration Costs
1.	The expenses and fees of the arbitrator, and the cost (if any) of the hearing room will be shared equally by the parties.
2.	If the arbitration hearing is postponed or canceled because of one party, that party will bear the cost of the postponement or cancellation. The costs of any mutually agreed upon
WPEA HE - 2012-13
59
postponements or cancellations will be shared equally by the parties.
3.	If either party desires a record of the arbitration, a court reporter may be used. If that party purchases a transcript, a copy will be provided to the arbitrator, free of charge. If the other party desires a copy of the transcript, it will pay for one half (1/2) of the costs of the fee for the court reporter, the original transcript and a copy.
4.	Each party is responsible for the costs of its attorneys, staff representatives, and all other costs related to the development and presentation of their case. When an employee is subpoenaed as a witness on behalf of the Union in an arbitration case, the employee may appear without loss of pay if he or she appears during his or her work time. Every effort will be made to avoid the presentation of repetitive witnesses. The Union is responsible for paying any travel or per diem expenses for its witnesses, the grievant and the shop steward.
5.	If, after the arbitrator issues his or her award, either party files a motion with the arbitrator for reconsideration, the moving party will bear the additional expenses of the arbitrator.
30.3	Election of Remedies
Arbitrating a claim under this Article constitutes a waiver of the right to pursue the same claim before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Human Rights Commission, or in a judicial or other forum. Pursuit of a claim before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Human Rights Commission, or in a judicial or other forum constitutes a waiver of the right to pursue the claim through arbitration under this Article.

Article 32
Legal Liability
32.1	Employee Liability

An employee has the right to seek reimbursement for personal property items damaged in the proper performance of his or her duties, and the Employer will process the request in accordance with RCW 4.92.100. Employees are encouraged to take precautions to protect personal property/equipment.
Article 33
Personnel Files
33.1	The Employer will maintain an official personnel file for each employee, showing a record of employment and such other information required for business and legal purposes. The Employer will determine the location of the personnel file and will notify the Union if someone other than the Employer’s Human Resource Manager is responsible for the personnel file.
33.2	Health and medical information obtained by the Employer will be maintained in a separate, confidential file. The Employer will not require employees to provide information about the health or medical conditions of the employee or the employee’s family unless such information is related to the performance of duties within the scope of employment, fitness to hold the employee’s position or the providing of benefits requested by the employee.
33.3	An employee and/or his or her representative may arrange to examine the employee’s personnel file, medical file and/or the file kept by the employee’s supervisor during regular business hours upon reasonable notice. Written authorization from the employee is required before any representative of the employee will be granted access to the personnel file, medical file and/or the file kept by the employee’s supervisor. The Employer may charge a reasonable fee for copying any materials beyond the first copy requested by the employee or his or her representative.
33.4	Employees will be provided a copy of all adverse material placed in the official personnel file at the time it is placed in the file. The employee or his or her representative may not remove any contents from the file; however, an employee may provide a written rebuttal or refuting documentation to any information in the file that he or she considers objectionable. The parties agree that it is a good practice for an employee to be provided with copies of letters of appreciation and
WPEA HE - 2012-13
61
commendation addressed to the Employer. An employee may insert a reasonable amount of job-related material in his or her personnel file that reflects favorably on his or her job performance.
33.5	Information in the personnel files will be retained only as long as it has a reasonable bearing on the employee’s job performance or upon the efficient and effective management of the District. Adverse material related to alleged employee misconduct that is determined to be false, and all information related to incidents of which the employee has been fully exonerated of wrong doing, will be promptly removed from the personnel file and/or supervisory file. Such information will be maintained in an administrative file, separate and apart from the personnel file and will not be released unless required by judicial order or by applicable laws governing disclosure of public documents.
33.6	When documents in an employee’s personnel file, supervisory file and/or administrative file are the subject of public disclosure request, subpoena or legal discovery the Employer will provide the employee and the Union with a copy of the request at least seven (7) calendar days in advance of the intended release date, unless otherwise required by law.
33.7	The Employer will not release personal information about an employee except as is necessary, or as the law requires.
33.8	Supervisors may keep working files of documentation relevant to employee performance. The previous year’s job performance documentation will be removed from the supervisor’s working file following the completion of a performance evaluation, unless related to issues of an ongoing nature. Upon request, the supervisor will inform the employee if documentation has been retained.
Supervisors who keep employee working files will maintain the files in a manner that protects against unauthorized access or casual observation and in accordance with other governing laws and rules. Employees may view these files per Section 33.3 above, but may not append refutations nor rebuttals to the file.
Article 34
Light Duty, Reasonable Accommodation and Disability Separation
34.1	The Employer and the Union will comply with all relevant federal and state laws, and regulations regarding the employment of persons with disabilities and will provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation may include job restructuring, or modification of the work environment, methods or equipment that make it possible for an employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of a position, or that enables the employee to enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment as are enjoyed by other similarly situated employees without a disability. Reasonable
WPEA HE - 2012-13
62
accommodation will be implemented as long as it is medically necessary and does not impose an undue hardship or a direct threat.
34.2	Essential functions means the primary job tasks and responsibilities of a position that are fundamental and necessary to accomplish the required outcomes of the position. The term “essential functions” does not include the marginal functions of the position that are incidental to the performance of the primary job functions.
34.3	An employee who believes that he or she suffers a disability and requires a reasonable accommodation to perform the essential functions of his or her position may request such an accommodation by submitting a request to the Employer. The Employer will make a good faith effort to provide the employee requesting accommodation with an alternate assignment during the accommodation process, as necessary.
34.4	Employees requesting accommodation must cooperate with the Employer in discussing the need for and possible form of any accommodation. The Employer and the employee will enter into an interactive process to discuss the job-related limitations, possible accommodation options, including the employee’s preferences, and the potential effectiveness of each option.
34.5	The Employer may require supporting medical documentation and may require the employee to obtain a second medical opinion at Employer expense. Medical information disclosed to the Employer will be kept confidential.
34.6	The Employer will determine whether an employee is eligible for a reasonable accommodation and the accommodation to be provided. If more than one (1) option for reasonable accommodation exists, the Employer will decide which option to provide the employee, taking into consideration the employee’s preference. If a reasonable accommodation cannot be provided, the Employer will provide the employee with written notification of such decision.
34.7	An employee with permanent status may be separated from service when the Employer determines that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of the employee’s position due to a mental, sensory, or physical disability, which cannot be reasonably accommodated. Determinations of disability may be made by the Employer based on an employee’s written request for disability separation or after obtaining a written statement from a licensed health care professional. The Employer can require an employee to obtain an independent medical examination at Employer expense, from a licensed health care professional of the Employer’s choice. Evidence may be requested from the licensed health care professional regarding the employee’s limitations.
34.8	When the Employer has medical documentation of the employee’s disability, has met its obligation to explore accommodation options, including placement in any vacant funded position at the same or lower level of pay and benefits for which the employee qualifies, and has determined that the employee cannot be
WPEA HE - 2012-13
63
reasonably accommodated, or the employee requests separation due to disability, the Employer may separate the employee with five (5) calendar days notice. The Employer will provide the Union with a copy of any disability separation letters.
34.9	The Employer will inform the employee in writing of the option to apply to return to employment prior to his or her separation due to disability. The Employer will provide assistance to individuals seeking reemployment under this Article for two (2) years. If reemployed, upon successful completion of the employee’s probationary period, the time between separation and reemployment will be treated as leave without pay and will not be considered a break in service.
34.10	A disability separation is not a disciplinary action. An employee who has been separated due to disability may grieve his or her disability separation only up to the final internal step of the grievance procedure. Disability separation at the employee’s request is not subject to the grievance procedure in Article 30.
34.11	Light duty may be considered for employees who are temporarily unable to perform the essential duties of their position.
Article 35
Seniority
35.1	Definition

WPEA HE - 2012-13
64
surviving spouses or surviving state registered domestic partners as defined by RCWs 26.60.020 and 26.60.030, as provided for in RCW 41.06.133.
C.	Employees who are separated from state service due to layoff and are reemployed within two (2) years of their separation date will not be considered to have a break in service. The time the employee is on the layoff list will be treated as leave without pay.

A.	Longest continuous time within their current job classification;
B.	Longest continuous time with the institution; and

35.3	Seniority List
The Employer will prepare and post a seniority list annually. The list will contain each employee’s name, job classification and the total amount of seniority.

A copy of the seniority list will be provided to the Union at the time of posting.
Article 36
Layoff and Recall
36.1	A. The Employer will determine the basis for, extent, effective date and the length of layoffs in accordance with the provisions of this Article. A layoff is an employer-initiated action that results in:
1.	Separation from service;
2.	Employment in a class with a lower	salary range maximum;
3.	Reduction in the work year; or

36.2	Basis for Layoff
A.	The reasons for layoff include, but are not limited to, the following:
1.	Lack of funds;

36.3	Voluntary Layoff, Leave of Absence or Reduction in Hours
The Employer may allow an employee to volunteer to be laid off, take an unpaid leave of absence or reduce his or her hours of work in order to reduce layoffs. If it is necessary to limit the number of employees in an institution on unpaid leave at the same time, the Employer will determine who will be granted a leave of absence and/or reduction in hours based upon staffing needs. Employees who volunteer to be laid off may request to have their names placed on the appropriate layoff list for the job classifications in which they held permanent status, regardless of a break in service with the current Employer.
36.4	Probationary Employees
Employees with permanent status will not be separated from state service through a layoff action without first being offered positions they have the skills and abilities to perform within their current job classification within the layoff unit currently held by probationary employees. Probationary employees will be separated from employment before permanent employees.
WPEA HE - 2012-13
66
36.5	Temporary Layoff
A.	Temporary Reduction in Work Hours
The Employer may temporarily reduce the work hours of an employee to no less than twenty (20) hours per week due to an unanticipated loss of funding, revenue shortfall, lack of work, shortage of material or equipment, or other unexpected or unusual reasons. Employees will normally receive seven (7) calendar days notice of a temporary reduction in hours.
B.	Temporary Layoff
The Employer may temporarily layoff an employee for up to ninety (90) calendar days due to an unanticipated loss of funding, revenue shortfall, lack of work, shortage of material or equipment, or other unexpected or unusual reasons.

B.	The layoff unit(s) for each institution covered by this Agreement are described in Appendix C.
36.7	Options within the Layoff Unit
A.	Permanent employees will be laid off in accordance with seniority, as defined in Article 35, Seniority, and the skills and abilities of the employee. The Employer will determine if the employee possesses the required skills and abilities for the position and the comparability of the position. Comparability is defined as having the same FTE appointment. The average number of hours worked in a year for 1.0 FTE equals two thousand eighty-eight (2088) hours. For this Section, a less than comparable position is defined as not less than eighty percent (80%) of the employee’s FTE appointment. The Employer may require updated
WPEA HE - 2012-13
67
information from the employee regarding his or her skills and abilities. Vacant positions will be offered prior to filled positions. Employees being laid off will be provided one (1) option within the layoff unit:
1.	A comparable funded vacant position for which the employee has the skills and abilities, within his or her current job classification.
2.	A comparable funded filled position held by the least senior employee for which the employee has the skills and abilities, within his or her current permanent job classification.

4.	A less than comparable funded filled position for which the employee has the skills and abilities and is within his or her current permanent classification.
5.	A comparable funded vacant position for which the employee has the skills and abilities, at the same or lower salary range as his or her current permanent position, within a job classification in which the employee has held permanent status.
6.	A comparable funded filled position held by the least senior employee for which the employee has the skills and abilities, at the same or lower salary range as his or her current permanent position, within a job classification in which the employee has held permanent status.
B.	The layoff unit option will be determined, as specified above, in descending order of salary range and one progressively lower level at a time.
C.	If a job classification in which an employee has previously held status has been abolished or revised, a crosswalk to the class series will be used to identify layoff options at the same or lower salary range as his or her current permanent position.
D.	An employee in a position that is reduced in work year or work hours will have the choice of staying in the reduced position.
36.8	Institution-wide Options
A. In addition to the layoff unit option offered in Section 36.7 above, permanent employees being laid off will be offered:
1.	Up to three (3) institution-wide comparable funded vacant positions within their district provided they meet the skills and

2.	If there are no comparable vacant positions, the Employer will offer less than comparable funded vacant positions.
3.	If there are no less than comparable vacant positions, the Employer may offer a temporary appointment per Article 5. The award or denial of an informal option to a temporary appointment is not subject to the grievance procedure.
4.	The Employer will determine if the employee possesses the required skills and abilities for the position.
36.9	Multi-Employee Layoffs
For multi-employee layoffs, more than one (1) employee may be offered the same funded vacant position. In this case, the most senior employee with the skills and abilities who accepts the position will be appointed.
36.10	Notification to Permanent Employees
A.	Except for temporary reduction in work hours and temporary layoffs as provided in Section 36.5, permanent employees will receive written notice at least twenty-one (21) calendar days before the effective layoff date.

2.	The effective date of the layoff;
3.	The employee’s layoff unit option and any institution-wide options;
4.	The specific layoff lists for which the employee is entitled to placement;
5.	The date by when an employee must select a layoff option; and
6.	The process, including timelines, by which the employee is entitled
to challenge the layoff.
B.	The Union will be provided with a copy of the notice.
C.	Except for temporary reduction in work hours and temporary layoffs as provided in Section 36.5, if the Employer fails to provide twenty-one (21) calendar days’ notice, the employee will be paid his or her salary for the days that he or she would have worked had full notice been given.
WPEA HE - 2012-13

C.	Appointment from a Layoff List
1.	Employees who are appointed from a layoff list to a position with the same salary range from which they were laid off will be paid the amount for which they were compensated when laid off plus any across the board adjustments, including salary survey adjustments, that occurred during the time they were laid off.
2.	Employees who are appointed from a layoff list to a position with a
lower salary range than the position from which they were laid off will be paid an amount equal to the salary they were receiving at the time they were laid off provided it is within the salary range of the new position. In those cases where the employee’s prior salary exceeds the maximum amount of the salary range for the new position, the employee will be compensated at the maximum salary of the new salary range.
36.12	Transition Review Period
A.	The Employer will require an employee to complete a six (6) month transition review period when the employee accepts a layoff option to a job classification in which he or she has not held permanent status or has been appointed into a new position from a layoff list. The Employer may

70
extend the transition review period for an individual employee as long as the extension does not cause the total period to exceed twelve (12) months.

Appendix K
Due to legislative amendments to RCW 41.80.020 and RCW 47.64.270, the coalition agreement on health care benefits is a separate agreement and is not included as part of the 2011-2013 master collective bargaining agreement. For ease of reference, the coalition health care agreement is reprinted below.
Health Benefits Agreement
By and Between
The State of Washington
AND
The Coalition of Unions1
Health Care Benefits Amounts
I.1	The Employer will contribute an amount equal to eighty-five percent (85%) of the total weighted average of the projected health care premium for each bargaining unit employee eligible for insurance each month, as determined by the Public Employees Benefits Board annually for benefits in calendar year 2012 and calendar year 2013, respectively. The projected health care premium is the weighted average across all plans, across all tiers. The Uniform Medical Plan (deductible, out-of-pocket maximums and co-insurance) in effect for calendar year 2011 will be maintained for the 2011-2013 biennium.
I.2	The Employer will pay the entire premium costs for each bargaining unit employee for basic life, basic long-term disability and dental insurance coverage.
I.3	Wellness
To support the statewide goal for a healthy and productive workforce, employees are encouraged to participate in a Health Risk Assessment survey. Employees will be granted work time and may use a state computer to complete the survey.
1 The Coalition of Unions comprises all exclusive bargaining representatives subject to RCW 41.80 and RCW 47.64.

Increased Revenue
The parties agree that if the November 2012 general fund revenue forecast projects an increase of three percent (3%) or greater in the 2011-2013 revenues ($33.583 billion or greater) than what was projected in the November 2010 general fund state forecast ($32.605 billion), the Governor will submit in her supplemental budget a request for funding to reduce the salary reduction for the period of January 1, 2013 through June 29, 2013 from three percent (3%) to two percent (2%). If the legislature approves the funding request, Article 5, Temporary Appointments, and Article 43, Compensation, of the parties’ 2011-2013 collective bargaining agreement will be modified to reflect the change in salary reduction from three percent (3%) to two percent (2%) for the period of January 1, 2013 through June 29, 2013. In addition, Article 43, Compensation, of the parties’ 2011-2013 collective bargaining agreement will be modified to reflect a change in Temporary Salary Reduction leave from 5.2 hours per month to 3.5 hours per month for the period of January 1, 2013 through June 29, 2013.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
BETWEEN
THE STATE OF WASHINGTON
AND
THE WASHINGTON PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION
Temporary Reduction of Work Hours or Temporary Layoffs
1.	The parties agree that the temporary salary reduction agreement negotiated for the 20122013 agreement constitutes the full extent of temporary reduction of work hours or temporary layoffs during the duration of this contract that resulted from the loss of funding and revenue shortfall forecasted in the November 2010 Economic Revenue Forecast for the ’11-’13 biennium. Article 36.5 A and B of the 2012-2013 agreement is superseded as it relates to revenue shortfall and loss of funding unless the provisions of 2 below are met.
2.	In the event of a significant loss of funding or revenue shortfall for the period of this contract and the Employer chooses to use temporary layoffs or reduction in work hours to make up the shortfall or loss of funding, the employer will negotiate the impacts and implementation of any said layoffs or reductions with the Union. Negotiations will include options to lessen any negative impacts on the employees. The parties will jointly develop mutual approaches to implementation that make such layoffs or reductions less onerous to employees and more fairly distributed.
