2/1/5 The Employer agrees to provide advance notice, thirty (30) calendar days whenever possible, to the Association of reclassification and reallocation actions from the bargaining unit to a different classification which is not assigned to this bargaining unit.

2/2/2	Such orders shall be effective only as to membership dues
becoming due after the date of delivery of such authorization to the payroll office of the employing unit.

The list will include the department, employing unit, name, and amount deducted.
2/2/4	Such orders may be terminable in accordance with the terms
of the order the employee has on file with the Employer.

The Employer shall give notice to the Association of receipt of such notice of termination.
B.	Fair Share Deduction:

Grievance Procedure
Section 1	General
4/1/1 A grievance is defined as, and limited to, a written complaint involving an alleged violation of a specific provision of this Agreement.
4/1/2 Only one subject matter shall be covered in any one (1) grievance. A written grievance shall contain a clear and concise statement of the grievance by indicating the issue involved, the relief sought, the date the incident or violation took place, and the specific section or sections of the Agreement involved. The first step grievance shall be presented to the designated supervisor involved in quadruplicate (on forms furnished by the Employer to the Association and any prospective grievant) and signed and dated by the employee(s) and/or Association representative.
4/1/3 An employee may choose to have the appropriate Association representative represent the employee at any step of the grievance procedure. If an employee brings any grievance to the Employer’s attention without first having notified the Association, the Employer representative to whom such grievance is brought shall immediately notify the appropriate Association representative and no further discussion shall be had on the matter until the appropriate Association representative has been given notice and an opportunity to be present.
4/1/4 Individual employees or groups of employees shall have the right to present grievances in person or through other non-Association representatives of their own choosing at Steps One, Two or Three of the grievance procedure, provided that the appropriate Association representative has been afforded the opportunity to be present at any discussions and that any settlement reached is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Under these circumstances, the Employer will supply copies of all written decisions to that Association representative.
4/1/5 All grievances must be presented promptly in writing at Step One (except disciplinary appeals as provided in Section 11 of this Article) and no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date the grievant first became aware of, or should have become aware of with the exercise of reasonable diligence, the cause of such grievance.
Section 2	Procedure
Step One:
4/2/1 Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the written grievance schedule a meeting with the employee(s) and the representative to hear the grievance and return a written decision on the grievance form to the employee(s) and the representative.
12
Step Two:
4/2/2 If dissatisfied with the supervisor’s decision in Step One, to be considered further, the grievance must be appealed to the designated agency representative within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the decision in Step One. However, where the grievant is unable to contact the designated agency representative to appeal the grievance, the grievant may present the Step Two appeal to the Step One designated supervisor for forwarding to the designated agency representative. The appropriate agency representative(s) will meet with the employee(s) and the employee’s representative and attempt to resolve the grievance. A written decision will be placed on the grievance form following the meeting by the appropriate agency representative and returned to the employee(s) and the employee’s representative within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the appeal to the agency representative.
Step Three:
4/2/3 If dissatisfied with the Employer’s decision in Step Two, to be considered further, the grievance must be appealed to the designee of the Employer (i.e., Division Administrator, Bureau Director, or personnel office) within ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the decision in Step Two. The designated agency representative(s) will meet with the employee and the employee’s representative at the assigned headquarters unless mutually agreed otherwise to discuss and attempt to resolve the grievance. In addition, one of the statewide officers may participate in this meeting. Such participation shall be without compensation, travel or subsistence expenses, except that when the statewide officer is functioning in the employee’s assigned departmental district or departmental headquarters station such participation shall be without loss of pay. Following this meeting, the written decision of the agency will be placed on the grievance form by the Employer or the Employer’s designee and returned to the grievant and the grievant’s representative within twenty-one (21) calendar days from receipt of the appeal to Step Three.
Step Four:
4/2/4 Grievances which have not been settled under the foregoing procedure may be appealed to arbitration by the Association or the Employer within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the agency’s decision in Step Three, except grievances involving discharge or claims filed under s. 230.36, Wis. Stats., must be appealed within fifteen (15) calendar days, or the grievance will be considered ineligible for appeal to arbitration. If an unresolved grievance is not appealed to arbitration, it shall be considered terminated on the basis of the Third Step answers of the parties without prejudice or precedent in the resolution of future grievances. The issue as stated in the Third Step shall constitute the sole and entire subject matter to be heard by the arbitrator, unless the parties agree to modify the scope of the hearing.
13
4/2/5 For the purpose of selecting an impartial arbitrator, the parties will meet within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the written appeal of the grievance to arbitration. If the parties are unable to agree on an impartial arbitrator within the fourteen (14) calendar day period, the parties or party, acting jointly or separately, shall request the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission to submit a panel of arbitrators. If the parties are still unable to reach agreement, a request will be made to the Federal Mediation & Conciliation Service to furnish a panel of arbitrators and final selection shall be in accordance with the procedures established by the Federal Mediation & Conciliation Service.
4/2/6 Where two (2) or more grievances are appealed to arbitration, an effort will be made by the parties to agree upon the grievances to be heard by any one (1) arbitrator. On the grievances where agreement is not reached, a separate arbitrator shall be appointed for each grievance.
4/2/7 The cost of the arbitrator and expenses of the hearing, including a court reporter, if requested by either party, will be shared equally by the parties, except as provided in Section 11 of this Article. Each of the parties shall bear the cost of their copy of the transcript and of their own witnesses, including any lost wages or expenses that may be incurred, except as provided in Section 14 of this Article.
4/2/8 On grievances where the arbitrability of the subject matter is an issue, a separate arbitrator shall be appointed to determine the question of arbitrability, unless the parties agree otherwise. Where the question of arbitrability is not an issue, the arbitrator shall only have authority to determine compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify, or ignore in any way the provisions of this Agreement and shall not make any award which in effect would grant the Association or the Employer any matters which were not obtained in the negotiation process.
4/2/9 The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on both parties of this Agreement. The decision of the arbitrator will be rendered within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of the briefs from the parties or the transcript in the event briefs are not filed.
Section 3	Special Arbitration Procedures
4/3/1 In the interest of achieving more efficient handling of routine grievances, including grievances concerning minor discipline, the parties agree to the following special arbitration procedures. If either of the parties believes that a particular case is precedential in nature and therefore not properly handled through these special procedures, that case will be processed through the full arbitration procedure in subsection 4/2/4 - 4/2/9. Cases decided by these methods of dispute resolution shall not be used as precedent in any other proceeding.
14
Arbitrators will be mutually agreed to by the State Engineering Association, and the State Bureau of Collective Bargaining for both of these procedures during the term of the contract.
A.	Expedited Arbitration Procedure

If witnesses are used to present facts, there will be no more than two (2) per side. If called to testify, the grievant is considered as one of the two witnesses.
4.	The arbitrator will give a bench or other decision within five (5) calendar days. The arbitrator may deny, uphold, or modify the action of the Employer. All decisions will be final and binding.

This list may be revised upon mutual agreement of the parties at any time up to fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the hearing date.
3.	Statements of facts and the issue will be presented by the parties, in writing, to the arbitrator at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the
15
hearing date, unless the arbitrator agrees to fewer days for that particular hearing date. If contract language is to be interpreted, the appropriate language provisions of the contract will also be provided to the arbitrator prior to the hearing.
4.	Whenever possible, the cases will be grouped by campus, institution and/or geographic area and heard in that area. The hearing site may be moved to facilitate the expeditious handling of the day’s cases.

The Grievant and his/her steward, plus a department representative and the supervisor, will be present at the hearing and available to answer questions from the arbitrator.
6.	The arbitrator will render a final and binding decision on each case at the end of the day on the form provided. The arbitrator may deny, uphold or modify the action of the Employer.
7.	The cost of the arbitrator and the expenses of the hearing will be shared equally by the parties on a pro-rated basis, dependent on Union/Association participation.
Section 4	Time Limits
4/4/1 Grievances not appealed within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure will be considered as having been adjudicated on the basis of the last preceding Employer answer. Grievances not answered by the Employer within the designated time limits in any step of the grievance procedure may be appealed to the next step within ten (10) calendar days of the expiration of the designated time limits. The parties may, however, mutually agree in writing to extend the time limits in any step of the grievance procedure.
4/4/2 If the Employer representative with whom a grievance appeal must be filed is located in a city other than that in which the grievance was processed in the preceding step, the mailing of the grievance appeal form shall constitute a timely appeal if it is postmarked within the appeal period. Likewise, when an Employer answer must be forwarded to a city other than that in which the Employer representative works, the mailing of the answer shall constitute a timely response if it is postmarked within the answer period.
Section 5	Representation
4/5/1 An employee may consult with the appropriate Association representative during working hours for a reasonable period of time relative to a grievance matter by first contacting the employee’s supervisor. The employee’s supervisor will arrange a meeting to take place as soon as possible for the employee with the representative through the representative’s supervisor.
16
Section 6	Retroactivity
4/6/1 Settlement of a grievance may or may not be retroactive as the equities of particular cases may demand. In any case, where it is determined that the award should be applied retroactively, except for administrative errors relating to the payment of wages, the maximum period of retroactivity allowed shall be a date not earlier than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the date of initiation of the written grievance in Step One. Employees who voluntarily terminate their employment will have their grievances immediately withdrawn and will not benefit by any later settlement of a group grievance.
Section 7	Exclusive Procedure
4/7/1	The grievance procedure set out above shall be exclusive and shall
replace any other grievance procedure for adjustment of any disputes arising from the application and interpretation of this Agreement.
17
Section 8	Number of Grievance Representatives
4/8/1 The Association may designate a total of up to seventy-five (75) grievance representatives who are members of the bargaining unit for the bargaining unit.
4/8/2 The Association shall designate the jurisdictional areas for the grievance representatives within each department. Representatives will be designated consistent with the geographic locations and number of employees in the work unit within each department. However, where no grievance representatives can be designated for a department in a geographical location, grievance representatives from other departments within that geographical location may be utilized to process individual or group grievances. All designations will be made in a manner as to avoid unnecessary travel.
4/8/3 The Association shall notify the Employer in writing of the names of the grievance representatives, and their respective jurisdictional areas within the thirty (30) calendar days after the effective date of this Agreement. In addition, where grievance representatives are designated to process grievances in departments other than their own, the Association shall also provide the name and telephone number of the grievance representative’s appropriate departmental or employing unit office to contact to arrange the meeting(s). Any changes thereto shall be forwarded to the Employer by the Association as soon as the changes are made.
Section 9	Association Grievances
4/9/1 The statewide Association officers [not to exceed twenty-five (25) during the term of this Agreement] who are members of the bargaining unit shall have the right to file and process a grievance when any provision of this Agreement has been violated or when the Employer interpretation of the terms and provisions of this Agreement lead to a controversy with the Association over application of the terms or provisions of this Agreement. Such grievances shall be designated as Association grievances at the initial step and shall comply with the time limits previously set forth in this Article. Upon receipt of an Association grievance decision, management shall inform all employing units in writing.
Section 10	Group Grievances
4/10/1 Group grievances are defined as, and limited to, those grievances which cover more than one (1) employee, and which involve like circumstances and facts for the grievants involved. Individual grievances which meet the definition of group grievances as contained herein shall be consolidated at each step of the grievance procedure. A group grievance shall be so designated as a group grievance at each step of the grievance procedure and shall set forth thereon the names and classifications of the employees covered by the group grievance. Relief is restricted to those employees identified in the group grievance. Any one (1) of the grievants shall appear without loss of pay and shall represent and serve as spokesperson for the entire group.
18
Section 11	Processing Grievances

4/11/2 The Employer is not responsible for any travel or subsistence expenses incurred by grievants or Association representatives in the processing of grievances.
Section 12	Disciplinary Actions and Appeals
4/12/1 The parties recognize the authority of the Employer to suspend, demote, discharge or take other appropriate disciplinary action against employees for just cause. An employee who alleges that such action was not based on just cause, may appeal a demotion, suspension, or discharge taken by the Employer beginning with the Third Step of the grievance procedure. Appeals of written reprimands or any other disciplinary action, excluding verbal reprimands, shall be filed at Step One of the grievance procedure.
4/12/2 An employee shall be entitled to the presence of a designated grievance representative at an investigatory interview if the employee requests one and if the employee has reasonable grounds to believe that the interview may be used to support disciplinary action against the employee.
4/12/3 Disciplinary action taken by the Employer, other than verbal reprimands, shall be in writing with a copy simultaneously sent to the employee(s) and the designated Association representative. The e-mail system shall not be used to transmit such written discipline to employees or Association representatives. A good faith effort shall be made to maintain confidentiality when communicating about disciplinary matters via e-mail. A breach of confidentiality under this section cannot be the basis for appeal of, reduction or nullification of discipline. This provision will be disseminated to all supervisors.
Section 13	Exclusion of Probationary Employees
4/13/1 Notwithstanding Section 12 above, the retention or release of probationary employees shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
Section 14	Pay Status of Arbitration Witnesses
4/14/1 When a bargaining unit employee is subpoenaed by either party in an arbitration case involving this bargaining unit, that employee shall appear without loss of pay if the employee appears during the employee’s regularly scheduled hours of work provided the testimony given is relevant to the employee’s job functions and is relevant to the arbitration case.
19
ARTICLE V
Seniority
Section 1	General
5/1/1 Seniority for employees hired after the effective date of this Agreement shall be determined by the original date of employment with the State of Wisconsin. Seniority for existing bargaining unit employees shall be their seniority date as of the effective date of this Agreement. Seniority for employees who become members of the bargaining unit during the term of this Agreement shall be their adjusted continuous service date or seniority date as of the time they became members of the unit. When the Employer becomes responsible for a function previously administered by another governmental agency, a quasi-public, or a private enterprise, the seniority of employees who become bargaining unit members as a result of this change of responsibility shall be their adjusted continuous service date which gives credit for their service with the other governmental agency, quasipublic, or private enterprise as of the date of the change of responsibility. In accordance with the above, the employee with the earliest date shall be considered having the greatest seniority.
Section 2	Separation
5/2/1 Seniority as established in Section 1 above, shall be changed only where the employee is separated from state service by discharge, resignation or layoff.
5/2/2 Where separation has occurred and the employee is subsequently rehired, the date of rehire shall begin the seniority date except as outlined below:
5/2/3 A. Where an employee is laid off and restored or reinstated within five (5) years thereof, the employee shall retain their original date of employment for the computation of seniority.
5/2/4 B. Where, within five (5) years of resignation, an employee is reinstated, the new seniority date shall be the original date of employment adjusted to a new and later date which gives no credit for the period of resignation during which they were not an employee of the state.
5/2/5 In the event two (2) employees have the same seniority date, seniority of the one as against the other shall be determined by age with the oldest employee considered having the greatest seniority.
Section 3	Application
5/3/1 Management shall be required to apply seniority as defined above only as specifically provided in this contract and subject to any limitations set forth in any particular Article or Section of this contract.
20
Section 4	Seniority Lists
5/4/1 Seniority lists shall be posted in the appropriate employing unit offices and shall be submitted to the Association semiannually (on or about July 15, sorted by employing unit and January 15, sorted by department and by classification).

ARTICLE VI
Hours of Work
Section 1	Work Schedules

This shall not apply to persons paid to carry tools in their vehicles or to employees meeting solely for the purpose of riding together to a job site.
(3)	The time spent in traveling from an employee’s place of residence to and from a work site is not considered work time except in those instances where an employee is required by the Employer to travel in excess of eighteen (18) miles one way, measured from the employee’s home work station or place of residence, whichever is closer.
(4)	The time spent in traveling by carpools from the employee’s home work station or other appropriate and reasonable meeting place designated by management to and from a work site is not considered work time except in those instances where the required travel exceeds eighteen (18) miles one way.
(5)	In applying this subsection, those miles traveled in excess of eighteen (18) will be considered work time.
B.	Overtime Assignments
6/2/4	Whenever scheduled overtime work is required, the Employer

permitted to decline scheduled overtime work; however, the Employer shall have the right to require the performance of overtime work.

6/2/6	Employees who do not want to accept scheduled overtime
work on an ongoing basis may file a written waiver on a quarterly basis. Such waiver shall indicate that the Employer is relieved from the requirement to offer scheduled overtime work to the employee for the period covered in the waiver. The waiver in no way affects the ability of the Employer to require the employee signing the waiver to perform scheduled overtime work as provided in this Section.
C.	Eligibility for Overtime Credit and Compensation
6/2/7	Employees in salary ranges 14-03 through 14-06, 14-22
through 14-26, 14-46 through 14-48 and 14-55 through 14-57 shall receive overtime credit for those hours worked in a workweek which are in excess of forty (40), provided that such hours were worked at the specific direction of and were previously approved by management.
23
6/2/8	Compensation for overtime credits shall be in cash calculated
at the employee’s base rate or compensatory time off on an hour for hour basis as the Employer may elect. However, if the overtime credited as compensatory time exceeds forty (40) hours in a calendar year, any such overtime credits in excess of the forty (40) hours shall be paid in cash at the employee’s base rate or compensatory time off on an hour for hour basis as the employee may elect. Such compensatory time off shall be subject to the provisions of Article VI, Section 3 of this Agreement.
Section 3 Scheduling of Vacation, Personal Holidays and Compensatory Time Off
6/3/1 A. The parties recognize that the Employer has the right to determine the number of employees within each classification and work unit that may be absent at any given time.

6/3/2 B. In scheduling vacation (annual leave), or compensatory time credits, choice of time and amounts shall be scheduled in accordance with Article VI, Section 3/B./5. Once these periods of absence have been scheduled, the Employer shall make changes in such schedules only to meet unanticipated staff shortages or emergencies. In the event the Employer finds it necessary to cancel a scheduled absence, the affected employee may either reschedule such absence during the remainder of the calendar year (providing it does not affect any other employee’s scheduled period of absence) or extend the scheduling into the first six (6) months of the ensuing calendar year as the employee desires. It is the expressed intent of the Employer to exercise the authority to change such schedule periods as seldom as possible.
1.	Should an employee become ill or injured immediately before or during a scheduled absence period, the employee may cancel such scheduled time off credits as charged and utilize sick leave under the provisions of Article XIII, Section 4, commencing with the date the employee informs the Employer.
2.	Employees who transfer shall carry their selections to their new work unit providing no other employee’s selection is adversely affected.
3.	Notwithstanding paragraph B., above, employees shall be permitted to carry over forty (40) hours of earned annual leave credit to the first six (6) months of the ensuing calendar year.
4.	In accordance with the provisions and limitations of this Section, employees shall be permitted to schedule a minimum of one week (40 hours) of their vacation credits (annual leave) during the period May 1 through October 31 each year.
24
5.	Within the basic framework provided above, and considering seniority as a factor, the implementation and application of vacation scheduling shall be determined by the local association section and local management within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this contract or by January 31 each year of the contract, whichever is later. Agreements under the provisions of this section will be reduced to writing.
6/3/3 C. All compensatory time credits earned shall be scheduled and used prior to seasonal layoff or January 1, whichever is first. However, if the Employer does not permit an employee to use accrued compensatory time by January 1, the employee shall, at the Employer’s discretion, be paid in cash or be permitted to carry such credits into the first four (4) months of the new calendar year.
6/3/4	Employees permitted to carry unused compensatory time
credits into the new calendar year shall use such credits prior to May 1.

6/3/5 D. Personal Holidays
Employees may take their personal holidays at any time during the calendar year provided the days selected by the employee have the prior approval of the Employer.
Section 4	Standby
6/4/1 When the Employer requires that an employee must be available for work immediately and able to report for duty in less than one (1) hour, the employee shall be considered to be in standby status. Such employee shall be compensated on the basis of a fee of twenty ($20.00) dollars for each eight (8) consecutive hour period or any portion thereof for which the employee is in standby status.
Section 5	Maximum Lunch Period
6/5/1 No employee shall be required to take more than one (1) hour as a lunch period. However, this shall not be construed as prohibiting the Employer from having scheduled split shifts.
Section 6	Rest Periods
6/6/1 Recognizing the fact that employees covered by this Agreement are professional, reasonable rest periods may be taken at the employee’s discretion. However, such rest periods shall not conflict with the fulfillment of the operational needs of the work unit.
25
Section 7	Flextime
6/7/1 Flextime shall be defined as a work schedule structure requiring that all employees be in work status during a specified number of core hours with scheduling flexibility allowed for beginning and ending times surrounding those core hours.
6/7/2 The Employer agrees that reasonable efforts will be made to explore the possibility of implementing flextime in appropriate work environments. Implementation of flextime, or a variation thereof, shall be by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Association.
6/7/3 Nothing in this section shall infringe upon Management’s ability to insure adequate coverage for operational requirements.
26

For employees who retire with at least fifteen (15) full years of seniority, the Employer shall match each one (1) hour of accumulated sick leave up to a maximum of fifty two (52) hours per year multiplied by the number of years of service through twenty four (24) years. For years of seniority over twenty four (24) years, the Employer shall match each one (1) hour of accumulated sick leave credit up to a maximum of one hundred and four (104) hours per year multiplied by the number of years of seniority over twenty four (24) years.
Employees who have earned part of their seniority while in protective occupation status shall have their credits prorated in accordance with these provisions:
C.	If at the time of retirement, the employee has seniority of less than twenty five (25) years, multiply the number of years as general by fifty two (52) hours. Multiply the number of years as protective by seventy eight (78) hours. Combine these totals to determine the maximum matching credits.
D.	If, at the time of retirement, the employee has seniority of over twenty four (24) years, determine the proration based on the first twenty four (24) years of service and then add one hundred and four (104) hours for each year of seniority over twenty four (24) years.
Employees who suffer from a personal illness or injury that requires them to use at least five hundred (500) hours of accrued sick leave during the three (3) years immediately prior to retirement shall receive five hundred (500) hours credited to this account upon retirement.
Employees shall be required to provide medical documentation of such illness or injury to the Employer on forms provided by the Employer at the time the leave is taken. Employees who have suffered such an illness or injury during the three (3) years immediately preceding the effective date of this contract shall also be required to provide supporting medical documentation.
Access to these credits for payment of post retirement health insurance premiums shall occur only after all Accumulated Sick Leave Conversion Credits (ASLCC) have been exhausted.
In the event an employee returns to a position covered by this Agreement after having retired, the credits in this account shall be held in escrow until the employee again retires. The credits will then be adjusted to reflect additional years of seniority and sick leave accrual.
56
At the employee’s option, these credits shall be converted using the employee’s base pay rate at the time of retirement or the average of the employee’s base pay rates during the employee’s three highest earnings years.

Stats.
13/4/5 D. Separation from the service shall cancel all unused accumulated sick leave. After the effective date of this Agreement, when a person who is an employee with permanent status in class is laid off or resigns, any unused accumulated sick leave shall be restored, if the employee is re-employed by the same agency or is rehired by any other agency of the State within five (5) years.

Employees who become bargaining unit members after the effective date of this Agreement and have unused sick leave accumulated in their sick leave account, shall have the amount accumulated in their account as of the date they become bargaining unit members, carried over under this Agreement. This section shall not be used to recompute the amount of sick leave accumulated in an employee’s account prior to July 1, 1993 or prior to the date an employee becomes a bargaining unit member.
13/4/7 F. Payment of Health Insurance Premium for Laid Off Employees.
Upon written request of an employee, accumulated unused sick leave shall, at the time of layoff, be converted to cash at the employee’s current base pay rate for credits to be used to pay health insurance premium costs during the time of layoff. Direct premium payment to the insurer shall be made by the Employer on behalf of the laid off employee. Premium payments under this provision shall be limited to a maximum period of five years from the date of layoff or shall cease the first of the month following the acceptance of any other employment, whichever occurs first. At the time of reinstatement or restoration, unused cash credits shall be converted to sick leave at the same rate used for the original conversion and restored to the employee’s sick leave account.
13/4/8 G. Payment of Health Insurance Premium for Employees Eligible for Disability Benefits.
