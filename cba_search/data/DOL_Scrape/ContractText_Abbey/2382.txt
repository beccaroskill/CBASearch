Section 7.	Work Offer During Overtime

In the event the Company has none of his regular work for him, such employee may elect to decline an assignment to another classification for up to four (4) hours or longer. It is expressly understood that such refusal would relieve the Company of any obligation for reporting pay.
c)	Notification of employees who are not to report to work shall be made in inverse seniority order. In the event the Company cannot notify all employees affected and the chain of seniority is broken, such employees will be identified to appropriate Union representatives. Upon reporting such employees will not be allowed to work and will not receive report-in pay. Failure to attempt to contact all employees causing the chain of seniority to be broken will result in the remaining employees to be allowed to work or receive report-in pay as provided in (a) and (b) of this Section.
Section 9.	Conditions Beyond Company Control
The provisions of Section 8 shall not apply if an employee is prevented from starting after reporting, or is prevented from continuing to work after starting because of conditions beyond the control of the Company. In such cases, each employee shall be paid at his applicable hourly rate for all time actually worked or one (1) hour, whichever is greater.

Section 10.	Overtime
It is the intention of the Parties to establish herein, as far as is practical, the basic principles for equitable rotation within job classifications, shifts and departments of such overtime work as may be required. To this end, the following rules are agreed to and shall prevail:
a)	Posting and Sign-Up for Scheduled Overtime
1.	Daily overtime, whether scheduled or unscheduled, will be filled by coverage overtime. Whenever possible, the Company will post for daily scheduled overtime (/'.e., overtime offered between 3:00 am on Monday and 11:00 pm on Friday) in advance by at least 24 hrs. However, overtime work on Friday from 7:00 pm to 11:00 pm shall be considered third shift’s daily overtime. Overtime from 11:00 pm on Sunday to 3:00 am on Monday shall be considered second shift’s overtime.
2.	The Company will separately post a roster for weekend overtime volunteers at the beginning of the workweek (third shift Sunday night), which will remain posted until two and one half (2 %) hours following the beginning of the third (3rd) day of the work week. By the end of the fourth (4th) day of the work week, employees needed to fill overtime requirements will be notified. If additional openings remain, employees may volunteer by the end of the shift on fifth (5th) day of the work week, by notifying their supervisor and signing the overtime sign-up sheet. Such employees will be placed in available openings by management subject to the selection process set forth below.
3.	Employees must personally sign all overtime sign-up sheets or contact their supervisor if away from the facility. Other employees are prohibited from signing the sheet on another person’s behalf.
4.	Signup sheets shall be available upon request to each department steward and general grievance committeeman for seventy-two hours following the close of the relevant signup period.
b)	Assignment of Overtime
1.	Available overtime, whether scheduled or unscheduled, will be offered in rotation. The rotation list shall be maintained in seniority order. The parties recognize, however, that the unpredictable nature of unscheduled overtime may occasionally require exceptions in the regular rotation.
2.	Overtime will be offered in order to those employees on the rotation list who have signed up for overtime on that date. Employees will be offered overtime in accordance with any preferences they have listed in terms of pre- or post-shift, provided the honoring of such preferences does not result in an empty overtime slot following exhaustion of the steps listed below.
3.	Employees who do not sign up to indicate their availability for overtime on that date shall be skipped in the rotation, and the available overtime will be offered to the next employee in the rotation.
4.	Employees who decline an offer of overtime on a date for which they signed up shall be skipped in the rotation, and the available overtime will be offered to the next employee in the rotation.
10
5.	Overtime requirements not filled by scheduled employees on that shift will be offered to other employees who signed up to be available for overtime but not able to work in their own job class on the same shift (or, in the case of weekend overtime, on a different shift).
6.	If overtime requirements still are not filled, the Company may require, schedule and rotate weekend overtime work beginning in inverse order of seniority for such employees to meet minimum coverage requirements. The Company shall not, however, mandate more than four (4) hours of daily overtime from an employee in a single workday.
7.	It is the responsibility of the employee to request training in all areas of their job classification. If an employee is not trained in an area, he/she will be skipped in the overtime rotation. However, if an employee has requested training and is awaiting training, he/she shall be eligible for overtime in that area if:
i.	The Company determines that it is operationally feasible to offer an overtime assignment in which the employee will only be required to perform work within his work area for which he is qualified;
ii.	The Company determines that it is operationally feasible to allow the employee to work with a qualified co-worker during the overtime assignment.
c)	When it becomes necessary to fill an open position for a minimum of one week, the company will, in lieu of offering overtime in accordance with the above process, fill the opening with the most senior employee with recall rights to that position in accordance with Article XVII, Section 5(f) or 5(g), whichever applies. If no employee is available the company may elect to fill the open position by coverage overtime and/or with a Company convenience transfer offered to the most senior qualified employee who is interested in the transfer. Whenever possible, the Company will cover open positions in an equitable manner, i.e. first half of shift and second half of shift.
d)	The Company may designate in certain job classifications where operations are continuous, that 0.3 hours of daily overtime be required. For the purpose of this paragraph (b) only, a continuous operation is defined as any plastic molding machine operation which works for two (2) or more consecutive eight (8) hour shifts within a twenty-four (24) hour period. For the purpose of overtime equalization, overtime that is generated as a result of the mandatory overlap for continuity of molding operations in the job classification 0692, Department 357, will not be counted.
e)	Company may on a rotating basis elect to limit the number of overtime hours scheduled per job class and shift. The Company shall not be obligated to insure cross-shift equalization of overtime in any respect.
f)	Employees who accept and/or who are scheduled for overtime assignments under this Article shall be obligated to work them. Failure to work mandatory overtime will be considered a step of discipline for the purpose of Article IX, Section 2. Failure to work voluntary weekend overtime will result in the charging of an occurrence. Failure to work daily overtime will result in the charging of half of an occurrence.
g)	Employees shall not be permitted to switch daily overtime, and shall only be permitted to give away daily overtime to the unscheduled, next-in-rotation employee. Employees shall not be permitted to switch or give away weekend overtime after four (4) hours into their last
11
g) Employees shall not be permitted to switch daily overtime, and shall only be permitted to give away daily overtime to the unscheduled, next-in-rotation employee. Employees shall not be permitted to switch or give away weekend overtime after four (4) hours into their last day in their normal workweek. However, employees on mandatory overtime may be allowed to find a qualified replacement up to the end of their shift on the last day in their normal workweek.
