AGREEMENT between the STATE OF CALIFORNIA and the CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS covering
PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN BARGAINING UNIT 18
Effective
July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006
NOTE CONCERNING THE CONTRACT EFFECTIVE DATE
This contract succeeds the one that was scheduled to expire July 2, 2003. All provisions of that 2003 contract remained in full force until this new contract took effect. This is because during negotiations for this successor agreement, that previous contract was formally extended through January 2, 2004.

ARTICLE 2 PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIAN PROVISIONS
2.1	Professional Recognition and Rights
A.	Preamble
The State of California recognizes the important contribution of the profession of Psychiatric Technicians and further recognizes them as an integral part of level of care services provided to the clients in the facilities operated by the Departments of Mental Health, Developmental Services, and Corrections and Rehabilitation. The State of California recognizes and encourages the efforts of Psychiatric Technicians to promote and maintain the professional standing of the Psychiatric Technician classification.
B.	Rights
1.	A Unit 18 employee, upon request, shall be entitled to have a CAPT representative or represent himself/herself at Skelly proceedings and formal disciplinary hearings held before the State Personnel Board.
2.	The State shall grant a total of four (4) days per fiscal year of State paid release time for two CAPT representatives to participate on the Licensing Advisory Board.
3.	Disciplinary representation will be administered as follows:
3
a.	Prior to the start of an investigatory interview, an employee shall be informed of the subject of the interview and if he/she may be subject to disciplinary or criminal action. If, during the course of an interview, should the focus of an investigation change to include the employee being interviewed, the employee will be so informed and, if requested by the employee, shall be allowed to obtain CAPT representation.
If the investigation is not concluded within 75 calendar days from the date an employee who is the subject of the investigation is interviewed by the special investigator, or 75 days from the date that the employee has received notice of administrative leave or reassignment, the employee who is the subject of the investigation or CAPT may file a grievance with the Executive Director, Warden or designee. The response shall include the anticipated completion date of the investigation. If the investigation is not completed by the time frame contained in the grievance response from the Executive Director, Warden or designee, the matter may be appealed to the Department Director’s level.
For any grievance filed based on this section, the response given at the director’s level shall be final and the grievance may not be appealed further in the grievance and arbitration procedure.
An employee shall be given advance written notice that he/she is being administratively transferred or placed on administrative leave, during the investigation of an allegation of wrongdoing.
The notice shall inform the employee of the reason for the administrative transfer or leave and the effective date.
b.	Upon request, an employee shall be accompanied by an Association representative at a meeting held with a significant purpose to investigate facts to support adverse action pursuant to Robinson v. State Personnel Board, the U.S. Supreme Court case in NLRB v. Weingarten, and final cases interpreting these decisions. "Adverse action" shall be defined as dismissal, demotion, reduction of pay, suspension without pay, a formal letter of reprimand or other adverse action as defined by the State Personnel Board.
Upon request, employees shall be allowed representation for meetings and investigations, as defined in this Section, with investigators employed by the Department of Health Services and investigators representing the Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians.
c.	At the request of the employee, representation shall be permitted at counseling sessions when:
(1)	The result of the counseling session is reduced to writing; and
(2)	The counseling memo or letter of instruction is included in the employee’s official personnel file; and
4
(3)	The counseling memo or letter of instruction refers to disciplinary action.
d.	Counseling memos or letters of instruction meeting the above criteria may be appealed through the department's complaint process.
e.	Every counseling memo or letter of instruction shall be written by the employee's supervisor and shall refer to a specific incident or incidents. When appropriate because of direct involvement, counseling memos or letters of instruction may be written by other than the employee's supervisor. For issues not involving a formal investigation, the memo or letter of instruction shall be issued to the employee within thirty days of the incident described in the memo, or from the date of discovery of the incident.
f.	The Association will provide a representative within a reasonable time based on the circumstances of the meeting.
g.	When formal adverse action is taken against an employee for an alleged offense that requires the State to report to the BVNPT or the Department of Health Services, no such report shall be made until after the conclusion of the Skelly hearing. After the conclusion of the Skelly hearing, the State may report to the BVNPT or the Department of Health Services the nature of the adverse action taken against the employee.
h.	If an employee is the subject of an investigation by the special investigator, which can result in disciplinary action, and there is insufficient evidence to take disciplinary action, the employee shall be so informed in writing by the Executive Director, Warden or designee of the facility conducting the investigation. This provision shall be subject to the complaint procedure.
i.	A dismissed employee whom the SPB or court later clears of any wrongdoing shall be reinstated to work in accordance with the following provisions. If the returning employee’s previous position has been permanently filled, the returning employee shall be offered the next vacant position on the shift and unit previously worked. An employee who elects not to return to the previously worked position shall be offered a position on another unit on the same shift as previously held. Should management determine return of the employee to the previously held position would not be in the best interest of the employee, other employees, or the patients of the unit, the returning employee shall receive written notification. The employee would then be granted, for a period of one year, super seniority to make a bid. During this period, the employee shall be placed in a position on a shift of the employee’s choice. Nothing in this subsection shall be counted according to Article 9.2 (Post and Bid).
4.	No recording device shall be used, nor shall any stenographic record be taken during an investigatory interview unless the employee and/or employer is so advised in advance.
5
5.	No Unit 18 employee, against whom disciplinary action has been initiated, shall be directed to sign any statement or admission of guilt to be used in a disciplinary proceeding without the opportunity to review the matter with an Association representative, upon the request of the employee.
6.	No Unit 18 employee shall be required to take a polygraph examination in connection with any formal disciplinary action.
7.	When formal adverse action is taken against an employee, the employee shall be given a copy of all documents and other investigating materials that were used to formulate the adverse action.
8.	Upon service of a subpoena on an employee to testify at an arbitration, State Personnel Board (SPB), Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) or legislative hearing, or a judicial proceeding, the State shall release the subpoenaed employee without loss of compensation for such time as is required to comply with the subpoena.
C.	Grievance or appeals of this provision:
During the term of this agreement, alleged violations of Section 2.1, Subsection B, paragraphs (2), (3), (6) and (9) shall be processed through the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Agreement unless otherwise stated.
Alleged violations of Section 2.1, Subsection B, paragraphs (1), (4), (5), (7), and (8) may not be processed through the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement, but instead shall be raised, if at all, in any disciplinary appeal or other proceedings authorized by law.
Section 2.1, Subsection A (Preamble) shall not be subject to the grievance, complaint or any other appeal procedure. Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver of any other right currently enjoyed by either the Association, State or employees in Unit 18.
2.2	Psychiatric Technician Career Ladder
A.	The State and the Association recognize the importance of career development and a career ladder on recruitment, retention and the morale of Bargaining Unit 18 employees.
B.	A series of classes within the bargaining unit exists which allows progression from entry-level classifications such as Psychiatric Technician Training Candidate, Psychiatric Technician Student, Psychiatric Technician Apprentice and Psychiatric Technician Assistant through Senior Psychiatric Technician. This career ladder extends beyond the bargaining unit through supervisory and managerial positions.
C.	The employer may sponsor an employee in Bargaining Unit 18 while he/she is engaged in training that leads to eligibility for examination for licensure in one of the level-of-care classifications.
1.	A sponsored employee is an employee who is selected by the employer to participate in a career training program.
6
2.	By necessity, a sponsored employee works irregular hours for an agreed-upon salary while voluntarily attending an educational institution in preparation for licensure.
3.	While on sponsorship status, the employee is guaranteed a weekly salary (paid bi-monthly) regardless of hours worked. Hours worked are determined by the employer, based on the employee's academic schedule, whether or not school is in session, and the operational needs of the facility.
4.	The regular hourly rate of pay of a sponsored employee is calculated by dividing the number of hours in the agreed upon time base into the salary specified in the State of California pay scales for the class at that time base. In no case will this hourly rate be less than minimum wage. This regular hourly rate will be paid for all hours up to the number specified in the time base worked in any work week. A rate of 1% times the regular rate of pay will be paid for all hours worked in excess of 40 in any workweek. The fixed salary, based on the time base of employment, is guaranteed to the employee in any work week in which he/she performs any work. For those sponsored on less than full time base sponsorship status, if the employee works beyond the number of hours indicated by the time base, he/she will be paid the regular hourly rate of pay for any hours worked above the sponsorship time base up to 40 hours and 1% times the regular rate of pay for all hours in excess of 40 hours. (See Appendix D for examples.)
5.	(a) Time spent in classroom activities and clinical lab time at sites other than the sponsoring facility is not counted as hours worked as it provides no direct benefit to the sponsoring facility.
(b) Compensation for clinical lab time performed at the sponsorship site is included in the guaranteed salary. Such clinical lab time, scheduled and worked, is included in the determination of the employee's eligibility for overtime payment.
6.	Sponsored employees will be provided a sponsorship contract and guidelines prior to entrance into the sponsorship relationship. (See Appendix E for model contract).
7.	Sponsored employees are expected, upon attainment of licensure, to work at the sponsoring site for at least the length of the sponsorship.
2.3	Professional Practice Groups (PPGs)
A.	The purpose of professional practice groups is to provide an orderly process through which Psychiatric Technicians may participate regularly as a group to:
1.	Establish, maintain and improve the standard of nursing care within the scope of the Psychiatric Technician license.
2.	Function as a central group to assist in:
(a)	Maintaining competence in nursing practices within the scope of the Psychiatric Technician license,
7
(b)	Increasing the competence of Psychiatric Technicians by exposure to new skills, trends and developments of practice for developmentally disabled clients and mentally disabled patients, and
(c)	Recognizing and accepting responsibility for recommending improvements in practices that will enhance client/patient care.
3.	Participate actively in efforts to define and upgrade the standards of practice, education, orientation, ethics, conduct and achievement as required by the appropriate licensing board.
4.	Serve as a centralized group for receiving individual or group concerns pertaining to nursing practices within the scope of the Psychiatric Technician license and channeling this input for study evaluation and consideration.
5.	Improve communications between members of the Psychiatric Technician discipline, related treatment/health care disciplines, and management and supervisors regarding new trends and changes in the field, such as a result of legislation, science or new applications and interpretation of existing laws.
B.	The size, composition and frequency of meetings for Psychiatric Technician PPGs shall be determined by facility management, which may include multidisciplinary Professional Practice Groups. Meetings of any PPGs shall be open and other employees may attend on their own time or on State time with his/her supervisor's approval. The selection process for the PPGs shall include an election of representative rank-and-file licensed Psychiatric Technicians and may also include direct appointments by management. Prior approval of agendas may be required. Each Professional Practice Group may elect officers and publish agendas in advance. No bargaining unit officer or job steward may serve as an elected officer. Each Professional Practice Group shall prepare minutes and provide a copy to management. Upon request, facility management shall be entitled to review the minutes prior to distribution.
C.	Professional Practice Groups shall be able to use State facilities, clerical support and mail systems consistent with current practices, workload and other facility priorities. Psychiatric Technicians participating in Professional Practice Groups shall suffer no loss of compensation and shall receive no overtime as a result of attendance at any Professional Practice Group meeting or assignments made by a Professional Practice Group.
D.	Professional Practice Groups may submit recommendations to facility management. It is understood by both parties that effective two-way communications improve morale and productivity.
E.	The Professional Practice Group shall not be for the purpose of meeting and conferring on any subject, nor for discussing a subject of any grievance or complaint. No Professional Practice Group communications, written or oral, may occur with any agency or organization other than the facility management without prior approval of the facility director or designee.
F.	It is understood that it is the responsibility of the Psychiatric Technicians themselves to form and organize the Professional Practices Group.
8
G.	This provision shall not be subject to the Grievance and Arbitration Article of this Agreement.
H.	Each chairperson of a facility Professional Practice Group may, upon request, be placed on a work schedule that allows up to 20 hours per week to perform PPG functions.
ARTICLE 3
MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
A.	All the functions, rights, powers and authority which the employer has not specifically bridged, delegated or modified by this Agreement are recognized by the Association as being retained by the State employer.
B.	This Agreement is not intended to, nor may it be construed to, contravene the spirit or intent of the merit principle in State employment, nor to limit the entitlements of State Civil Service employees provided by Article VII of the State Constitution or bylaws and rules enacted thereto.
ARTICLE 4 WAGES
4.1	Salary Definitions
For the purpose of salary actions affecting employees assigned to Bargaining Unit 18, the following definitions shall apply:
A.	"Salary range" is the range of rates between, and including, the minimum and maximum rate currently authorized for the class.
B.	"Step" for employees compensated on a monthly basis is a 5 percent differential above or below a salary rate rounded to the nearest dollar and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is a 5 percent differential above or below a rate rounded to the nearest dollar and cents amount. One step higher is calculated by multiplying the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,300 x 1.05 = $2,415). One step lower is calculated by dividing the rate by 1.05 (e.g., $2,415 ) 1.05 = $2,300).
C.	"Rate" for employees compensated on a monthly basis is any one of the full dollar amounts found within the salary range and for employees compensated on a daily or hourly basis is any one of the dollar and cents amounts found within the salary range.
D.	"Range differential" is the difference between the maximum rate of two salary ranges.
E.	"Substantially the same salary range" is a salary range with the maximum salary rate less than two steps higher than or the same as the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
F.	"Higher salary range" is a salary range with the maximum salary rate at least two steps higher than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
9
G.	"Lower salary range" is a salary range with the maximum salary rate any amount less than the maximum salary rate of another salary range.
Unless otherwise provided by the State Personnel Board, the lowest salary range currently authorized for the class is used to make salary comparisons between classes except for deep classes. Any rate falling within the salary range for a class may be used to accomplish appropriate step differentials in movements between classes and salary ranges.
4.2	Salaries
A.	Effective the beginning of the August 2004 pay period, all Unit 18 classifications shall receive a general salary increase of two and one-half percent (2.5%). The Universal Salary Schedule shall be used to determine the two and one-half (2.5%) increase. The parties recognize that the actual salary increase for each classification may vary slightly due to rounding.
B.	Effective the beginning of the January 2005 pay period, all Unit 18 classifications shall receive a general salary increase of two and one-half percent (2.5%). The Universal Salary Schedule shall be used to determine the two and one-half (2.5%) increase. The parties recognize that the actual salary increase for each classification may vary slightly due to rounding.
4.3	Ranges B and C
A.

A.	The State employer agrees that for the life of this Agreement, employees shall receive their annual salary adjustments in accordance with Government Code Section 19832 and applicable Department of Personnel Administration rules.

4.6	Bilingual Differential Pay
Bilingual Differential Pay applies to those positions designated by the Department of Personnel Administration as eligible to receive bilingual pay according to the following standards:
A.	Definition of Bilingual Position for Bilingual Differential Pay:
1.	A bilingual position for salary differential purposes requires the use of a bilingual skill on a continuing basis averaging 10% of the time. An employee using his/her bilingual skills 10% or more of the time will be eligible whether the skills are used in a conversational, interpretation or translation setting. In order to receive bilingual differential pay, the position/employee must be certified by the using department and approved by the Department of Personnel Administration. (Time should be an average of the time spent on bilingual activities during a given fiscal year.)
2.	The position must be in a work setting that requires the use of bilingual skills to meet the needs of the public in either:
(a)	A direct public contact position;
(b)	A hospital or institutional setting dealing with patient or inmate needs; or
(c)	A position utilized to perform interpretation, translation or specialized bilingual activities for the department and its clients.
3.	The position must be in a setting where there is a demonstrated client or correspondence flow where bilingual skills are clearly needed.
4.	Where organizationally feasible, departments should ensure that positions clearly meet the standards by centralizing the bilingual responsibility in as few positions as possible.
5.	Actual time spent conversing or interpreting in a second language and closely related activities performed directly in conjunction with the specific bilingual transaction will count toward the 10% standard.
B.	Rate:
1.	An employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria during the entire month shall receive a maximum of $100 per month, including holidays.
2.	An employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria less than the entire month shall receive the differential on a pro-rata basis.
3.	A fractional-month employee meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria shall receive the differential on a pro-rata basis.
4.	An employee paid by the hour meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria shall receive a differential of $.58 per hour.
5.	An employee paid by the day meeting the bilingual differential pay criteria shall receive a differential of $4.61 per day.
12
C.	Employees, regardless of the time base or tenure, who use their bilingual skills more than 10% of the time on a continuing basis and are approved by the Department of Personnel Administration will receive the bilingual differential pay on a regular basis.
D.	Bilingual differential payments will become earnings and subject to contributions to the State Retirement System, OASDI, levies, garnishments, Federal and State taxes.
E.	Employees working in positions which qualify for regular bilingual differential pay as authorized by the Department of Personnel Administration may receive the appropriate pay during periods of paid time off and absences (e.g., sick leave, vacation, holidays, etc.).
F.	Employees will be eligible to receive the bilingual differential payments on the date the Department of Personnel Administration approves the departmental pay request. The effective date may be retroactive to the date of appointment to a position requiring bilingual skills when the appointment documentation has been delayed. The effective date may be retroactive up to 60 days when the incumbent's duties are changed to include the use of bilingual skills.
G.	Bilingual salary payments will be included in the calculation of lump sum vacation, sick leave, and extra hour payments to employees terminating their State service appointment while on bilingual status.
H.	Employees will not receive bilingual salary compensation for overtime hours worked, except upon separation from State service, regardless of total hours during the pay period. Agencies may not include bilingual salary compensation when computing the overtime rate.
I.	Employees receiving regular bilingual differential pay will have their transfer rights determined from the maximum step of the salary range for their class. Incumbents receiving bilingual pay will have the same transfer opportunities that other class incumbents are provided.
J.	The bilingual differential pay shall be included in the rate used to calculate temporary disability, industrial disability, and non-industrial disability leave benefits.
4.7	Rate on Reinstatement after Separation
Employees who are permissively reinstated by the appointing power after a break in service of three (3) years or less shall be reinstated to the same step and salary range as when separated.

C.	An employee whose employment is terminated prior to full repayment of the amount owed shall have withheld from any money owing the employee upon termination an amount sufficient to provide full repayment. If the amount owing is insufficient to provide full reimbursement to the State, the State shall have the right to exercise any and all other legal means to recover the additional amount owed.
14
D.	If the employee should have reasonably known that an overpayment occurred, the schedule of repayment may be determined by the State and will not be subject to this Section.

F.	The department may withdraw any recruitment and retention differential for specific positions, classifications, facilities or geographic locations for new hires when it is no longer needed with a 30-day notice to CAPT.
15
G.	It is understood by CAPT that the decision to implement or not implement recruitment and retention payments or to withdraw authorization for such payments or differentials, and the amount of such payments or differentials rests solely with the State and that such decision is not grievable or arbitrable.

C.	If the Department mandatorily transfers an employee, he/she shall be eligible for a pro rata share for those months served.
D.	It an employee promotes to a different facility or department other than at the approved institutions prior to the completion of the twelve (12) consecutive qualifying pay periods, there shall be no pro rata of this recruitment and retention bonus.

HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
5.1	Overtime
A.	Overtime for employees in Work Week Group 2 is defined as all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a period of 168 hours or seven consecutive 24-hour periods.
B.	Payment of authorized overtime required by the State shall be in cash or compensating time off (CTO) and shall be at a rate of one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay for each hour of overtime worked, or fraction thereof, computed to the nearest fifteen minutes.
C.	During the term of this agreement, if the State is unable to provide cash compensation for overtime under the provisions of this contract, the State shall notice CAPT and the parties shall meet and confer pursuant to Article 14 (Entire Agreement).
D.	Employees may accrue up to 100 hours of compensating time off. Employees shall have the choice of cash or CTO for overtime hours worked. Management shall have the option, each fiscal year, to compensate employees up to 40 hours with CTO. All hours in excess of the 100 hour CTO maximum shall be compensated in cash.
Employees shall have the right to hold up to 40 hours of accrued CTO exempt from mandatory buyout. The employer or the employee shall be informed, prior to working overtime, whether the overtime will be in cash or CTO. If cash compensation is paid to an employee for accrued CTO, such compensation shall be paid at the regular rate earned by the employee at the time the employee receives the payment.
E.	If the State does not permit the employee to schedule the CTO within one year from the date the overtime was earned, the State shall make a cash payment in lieu of CTO except as provided in D above.
F.	Before an employee is required to work mandatory overtime, a reasonable effort will be made to find an acceptable volunteer within the program where the employee works. Overtime shall first be offered to level of care employees before allowing other classifications to work overtime.
18
1.	"Acceptable volunteer" means an employee who is competent to perform the assignment and meets any necessary licensure requirements.

1.	More than six involuntary overtime shifts of at least two hours duration in a month, or
2.	In excess of sixteen (16) hours continuously, or

1.	Take the next shift off on vacation, annual leave, CTO or holiday credit if staffing permits.
2.	Adjust the shift starting time to provide a 10-hour break between shifts.
3.	Take two hours off without pay or use CTO, holiday, annual leave or vacation at the start of the next shift to provide a 10-hour break.
I.	Employees shall be subject to the overtime provisions of Work Week Group 2. The appointing power determines the work week, which may begin on any day at any hour. Once the beginning time of an employee's work week is established and noted in the records, it remains fixed regardless of the schedule of hours worked. The beginning of a work week may be changed if the change is intended to be permanent and it is not designed to evade the overtime provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), except that, when the FLSA applies, the overtime provisions of Work Week Group 2 shall be in effect.
J.	Time during which a Unit 18 employee is excused from work because of vacation, CTO, holiday time or other paid leave shall be counted as hours worked within the workweek for purposes of determining overtime, except that effective the first pay period in August 2005 sick leave shall not be counted for this purpose.
K.	Notwithstanding any other contract provision, departmental policy or practice, the travel time of employees who are covered by FLSA shall be considered as time worked only if it meets the definitions and requirements of travel time in Sections 785.34 through 785.41 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
19
L.	Employees will not be called in to work on a scheduled day off. Management shall not require mandatory overtime on the last day of their regularly scheduled work week in excess of four (4) hours.

B.	When a training session is scheduled on an employee's authorized day off and the training session is canceled without prior notice to the employee, the employee shall be guaranteed at least four (4) hours of work or shall be paid for a minimum of four (4) hours at the employee's regular rate of pay.
C.	When a training session is scheduled on an employee's scheduled work day and outside the employee's scheduled work shift, and the employee is required to attend and the training session is canceled without prior notice, the employee shall be compensated for the actual time from the beginning or end of his/her shift to the notice of cancellation.
5.3	Call Back Time
An employee who has completed a scheduled work shift, or an employee on an authorized day off, when ordered back to work shall be credited with a minimum of four (4) hours work time at the employee's appropriate rate of pay provided the call back to work is without having been notified prior to completion of the work shift and the work begins more than two (2) hours after the completion of the scheduled work shift.
When staff meetings, training sessions or work assignments are regularly scheduled on an employee's authorized day off and the employee is required to attend, the employee shall receive callback compensation or shall work a minimum of four (4) hours.

Upon request of a NOC shift employee, management, where possible, shall approve CTO for the NOC shift prior to or after the training.
20
5.4	Rest Periods
A.	Two (2) rest periods of fifteen (15) minutes each shall be scheduled by the supervisor during each regular shift; one (1) during the first half of the shift and one (1) during the second half of the shift. Employees shall be permitted to take breaks except in cases of emergency involving client care.
B.	A rest period shall not be granted during the first or last hour of the work shift. Rest periods may not be accumulated, nor may they be used for overtime purposes. However, if operational needs prevent an employee from taking a rest period, the employee's supervisor may adjust the employee's shift in order to enable the employee to leave work early.
C.	Whenever possible and with the approval of his/her supervisor, the employee may take the break away from the employee's work area provided the employee is back in the work assignment at the end of the rest period.
5.5	Meal Periods
A.	Except for employees who are assigned to a straight eight (8) hour shift, full-time employees will be allowed a meal period of not less than 30 minutes nor more than 60 minutes which shall be determined by the State.
B.	Meal periods shall not be counted as part of total hours worked except for those employees who are required by the State to perform assigned duties during meal periods. When employees are required or permitted to work through their meal period, the State, at its option, may either adjust the employee's workweek schedule or workday schedule, or credit the employee for the time worked.
5.6	Days Off Cycles
At the request of the Association, the departments agree to schedule a meeting at each facility to discuss Association proposals related to days off cycles. Additional meetings may be scheduled with mutual agreement.
5.7	Exchange of Days Off
Unit 18 employees shall be permitted to exchange hours of work with other employees in a higher classification, the same classification or a lower classification within the series, performing same type of duties within the same work areas, provided:
1.	The exchange occurs within a period not to exceed 30 calendar days.
2.	The employees make a written request to their supervisor at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the exchange, and the request is approved by the supervisor.
An exchange shall be prohibited where it would result in overtime, or other additional compensation under the FLSA or this Agreement. Exchanges shall not qualify as an out-of-class assignment. This does not preclude exchanges between employees on different shifts.
21
5.8	Compensable Travel Time
Notwithstanding any other contract provision, departmental policy or practice, the travel time of employees who are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act shall be considered as time worked only if it meets the definitions and requirements of travel time in Sections 785.34 through 784.41 of Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
In applying Section 785.37 (home to work on special one-day assignment in another city), for purposes of consistent application, "another city" is defined as a work location in excess of a 25-mile radius from the employee's headquarters.
5.9	Excess Time
A.	At the conclusion of each fiscal year, management shall determine the feasibility of paying cash compensation for excess time accrued over the previous year.
1.	Should management determine that it is feasible to provide cash compensation for the accrued excess time, the facility will survey employees for cash-out.
2.	If the facility determines that it cannot cash out all the requested excess time, facility management will determine a method to distribute the available cash among those employees requesting cash-out.
B.	Employees must maintain a minimum of 32 hours after the cash-out occurs.
5.10	Mixed Shifts

DDS Vacation Scheduling
A.	On October 1 of each year, each unit/work location shall post a vacation calendar in a prominent place readily available to Bargaining Unit 15, 17, 18 and 20 LOC employees. For the AM and PM shifts, the calendar shall clearly indicate by unit/work location (as defined by the program management) and shift, the number of LOC employees who may be on vacation on each day of the upcoming year. For the NOC shift, the calendar shall indicate by program, the number of employees who may be on vacation on each day of the upcoming year. The posted vacation time shall be sufficient to permit all employees on each shift to have a vacation sometime during the year. Nonclient residential programs are exempt from coverage but will be governed by terms and conditions of this Agreement.

These employees will be given the opportunity to modify their vacation choices through discussion and compromise among the affected employees. Where these discussions do not result in compromise and agreement among the affected employees, the most senior employees' vacation request shall prevail if the employees are in the same bargaining unit. Conflicts between employees of different bargaining units shall be resolved by lot (coin toss). If an employee does not obtain his/her bid vacation, he/she will be provided the same duration of time off as bidded as determined by management, or the employee may bid on the remaining unbid vacation time.
D.	On December 7, program management shall post the vacation calendar for the upcoming vacation year.
E.	Program management shall post an ad hoc calendar on a quarterly basis for the purpose of identifying potential time slots. The calendar shall be posted on or about December 20 for the January/March quarter and by the 20th day of the last month of each quarter thereafter.
28
1.	Program management shall maintain full and unabridged discretion to determine the time slot(s) available on the ad hoc calendars and shall maintain full and unabridged prerogatives to add or delete ad hoc time slot(s) that have not been approved off.
2.	The ad hoc calendar shall not be construed as an additional vacation calendar, but as contingent and tentative time slot(s) subject to cancellation for operational needs.
3.	The ad hoc time slot(s) shall be obtained on a first-come, first-served basis without regard to what type of employee time accrual is used to request the time slot(s) off.
F.	When an employee cancels a vacation period, the state shall make a reasonable effort to make all or part of the time available on the ad hoc calendar.
G.	A reasonable effort shall be made to honor vacation time when an employee transfers to another position within the facility. If it cannot be honored, the employee will be guaranteed the equivalent time off at another time, as determined by management determination.
H.	Nothing in this agreement shall prevent program management from granting additional time in excess of the ad hoc calendar.
I.	If an ad hoc time slot is available and an employee elects to use a personal holiday, it shall be granted if the request is made at least five (5) calendar days in advance.
6.3	Annual Leave
A.	Employees may elect to enroll in the annual leave program to receive annual leave credit in lieu of vacation and sick leave credits. Employees enrolled in the annual leave program may elect to enroll in the vacation and sick leave program at any time except that once an employee elects to enroll in either the annual leave program or vacation and sick leave program, the employee may not elect to enroll in the other program until 24 months have elapsed from date of enrollment.
B.	Each full-time employee shall receive credit for annual leave in lieu of the vacation and sick leave credits of this agreement in accordance with the following schedule:
1 month to 3 years..
37 months to 10 years .. 121 months to 15 years 181 months to 20 years 241 months and over.
11 hours per month
14 hours per month
16	hours per month
17	hours per month
18	hours per month
29
Part-time and hourly employees shall accrue proportional annual leave credits, in accordance with the applicable DPA rules.

All provisions necessary for the administration of this section shall be provided by DPA rule or memorandum of understanding.
C.	A full-time employee who has 11 or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn annual leave credits as set forth in DPA Rules 599.608 and 599.609.
Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than 11 consecutive days which fall into two consecutive qualifying pay periods shall disqualify the second pay period.
D.	Employees who work in multiple positions may participate in annual leave, provided an election is made while employed in an eligible position subject to these provisions. Annual leave accrual for employees in multiple positions will be computed by combining all positions, as in vacation leave, provided the result does not exceed the amount earnable in full-time employment, and the rate of accrual shall be determined by the schedule which applies to the position or collective bargaining status under which the election was made.
E.	If an employee does not use all of the annual leave that the employee has accrued in a calendar year, the employee may carry over his/her accrued annual leave credits to the following calendar year to a maximum of 640 hours. A department head or designee may permit an employee to carry over more than 640 hours of accrued hours because the employee was:
1.	Required to work as a result of fire, flood or other extensive emergency.
2.	Assigned work of a priority or critical nature over an extended period of time.
3.	Absent on full salary for compensable injury.
4.	Prevented by department regulations from taking annual leave until December 31 because of sick leave.

However, when two or more employees on the same shift (if applicable) in a work unit (as defined by each department head or designee) request the same annual leave time and approval cannot be given to all employees requesting it, employees shall be granted their preferred annual leave period in order of State seniority.
I.	Each department head or designee will make every effort to act on annual leave requests in a timely manner.
J.	Annual leave that is used for purposes of sick leave is subject to the requirements set forth in Section 6.4 (Sick Leave) of this Agreement.
K.	The Enhanced Non-industrial Disability Insurance (ENDI) in Section 7.8 applies only to those employees in the annual leave program described above in this section.
L.	Employees who are currently subject to vacation and sick leave provisions may elect to enroll in the annual leave program at any time after 24 months has elapsed from date of last enrollment. The effective date of the election shall be the first day of the pay period in which the election is received by the appointing power. Once enrolled in annual leave, an employee shall become entitled to an Enhanced NDI benefit (50 percent of gross salary).
M.	Upon enrollment in the annual leave program, existing vacation balances will become the employee's annual leave balance. For example, if an employee has accrued 300 vacation hours and enrolls in the annual leave program, the 300 hours of vacation become 300 hours of annual leave. In this example, all earned hours of annual leave shall be added to the 300 hours and the employee may accrue annual leave hours up to a cap of 640 hours as outlined in Subsection E above.
6.4	Sick Leave

31
B.	On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each monthly pay period of service, each full time employee shall earn eight hours of credit for sick leave with pay. A full-time employee who had eleven or more working days of service in a monthly pay period shall earn full sick leave credit. Absences from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven consecutive working days, which fall into two consecutive qualifying pay periods, shall disqualify the second pay period.
C.	Credit for less than full-time employees shall be computed as follows:
1.	Part-time employees. On the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of each monthly pay period of continuous service, each part-time employee shall be allowed, on a pro-rata basis, the fractional part of eight hours credit for sick leave with pay.
2.	Multiple positions under this rule:
a.	An employee holding a position in addition to other full-time employment with the State shall not receive credit for sick leave with pay for service in the additional position.
b.	Where an employee holds two or more "less than full-time positions," the time worked in each position shall be combined for purposes of computing credits for sick leave with pay, but the credits shall not exceed full-time employment credit.
D.	The department head or designee shall approve sick leave only after having ascertained that the absence is for an authorized reason and may require the employee to submit substantiating evidence including, but not limited to, a physician's certificate. If the department head or designee does not consider the evidence adequate, the request for sick leave shall be disapproved.

Upon notice, the employee shall have five working days to provide additional documentation to verify the request for sick leave prior to the denial becoming final.
Verification of sick leave will be made in accordance with Subsection D above. Employees who are on attendance programs shall be required to provide medical verification in accordance with their attendance plan.
J.	Upon request, an employee who is not on a sick leave attendance program and who submits substantiation for use of sick time which is accepted by the employee's supervisor as a valid absence from work under Subsection A above, and has insufficient sick leave credits to cover the absence, other leave credits shall be used to cover the absence.
Upon request, an employee who is on a sick leave attendance program and who suffers a major injury and submits substantiation for use of sick time which is accepted by the employee's supervisor as a valid absence from work and the employee has exhausted all sick leave credits, other leave credits may be used to cover the absence.
K.	An employee shall be provided written counseling before being placed on a sick leave attendance program.

A.	The State acknowledges its commitment to comply with the spirit and intent of the leave entitlement provided by the FMLA and the California Family Rights Act (CFRA), referred to collectively as “FMLA.” The State and the Union recognize that on occasion it will be necessary for employees of the State to take job-protected leave for reasons consistent with the FMLA. As defined by the FMLA, reasons for an FMLA leave may include an employee’s serious health condition, for the care of a child, parent, spouse or domestic partner who has been defined and certified with the Secretary of State’s office in accordance with Family Code Section 297 who has a serious health condition, and/or for the birth or adoption of a child.
40
B.	For the purposes of providing FMLA benefits, the following definitions shall apply:
1.	An eligible employee means an employee who meets the eligibility criteria set forth in the FMLA.
2.	An employee’s child means any child, regardless of age, who is affected by a serious health condition as defined by the FMLA and is incapable of self care. “Care” as provided in this section applies to the individual with the covered health condition.
3.	An employee’s parent means a parent or an individual standing in loco parentis as set forth in the FMLA.
4.	Leave may include paid sick leave, vacation, annual leave, personal leave, catastrophic leave, holiday credit, excess hours and unpaid leave. In accordance with the FMLA, an employee shall not be required to use CTO credits unless otherwise specified by Section 6.9 of this Contract.

FMLA absences for reasons other than illness and/or injury (i.e. adoption or care of an eligible family member) may be covered with leave credits other than sick leave, or with unpaid leave, at the employee’s discretion. Except in accordance with Section 6.9 of this Contract, an employee shall not be required to exhaust all leave credits available before choosing unpaid leave to cover an FMLA absence.
C.	An eligible employee shall provide certification of the need for an FMLA leave. Additional certification may be requested if the department head or designee has reasonable cause to believe the employee’s condition or eligibility for FMLA leave has changed. The reasons for the additional certification request shall be provided to the employee in writing.
D.	An eligible employee shall be entitled to a maximum of twelve (12) workweeks (480 hours) of FMLA leave per calendar year and all other rights set forth in the FMLA.

41
E.	Within 90 days of the ratification date of this Contract, and on January 1 of each year thereafter, FMLA leave shall be recorded in accordance with the calendar year. Each time an employee takes an FMLA leave, the remaining leave entitlement is any balance of the twelve (12) workweeks that has not been used during the current calendar year. Employees who have taken FMLA leave under the previous 12-month rolling period shall be entitled to additional leave up to a total of 12 weeks for the current calendar year.
F.	An employee on FMLA leave has a right to be restored to his/her same or “equivalent” position (FMLA) or to a “comparable” position (CFRA) with equivalent pay, benefits and other terms and conditions of employment.

Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) work days.
C.	The employee shall serve a ten (10) consecutive calendar day waiting period before NDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued vacation or sick leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period.

An employee will be eligible for NDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of 960 hours of compensated work.
I.	All other applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and regulations not superseded by these provisions will remain in effect.
J.	Upon approval of NDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
49
K.	All appeals of a denial of an employee's NDI benefits shall follow only the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22.

7.8	Enhanced Non-Industrial Disability Insurance (ENDI) - Annual Leave
A.	This ENDI provision is applicable only to employees participating in the annual leave program referenced in Section 6.3.

Paid leave shall not be used to cover the ten (10) work days. Disability payments may be supplemented with annual leave, sick leave or partial payment to provide up to 100% income replacement. At the time of an ENDI claim, an employee may elect either the 50% ENDI benefit rate or a supplementation level of 75% or 100% at gross pay. Once a claim for ENDI has been filed and the employee has determined the rate of supplementation, the supplemental rate shall be maintained throughout the disability period.
D.	The employee shall serve a seven (7) consecutive calendar day waiting period before ENDI payments commence for each disability. Accrued paid leave or CTO leave balances may be used to cover this waiting period. The waiting period may be waived commencing with the first full day of confinement in a hospital, nursing home or emergency clinic for at least one full day.

This does not qualify the employee for a new disability period Subsection C above. The appointing power may require an employee to submit to a medical examination by a physician or physicians designated by the Director of the Employment Development Department for the purpose of evaluating the capacity of the employee to perform the work of his/her position.
H.	If an employee refuses to return to work in a position offered by the employer under the State's Injured State Worker Assistance Program, ENDI benefits will be terminated effective the date of the offer.
I.	Where employment is intermittent or irregular, the payments shall be determined on the basis of the proportionate part of a monthly rate established by the total hours actually employed in the 18 monthly pay periods immediately preceding the pay period in which the disability begins as compared to the regular rate for a full-time employee in the same group or class. An employee will be eligible for ENDI payments on the first day of the monthly pay period following completion of 960 hours of compensated work.
J.	All other applicable Department of Personnel Administration laws and regulations not superseded by these provisions will remain in effect.
K.	Upon approval of ENDI benefits, the State may issue an employee a salary advance if the employee so requests.
L.	All appeals of an employee's denial of ENDI benefits shall follow only the procedures in the Unemployment Insurance Code and Title 22. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to an individual's denial of benefits.
M.	Employees who become covered in the annual leave program while on an NDI claim shall continue to receive NDI pay at the old rate for the duration of the claim.
N.	Employees who do not elect the annual leave program will receive NDI benefits in accordance with Section 7.7.
7.9	Industrial Disability Leave (IDL)
A.	Subject to the three-day waiting period specified in Government Code Section 19875, eligible employees shall receive IDL payments equivalent to full net pay for the first 22 work days after the date of the reported injury.
B.	In the event the disability exceeds 22 work days, the employee will receive 66 and 2/3% of gross pay from the 23rd work day of disability until the end of the 52nd week of disability. No IDL or payments shall be allowed after two years from the first day (i.e., date) of disability.
51
C.	The employee may elect to supplement payment from the 23rd work day with accrued leave credits including annual leave, vacation, sick leave or compensating time off (CTO) in the amount necessary to approximate the employee's full net pay. Partial supplementation will be allowed, but fractions of less than one hour will not be permitted. Once the level of supplementation is selected, it may be decreased to accommodate a declining leave balance but it may not be increased. Reductions to supplementation amounts will be made on a prospective basis only.
D.	Temporary Disability (TD) with supplementation, as provided in Government Code Section 19863, will no longer be available to any State employee who is a member of either the CalPERS or STRS retirement system during the first 52 weeks, after the first date of disability, within a two year period. Any employee who is already receiving disability payments on the effective date of this provision will be notified and given 30 days to make a voluntary, but irrevocable change to the new benefit for the remainder of his/her eligibility for IDL.
E.	If the employee remains disabled after the IDL benefit is exhausted, the employee will be eligible to receive Temporary Disability benefits as provided in Government Code Section 19863.
F.	In the event an employee is determined to be "permanent and stationary" by his/her physician before the IDL benefit is exhausted, but is unable to return to work, he/she must agree to participate in a vocational rehabilitation program. Refusing to participate will result in immediate suspension of the IDL benefit.
G.	All appeals of an employee's denial of IDL benefits shall follow only the procedures in the Government Code and Title 2. All disputes relating to an employee's denial of benefits are not grievable or arbitrable. This does not change either party's contractual rights which are not related to an individual's denial of benefits.
H.	A dispute on whether an injury is job related may be grievable to the 2nd step of the grievance procedure. This procedure shall not apply to SCIF determinations.
I.	IDL shall continue beyond the physician's statement that the employee's condition is "permanent and stationary" providing the employee has benefits remaining and the employee is declared a "qualified injured worker" and is eligible for and agrees to participate in vocational rehabilitation.
J.	If the IDL benefits are to be terminated, the employee shall be notified by letter and advised as to the status of his/her health, retirement and miscellaneous deductions.
K.	All checks issued pursuant to this section from the facility revolving fund shall have an explanation as to the monies received and pay periods covered.
L.	A standard Supervisor's Report of Injury shall be submitted to the Health and Safety Officer within 24 hours after a job-related injury.

This provision may not be subject to the grievance, arbitration, complaint or any other appeal procedure.
P.	Appeals with respect to medical examinations in accordance with GC 19253.5 may be filed with the State Personnel Board.

Such injury must have been directly and specifically caused by an assault or in the restraining of an assaultive patient/client or inmate/ward, except that the Department Director may waive these preceding restrictions. An employee who is determined to be eligible for EIDL shall receive EIDL benefits from the first full day of absence.
B.	The EIDL benefit will be equivalent to the injured employee's net take-home salary on the date of the injury. EIDL eligibility and benefits may continue for no longer than one year after the date of initial absence as a result of the injury.

Pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the employer shall make employee contributions on behalf of employees and such contributions shall be treated as employer contributions in determining tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of the United States. Such contributions are being made by the employer in lieu of employee contributions.
2.	Employee contributions made under Subsection A above shall be paid from the same source of funds as used in paying the wages to affected employees.
3.	Employee contributions made by the employer under Subsection A above shall be treated for all purposes other than taxation in the same manner and to the same extent as employee contributions made prior to the effective date of this Agreement.
68
4.	The employee does not have the option to receive the employer-contributed amounts paid pursuant to this Agreement directly instead of having them paid to the retirement system.
C.	Wage adjustment
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the wages of employees shall be reduced by the amount of employee contributions made by the employer pursuant to the provisions hereof.
D.	Limitations to operability
This Section shall be operative only as long as the State of California "pick up" of employee retirement contributions continues to be excludable from gross income of the employee under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
E.	Non-arbitrability
The parties agree that no provisions of this Section shall be deemed to be arbitrable under the grievance and arbitration procedure contained in this Agreement.
8.5	Items Excluded from Compensation for Retirement Purposes
The parties agree that sustained superior accomplishment awards shall not be considered as compensation for retirement purposes.
8.6	First Tier Retirement Formula (2% @ 55)
CAPT and the State continue to support the “2% at 55” retirement formula for Bargaining Unit 18 employees who are Miscellaneous and Industrial members of the First Tier plan under the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS). The 2% at 55 formula provides enhanced benefit factors to State employees who retire directly from State employment on and after January 1, 2000. The following table compares the previous First Tier age benefit factors to the enhanced factors:
Age at Retirement	Previous Factors	Enhanced Factors
50 .........................1.092......................1.100
51 .........................1.156......................1.280
52 .........................1.224......................1.460
53 .........................1.296......................1.640
54 .........................1.376......................1.820
55 .........................1.460	 2.000
56 .........................1.552......................2.064
57 .........................1.650......................2.126
58 .........................1.758......................2.188
59 .........................1.874......................2.250
60 .........................2.000......................2.314
61 .........................2.134	 2.376
62 .........................2.272......................2.438
63 and over.................2.418	 2.500
69
The Government Code section implementing this enhancement specifies factors for attained quarter ages, such as 52%. The improved factors also apply to past service that is credited under the First Tier and the Modified First Tier.
Except as specified in Section 4.2 of this Agreement, the amount of member contributions required of employees who will be covered under these new factors will continue to be 5 percent of monthly compensation in excess of $513.
8.7	Safety Member Retirement Formula (2.5% @ 55)
CAPT and the State continue to support the “2.5% at 55” retirement formula for Bargaining Unit 18 employees who are State Safety members of the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS).
This continues the prior enhancement of the age benefit factors from age 50 to 55, with a benefit at age 55 equal to 2.5% of compensation for each year of service. These improved benefit factors apply to employees who retire directly from State service on and after January 1, 2000, and for service rendered as a State Safety member prior to and after that date.
Once the forensic client population reaches fifty percent (50%) of the total population at Porterville Developmental Center (PDC), the parties to this agreement shall meet and confer for the purpose of implementing safety retirement for all PDC employees who are in the miscellaneous retirement category.
8.8	Safety Retirement - Department of Developmental Services
A.	Bargaining Unit 18 employees working for the Department of Developmental Services who meet the criteria for Safety Retirement as provided in Government Code Sections 18717, 19816.20 and 20405.1 will be given the option to either remain in their current retirement category or move to safety retirement when their eligibility is established by the Department of Personnel Administration.
B.	Service in Bargaining Unit 18 prior to the effective date of this change shall remain credited under the miscellaneous retirement formula. However, service in another position or department which is defined as state safety service shall be creditable as provided by Section 20068 of the Government Code.
C.	CAPT understands and agrees that the State may establish new classifications necessary to implement this provision.
D.	The State agrees to conduct a “Safety Study” at the Department of Developmental Services Northern California (Sierra Vista) and Southern California (Canyon Springs) Community Facilities to determine whether Unit 18 employees qualify for state safety membership under the California Public Employees’ Retirement System pursuant to the Government Code Section 19816.20. If the study determines they meet the Government Code Criteria, then the employees will be moved prospectively into the Safety category as defined in B above.
70
8.9	First Tier Retirement Eligibility for Employees in Second Tier Retirement
CAPT and the State continue to support the option for employees who are currently in the Second Tier retirement plan to elect to be covered under the First Tier.
New employees who meet the criteria for CalPERS membership will be enrolled in the First Tier plan and have the right to be covered under the Second Tier plan within 180 days of the date of their appointment. If a new employee does not make an election for Second Tier coverage during this period, he or she will remain in the First Tier plan.
Employees who purchase their past service will be required to pay the amount of contributions they would have paid had they been First Tier members during the period of service that they are purchasing. As required by CalPERS law, the amount will include interest at 6 percent, compounded annually.
8.10	Industrial Disability Retirement
Industrial Disability and Special Death Benefits for Bargaining Unit 18 employees at Porterville Developmental Center are specified in Government Code Section 20047.5 which reads as follows:
20047.5.	"Industrial," with respect to state miscellaneous members, means death or disability on or after January 1, 2002, resulting from an injury that is a direct consequence of a violent act perpetrated on his or her person by a patient or client of the State Department of Developmental Services, at Porterville Developmental Center if both of the following apply:
(a)	The member either (1) was performing his or her duties within a treatment ward at the time of the injury, or (2) was not within a treatment ward but was acting within the scope of his or her employment at the hospital and is regularly and substantially as part of his or her duties in contact with the patients or clients.
(b)	The member, at the time of injury, was either (1) employed in a state bargaining unit for which a memorandum of understanding has been agreed to by the state employer and the recognized employee organization to become subject to this section, (2) excluded from the definition of "state employee" in subdivision (c) of Section 3513, or (3) a non-elected officer or employee of the executive branch of government who was not a member of the civil service.
8.11 Alternate Retirement Program
Effective August 11, 2004, CAPT expressly agrees and acknowledges that new employees in all Unit 18 classifications are subject to the terms of the Alternative Retirement Program as specified in SB 1105.

ARTICLE 9
WORKING CONDITIONS
9.1	Layoff and Reemployment
A.	Application
Whenever it is necessary because of a lack of work or funds, or whenever it is advisable in the interest of economy to reduce the number of permanent and/or probationary employees (hereinafter known as "employees") in any State agency, the State may lay off employees pursuant to this Section.
B.	Order of Layoff
Employees shall be laid off in order of seniority pursuant to Government Code Sections 19997.2 through 19997.7 and applicable State Personnel Board and Department of Personnel Administration rules.
C.	Notice
Employees compensated on a monthly basis shall be notified thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the effective date of layoff. Where notices are mailed, the thirty (30) calendar day time period will begin to run on date of mailing of the notice. The State agrees to notify CAPT no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the actual date of layoff.
D.	Transfer or Demotion in Lieu of Layoff
The State may offer affected employees a transfer or a demotion in lieu of layoff pursuant to Government Code Sections 19997.8 through 19997.10 and applicable Department of Personnel Administration rules. If an employee refuses a transfer or demotion, the employee shall be laid off.
E.	Reemployment
In accordance with Government Code Sections 19997.11 and 19997.12, the State shall establish a reemployment list by class for all employees who are laid off. Such lists shall take precedence over all other types of employment lists for the classes in which employees were laid off. Employees shall be certified from department or subdivisional reemployment lists in accordance with Section 19056 of the Government Code.
F.	State Service Credit for Layoff Purposes
In determining seniority scores, one point shall be allowed for each qualifying monthly pay period of full-time State service regardless of when such service occurred. A pay period in which a full-time employee works eleven or more days will be considered a qualifying pay period except that when an absence from State service resulting from a temporary or permanent separation for more than eleven consecutive working days falls into two consecutive qualifying pay periods, the second pay period shall be disqualified.
72
G.	Disputes
Any dispute regarding the interpretation or application of any portion of this layoff provision shall be resolved solely through the procedures established in Government Code Section 19997.14. The hearing officer's decision shall be final and, upon its issuance, the Department of Personnel Administration (DPA) shall adopt the hearing officer's decision as its own. In the event that either the employee(s) or appointing power seeks judicial review of the decision pursuant to Government Code Section 19815.8, DPA, in responding thereto, shall not be precluded from making arguments of fact or law that are contrary to those set forth in the decision.
9.2	Post and Bid
A.	Vacant Positions
As management determines that Psychiatric Technician or Psychiatric Technician Assistant positions become available or vacant, they shall first be reviewed by the State to determine if, pursuant to the terms of this Section, the position is eligible for post and bid or is to be filled without posting.
If the State determines to fill the position without posting, the position may be filled by hire, transfer, promotion or any other method allowed by the civil service system. Such positions may be advertised where appropriate, but will be filled through the sole discretion of the State. As positions become vacant and determinations are made by the State, the excess of non-posted positions over posted positions shall not exceed two (2) at any hospital or developmental center at any time. In no case shall more than 60% of the filled licensed Psychiatric Technician Series positions in a hospital/developmental center be held by employees through successful bids.
B.	Posted Positions
Those positions which are determined to be posted shall be posted in a prominent place where such notices are customarily posted on each unit and, in addition, may be advertised in each hospital's/developmental center's publication. The posted notice shall be on a form designed for that purpose and shall include the following posting criteria:
1.	Identification posting number
2.	Level of position
3.	Program and unit (or ward) or other assignment
4.	Shift
5.	Days off or rotation pattern and cycle
6.	Time base
7.	Deadline for bid submittal
8.	Indication of an "incentive bid position"
9.	Location where bid is to be submitted
Each notice shall remain posted for no less than seven (7) calendar days.
73
C.	Bidding
Employees may bid on the posted position by filling out a bid form provided by the State. Bid forms shall be submitted in triplicate with the employee submitting the original to the appropriate central office, a copy to the Association, and the employee retaining a copy. Bid forms shall include the identification posting number, the employee's name, classification, seniority points, current work location and business telephone number. The form must be dated and signed by the employee to indicate certification that the worksite has been visited.
Posted positions shall be available for bid only to those employees in the civil service classification specified on the posted notice.
D.	Assignment
Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the posting of notice of vacancy, the position shall be assigned to the eligible bidding employee with the most seniority. However, in emergencies or where severe staffing shortages exist in the employee's incumbent program, assignment may be delayed up to sixty (60) calendar days after the posting of notice. If no bids are received, management shall withdraw the bid notice. The withdrawn notice does not count against either party's ratios or 60/40 position count. These positions may be filled:
1.	In accordance with Subsection A above, or
2.	Hire, promotion, reinstatement, transfer from within the facility or from another State hospital/developmental center or other State agency.
If that position is filled or committed within sixty (60) days of withdrawal of posting under (2) above, it shall not count in the 50/50 posting ratios.
E.	Incentive Bid Position
A vacant position that is posted two (2) consecutive times and remains unbid may be identified as an "incentive position" on the third consecutive posting. In a program identified as a "designated program" an unbid position may be identified as an incentive position on the second consecutive posting.
An employee who successfully bids an incentive position and remains in the position for one (1) year shall be accorded super-seniority for his/her next successful bid. When two (2) or more employees with super-seniority bid, the position shall be awarded as follows:
1.	Length of super-seniority
2.	Seniority
3.	By lot
74
Incentive positions that are not bid upon may be filled through internal transfer from within the hospital without counting in the posting ratios or position counts. He/she is then eligible to receive super-seniority in the same manner as an employee who bid the position. Employees who successfully bid an incentive position and are bidding in-place (same unit and shift as the posted position) shall not be eligible to earn the super-seniority. In "designated programs" the super-seniority eligibility shall be limited to positions awarded to employees from outside the program only.
The facility shall provide the Association with a weekly listing of "designated programs."
An employee in an incentive position that is deleted or altered in accordance with Subsection f. shall retain the eligibility to earn super seniority if he/she elects to remain in the altered or changed position. Employee absences due to illness or injury shall not be counted after the 14th consecutive calendar day toward the one-year qualifying period to earn super-seniority.
F.	Deletions and Changes
If a bid position is deleted due to reduced allocations or for other reasons, the employee in that position may bid on any vacant posted position. If, because of coverage or other legitimate operational need, it is determined that a bid position's posting criteria must be altered in any respect, the employee filling that position shall be notified of the proposed changes and the reason for the change in writing. If the employee desires to remain in the altered position, he/she shall notify management of that desire within five (5) calendar days and shall remain in the position. A position shall not be considered to be altered when training is conducted on a shift other than the employee's regularly scheduled shift and the employee is required to attend.
G.	Special Positions
Special positions such as Developmental Specialist and Child Care Practitioner shall be available for bid only to those employees in the appropriate civil service classification and shall be so identified on the posted notice. Posted positions shall be available for bid by any employee if in the appropriate civil service classification.
H.	Floating
If it becomes necessary to float employees to provide coverage, each work location (unit and shift) shall establish a rotational system that distributes floating on an equitable basis.
75
I.	Exempt Positions
Positions for employees including SR PT, PTTC, PTT, PTS, Psychiatric Technician Apprentice and PLPT may be designated by management among all vacant or unbid positions. These positions shall not be included in the management discretion positions. These classes have no bidding rights and may be assigned by management as needed or desired. When a non-licensed employee receives his/her license and is subsequently appointed to a Psychiatric Technician classification, he/she shall not be considered as a new hire for purposes of counting positions under Subsections A, C, D or E.
J.	Transfers
Employees holding bid positions shall not, except in cases of emergency, be involuntarily transferred or moved except as otherwise provided in this Section.
K.	Denial of Bid
Employees who have adverse actions taken against them shall lose their right to hold a bid position and/or to bid on any positions for a period of up to six (6) months if the position or bid is meaningfully related to the cause of action. If, on appeal, the employee is exonerated, his/her right to bid and/or hold positions shall be restored. Employees who are charged with wrongdoing, which is also grounds for adverse action, may lose their right to bid and/or hold a bid position for a period of up to six (6) months if the position or bid is meaningfully related to the cause of action. A hearing before the Executive Director or designee is required prior to such denial.
Employees who receive yearly evaluations which have two (2) or more categories marked below standard may lose their right to hold and/or bid positions for up to six (6) months, subject to review in three (3) months. If the evaluation is overturned by a reviewing officer or as a result of a grievance decision, the employee shall have his/her right to bid and hold positions restored.
An employee shall retain his/her right to bid during an investigation of an allegation of wrongdoing. If the employee who is under investigation is awarded the bid position, he/she shall vacate his/her previous position. If the employee is on an administrative reassignment due to the investigation and cannot be assigned to the bid position, the assignment shall be delayed pending the outcome of the investigation. Employees losing their right to bid or hold positions as outlined above may be administratively transferred at the discretion of the State. Employees who have been absolved of wrongdoing as stated above, shall be moved to the awarded bid position.
L.	Limits on Bid
An employee may not make more than one successful bid each twelve (12) months except if an employee's bid position is altered and the employee elects not to stay in the position, or if an employee is granted a bid under the provisions in Subsection j. above, these bids shall not be counted under this subsection. Exceptions to this limitation may be granted. Employees on probationary status shall not be eligible to bid on posted positions.
76
Management may deny a bid which is submitted by an employee who is on limited duty status if it is determined that the duties of the posted position are in conflict with the work limitation(s) described by his/her physician.
M.	Nepotism
No bid shall be denied based solely on personal relationships. An employee may lose his/her right to hold and/or bid a position based on the department's nepotism policy in accordance with the following:
1.	If such bid or position creates a nepotistic situation, notice must be given to the Association.
2.	Representatives of the Association and the State shall meet and review the situation.
3.	Assignments not in conformance with this subsection shall be corrected by transfer or other appropriate action within ninety (90) days.
4.	Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the employee and/or the Association from filing a grievance.
N.	Meet and Discuss
Either party may request a meet and discuss regarding any problem or concern with the Post and Bid procedure. This request will be honored by the non-requesting party in the form of a meeting within thirty (30) days of the request.
O.	Administration
At each hospital or developmental center, management shall designate an official who shall be responsible for the administration of the Post and Bid provision. Upon request, the Post and Bid administrator shall meet periodically with CAPT representatives for the purpose of reviewing compliance with the Post and Bid provision. At the request of the CAPT chapter president or designee, the post and bid administrator shall provide information relative to a specific post and bid request.
Upon request, on a semi-annual basis, the post and bid administrator at each facility shall provide CAPT a report on the status of post and bid in Unit 18. This report shall include a month by month record of all post and bid and management discretion positions, identification of positions posted, bids received and awarded and positions that received no bid.

If no bids are received, management shall withdraw the bid notice and fill the vacant position by hiring, promotion, reinstatement or transfer from another facility.
D.	Denial of Bid
Employees must maintain an acceptable overall performance rating. An acceptable overall rating is defined as a rating of standard or better in all performance categories. For the initial implementation of this provision, the previous year's performance report will not be considered for the purposes of eligibility.
For the 12 calendar month preceding the initial implementation of this process, an employee who has an adverse personnel action which related to his/her job performance may be precluded from participation.
An employee may be removed from the posted position upon the effective date of an adverse action related to job performance.
78
Management may deny a bid which is submitted by an employee who is on limited duty status if it is determined that the duties of the posted position are in conflict with the work limitations described by his/her physician.

Duties which are appropriately assigned to incumbents in the employee's current classification are not out-of-class. Duties appropriately assigned are based on the definition and typical tasks enumerated in the California State Personnel Board specification.
Assignments that do not substantially change the overall nature of an employee's work assignment shall not be considered out-of-class work. Training and Development assignments are not out-of-class work.

b.	Cannot be feasibly met through use of other civil service or administrative alternatives.
2.	Departments may not use out-of-class assignments to avoid giving civil service examinations, or to avoid using existing eligible lists created as the result of a civil service examination.

Code Regs 599.673, 599.674 or 599.676 if appointed to the higher classification for the duration of the assignment not to exceed one year.
81
4.	Out-of-class work may be discontinued by departments at any time; however, departments may not rotate employees in and out of out-of-class assignments to avoid payment of out-of-class compensation.

C.	Out-of-Class Grievances and Allocation Appeals
1.	The grievance and arbitration procedure described in Subsection D below shall be the exclusive means by which alleged out-of-class assignments shall be remedied, including requests for review by the Department of Personnel Administration referenced in Government Code Section 19818.16 or the State Board of Control.
2.	The grievance and arbitration procedure described in Subsection D below shall be the exclusive means by which alleged position allocation or reallocation appeals shall be remedied, including those referenced in Government Code sections 19818.6 and 19818.20.
3.	Employees may not separately file out-of-class grievances and position allocation or reallocation grievances pertaining to the same duties and responsibilities.

I. Calculation of rates of pay
Example 1:	Position time base - full time. (Actual hours work variable. Hours scheduled by employer in accordance with school schedule and operational needs.) Position salary	$1,200 (salary x 1) Regular rate of pay	$ 6.92 ($1,200 divided by 173.33) Overtime rate	$10.38 ($6.92 x 1.5) Guaranteed weekly pay* $276.93 [($1200 x 12) divided by 52]
118
Example 2: Position time base - % time. (Actual hours worked variable. Hours scheduled by employer in accordance with school schedule and operational needs.)
Position salary
Regular rate of pay Overtime rate Guaranteed weekly pay*
$900 ($1200 x .75)
$ 6.92 [$900 divided by (173.33 x .75)]
$10.38 ($6.92 x 1.5)
$207.69 [($900 x 12) divided by 52]
*Paid bi-monthly depending on the job classification and payroll system.
II.
Overtime determination
Example 1	Full-time sponsorship with an anticipated 20 hour per week work schedule
Instance A Employee is scheduled and works 20 hours per week during pay period. Employee receives guaranteed monthly pay.
Instance B During one week, the employee works 20 regularly scheduled hours and an additional 8 hours due to operational needs. Employee receives guaranteed monthly pay. No additional compensation is warranted as 20 + 8 is less than 40.
Instance C During one week, the employee works 20 regularly scheduled hours and an additional 8 hours because of operational needs. During this same week, the employee also attended 17 hours of clinical lab time at the sponsoring facility. The employee receives the guaranteed monthly pay and an additional 5 hours of overtime pay. Overtime pay is required because 20 + 8 + 17 = 45 and the 5 hours over 40 are overtime hours.
Example 2	Three quarter (%) time sponsorship with a 20-hour scheduled
work week.
Instance A Employee is scheduled and works 20 hours per week during pay period. Employee receives the guaranteed monthly pay of a % time position.
Instance B During one week, the employee works 20 regularly scheduled hours and an additional 12 hours due to operational needs. Employee receives the guaranteed monthly pay and an additional 2 hours pay at the regular rate of pay. This additional 2 hours at the regular rate of pay is required because 20 + 12 = 32 which is less than 40 but 2 hours more than the 30 hours provided for in the % time agreement.
119
Instance C	During one week, the employee works 20 regularly scheduled hours and an additional 12 hours because of operational need. During this same week, the employee also attended 17 hours of clinical lab time at the sponsoring facility. The employee receives the guaranteed monthly pay, an additional 10 hours at the regular rate of pay, and 9 hours of overtime pay. The additional compensation is required because 20 + 12 + 17 = 49 hours which is 10 hours more than the 30 required by the % time position and an additional 9 over 40 requiring overtime compensation.
Instance D	During one week, the employee works 20 regularly scheduled hours and an additional 12 hours because of operational need. During this same week, the employee also attended 17 hours of clinical lab time at a training site other than the sponsoring facility. The employee receives the guaranteed monthly pay and an additional 2 hours at the regular rate of pay as in B above. This compensation is required because 20 + 12 = 32 which is 2 more hours than required by a % time position and clinical hours at sites other than the sponsoring facility are not included in the determination of when overtime is due.
