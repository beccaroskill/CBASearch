("Holdings"), excluding replacements as the result of death, disability or reaching of retirement age, or (ii) through making shareholder proposals or initiating proxy solicitations, directs Holdings' board and/or influences the operations of the Company (a "Change of Control Event"), then: (a) the Union shall have the right in its sole discretion to extend the duration of the Agreement for up to two (2) years from the date of the Change of Control Event; and (b) Holdings and the Company shall at Holdings' option either (i) issue to eligible employees represented by the IAM Clerical common shares of Holdings having an aggregate market value of $1,202,972 at the time of the Change of Control Event, or (ii) pay $1,202,972 in cash.

In the event that an "Adverse Transaction" occurs then, in addition to all other rights and remedies specified in the Agreement or otherwise available at law, the Union shall have the right in its sole discretion to (A) extend the duration of the Agreement for up to two (2) years past the Change of Control date, in the event of an Operational Reduction, or two (2) years past the Adverse Transaction date in the event of a Sale or Merger; and (B) obtain an agreement from the Company pursuant to which no active eligible employees (less the number of eligible employees on leave) who are on the seniority list on the date of the Adverse Transaction shall be furloughed from the date the Adverse Transaction through the amendable date, as it may be extended hereunder, except for furloughs that occur in the ordinary course for reasons such as but not limited to seasonality and aircraft placed out of service except as a result of the Adverse Transaction.

If Holdings elects to issue cash, it shall do so no later than eight (8) business days following the effective date of the Adverse Transaction. The stock or cash shall be allocated based on W-2 wages for the tax year immediately preceding the issuance of the stock. In the event of a Merger, the furlough protection provided in (B) herein shall only be required of the Company until such time as the seniority lists and collective bargaining agreements of the merged companies are combined, and the Company hereby agrees to make such operational integration of the two carriers a condition of such Merger. The Company agrees that it shall provide the Union with sufficiently detailed information regarding a prospective Adverse Transaction on which to make the determination described herein, on or before the later of (x) 30 days prior to the effective date of the proposed Adverse Transaction, or (y) as soon as legally practicable based on advise of counsel to Holdings.
Page 10
For purposes of this clause 3.7, any reference to the Company or Holdings shall be deemed to include any successor or parent entity of either the Company or Holdings; provided, however, in no event shall a single transfer or disposition of assets or equity securities of the Company, Holdings or any successor or predecessor of either the Company or Holdings trigger both a Change of Control Event and an Adverse Transaction for purposes of clause 3.7, whether or not coupled with a replacement of a majority of the directors of the Company or Holdings in connection with a Sale or Merger, as both are defined above.
3.8	In the event a petition under chapters 7 or 11 of the Bankruptcy Code concerning the Company filed, then the Company shall not file any application seeking rejection or modification of any agreement between the Company and the IAM pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 1113, including a request to implement interim changes in the Agreement pursuant to 11 U.S.C. Section 1113(e) before February 27, 2000.
3.9	It is agreed that should Corporate Governance terms regarding Employee Directors and the presence of an Employee Director on each significant Board Committee be continued for either the AFA or ALPA, then similar provisions will be agreed to for representation on the Board of Directors from the IAM. Any potential Director recommended by the IAM shall be subject to concurrence of the chair of the Board of Hawaiian Airlines.

Employees without telephone numbers listed for overtime calls will be charged with refusal when they would have been called. No charge will be made if the overtime is cancelled. However, if an employee is not advised of the opportunity to work at least one (1) hour prior to the contemplated start of non-emergency overtime, his overtime balance will not be charged should he refuse the work.

ARTICLE 9
SENIORITY
9.1	Definitions:
(a)	Company seniority shall be the date the employee filled a permanent full time position in the Company covered by the IAM Agreements. In the event two or more employees have identical company seniority, their seniority ranking will be determined first by date of hire and then by the last four digits of the Social Security Number (SSN), if their date of hire is after May 27, 1999. Company seniority will be utilized for purposes of vacation bidding.
(b)	Effective DOS Classification seniority shall be the day following the closing date of the bulletin for a permanent full time position. In the event two or more employees have identical classification seniority, their seniority ranking will be determined first by entry date into the division, if that is the same, by company seniority, then by the last four digits of their Social Security Number, if their date of hire is after May 27, 1999. Classification seniority is used for shift and days off bidding.
9.2	The classification to be recognized for seniority purposes are those listed in Article 4. Employees who have established seniority in any other classification will continue to accrue seniority in that classification and shall be able to return to that classification in the event of a reduction.
9.3	When an employee moves to a higher rated classification he shall continue to accrue seniority in the lower rated classification. If he voluntarily moves to a lower rated classification he will lose seniority in the higher rated classification.
9.4	The employees covered by this Agreement possessing the qualifications and the greater company seniority as defined in clause 9.1.a shall receive preference in all matters regarding choice of work units, transfers, promotions, and reemployment. It is understood that "qualified" shall mean meeting the qualifications as outlined in Article 5 as well as having the basic ability to perform the work required for the job and not "best qualified." In the case of layoffs, demotions, or voluntary step-backs, the affected employees and any other employees they displace will have five (5) calendar days from receipt of notice to bump into any classification, unit, shift, or days off (in that order) in accordance with classification seniority and ability to perform the work. Employees who fail to meet the performance requirements of the jobs they bump into and are found unqualified within the sixty (60) day trial period shall have the right to bump again.
Page 49
9.5	An employee who has once exercised his classification seniority rights in the choice of a shift or days off within a shift may not thereafter exercise his seniority rights to displace a junior employee from a shift or days off to which the junior employee is already assigned.
9.6	Employees leaving positions covered by this agreement to accept noncontract non-management permanent positions with the Company will continue to accrue seniority for six (6) months and thereafter retain such accrued seniority provided they continue to submit the applicable dues to the union. Such employees can only voluntarily return to the bargaining unit if there is a vacancy. However, in the event of RIF (Reduction in Force) or involuntary removal from a non-contract nonmanagement position, the employee can displace back into the bargaining unit providing he meets the qualifications. The names of such employees shall appear on the seniority lists.
9.7	When an employee accepts a promoted position in the Company that is outside the scope of this Agreement and not covered by another Agreement, the employee shall continue to accrue seniority for six (6) calendar months and thereafter will retain accrued seniority provided they pay Union Dues on a monthly basis. An employee assigned to a supervisory position will retain seniority accrued to January 1, 1971 but will not accrue further seniority while continuing in such supervisory position. Following DOS employees who accept a temporary or permanent position in the Company that is outside the scope of this Agreement will, after six (6) months lose their accrued seniority on a day for day basis. Such employees can only voluntarily return to the bargaining unit if there is a vacancy. This clause is inapplicable in the first six (6) months outside the scope of this Agreement and in the event of RIF or removal from a supervisory position by management. The name of such employee shall be carried on the seniority lists as provided for in Clause 9.10. Promoted means a position that pays more than the highest classification in that work unit. Employees accepting a position that pays less than the highest classification in that work unit will lose all their seniority and have their names removed from the seniority list.
9.8	When the employee accepts a position in the Company that is in another bargaining unit, the employee shall continue to accrue seniority for the length of their probationary period in the other collective bargaining agreement. To continue to accrue or retain seniority such employee must pay union dues on a monthly basis. During this period the employee may displace into the bargaining unit providing he has the classification seniority and meets the qualifications. At the end of the probationary period the employee loses all seniority in this bargaining unit.
9.9	An employee accepting a management position involving instructional duties directly related to members of the IAM
Page 50
shall continue to accrue seniority for five (5) years and thereafter retain seniority. To continue to accrue and retain seniority the employee must continue to pay union dues on a monthly basis.
9.10	Employees new to the bargaining unit shall be regarded as probationary employees for the first ninety (90) calendar days of their employment and may be discharged at any time during said probationary period without hearing. With the exception of days off and holidays, an employee who spends any part of the ninety (90) probationary days away from work, (e.g., sick leave, vacation, leave of absence and occupational illness or injury leave) shall have his probationary period automatically extended until such time that he completes his ninety (90) calendar days. If retained in the service of the Company after the probationary period, the names of such employees shall then be placed on the seniority list for their respective classifications.
9.11	Copies of a seniority list by classifications showing the name, job classification, classification seniority date, adjusted classification seniority date, divisional and Company seniority dates shall be posted in a convenient place within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this Agreement. A copy of such list will be furnished to the System General Chairman and to the Chairman of the Local Committee. The seniority dates shall, when necessary, be set ahead to adjust for any periods during which the seniority accrual has been suspended, as provided for in Clauses 9.6, 9.10 and 11.1. The seniority list shall be amended each October 1 and April 1 to incorporate changes and additions and shall be subject to correction upon protest of any omission or incorrect listing if a complaint is filed under the procedures of Article 15 within thirty (30) days of delivery of the list to the Union. If no such protest is filed within thirty (30) days from the time the first list is posted and delivered to the designated Union representative or within thirty (30) days from the date an employee's name first appears on a list posted and given to the Union representative, the dates on each list shall be presumed beyond question to be correct and no protest, grievance, suit or other means shall thereafter be commenced or entertained to change said date for any employee.
9.12	An employee covered by this Agreement shall lose his seniority status and his name shall be removed from the seniority list under the following conditions:
(a)	He resigns from the Company.
(b)	He resigns from a classification or voluntarily steps down to accept a lower classified or part-time job for which he is the successful bidder.
(c)	He is displaced and refuses to exercise his seniority right to bump laterally into another job for which he is qualified.
Page 51
(d)	He refuses recall to a higher classified job of more than sixty (60) days anticipated duration for which he is qualified.
Under the circumstances listed in Clause 9.12 b, c, d, it is understood that he will lose only such seniority he has earned in the classification from which he resigned, stepped down, was displaced, or refused recall; provided, he shall not lose this seniority if he must change his domicile in order to bump or accept recall. This will not restrict him from bidding on future vacancies in any classification.
(e)	He is discharged for cause.
(f)	He is absent from work for two (2) consecutive work days without properly notifying the Company of the reason for his absence and not then if a satisfactory reason is given for not so notifying the Company.
(g)	He does not inform the Company in writing, by email, or by fax of his intention to return to service within ten (10) days of sending out notice offering him re-employment.
(h)	He does not return to the service of the Company on or before a date specified in the notice from the Company offering him reemployment, which date shall not be prior to fifteen (15) days after sending such notice; provided, however, that the offer is for a position anticipated to last sixty (60) or more consecutive days
(i)	He is not recalled after having been laid off from the Company for a continuous period of five (5) years. The five (5) years shall be considered broken only if an employee is recalled for a period of sixty (60) or more consecutive days.
NOTE:	Employees who held classification seniority
prior to October 1, 2001, will continue to accrue such seniority. Should they wish to bid or displace into the classification they are required to meet the qualifications. If the work in the employee's previous classification has changed the employee, provided he meets the qualifications, will be given sixty (60) days to demonstrate his ability to perform such work.
9.13	All notices required to be sent under Clause 9.12 shall be hand delivered (the appropriate time period shall commence at the time and on the day the employee receives and signs for it), sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by email or by fax to the employee at the last address filed by him with the Personnel Office; provided, however, that there shall be no duty on the part of the
Page 52
Company to send a notice to the laid-off employee unless said employee shall, when laid off, file his address with the Personnel Office of the Company and shall thereafter promptly advise the Personnel Office of any change in address.
9.14	When it becomes necessary to lay off employees because of a reduction in force, the employees to be laid off shall be given five (5) work days notice or shall be paid at the rate of eight (8) straight time hours per day in lieu thereof. Affected employees whose seniority rights entitle them to continued employment shall assert such rights within five (5) calendar days from receipt of notice of layoff.
9.15	All orders or notices to an employee covered by this Agreement involving a transfer, promotion, step-back, or layoff shall be given in writing.
9.16	Employees who have given long and faithful service in the employ of the Company and who have become unable to handle their normal assignments will be given preference for such other available work as they are able to handle within their classification at the rate of pay for the job to which they are assigned.

10.2	All vacancies of more than sixty (60) days anticipated duration, including those caused by the temporary absence of an employee, shall be posted. Employees filling temporary vacancies of sixty (60) days or less shall be returned to their former assignment and status at the conclusion of the temporary vacancy. While in the temporary position the employee does not accrue classification seniority if it is different than his regular classification. Employees filling temporary vacancies can bid on permanent vacancies. Employees filling temporary vacancies anticipated to exceed sixty (60) days will, if they are in the vacancy for greater than sixty (60) days exercise their bumping rights under this agreement on the return of the regular incumbent. Vacancies anticipated to be sixty (60) days or less will be filled by seniority on the shift, or work unit if no volunteers from the shift.
10.3	All permanent positions will be first filled (by a mutually agreed system between the Local Committee and management) within the work unit where the vacancy has occurred to allow employees within the work unit an opportunity to change their shift and/or days off. The resulting vacancy will then be posted at all work locations at which there are employees represented by the IAM. An employee awarded a position of a non-promotional nature in another department or work unit may be required to remain in the position for twelve (12) months. Employees shall retain their right to bid at any time on shift preferences or preferences for days off within the shift except for absences of less than five (5) days which will be filled by temporary upgrading of an employee within the work location based on classification seniority.

Page 56
over Company routes only on a strictly space available basis if such goods and car are delivered at the employee's expense to the Company's nearest freight facility. If no space is available to ship employee property within thirty (30) days from receipt, the employee must either arrange other means of transporting his goods, or may ship via Hawaiian at fifty percent (50%) of the going tariff. The employee, upon his request, will be allowed time off for a reasonable period without pay between the time he is relieved of his duties at his previous location and the time he is required to report at the new location, the length of such period to be established in advance.

| 22.9 PENSION PLAN
The Company will provide, at no cost to the employee, a fully paid pension plan (see Retirement Letter of Understanding included in the Agreement ). Effective January 1985 employees must have reached 21 years of age and been employed full-time for one (1) year in order to be eligible for this program. Effective July 1, 1981, employees who reached 23 years of age and have one (1) year of full-time service with the Company were eligible to participate in the Company's retirement program. Those employees whose eligibility did not start until age 25 and who had one (1) year of service with the Company at age 23 were given credit for two (2) additional years of service effective July 1, 1981.
The Company will provide all eligible employees retiring after January 16, 1987 a retirement program as follows:
(a)	Normal Retirement (age 65)
1.6% of Final Average Pay multiplied by years of Credited Service. (Average of best 5 consecutive years earnings out of last 10 years worked)
(b)	Early Retirement (Less than 30 Years Employment) -Minimum Age 55
1.6% of Final Average Pay multiplied by years of Credited Service actuarially reduced for each year under age 65
(c)	Early Retirement (30 Years or More of Employment)
Rule of 85
Retirement Age:	55	56	57	58	59
Percentage:	60	62	1/2	65	67	1/2	70
Rule of 90
If an employee is 60 years old or over and has been employed by Hawaiian Airlines for 30 years, he will be able to retire at 1.6% of his Final Average Pay multiplied
Page 102
by years of Credited Service without any actuarial reduction for years under age 65.
EXAMPLE:	John Jones is 60 and has worked 30
years for Hawaiian Airlines. He was 30 years old when first employed. During his first year with the Company, he was not eligible to join the Plan. At age 31 he had 1 year of service and joined the Plan. At age 60, he had 29 years of Credited Service. His best 5 year average annual straight time earnings during his last 10 years of employment was $30,000. His yearly retirement income with no reductions will be:
1.6% x $30,000 x 29 years = $13,920.00, or $1,160.00 per month
It is further understood and agreed that as of January 1, 1973 the Variable Annuity Plan for employees administered by the Bishop Trust Company has been discontinued and all future retirement payments will be based on the Fixed Annuity payments outlined above. However, contributions made to the Variable Fund by employees prior to January 1, 1971 plus interest will always be payable to them or their heirs should the employee resign or die.
In addition, employees who either failed to join or dropped out of the retirement plans prior to January 1, 1971 will be given credit for past service to the dates they first could have become eligible (age 25 and 3 years of service; effective July 1, 1981, age 23 and 1 year of service) for purposes of calculating their benefit at retirement, consistent with Company practice supported by that arbitration decision of April 4, 1983. Employees who contributed their own funds prior to January 1, 1971 will receive credit for such contributions plus interest thereon through December 31, 1974, and will receive an additional monthly retirement benefit for such contributions over and above the Company paid plan, or may elect to receive his contributions in one lump sum cash payment.
Effective October 1, 1993, the pay and service levels in the above defined benefit plan will be frozen. Participants' benefits from the plan will be calculated based on pay and years of credited service through October 1, 1993, but will not include any pay and credited service after that date. Union members of the Pension Committee will be given reasonable time during working hours to confer with the Company on pension matters.

After three (3) months on furlough, an eligible employee and his dependants may continue in the Company's medical and/or dental plans at his own expense until recalled, or for so long as he remains on the Company's seniority list, or until obtaining full-time employment elsewhere, whichever event coverage occurs first, but in no event longer than two (2) years from his date of furlough.

His yearly retirement income with no reductions will be:
1.6% x $30,000 x 29 years = $13,920.00, or $1,160.00 per month
It is further understood and agreed that as of January 1, 1973 the Variable Annuity Plan for employees administered by the Bishop Trust Company has been discontinued and all future retirement payments will be based on the Fixed Annuity payments outlined above. However, contributions made to the Variable Fund by employees prior to January 1, 1971 plus interest will always be payable to them or their heirs should the employee resign or die.

In addition, employees who either failed to join or dropped out of the retirement plans prior to January 1, 1971 will be given credit for past service to the dates they first could have become eligible (age 25 and 3 years of service; effective July 1, 1981, age 23 and 1 year of service) for purposes of calculating their benefit at retirement, consistent with Company practice supported by that arbitration decision of April 4, 1983. Employees who contributed their own funds prior to January 1, 1971 will receive credit for such contributions plus interest thereon through December 31, 1974, and will receive an additional monthly retirement benefit for such contributions over and above the Company paid plan, or may elect to receive his contributions in one lump sum cash payment.
Effective October 1, 1993, the pay and service levels in the above defined benefit plan will be frozen. Participants' benefits from the plan will be calculated based on pay and years of credited service through October 1, 1993, but will not include any pay and credited service after that date. Union members of the Pension Committee will be given reasonable time during working hours to confer with the Company on pension matters.

Dear Mr. Kauhane:
Re: Training Courses
During negotiations for Plan B restructuring the following was agreed:
When a prerequisite is required for a position, an employee will not be disqualified when that particular course(s) is not available. When courses are available, whether offered internally or through outside resources, it is the responsibility of the employee to seek out these opportunities in order to progress within the bargaining unit. Employees are urged to submit their career goals to their supervisor in writing to ensure required training and options are identified. If the course or training is not available through the Training and Learning Center, the supervisor should determine if the course is offered through other sources such as a Community College, Adult Education, Computer Based Learning. If so available, the Company will reimburse the cost of tuition and mandatory books for such courses subject to the following:
A.	The employee must receive written approval from the Department Manager prior to taking the course if the employee is requesting that the Company pay for the expenses.
B.	On successful completion of a course for which reimbursement is requested, the employee must provide official evidence of successful completion as well as receipts for tuition and books.
C.	If the employee wishes to have their record reflect successful completion of a course they must provide the Company with an official transcript which will be placed in the Personnel file.

To address this seniority issue, we will establish the following:
Bidding of Shifts and Days Off
There will be five (5) levels of Honolulu IAM Clerical Positions (excluding Ramp) for the purpose of bidding shifts and days off:
Full-Time Employees:
Level 1: Protected/Non-Protected Employees who have established applicable Classification Seniority as of June 12, 2006
Level 2: Protected Employees who do not hold applicable Classification Seniority as of June 12, 2006
Level 3: Future Non-Protected Employees awarded a FT Honolulu applicable position
Part-Time Employees:
Level 4: Honolulu IAM Clerical Employees prior to June 12, 2006
Level 5: Protected/Non-Protected Employees awarded a PT HNL IAM applicable position after June 12, 2006
For the Purpose of Selection and awarding of shifts and days-off, shifts/days-off will be awarded in the following order and by the following criteria:
Page 175
Full-Time Employees:
Level 1:	Applicable Classification Seniority If identical, then by Company Seniority If that is identical, then by Date of Hire If that is identical, then by last four digits of the SSN#*
Level 2:	IAM Clerical Company Seniority If identical, then by Date of Hire If that is identical, then by last four digits of SSN#*
Level 3:	IAM Applicable Classification Seniority If identical, then by Company Seniority If that is identical then by Date of Hire If that is identical, then by last four digits of SSN#*
Part-Time Employees:
Level 4:	Date of Entry If identical, then by Date of Hire If that is identical, then by last four digits of SSN#*
Level 5:	Date of Hire If identical, then by last four digits of SSN#*
* SSN# for employees with a dare of hire after May 27, 1999 (Article 9.1.b)
This system will protect current IAM Clerical employees and will allow all protected FT employees to move to Honolulu station at any time and once there, exercise their years of service.
Vacation Bidding
All FT IAM Clerical employees will bid for vacation and be awarded based on their company seniority date and PT IAM Clerical will bid for vacation and be awarded based on Date of Hire, as outlined in the CBA.

RE: Letter of Understanding - Temporary Utilization of Honolulu Customer Service Agents/Chief Agents
Dear Mr. Kauhane:
The Company and the Union are committed to finding meaningful work opportunities for the agents and Chief agents at Honolulu's customer service department. With the transition of employees from the "outsourced departments", we find that there are challenges in finding meaningful work for all employees.
Therefore, the undersigned parties agree as follows:
A.	The Company can temporarily assign protected and unprotected Honolulu Station Customer Service Agents/Chief Agents to other positions within the Company as long as that position is not already within the job scope of the IAM or another union.
B.	The temporary assignment will be on a voluntary basis and for a period not to exceed 6 months. Selection for such assignments will be by Company seniority. The length of assignment may be amended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
C.	The Union agrees that it cannot use the new work performed by its union member as a basis to claim such work as within the scope of the Agreement.
D.	It is agreed that the temporary assignment may be outside the already established shift/day-off of the employee.
E.	The employee will be paid at the same rate of pay whenever filling such temporary assignment. In addition, seniority and/or "protection" status will be unaffected while in such assignment.
F.	While working in such temporary assignments, employees may trade only with employees who are also filling such temporary assignments.

Mr. Randy Kauhane
Assistant General Chairman
Honolulu, HI 96819
Dear Randy:
The Company has agreed to amend its travel policy for IAM employees while on sick leave, FMLA, HFFL, Military Leave or occupational injury.
When this employee is on such leave, their Eligible Family members and FTP passengers will be eligible for Pass Travel.
Pass travel as it pertains to the employee has the following changes:
1.	When an employee is absent from work due to one's own illness (sick leave or FMLA), the employee will be granted Pass Travel on HA only when traveling to a specialist's office in connection with the employee's leave. Approval must be granted prior to the travel.
2.	When an employee is absent from work due to care of a family member (FMLA or HFLL), that employee will continue to be eligible for travel privileges if that travel is necessary to care for that family member. It is the responsibility of the employee to maintain communications with his manager and/or human resources during these circumstances. Approval must be granted prior to the travel.
3.	When the employee is absent from work due to an occupational injury, travel requests will be reviewed and granted on a case by case basis. The employee must present to the Company a doctors note that states that such travel will not aggravate the employee's condition.
4.	When an employee is absent from work due to Military Leave, his/ her travel privileges will continue as if s/he were actively employed. The employee will be required to continue to follow the company's policy of not sharing his password and access to ID90 with others. When s/he is unable to access ID90, he or the person traveling under his pass travel privileges is required to contact Hawaiian's Pass Bureau (Jody Borges for assistance.
If there are any questions, please contact me.
Sincerely,
/s/

LETTER OF AGREEMENT
PERFORMANCE BONUS AND PROFIT BONUS PROGRAMS
Incentive Compensation Program
The IAM-C will participate in the Incentive Compensation Program established by the Board of Directors for senior management, with a target payout bonus of one percent (1%) of W-2 wages. The same numerical calculations established by the Board that determines the Company's performance will be applied to the IAM-C, resulting in a potential payment range of zero percent (0%) to two percent (2%) of the previous year's W-2 wages. Payment from the Incentive Compensation Program will be paid at the same time and in the same manner as applied to senior management. The distribution amount will be prorated based on months of participation.
Performance Bonus
Each year, the Company will establish performance goals for on-time performance, safety, etc. Based on the yearly goals, quarterly goals will be set. These performance goals will be discussed with all unions and brought to the attention of all employees. For each quarter that the performance goals are met, each active full-time employee will receive a bonus of $150, a potential total of $600 per year, and each active part-time employee will be eligible for a quarterly bonus of $75 per quarter, a potential total of $300 per year. Any bonus payments will be reduced by applicable taxes and pre-tax deferral deductions. If goals are not met, no performance bonus will be paid for that quarter. Performance bonus payments will be paid regardless of company profitability. Should the Performance Bonus payments be increased for any other group, such increase shall not result in a decrease to IAM-C's share of any Profit Bonus.
Profit Bonus
The total potential profit bonus will be 5% of annual pretax profits (excluding extraordinary items and charges) from the first dollar of profit. Before being allocated among employee groups, the total potential profit bonus will be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the performance bonuses and any special bonuses paid for the year. The Company may, at its discretion, pay the profit bonus on a quarterly, rather than an annual basis. Should any other group(s) be provided a different Profit Bonus formula, such group(s) will be separated into a different Profit Bonus plan so as not to negatively impact the IAM-C's share of the plan.
The net profit bonus will first be divided among all employee groups (ALPA, AFA, IAM, TWU, non-represented, etc.) on the basis of each group's pro rata share of W-2 wages for the year. The pro rata share of any non-participating employee group will not be paid out to any group. Within each participating group, the bonus will then be allocated based on regular W-2 wages (as defined below) of each
Page 197
eligible member of the group, or another basis if that is agreed upon. Profit bonuses paid will be less applicable taxes and pre-tax deferral deductions. The Company would have discretion to set a minimum amount payable to any individual.
Example
If Hawaiian's 2009 pre-tax profit were $40 million the total potential bonus payment would be $2 million. If the Performance Bonuses paid out for the year totaled $600 thousand, then up to $1.4 million would be allocated among employee groups and individual employees in the manner described above.
General Provisions
Eligible employees are defined as active employees during the applicable period with accumulated W-2 wages in excess of $500 per quarter unless, before the time of payout, they were involuntarily terminated or voluntarily resigned. The profit Performance Bonus and Profit Bonus plans would apply to all employees meeting these criteria, except corporate officers. The above criteria would also apply to all employees and corporate officers in the Incentive Compensation Program.
For purposes of the plans, W-2 wages shall mean regular earnings as reported in Box 5 including employee pre-tax deferrals (e.g. 401(k) employee contributions) on previous year's IRS Form W-2 and exclude bonuses, vacation payoffs, insurance, layoff severance and other similar non-regular earnings even if otherwise reported in Box 5 on Form W-2.
Payments described herein will not be treated as covered compensation for 401(k) or pension plan purposes.
Participation in the Profit Bonus and the Incentive Compensation programs shall start as of the effective date of the amended CBA and shall continue until the CBA becomes amendable. If the CBA starts or becomes amendable during a year, the amount of the Profit Bonus to the group using the formulas described above will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of whole months in the year through the amendable dated and the denominator of which is 12. The resulting amount will then be distributed among members of the group based on the allocation rules described above.
Participation in the programs described herein shall continue through December 31, 2013 (i.e. final payouts in 2014). While any of these may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, it is expressly agreed that notwithstanding the status quo provisions of the Railway Labor Act, this Agreement shall have no force or effect beyond the dates stated herein.

RE:	Letter of Clarification of Weight and Balance Classification
Dear Randy:
In the 2010 contract negotiations, a new job classification of Weight and Balance was created. The hourly rate of pay for this new classification was established as Group 3. As of this date, this classification shall be known as Weight and Balance Coordinator.
When negotiated, we never discussed the requirement of a Chief in this Weight and Balance classification. We placed this new classification into a group that is higher skilled with greater responsibility, and higher pay rates. Group 3 includes chiefs and classifications that do not require chief oversight (i.e. assistant crew scheduler, lead printer).
The Company and Union agreed that there is no requirement in Weight and Balance for a supervisory (i.e. Chief) position. However, a position was created to cover this job duties such as training and oversight, and that position was given a Group 2 rate of pay.
The Company and Union further agree that there are no requirements that Group 2 Weight and Balance classification is staffed on every shift or on duty at all times of operation, nor is it subject to the Chief/agent ration. In addition, although the pay rates and duties may differ, they will be treated as one group in terms of trades, shift and day off bidding as well as vacation bidding.
I trust this represents our understanding.
Sincerely

APPENDIX B
SEVEN STEPS FOR JUST CAUSE
Following are the steps which arbitrators will consider when determining if there was just cause for disciplinary action.
1.	Adequate notice: Did the Company give to the employee forewarning or foreknowledge of the possible or probable disciplinary consequences of the employee's conduct?
2.	Reasonable rules: Was the Company's rule or managerial order reasonably related to the orderly, efficient, and safe operation of the Company's business?
3.	Fair investigation: Did the company, before administering discipline to an employee, make an effort to discover whether the employee did in fact violate or disobey a rule or order of management?
4.	Opportunity to respond: Was the Company's investigation conducted fairly and objectively?
5.	Substantial proof: At the investigation did the judge obtain substantial evidence or proof that the employee was guilty as charged?
6.	Equal treatment: Has the Company applied its rules, orders, and penalties evenhandedly and without discrimination to all employees?
7.	Appropriate penalty: Was the degree of discipline administered by the company in a particular case reasonably related to (a) the seriousness of the employee's proven offense and (b) the record of the employee in his service with the company?
