2.	The provisions of this Section C shall apply to vacancies occurring in classifications listed in Exhibit “C” and in Exhibit “E” in accordance with seniority provisions of the Agreement.
In determining what constitutes sufficient ability and qualifications to meet the standards of the job under Exhibit “C" and Exhibit “E” bidding, due consideration will be given to: (1) the quality of the employee’s performance on his current job; (2) his background of education and experience in similar or related work; (3) the amount of special preparation for the new job, if any is necessary, which the employee has completed at the time the selection is made; and (4) leadership qualifications and ability to progress.

Article VII
a.	Such employees shall be subject to direct layoff by classification and working location.
b.	An employee who is declared surplus and who is subject to direct layoff shall be entitled to displace the least senior employee or fill a vacancy in a similar or lower level classification at his established working base or another working base within his working unit as defined in Article VILB. Such employees shall not be permitted to bump into other working units.
c.	In order to displace a less senior employee in his working unit, an employee must be qualified by previously holding the position or by passing a standard job knowledge or aptitude test and is otherwise qualified to perform the duties of the classification.
d.	The bumping process shall be expedited so that the necessary rounds of bumping, if any, can be completed within a maximum of thirty (30) calendar days. Employees shall be afforded the opportunity to take qualifying job knowledge and aptitude tests during this period.
e.	During a reduction in forces, affected employees who have exhausted their seniority rights for a full-time position, may fill a part-time Meter Reader vacancy or displace a part-time Meter Reader via the bump choice sheet. If converted to part-time Meter Reader, such employees will have recall rights, but no severance benefits, and if the employee subsequently terminates voluntarily, they will retain recall rights. The Company will determine which part-time Meter Reader is displaced at any requested location. Employees converted to part-time Meter Reader may not be displaced by another full-time employee. Employees working in part-time Meter Reader positions will be placed in the wage step closest to, but not greater than, their current rate of pay and will

Article VII
be subject to the same working conditions as part-time Meter Readers.
f.	In any event, employees who are declared surplus, who do not have sufficient seniority or qualifications to exercise their seniority rights as stated in this Section E.1and/or have not transferred to a vacancy outside their working unit within thirty (30) calendar days after the implementation of the force reduction shall be laid off.
g.	Recall of such employees shall be in accordance with Article VII, Section F, except that employees laid off under this Section E.1. would be permitted to decline jobs outside their former work ing unit without forfeiting their rights under Article VII, Sections F & G.
h.	When the number of positions identified as surplus is the greater of either ten (10) positions or 3% of all of the bargaining unit employees, in the working unit, then these provisions of Article VII.E.1. shall apply.
i.	For the purposes of this Article VII.E.1Customer Service geographical divisions shall be considered separate working units.
j.	Apprentices who are subject to displacement, will be treated in the same manner as set forth in Article VII.E.2.C.
k.	No position will be filled by promoiion or transfer during a reduction of forces so long as there are surplus employees at the same or higher level with qualifications and seniority sufficient to fill such position.

employees with the least Company seniority in that classification at that base will be declared surplus. Employees declared surplus and those subsequently displaced, shall be entitled to displace the least senior employee or fill a vacancy in a similar or lower level classification at his established working base or another working base in the working unit provided he has Company seniority over the least senior employee in the classification at the designated working base and is qualified by previously holding the classification or by passing a standard job knowledge or aptitude test and is otherwise qualified to perform the duties of the classification. All entry-level classifications shall be considered to be similar for the purpose of displacements under this provision.
b.	If a surplus or displaced employee does not have sufficient Company seniority and/or qualifications to displace an employee then occupying a similar or lower level classification within the employee’s working unit, he shall be entitled to displace the least senior employee or fill a vacancy in an entry-level classification at an established working base in any other working unit provided he has Company seniority over the least senior employee in the classification at the designated working base and is qualified by previously holding the classification or by passing a standard job knowledge or aptitude test and is otherwise qualified for the position.
c.	At the time of a reduction of forces at a working base, each journeyman classification as set forth in Exhibit D and the related 7th, 6th, and 5th step apprentices will be considered as one journeyman classification for the purpose of the reduction.

(2)(a) In the event a job vacancy occurs for which there are no qualified job bidders or transfers, any employee currently “red circled" in the vacant classification who was reduced from a work base within a 35-mile radius* of the vacant position may be offered assignment to the vacancy. Such employees will be offered the vacant position based on working unit seniority, beginning with the junior employee.
(b)	In the event a “red circled” employee is reduced to another working unit, the employee must file a valid transfer request back to his/her “pre-force reduction” working unit for all vacancies in his/her original job classification within a 35-mile radius* of the employee’s “pre-force reduction" work location.
(c)	If a “red circled" employee fails to accept the first job vacancy properly offered under j.(2)(a) or (b) above, the employee will assume the rate of pay of the current job classification.

I.	During a reduction in forces, affected employees who have exhausted their seniority rights for a full-time position, may fill a part-time Meter Reader vacancy or displace a part-time Meter Reader via the bump choice sheet. If converted to part-time Meter Reader, such employees will have recall rights, but no severance benefits, and if the employee subsequently terminates voluntarily, they will retain recall rights. The Company will determine which part-time Meter Reader is displaced at any requested location. Employees converted to part-time Meter Reader may not be displaced by another full-time employee. Employees working in part-time Meter Reader positions will be placed in the wage step closest to, but not greater than, their current rate of pay and will be subject to the same working conditions as part-time Meter Readers.

F. Reemployment shall be in reverse order of layoff, i.e., the last employee laid off shall be the first reemployed. The Company shall notify former employees who were laid off in writing by registered mail addressed to the last address of record to report back to work when jobs are available. If such a former employee does not report within ten (10) days (Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays excluded) after the sending of such notice, he shall lose his seniority, except that if the failure to so report is due to
16
Article VII
Rev. 2006
Article VII
substantiated illness, injury, or some cause beyond his control, the former employee shall be put back to work when he is able to report, provided he notifies the Company within such ten (10) day period the approximate date when he will be able to return and there is on such date an available job for which he is eligible by reason of qualifications and seniority.
It is the responsibility of the employee to see that the Company is advised of his current mailing address.
All former employees so reemployed must pass a physical examination and upon reemployment shall receive the prevailing rate of pay for the classification in which they are reemployed.
G. Except as otherwise provided herein, seniority shall be lost if an employee: (1) quits; (2) is discharged for cause; (3) fails to return to work within ten (10) days after being notified to report for work, except when such failure is due to substantiated illness, injury, or similar cause beyond his control and he has so notified the Company within the ten (10) day period; or (4) is laid off for more than twenty-four (24) consecutive months. However, if his seniority exceeds five (5) years, he shall not lose his seniority until he has been laid off for more than a continuous period of thirty-six (36) months. Seniority shall not accumulate during any such layoff.
H.	Company and working unit seniority shall accumulate for New Normal and Regular Employees during any absence due to illness or injury, so long as the employee continues to receive Comprehensive Disability Plan benefits, and the employee shall be returned, if qualified, to his former job or to a similar position at the then current rate.
I.	Employees who are transferred to supervisory or non-supervisory positions outside of the bargaining
Rev. 2006
Article VII

1.	In the working location where they are employed; or
2.	In any other location within the working unit, provided there is a job vacancy.
Such transfers shall be with accumulated seniority and all the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall apply while they are assigned to any job classification in the bargaining unit. Such transfers into the bargaining unit will be effected without the necessity of posting job vacancies. A job award, however, will be posted at the time the assignment is made.
For purposes of a reduction in forces, employees who have been outside of the bargaining unit for two (2) years or more and who are returned to the bargaining unit under this provision may not use Company seniority accrued while outside of the bargaining unit for a period of two (2) years.
J. Employees who are transferred to temporary positions outside of the working unit shall accumulate working unit seniority in their regular working unit while occupying such temporary positions. In the event any of the aforementioned employees are returned to classifications within the working unit, they shall be assigned, if qualified, the classification in the working unit they formerly held, with their accumulated seniority; and all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall apply to them while they are assigned to any job classification in the working unit.

Rev. 2006
Article IX
by an interruption of continuous work time of six (6) hours or less. (Any break in continuous work time of more than six (6) hours will be considered to be an interruption of continuous work time.)
Under the provisions of this Section G.2., the employees may be sent home for a specified break (it is understood that employees on any such break may be called back to work) and shall not lose any normal time pay for the regular time which they are required to lose by reason of such break. Meal periods will not be considered as an interruption of continuous work time and will not be considered as work time except when paid for by the Company.

3.	Employees who work on a job during the first day off of a days-off period and who are notified white at work on such a job to report back for work on the second day off, shall be paid at the doubles time rate for such time worked on this second day off. Such assignments, however, are not considered call outs and travel time provisions pertaining to a call out are not applicable, but the meal provisions for call outs will apply.
4.	Employees who work during a non-workdays period (starting at the end of their regular work hours prior to their first day off and continuing until the start of their regular work hours on their first day back) shall receive the double time rate of pay for time worked in excess of eight (8) hours. The double time rate shall remain in effect for all hours worked during the remainder of the days off period, except that, for prearranged overtime work on a subsequent: day off, the rate of time and one-half will apply if such work is preceded by a minimum of twelve (12) hours off.
Rev. 2006

Article IX
5.	The double time rate is the maximum which may be received under these provisions, even though there may be two or more bases for applying the double time rate.
H.	Employees reporting for work on normal scheduled working days will not have pay deducted because of weather conditions when the Superintendent directs that no field work be undertaken. However, it is understood that such employees may be held at headquarters pending trouble calls, or may be employed in other miscellaneous work at headquarters.
The provisions of this Section shall apply only on the employee’s regular scheduled work days, except that in those divisions and areas where the extended work week is temporarily in effect, the provisions of this Section shall also apply on the sixth (6th) day.
Seasonal or casual employees on an hourly or daily basis, ordered to report for work, will be credited with at least two (2) hours pay if weather conditions are so unfavorable that the Superintendent directs no work be attempted. Two (2) hours at overtime rates shall apply on non-work days.
I.	Overtime shall be divided as equally as practicable among those qualified and available for the work in each classification. Employees shall not be required to take equivalent time off during any regular scheduled work week to compensate for overtime previously worked or to be worked within that work week. Overtime records will be maintained in two separate categories, via., emergency (call out) or planned (prearranged) work, except in the case of “shift employees” where only one list will be maintained and in those Departments, Divisions or districts where the parties agree that one list will be used. In districts where the use of one list is

Article IX
Rev. 2006
Article IX
determined by a vote of the majority of employees, such employees shall have the option to re-vote annually if they so choose. Overtime totals will be carried on a cumulative or “evergreen” basis and records shall be readily available.
When an available and qualified employee is not assigned an overtime assignment Io which he is entitled by the provisions of the Agreement, the employee will be reimbursed for the overtime compensation loss he suffered if the overtime was improperly assigned to an employee in another classification or to an employee from another Evergreen overtime list (excluding planned versus emergency lists) thereby making it impossible for the normal application of the Evergreen provisions to provide future opportunities for the employee to make up the overtime lost.
Additional reference Appendix i and ii
J.	When conditions of the work require, employees may be temporarily assigned to or employed for work on shifts other than their normal shifts for a particular job at straight time rates for eight (8) hour periods other than specified, provided the assignment shall continue for at least eight (8) consecutive days. Special shifts for a shorter period than eight (8) consecutive days shall be subject to the overtime rules. For employees under such conditions, eight (8) consecutive hours shall constitute a regular day’s work, their meals to be eaten on Company time. No work shall be performed under these conditions which can reasonably be done during regular working hours with due regard for the requirement of public service.

F.	When an employee is permanently transferred from one established headquarters to another the following procedure will be followed with regard to moving expenses:
1.	In the event the aforementioned transfer results in a promotion as a result of the application of the seniority provisions of this Agreement, the employee will pay moving expense up to and including fifty dollars ($50.00).

The Company will pay the cost of any necessary wiring for electric range and water heater installations, and when necessary shall allow an employee expense of board and lodging while finding accommodations for his family or his personal possessions at the new location not to exceed fourteen (14) calendar days following the date of such transfer, except when the employee is transferred at his request.
Moves made that require the Company to pay all or part of the expense must be made within ninety (90) days after the transfer of the employee to the new locations. An extension of this time may be given upon written request addressed to his supervisor showing good and sufficient reason therefor.
Any special insurance purchased by the employee will not be covered by the Company.
