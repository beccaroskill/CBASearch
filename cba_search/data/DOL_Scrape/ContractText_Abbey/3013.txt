employee’s absence.
F.	Sick Leave Incentive /Overtime Reduction Pilot Program
1.	Purpose: The purpose of the “Sick Leave Incentive/Overtime Reduction Pilot Program” is to provide a positive incentive to employees in managing their sick leave usage by giving value to sick leave through: a) an annual cash-out program based on low usage and, b) provisions to allow the conversion of sick leave balances to retirement service credit. Also, because staffing for positions made vacant by sick leave usage has a major impact on the amount, and therefore, the cost of overtime, the purpose of this program is to bring about a significant reduction in annual overtime expenditures in the Sheriff’s Department.
2.	Eligibility for Annual Cash-Out: To be eligible for the annual cash-out program, an employee must have a sick leave balance of at least one hundred fifty (150) hours in the payroll period immediately preceding the payroll period in which the cash-out payment is made. Further, the employee must have at least ninety-nine (99) hours of sick leave remaining in the employee’s balance after the cash-out payment is made.
3.	Sick Leave Cash-Out Schedule: An eligible employee will have the option to
cash out a portion of the employee’s sick leave balance based on the six (6) usage levels set forth on the following schedule:
Maximum Annual Usage		Number of Hours of Cash-Out
Level 1	0 to 8.5 hours	51.0 hours
Level 2	8.5+ up to 17.0 hours	42.5 hours
Level 3	17.0+ up to 25.5 hours	34.0 hours
Level 4	25.5+ up to 34.0 hours	25.5 hours
Level 5	34.0+ up to 42.5 hours	17.0 hours
Level 6	42.5+ up to 51.0 hours	8.5 hours
4.	Administration of Sick Leave Cash-Out Process
a.	Time Period for Determining Maximum Annual Usage:	The
employee’s usage of sick leave shall be measured over twenty-six (26) pay periods beginning with payroll 01 in July and ending with payroll 26 of each fiscal year during which this pilot program is in effect.
b.	Report of Eligible Employees: As soon as practicable following the end of the fiscal year, a report will be prepared listing employees who
DS-01
30
ARTICLE 6. PAID LEAVES (Cont’d)
are eligible for sick leave cash-out. Each eligible employee will be notified of the maximum number of sick leave hours that he/she may opt to cash out.
c.	Employee Options: An eligible employee may opt to receive cash for
all, or a portion of, the hours on the annual sick leave cash-out eligibility report. The sick leave credits that are received by the employee in cash will be removed from his/her sick leave balance.
d.	The administration of this program is subject to the rules and regulations of the Auditor & Controller.
5.	Conversion of Sick Leave Credits to Retirement Service Credit
Upon retirement, deferred retirement, disability retirement from County service, or death, an eligible employee’s sick leave balance may be converted into retirement service credits subject to the rules and regulations of the San Diego County Retirement Association, provided that:
a.	The employee has completed ten (10) or more years of continuous service during that employee’s present employment; and
b.	The employee’s sick leave balance totals three hundred (300) hours or more; and therefore,
c.	Employees with ten (10) or more years of service may convert one hundred percent (100%) of their total sick leave credits.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4 (G) below, employees eligible under Section 4 (F), may elect to: 1) receive their full cash payment under Section 4 (G) and then convert their remaining eligible hours under Section 4 (F); or 2) waive receiving the full cash payment under Section 4 (G) and convert their eligible hours under Section 4 (F).

At the request of the appointing authority, a permanent employee shall, in lieu of layoff, be afforded the option of demotion within the same department to a position in a lower class, provided that no such demotion shall in turn require the layoff or demotion from such lower class of any employee whose layoff rating is at least as high as that of the demoting employee. A probationary employee may be afforded the opportunity to accept a demotion within the same department to a position in a lower class provided no such demotion shall in turn require the layoff of any employee in the lower class. Such probationer shall not become permanent in the lower class by this action except by completing a new full probation period in such lower class.

In addition, if the employee on the reinstatement list is appointed to a class from which he/she was laid off, or to a different class of equal to or greater status than the reinstatement list class, then his/her name shall be removed from the reinstatement list. An employee who accepts an offer of reinstatement to the class from which he/she was laid off shall also be removed from the reinstatement list upon the date of reinstatement. The placement on the reinstatement list shall be determined n the same manner as for the order of layoff except in the inverse order thereof.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to require the provision of such defense where the discretion to provide or not provide such defense is vested in the County pursuant to the provisions of the California Government Code, or where the act or omission was not within the scope of the employee's employment, or the employee acted or failed to act because of actual fraud, corruption or actual malice, or where the provision of such defense would create a conflict of interest between the County and the employee.
Nothing herein shall be construed to grant to any employee any rights or privileges in addition to those provided in the said Government Code.
Section 7.	Drug and Alcohol Use Policy
A.	The County and the Association agree on all negotiable provisions of the DRUG & ALCOHOL USE POLICY.

The time limit at this level may be extended by mutual agreement between the Sheriff, or the Sheriff's designee, and the employee or his/her representative.
G.	Waiver of Appeal Steps

H.	Advisory Arbitration of Grievances
In the event that the grievance is not resolved by the Sheriff, the grievant may, within thirty (30) days after receipt of the decision of the Sheriff or the Sheriff's designee, made pursuant to paragraph F, request that the grievance be heard by an arbitrator.

DS-01
66
ARTICLE 11. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE (Cont’d)
Except when an agreed statement of facts is submitted by the parties, it shall be the duty of the arbitrator to hear and consider evidence submitted by the parties and to thereafter make written findings of fact and a disposition of the grievance which shall be advisory in nature. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based solely on the interpretation of the appropriate provisions of the Memorandum of Agreement applicable to the grievance, and he/she shall not add to, subtract from, modify or disregard any of the terms or provisions of the Agreement.
The provisions for arbitration are not intended and shall not be construed to empower an arbitrator to change any condition of employment, specifically covered by the Memorandum of Agreement, or to revise, modify or alter, in any respect, any provision contained in the Agreement.
Upon receipt of an advisory decision, the Sheriff shall, within seven (7) work days, render a written decision which shall be final on those matters which fall under jurisdiction of the Sheriff.
L.	Payment of Costs

M.	Effect of Failure of Timely Action
