ARTICLE 1:	PREAMBLE
This Agreement shall constitute the complete and only statement of contractual relationship between the Employer and the Union, and it is specifically agreed that any understandings or practices that may have existed contrary to the specific terms and conditions of this Agreement dated September 14, 2003, prior to September 14, 2003, will be given no force or effect hereafter. The parties further agree that understandings or practices include, but are not limited to, resolutions of conflicts on an informal basis. The Employer and the Union accept the provisions of this Agreement as commitments which they will cooperatively in good faith honor, support, and seek to fulfill. The employees covered by this Agreement agree to work for the Employer in accordance with the terms and conditions specified, and the Employer agrees to maintain the terms and conditions specified herein for the life of the Agreement.
The parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement.
Therefore, the Employer and the Union, for the life of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered in this Agreement, except for participation in the grievance procedure as specified in the contract, even though such subjects or matters may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time that they negotiated or signed this Agreement, except by mutual understandings.
ARTICLE 2:	COVERAGE
2.1	The Employer recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent with respect to rates of pay, hours, and all other terms and conditions of employment for employees in job classifications covered by this Agreement at those units of the Employer located in Michigan in which the Union has been established as bargaining representative as of September 14, 2003.
2.2	This Agreement shall also apply to any remodel of a covered unit, replacement of a covered unit in the same market area, or expansion of any covered unit at the same site, provided that the nature of the operations and/or format of the business after the remodel, replacement or expansion is the same as that which existed at the affected unit prior to the change.
2.3	This Agreement shall also apply to all traditional Supermarket and/or General Merchandise and Warehouse units that are opened by the Employer in Michigan after September 14, 2003, in which the nature of the operations and/or format of the business is the same as that which presently exists at the units identified in Article 2.1 above, provided the Union properly establishes its right to be recognized as the bargaining agent for the employees at such unit.
7
2.4	The Employer recognizes the Union as the collective bargaining agent for all full-time and regular part-time Grocery, Meat, Produce, General Merchandise, Warehouse and Property Management and Services employees at the covered units, excluding employees of any lease operation, employees of any existing or future operations which are either not physically attached to a covered unit or are not operated within the same premises as a covered unit, Manager Trainees, Store Directors, Line Managers, Department Managers, Property Management and Services Supervisors, Distribution Center Supervisors, Working Supervisors and the management to which such Managers report, Auditors, Registered Pharmacists, Pharmacy Technicians, Professional, Confidential, Office, Clerical, Systems Monitors, Managerial employees, Security employees and other Guards and Supervisors as defined in the Labor Management Relations Act as amended, and all other employees.

It shall also be a continuing condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after the date of execution shall, following five (5) weeks of active employment, become and remain members in good standing in the Union.

To be a member of the Union in good standing, as required by this section, an employee must tender to the Union the periodic dues and the initiation fee uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership. Any employee who is required to be a member of the Union by this section and who fails to render such uniform dues and initiation fees shall not be retained as an employee in the bargaining unit so long as the Union has given written notice to the Company and employee of such failure, and such failure is not cured by employee within seven (7) days of such notice.
The Employer reserves the right to secure new employees from any source whatsoever.
Those employees who maintain a non-member status or change their status to a non-member status and are covered by the terms of this Agreement shall be required to pay as a condition of employment, an initial service fee, monthly (or otherwise) service fees to the Union for the purpose of aiding the Union in defraying cost in connection with the Union’s obligations and responsibilities as the exclusive bargaining agent of the bargaining unit herein.

The rights of the Employer, the Union, and the employees shall be respected and the provisions of the Agreement for the orderly settlement of all questions regarding such rights shall be observed.
ARTICLE 5:	GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
5.1	It is the intent of the grievance procedure that, should any difference, disputes, or complaints arise over the interpretation or application of this Agreement that cannot be resolved between the employee and his immediate supervisor, there shall be an earnest effort on the part of the parties to settle such with reasonable promptness through the following steps.
STEP I: By a conference to be held between the aggrieved employee, his steward and the management of the Employer, or the Business Representative and the management of the Employer. The conference will be held and management’s response will be given promptly.
The Step I grievance must be initiated by the aggrieved employee and his steward or the Business Representative with dated, written notification identifying the specific nature of the grievance filed with the Unit Director's office.
STEP II: If the grievance is not resolved in Step I, the Union may process the grievance to Step II of the grievance procedure. The Step II grievance must be initiated by the Union Business Representative with a written grievance signed by the Business Representative and identifying the specific nature of the grievance and submitted to the Unit Director’s office and a copy forwarded to the Labor Relations Department.

If the grievance is not resolved at Step I, the Union may process the grievance to Step II only by requesting such meeting in the manner provided within thirty (30) days of the response to the Step I conference.
Any grievance matter resolved by the parties at Step I or Step II of the grievance procedure shall be considered non-precedent setting and without prejudice to the rights of either party in any further grievance that may arise.
STEP III: If the grievance is not resolved in Step II, either party may, within ninety (90) calendar days from the Step II grievance conference, in writing, request arbitration and the other party shall be obliged to proceed with the grievance in the manner provided.

one (I) vote and upon majority vote the decision of the Grievance Adjustment Board shall be binding, This decision will be deemed to satisfy either parties' request to arbitrate the issue, and shall be considered final and binding.

The panel of Arbitrators will be selected by the parties and will be at least five (5) Arbitrators who have been mutually agreed upon by the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on the selection of an Arbitrator, they shall select the Arbitrator from a panel of names obtained from the American Arbitration Association in the manner prescribed by the rules of the Association.
5.2	The authority of the Arbitrator and the Grievance Adjustment Board shall be limited to the consideration of unresolved grievances timely raised under this Agreement. They alone shall have the authority to interpret the meaning of this Agreement but shall not have the authority to modify, add to, or detract from this Agreement.

They shall have the sole authority to order back pay in whole or in part. The decision shall be final and binding upon both parties and is exclusively and expressly reserved for the parties to this Agreement.
5.3	Grievances must be taken up promptly and no grievance shall be considered or discussed which is presented later than ten (10) days after the events took place that are the basis of the grievance, with the exception of wage claims which are limited to sixty (60) days.

If the Arbitrator is unable to make such a determination, the cost will be shared equally by the parties,
5,5	The Local Union shall have the right to determine whether or not the employee’s grievance is qualified to be submitted to Arbitration. This may include either the Grievance Adjustment Board or Arbitration.
5.6	A steward shall notify his immediate supervisor or supervisor-in-charge in the immediate supervisor's absence, when the steward is leaving his work station for Union business.
11
The Employer reserves the right to limit the time and number of grievance discussions between the grievant and his steward which are held during the working time of either employee, so long as reasonable periods are permitted for the discussion and writing of the grievance, within the grievance time limits.
Every reasonable effort shall be made by the Employer to provide an opportunity for confidential discussions between the grievant and the steward.
5.7	Employees are entitled to steward representation during a disciplinary interview of record or a corrective action that is recorded which could subsequently be used as a basis for future discipline. The steward will be invited to attend at the employee’s request. The employee affected will be given a copy of that record.
5.8	The Employer shall have the right to discipline, demote or discharge employees for just cause. Any questions surrounding discipline, demotion or discharge may be processed by the Union through the grievance procedure. Grievances concerning discharges shall proceed immediately to Step II of the grievance procedure.
The Employer may disqualify an employee from the award of a job, transfer or promotional opportunity if the Employer demonstrates substantial reasons why such employee should be disqualified. Employees disqualified will be notified of such action.
5.9	Every reasonable effort shall be made to schedule and hold grievance meetings during the scheduled working time of the aggrieved employee and the aggrieved employee’s steward when their schedules coincide.
5.10	Discussions of grievances which are not processed according to the procedures described in this Article are not required of the Company or the Union. No grievances will be considered at any step, unless it is processed within the respective time limits and according to the procedures set forth in the Agreement.
However, nothing in this article shall prevent the parties mutually agreeing to extend the time limits imposed.
5.11	The Union shall be the sole representative of the interests of employees or groups of employees within the bargaining unit. Only the Union, through its properly designated Representatives, shall have the right under arbitration procedures or in any judicial or adjudicatory forum to assert and process against the Employer a claimed violation of the Agreement.
5.12	The Employer, including all supervisors, shall grant to any accredited Union Representative, who is an employee of the Local, access to the units for the purpose of administering the terms of the Agreement. Such Union Representatives shall sign in and out on appropriate sign-in sheets. There will not be lengthy discussions with employees which might interfere with the Employer's business.
ARTICLE 6:	PEACEFUL RELATIONS
6.1	In view of the arbitration provision, the grievance procedure, and other provisions of the Agreement, the Union, its agents and members agree that individually and/or collectively, they will not engage in any strike, any interference with or interruptions of the business, picketing, handbilling, or public announcements adverse to the Employer for the duration of this Agreement. Persons who authorize or engage in such action shall be subject to immediate discharge. The Employer will not engage in any lockout for the duration of the Agreement.
6.2	In no event will the Union authorize its agents or members individually and/or collectively, to engage in any strike directly or in sympathy with any other employees,
12
Distributor Cemws 2003
withholding of services in whole or in part, in connection with any secondary picketing or handbilling at any Meijer location.
6.3	The Union, on behalf of itself, its agents and members, agrees that during the duration of this Agreement no sympathy strike shall be caused or sanctioned and that no member shall refuse to cross any picket line at any of the Employer’s properties or facilities. Persons who authorize or engage in such action shall be subject to immediate discharge.
ARTICLE 7D: SENIORITY
7D.1 A complete seniority list by departments for both full-time and part-time employees shall be compiled and furnished to the Union.
Regular full-time employees and regular part-time employees will be on probation for the first thirteen (13) weeks of active employment. Probationary employees shall be covered by all provisions of this Agreement except such employees may be terminated by the Company for any reason and such action shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
7D.2 Seniority shall mean length of continuous service with the Employer and shall apply as provided for in this Agreement.
Seniority shall be of two (2) types, full-time and part-time. Full-time seniority shall be convertible to part-time. Full-time seniority shall not accumulate during periods of part-time jobs and part-time seniority shall not be convertible to full-time seniority if a part-time employee becomes full-time. Part-time seniority shall not be lost by transfer to full-time work. In no case will part-time employees accumulate seniority over full-time employees.
If two employees have the same full-time seniority dates, part-time seniority will determine who is more senior.
Effective July 21,1984 when two (2) or more employees are hired on the same date, their seniority standing will be determined by alphabetical order of the employee's last name at date of hire. Subsequent name changes will not affect seniority in that department and unit.
Those employees who have a phantom full-time seniority date as of November 29, 1987, will maintain that date unless they change from full-time to part-time status.
For all seniority purposes in Articles 7 and 8, Grand Rapids and Lansing employees in Job No. 035 or Job No. 042 working in a General Merchandise warehouse will be combined with Job No. 157. Lansing employees in Job No. 042 working in a Food warehouse will be combined with Job No. 057. Newport employees in Job No. 042 will be combined with Job No. 078.
7D.3 A regular employee’s seniority may be considered broken if he quits, if he is discharged for cause and not reinstated, if he failed to report to work for three (3) consecutive work days without notifying the Employer or if an employee is laid off continuously for one (1) year.
A regular employee’s seniority shall be considered broken if he fails to report for work while on layoff within seven (7) calendar days after being notified to report unless extended by mutual agreement.
7D.4 A. Open jobs for permanent full-time vacancies in the Distribution Centers will be posted in all the Distribution Centers for forty-eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.

13
Seniority will be the determining factor in all cases of job bidding and the most senior employee bidding will receive the job. Postings will be by classification, shift, department (as defined in Article 7D.5), and Center, except postings for Driver and Mechanic classifications which will be by job number, department and center. Only the employee bidding for himself or his steward bidding on his behalf may sign the bid sheet.
B.	Employees bidding on the openings in the Driver and Mechanic classifications must meet all the qualifications of those respective classifications in order to be awarded the job.
C.	The employee awarded the job must assume the new job when assigned by the Employer and jobs will be assigned no later than the first of the week after a period of up to two (2) weeks following the awarding of the job. The employee shall be given a thirty (30) day break-in period to familiarize himself with the job duties of the new position by which time the employee will be required to perform the job at a satisfactory level.
If for justifiable reasons the Employer feels an employee cannot perform the job at a satisfactory level, the employee may be returned to his original job.
D.	A successful bidder may not bid again for one hundred and twenty (120) days after assignment to the bid job, unless bidding for a higher rated job or for a shift change. Employees bidding between Michigan Distribution Centers may not bid back to their prior Center for one (1) year from the date of the assignment to the bid job, unless bidding for a higher rated job or for a shift change.
E.	The total expense of any move between the Michigan Distribution Centers shall be borne by the bidding employee.
E Part-time employees will be surveyed in line of seniority for all permanent promotions to higher rated part-time jobs within their department and center. The most senior employee desiring the job will be awarded the job. Part-time employees may also exercise their seniority for full-time jobs for which there are no other bidders.
G.	Where the Employer operates temporary or leased facilities in the same geographical areas as units covered by this Agreement, the parties will meet and discuss initial staffing of these facilities. Once this initial staffing is accomplished, such units will operate as a separate facility for all purposes, except layoff and pay rates shown in this Agreement.
H.	When employees in Job Nos. 032,057,157, or 078 bid on a higher rated job, the successful bidder will be placed at the same or next higher rate from his existing rate in the new classification. When bidding on a lower rated job, the successful bidder will be placed at the rate commensurate with their seniority. However, once an employee attains top rate in a classification, he shall not be required to go through the progression steps in that classification if he subsequently leaves and then re-enters that classification, except as defined in Article 7D.4I.
I.	Employees in Job No. 042 moving into a General Merchandise building and department will maintain their current rate in Job No. 042.
Employees in Job No. 035 in a General Merchandise building and department moving to a Food building and department will be placed at the next higher rate from their existing rate in Job No. 042.
Upon bidding out of Job No. 035 or Job No. 042, employees shall forfeit all rights to return to Job No. 035 or Job No. 042, except as provided in Article 15.4.

O«nxAcn 2000
LAYOFF
7D.5 Layoff for the purpose of this Agreement shall mean displacement as a result of a reduction of the work force for an indefinite time. Management can lay off employees for lack of work. The existence of lack of work is to be determined solely by management.
Layoffs shall be made separately at the Lansing, Grand Rapids and Newport Distribution Centers in inverse order of seniority by department, classification and building. Departments for the purpose of this provision are Grocery, Cold Storage, General Merchandise, Perishables, Facilities Maintenance, Drivers, Warehouse Mechanics and Transportation Mechanics.
A.	Once a full-time employee with seniority is laid off or bumped, he must exercise one (I) of the following options. When more than one (I) employee is laid off from a classification at the same time, the most senior affected employee will exercise his bumping rights first.
1.	He may bump into any classification in which there is an employee junior to him in his Distribution Center.
2.	If a bumping employee has no employee junior to him that he can displace in his Distribution Center by exercising his bumping options listed in Article 7D.5A1, and chooses not to take a layoff to the street he must bump following the same options listed in Article 7D.5A1 at the other Centers.
The bumping employee will then become an employee of that department and shift for layoff and bumping purposes at that Center.
B.	In exercising any of the above bumping options, the full-time employee will displace the most junior employee in the classification in the department elected.
1.	An employee may only exercise his bumping rights into positions of Driver and Mechanics if he meets all qualifications established by the Company for those positions.
2.	Employees with one (1) or more years seniority at the time of layoff who are primarily affected by a layoff of two (2) weeks or more shall be given at least one (1) week’s advance notice of layoff or pay for the first week of layoff in lieu thereof, except in cases of emergency beyond the control of the Employer. Any employee bumped out of his classification by a laid off employee will be required to exercise any bumping rights he has as soon as he is bumped.
3.	Those employees in the Driver and Mechanic classifications may exercise bumping privileges in the other Centers within the Driver, Warehouse Mechanic and Transportation Mechanic Departments prior to exercising their bumping privileges, as defined in these provisions, in the Distribution Center to which they were originally assigned.
4.	Transfers to other Centers as a result of this provision will be at the employee’s expense.
5.	Full-time employees can bump regular part-time employees within any classification on any schedule in his Center, and while working the available hours on that part-time job, he will continue to accumulate full-time seniority for a twelve (12) month period.
Full-time health care benefits will also continue to apply to such an employee for a twelve (12) month period following such a bump.
15
6.	Once alt bumping within the Distribution Centers due to a layoff of two (2) weeks or more is completed, employees then within each affected classification, department and shift will be scheduled pursuant to the procedure established in this Agreement.
7.	Once a decision has been made to take a layoff to the street, the employee must remain on layoff until the employee successfully bids back on a job posted for bid in accordance with Article 7D.4.
C.	Regular part-time employees will be laid off in inverse order of seniority, by classification, and department, and recalled in line of seniority to open jobs within their classification and department.
Part-time employees may bump junior employees in a lower classification within their department.
In the event there are open jobs for which there are no part-time employees with recall rights, employees on layoff status will be offered recall and are required to return within the same Distribution Center Complex.
It is specifically understood that no other provisions from Articles 7D.5 or 7D.5B apply to layoff and recall of regular part-time employees.
D.	Laid off employees shall have their wage rates affected as described in Articles 7D.4H and I.
TRANSFERS
7D.6 Except as provided in Article 13 hereof, an employee transferred from one (1) department in the bargaining unit to another shall retain past seniority and continue to accumulate seniority in the new department.
DAILY BUILDING ASSIGNMENT
7D.7 When there is a need to assign full-time employees on a daily basis to another building, the Employer will offer such assignments to volunteers in line of seniority by department, classification, building and shift and require in inverse order of seniority by department, classification, building and shift for these daily assignments; for part-time employees, the Employer will assign as needed by inverse order of seniority.
When assigned under the provisions of this section, such full-time employees will be eligible for overtime in the building the employee is actually working in at the end of that day, provided the employee has been assigned at least two (2) hours prior to the end of that work shift.
ARTICLE 8D: WAGES AND HOURS
8D.1 The job classifications and rates of pay are as shown in the Wage Schedule attached hereto and made a part of this Agreement. The Employer is to establish classifications as needed, and is to classify employees. Although the Employer may change job classifications and job content, the rates applicable to new or materially changed classifications shall be subject to negotiations between the parties hereto. The Employer agrees to notify the Union and, upon request, meet with it regarding any substantial changes in job classifications, job content, new equipment and the like as soon as possible after it reaches a decision to make such a change and before such change occurs. Special aptitude or competitive situations may be recognized by the Employer in hiring or advancing employees at rates faster than shown in the Wage Schedule, however, the employee’s rate shall not exceed the top rate negotiated for that employee’s classification.

(Mributicn 2003
8D.2 If during the term of the Agreement the Employer elects to implement an economic incentive program, such program will be communicated to the Union and input from the Union considered before such program is finalized by the Employer.
8D.3
A.	The basic work week for full-time employees shall be forty (40) hours per week with guarantees only as specifically set forth herein.
B.	For employees of the Distribution Centers, the Employer agrees to offer a minimum of forty (40) hours work each week to eighty-five percent (85%) or more of the full-time employees by shift and department in line of seniority, scheduled to work on the first of the week. The guarantee of this provision excludes holiday weeks. In cases where the application of this percentage results in a fraction, such fraction will not apply.
Distribution Center departments for the purpose of this paragraph are as defined in Article 7D.5.
It is understood that the guarantee is subject to reduction for lateness, illness, or other personal reasons of the employee. If work is available, the employee reporting must perform the work assigned even though it is outside his regular classification. This section shall not apply in cases of power or equipment failure or other causes beyond the control of the Employer. This will be applied separately at each Center where departments are duplicated.
C,	When a manager assigns an employee to a higher rated classification, the employee will be paid the next higher rate from his existing rate for all time worked in that classification. When a manager assigns an employee to a lower rated job, the employee will be entitled to his regular rate of pay for all time worked in that lower classification.
8D.4
A.	Work Schedules
In constructing weekly work schedules, the Employer will determine the needs of the department based on the requirements of the business, establish work groups as needed and determine the number of employees in each work group. Once that determination is made, the following procedure will be utilized:
Employees, full-time and part-time, will bid work groups for scheduling purposes. These work groups will be bid no less than two (2) times per year. Once the employees report to work, they will be assigned to jobs as deemed necessary by management. Employees’ job assignments and work groups may be changed as deemed necessary.
1.	Full-time employees will be offered their weekly work schedules by seniority within shift and their work group. Such schedules may be single weeks or blocks of consecutive weeks.
The forty (40) hour week will be worked in five (5) days of eight (8) hour shifts or four (4) days of ten (10) hour shifts.
2.	Weekly work schedules may be constructed such that there are four (4) day weekly schedules with ten (10) hours of work on each day with the overtime rate not applying until after ten (10) hours, and/or such that there are weekly work schedules that include Sunday hours as a day of
17
the work week. Such schedules may also include four (4) day weekly schedules with ten (10) hour days. It is recognized that such schedules may overlap into the next work week such that an employee’s schedule includes work days in two (2) payroll weeks. It is further understood that for part-time employees, schedules containing less than four (4) ten (10) hour days may exist.
3.	Part-time employees will be assigned schedules by management within their respective work groups. Such schedules may be single weeks or blocks of consecutive weeks.
Non-restricted part-time employees’ hours shall be scheduled such that senior part-time employees’ weekly hours shall exceed or equal the hours of junior part-time employees.
4.	Additional hours not on the posted schedule will be offered in line of seniority either to part-time employees that are at work at the time the additional hours become available or to part-time employees that are not scheduled for work that day and can complete the work on a straight time basis.
5.	Employees are expected to inform themselves of the schedule and are responsible to work their scheduled hours. There will be no trading of scheduled hours among the employees without the express advance approval of the supervisor.
An employee requesting a schedule adjustment must bring the request to the supervisor’s attention within twenty-four (24) hours of the posting of the schedule or the schedule will be deemed acceptable and not subject to the grievance procedure.
6.	The Employer may also designate a limited number of weekly work schedules that rotate employees between work shifts or from one work shift to another for time periods not to exceed twenty-six (26) weeks. Such schedules will not be a part of the offer and assignment procedure referred to in Article 8D.4A, and instead will be assigned to those employees who have elected to be placed on rotation, or who have been notified of a temporary staffing reduction on their shift. Employees will remain on rotation and be excluded from the offer and assignment procedure until the rotation is completed. Full-time employees will not be included in the part-time employees' rotation and vice versa.
B.	Regular part-time employees who are scheduled to work during a scheduled work week will be guaranteed at least sixteen (16) hours a week if available for work as scheduled.
C.	Full-time employees, upon request, shall be scheduled to have one (1) full day off per week between Sunday midnight and Saturday midnight as opposed to two (2) half days.
D.	There shall be no mandatory split shifts.
8D.5 In all payroll computations, the payroll week shall be a seven (7) day period beginning on Saturday midnight and ending on the following Saturday at midnight. However, scheduled work shifts may overlap payroll weeks. The payroll week will be calculated separately from the scheduled work week.
8D.6 Any full-time employee required to report to work before his regularly scheduled starting time will be allowed to complete his scheduled working day, provided that
18
0»Mx«nn 2M0
time worked to the end of the shift will be treated as normal scheduled working hours for such an employee with exception of compensation. When the Employer decides to schedule early starts, the offer will be made in line of seniority by classification, workgroup, shift, building and department and required in inverse order of seniority by classification, workgroup, shift, building and department from those full-time employees scheduled to work that day.
8D.7 The Employer will poll employees three (3) times per year on February 1, June 1, and October 1, for holiday work and such work when required will be assigned to employees who signed the poll sheet by seniority, department and shift. If more employees are needed, the Employer will assign the work to the employees who have not signed the poll in inverse order of seniority by department and shift. Any work shifts whose continuation as part of a normal work week continue into a holiday are not subject to any polling or other assignment procedures. In addition, shifts that start after 10:00 p.m. on a holiday will not be subject to this polling procedure.
8D.8 All employees are to receive one and one-half (1-1/2) the regular hourly rate for all hours actually worked over forty (40) hours in any one (1) payroll week or over eight (8) hours in any one (1) day but not both, or over ten (10) hours in any one (1) day if working a schedule that includes ten (10) hour shifts. There is to be no pyramiding of overtime. In any week in which a paid holiday falls, hours for which an employee receives compensation as holiday pay will be counted as time worked for purposes of computing overtime over forty (40) hours in that work week.
For purposes of computing overtime, a work day shall be defined as the consecutive hours worked commencing with the beginning of the employee’s scheduled work day (shift). Unpaid lunch breaks shall not be considered to break the consecutive hours.
Under no circumstances may an employee through any privileges set forth in this entire Agreement force the existence of any time and one-half (1 -1/2) hours.
8D.9 The performance of overtime work in the Distribution Centers will be assigned by management, as needed, separately at each Center, to the employees regularly assigned to work within each of the following departments:
General Merchandise
Facilities Maintenance
Grocery
Cold Storage
Perishables
Drivers
Transportation Mechanics
Warehouse Mechanics
A.	When overtime work is required by the Company immediately following the end of a work shift, the overtime work will be offered in line of seniority and assigned by inverse seniority within each building, department, classification, and work group. The offer and assignment of overtime by management may include only those employees who are immediately involved in performing the work requiring the overtime or may include all employees whose work shift is ending at the time the overtime is needed.
For overtime to be mandatory, it must be posted at least one (1) hour prior to the end of the shift.

19
B.	If after the weekly work schedule is posted, the Employer finds it necessary to schedule a full-time employee for a sixth day, in the case of a full-time employee on a five (5) day work schedule, or a fifth day in the case of a full-time employee scheduled to work four (4) days, the Employer will offer the additional day to the most senior employee in the building, department, classification, work group, and shift not scheduled to work that day.
If the Employer’s needs cannot be met by the above offer, the employees will be required to report for work in inverse order of seniority by building, department, classification, work group, and shift. However, employees can only be required to report if instructed to do so twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the start of the additional shift.
Any full-time employee required to report for work under this section will work the remainder of their weekly schedule and such work is not subject to an overtime claim from a senior employee.
It is understood employees cannot make a claim for overtime under this section if the work was done on straight time or as part of another employee’s weekly schedule, or was overtime at the end of that employee’s shift that day.
Notification will occur no later than the end of the last regular shift of the employee preceding the shift for which the additional work was scheduled, or by telephone call to the employee at the last phone number supplied by the employee. Failure to receive such notice shall entitle the employee to four (4) hours pay or four (4) hours work that day, whichever the Company may choose. This section shall not apply in cases of power or equipment failure or other causes beyond the control of the Employer.
C.	Hours (both regular and overtime) for inventory purposes will be assigned according to the preceding paragraphs; however, employees working these hours may be assigned to various inventory work by the Employer according to their abilities aside from matters of classification, work group or seniority and the call in guarantee will be four (4) hours of work.
D.	The Company shall have no obligation to offer overtime or early starts to absent employees, orthose on approved leave.
8D.10 All full-time employees who are instructed to report for work shall be guaranteed six (6) hours work at their normal rate including holidays. All regular part-time employees who are instructed to report for work shall be guaranteed four (4) hours work at their normal rate including holidays. This clause shall not apply when the Employer schedules employees for meetings, but employees will be paid for time spent in meetings. The Employer may assign work available even though it is outside the employee’s regular classification. It is understood that the guarantees of this provision do not apply in cases of lateness, injury, illness, or other personal reasons of the employee and in circumstances beyond the control of the Employer, such as fire, flood, civil disturbance, power and equipment failure, or acts of God. If the employee is notified not to report before he leaves home, the Company shall not be required to pay call-in pay. Same applies if the Company attempts to notify the employee by the last phone number or address on Company records and it is incorrect due to change not recorded by employee.
8D.11 All employees shall be allowed a fifteen (15) minute paid rest period, to be scheduled as near to the middle of his shift as possible, for each half shift of three (3) hours or more. No employee will be scheduled for a rest period until he has worked for one (1) hour, unless otherwise agreed by the employee.
20
Datreuticn Center* 2003
Under normal circumstances, the total rest period tor both employees scheduled eight (8) and ten (10) hour shifts shall not exceed thirty (30) minutes in any work day.
An employee in the Distribution Center shall receive an additional fifteen (I5) minute paid rest period on any day that the employee works more than nine (9) hours, This additional fifteen (15) minute paid rest period will be scheduled by management but will not necessarily be scheduled at the exact completion of nine (9) hours of work. Employees working more than eleven (11) hours in one shift shall earn an additional fifteen (15) minute break with pay. For hours worked thereafter an employee earns a fifteen (15) minute paid rest period for each three (3) hour block of time worked. In no case will an employee become eligible for, or be paid on his time card, for a rest period at the completion of his work shift.
However, an employee scheduled a ten (10) hour shift shall earn the additional fifteen (15) minute paid rest period on any day that the employee works more than eleven (11) hours. The earned additional rest period likewise will not necessarily be scheduled at the exact completion of eleven (11) hours worked. Any additional breaks earned will require the same time frames and payment method as above.
No employee shall work more than five (5) consecutive hours without being offered a lunch period.

a.	In January of each year, the Drivers who were full-time prior to 10/01/95 will be polled to determine their desire to work the following twelve (12) months as either a mileage or an hourly Driver.
At the next schedule bid, those Drivers who indicated their desire to be mileage Drivers will be placed on the Mileage Driver Schedule and allowed to exercise their seniority among the other Drivers on the Mileage Driver Schedule. Those Drivers who have indicated their desire to be hourly Drivers will be placed on the Hourly Driver Schedule and allowed to exercise their seniority among the other Drivers on the Hourly Driver Schedule.
Any hourly Driver who wishes to change their election to a mileage Driver may do so by indicating their desire in writing to management. Such requests will be accommodated at the next overall schedule bid.

Such schedules may also include four (4) day weekly schedules with ten (10) hour days. It is recognized that such schedules may overlap into the next work week such that an employee’s schedule includes work days in two (2) work weeks. These weekly schedules will be assigned to Drivers by a bid process in line of seniority.
Mileage Drivers - It is understood that full-time mileage Drivers’ schedules will be posted with both four (4) and five (5) day per week schedules and that such schedules will be assigned to Drivers by a bid process in line of seniority to the Drivers on the mileage schedule and do not fall under overtime wage and hour provisions.
23
e.	Weekly work schedules may include Sunday hours as a day of the work week with Sunday hours paid on a straight time basis.
f.	Additional hours of work which are not on the posted schedule and which the Employer elects to offer to off-duty employees will be offered in line of seniority to available full-time Drivers not scheduled to work on that day who are legally able to drive and complete the work on a straight-time or mileage basis. It is the responsibility of the Driver to ensure that any additional hours accepted under this provision will not prevent the Driver from working the remainder of his scheduled work week.
g.	Regular Driver work schedules may be rewritten and/or regrouped for bid as it is deemed necessary by management, but no less than two (2) times each calendar year. Switcher schedules will be included in the bid process, and will be designated as such.
h.	In order to provide the Drivers a basis for schedule selection, the Employer will post the expected runs and their approximate shipping times when the schedule bid process takes place.
i.	Mileage Drivers with Multiple Stop Trips - During a multiple stop run, the 30 minute delay criteria will be waived on the third and any subsequent stop during that trip. A trip is defined as travel from a Meijer Distribution Complex to the next Meijer Distribution Complex.

k.	Mileage Drivers and Short Trips - The Employer may re-value short mileage runs in order to create equity between the Mileage and Hourly systems for this work. The Employer will post a listing of all re-valued short mileage runs. In no case will the re-valued trip pay less than the mileage value of the trip. In no case will an Hourly Driver be paid anything other than hourly for any trips.
The parties shall meet and discuss any disputes regarding the value of shorter runs.
3.	Part-time Drivers’ weekly schedules will be posted and will be assigned to part-time Drivers by a bid process in line of seniority by Center.
a.	Weekly work schedules may be constructed for part-time Drivers such that there are schedules with ten (10) hours of work on each day with
the overtime rate not applying until after ten (10) hours and/or such that there are weekly work schedules that include Sunday hours as a day of the work week.
b.	It is understood that part-time Drivers scheduled to work during a given week are guaranteed a minimum of sixteen (16) hours of work per week. Part-time Drivers are also guaranteed four (4) hours of work on a daily basis if they report as scheduled. Such guarantees are subject to reduction in the same manner as other daily and weekly guarantees.
Weekly work schedules shall be constructed for part-time mileage Drivers such that there are two or more days of work. Mileage Drivers shall be able to exercise their seniority to maximize their work on a daily basis.
c.	Weekly work schedules may include Sunday hours as a day of the work week with Sunday hours paid on a straight time basis.

Additional hours of work which are not on the posted schedule and which the Employer elects to offer to off-duty employees will be offered in line of seniority to available part-time Drivers not scheduled to work on that day who are legally able to drive and complete the work on a straight-time or mileage basis.
4.	During the two (2) week period involved in the opening of a new store, during the week preceding the holiday week and the holiday week, and during the weeks that inventory is completed, Drivers may be assigned to starting times and days off that differ from their bid schedule. In making these changes in schedules, the Employer will recognize seniority for consecutive work weeks and earlier starting times.
5.	For all purposes, the assignment of runs will be separated by mileage or hourly Driver groups.
a.	When more than one (1) Driver has the same starting time on a particular day at the same Center and within the same group (mileage or hourly), those Drivers will be allowed to choose a run from those that the Dispatcher has decided to dispatch at that time in line of seniority. The least senior Driver will be required to take the run that was not chosen by the more senior Driver. Drivers with other start times and Drivers from another Center and Drivers outside of the group (mileage and hourly) will not participate in the above process. When only one (1) Driver has a start time, but there is more than one (1) load to be dispatched, he will be allowed to choose a run from those that the Dispatcher has decided to dispatch at that time.
b.	In the process of assigning subsequent runs to hourly Drivers, the Employer will assign runs at the time the Company elects to dispatch the runs to the Driver available at the dispatch window for immediate dispatch and legally able to take the run in a manner so as to create a reasonable balance of working hours that day among such available Drivers, with due consideration for seniority.
In the process of assigning subsequent runs to mileage Drivers, the Employer will assign runs at the time the Company elects to dispatch the runs to the mileage Driver available at the dispatch window for
25
immediate dispatch and legally able to take the run in a manner so as to favor the senior Drivers.
6.	It is recognized that at all times efficient operation of the Company to meet business needs will be the determining factor in making such assignments.
7.	In lieu of Article 8D.9A, overtime at the end of a work shift will be assigned and required, but in the event a Driver does not wish to work overtime or extra work and less senior Drivers are immediately available and can be legally dispatched immediately, the work will be assigned and required in inverse order of seniority to the most junior employee.
8.	a. In lieu of Article 8D.9B, if a full-time employee is scheduled a sixth day, in the case of a full-time employee on a five (5) day work schedule, or a fifth day in the case of a full-time employee scheduled to work four (4) days, the Employer will offer by group (mileage or hourly) the additional day to the most senior Driver in that Center not scheduled to work that day that can legally work the hours required.
If such hours are not filled by the above offer, the junior Driver must report for work in inverse order of seniority. However, employees can only be required to report if instructed to do so eight (8) hours in advance of the start of the additional shift.
Any full-time Driver required to report for work under this section will work the remainder of their weekly schedule. Such work is not subject to an overtime claim from a senior Driver.
b. When the Employer decides to schedule early starts, the offer will be made in line of seniority by classification, shift, group (mileage or hourly) and department and required in inverse order of seniority by classification, shift, group (mileage or hourly) and department from those full-time employees scheduled to work that day.
D.	The Employer agrees to reimburse Truck Drivers for the cost of renewing any licenses (including chauffeur's license) and the costs of any examinations required by the Employer or applicable laws or regulations, and to pay the regular corporate motel and meal allowance to Drivers whose schedule includes an overnight stay.
E.	If a seniority Truck Driver working under this Agreement should lose his license or should become physically unable to drive, he shall be entitled to exercise seniority by bumping within his Distribution Center provided the Driver is qualified to perform the duties of the job. Once this bump occurs, the employee will be reclassified and can only return as a result of a new bid on an open job.
Should a “Schedule A” Driver lose his license due to tickets, he will be returned to the “Schedule A" rate only after bidding on the first available job posting for which he is legally eligible.

ARTICLE 9: PAID TIME OFF BENEFITS
9.1	Eligibility and Benefit Calculations
A.	The Benefits described in this Article 9 have been modified as of September 14, 2003. For employees hired prior to September 14, 2003, benefit improvements to Bereavement Leave (9.5) and Jury Duty (9.6) will take immediate effect. However, the eligibility requirements for all Benefits described in this Article will change for all employees hired prior to September 14, 2003, on the employee’s anniversary date commencing on or after January 1, 2004, and will be subsequently adjusted on the employee’s anniversary date commencing on or after January 1, 2005, pursuant to the Paid Time Off “fringe day hours average” requirement described in Section 9.7A. Employees hired on and after September 14, 2003, will have the eligibility provisions applied during their first year of service and in subsequent years as defined in Section 9.7B.
B.	For the purpose of calculating benefits that are based on an employee’s fringe day amount, this is calculated by taking the employee’s total Active Service Hours (ASHs) during the previous anniversary year, divided by fifty-two (52) weeks, and then divided by five (5) days. There is no maximum applied to this calculation. This equals the fringe day hours average. The fringe day amount is equal to the fringe day hours average times the employee’s rate of pay in effect when the benefit is payable. An Active Service Hour (ASH) is any hour that the employee is
35
paid for active work, Holiday pay, Paid Vacation, Personal Paid Days, Bereavement Leave pay, or Jury Duty pay.
For the purpose of using the fringe day amount for benefits paid during the first year of employment, an employee's fringe day amount will be calculated after the completion of thirteen (13) weeks of service, based on total ASHs at that time, divided by thirteen (13) weeks of employment, divided by five (5) days.
9.2	Paid Holidays

The remaining weeks (or days) of vacation available during the June, July, August period will be distributed to the more senior employees based on requests received on the blank vacation schedule. It is understood that the posting of a vacation schedule and the granting of requested vacation shall be separate for full-time and part-time employees.
Once an employee’s request for vacation is approved and such approval is reflected on that department’s vacation schedule after the posting period, the employee's vacation will not be changed by management and no other em
38

ployee may exercise seniority rights to displace the employee from the scheduled vacation.

Unused vacation pay (that became available on the last seniority anniversary date) of any employee voluntarily leaving the Employer’s service or terminated for reasons other than misconduct (as described in this subsection 9.4H above), death, or retirement (if the employee has at least one (1) year of service), will be paid after termination only when a minimum of two (2) weeks advance written notice is given to the Employer and the employee completes the remainder of his scheduled shifts prior to the end of his employment.
The unused vacation pay of any employee whose service has been terminated by death is to be paid to the employee’s beneficiary as shown in the employee’s group life insurance policy (or, if the employee is not insured, it is to be paid to his spouse or to his estate).
The unused vacation pay of any employee whose service has been terminated by retirement is to be paid at retirement.
