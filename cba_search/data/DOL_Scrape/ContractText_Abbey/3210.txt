MASTER AGREEMENT
between the Akron Board of Education
Akron OPublic Schools
EFFECTIVE
July 1, 2002 «*I*-“..... .
through
June 30, 2005
Fore ward
This document is the sixteenth formal Agreement between the Akron Education Association and the Akron Board of Education dating from 1968, when Akron was the first district in the state to negotiate a comprehensive collective bargaining agreement. (The twelfth formal agreement between the Association and the Board was extended to cover the period July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1996.) As a comprehensive, mature document, it contains mutual understandings concerning salaries, fringe benefits, and conditions of employment for professional staff, which have evolved over the three decades of negotiations.
The contract is a dynamic one. As in previous Agreements, it specifies processes for clarifying and implementing the understandings that it contains. Moreover, if the Association and the Board follow the channels of communications contained herein, teachers and other members of the educational staff will be able to resolve mutual problems and achieve compatible objectives.
The chief objective for both parties—of course—is to provide the best educational programs for the students attending the Akron Public Schools. These contractual understandings will underwrite our joint efforts. Furthermore, this document represents a commitment to the community by providing for a period of stable management-employee relations.
By ratifying this contract, both parties have agreed to abide by the terms and conditions set forth herein. Hopefully, this document will help minimize the disputes and disagreements which occasionally arise and which interfere with our efforts to maximize our effectiveness as professional educators.

The district will follow provisions outlined in the Federal Statute, the individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and the Ohio Model Policies for Children with Disabilities. Any changes in IDEA or the Policies and Procedures will void conflicting language in this Agreement.
A. Discipline
Based on Federal Statute (IDEA), special education students may be suspended up to ten (10) days per year in the same manner as nondisabled students for violations of the Code of Student Behavior. In limited instances, a special education student may be suspended for more than ten (10) days if the following provisions are met: (1) the IEP team conducts a manifestation determination hearing, (2) the principal or the IEP team determines that suspending a student beyond ten (10) days would not result in a change of placement, (3) educational services continue starting with the 11th day of suspension, (4) a functional behavior analysis (FBA) is conducted to gather information for a behavior plan, and (5) a behavior plan intervention plan (BIP) is written to address the behavior in the future or the student’s current BIP is revised.
33
B.
A manifestation determination is a hearing held by the IEP team to determine if the behavioral infraction is related to the student's disability. IDEA outlines specific criteria that must be met to determine that the behavior is unrelated. If the behavior is unrelated, the student may be suspended beyond ten (10) days, but educational service must continue. This option is limited by availability of staff and funding.
When a student’s violation of the Code of Student Behavior involves drugs, weapons or dangerousness [IDEA 300.521 (a) defines dangerousness as “...maintaining the current placement of the child is substantially likely to result in injury7 to the child or to others.”], the student may be removed to an Interim Alternative Education setting for up to 45 days.
Procedures for suspending students with disabilities appear in the Office if Special Education Handbook.
Building Special Education Service Delivery Plans
There are various options for delivering appropriate special education services to students with disabilities. On an annual basis, buildings must select a service delivery plan from the pre-approved list in the Office of Special Education Handbook or submit a proposal for a unique service delivery7 plan. Unique plans must include signatures indicating support from participating staff.
Determining Least Restrictive Environment (Placement)
The placement of a student in regular or special education class(s) and the services provided to the student are determined by the student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP is developed by a team composed of: (a) the parents, (b) at least one regular education teacher of the child (if the child is, or may be, participating in the regular education environment), (c) at least one special education teacher or provider, (d) a district representative (e.g., principal or special education coordinator) and (e) whenever appropriate, the child with the disability.
The IEP team should work toward consensus in developing the IEP. No individual member has a right to mandate or reject any aspect of the IEP. The District Representative (e.g.. principal or special education coordinator) has the ultimate responsibility to ensure the IEP includes the services that the child needs in order to receive a free appropriate public education (FAPE). Any member who may be involved in the instruction of a special education student should be given the opportunity to serve on the IEP team or provide input into the development of the IEP.
The federal statute on special education, IDEA, states [20USC 1412 (a)(5)(A)]: “To the maximum extent appropriate, children with disabilities, including children in public or private institutions or other care facilities, are educated with children who are nondisabled, and special classes, separate schooling, or other removal of children with disabilities form the regular educational environment occurs only when the nature or severity of the disability of a child is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary7 aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.” The IEP team must carefully document in the service column of the IEP, if needed, the supplementary aids, accommodations, grading modifications, and specialized services for students spending all or portion of their day in the regular education environment. The Board must ensure that all services set forth in the child’s IEP are provided, consistent with the child’s needs as identified in the IEP.
34
	If after a reasonable amount of time and effort to implement the IEP, any member of the IEP team believes that a change is needed in the student’s individualized program. A team member may request an IEP meeting. The team member should present data (e.g., work samples, grades, behavior charts) to demonstrate the need for a revision in the IEP. As with the initial review IEP, the IEP team should work toward consensus on any modifications requested.
3.23	Pupil Adjustment The Board has adopted pupil adjustment policies and procedures that provide for: 1.	The identification of infractions resulting in expulsion from school. 2.	The establishment of a psychological referral/support center to provide assessment, diagnosis, and prescription for improving the deportment of students. No teacher or class is ever required to tolerate any act of gross misconduct, including flagrant discourtesy, abusive and vile language, acts of violence and/or deliberate insubordination. Corporal punishment shall not be administered to elementary or secondary students of the Akron Public Schools. If, in spite of the teacher’s best efforts at correction, which should include a teacher-parent conference, a pupil continues to misbehave, the teacher should refer the case to the principal for further action. If a pupil’s presence poses a continuing danger to persons or property or an ongoing threat of disrupting the educational process taking place either in the classroom or elsewhere in the school premises, the teacher may remove the pupil from the classroom or activity and must state the reason(s) in writing to the principal as soon as practicable. A conference may take place between the member and the principal before the student is readmitted to class. In extreme cases, where the matter cannot be resolved within 24 hours from the time of the student’s removal from class and/or activity by the teacher, then the student’s procedural due process rights under the law shall apply. The principal may reinstate a pupil removed from class by a teacher by informing the teacher, in writing, the reasons for reinstating the student prior to a hearing. An official School Office Cumulative Folder shall be maintained on each student in the school office files and shall be maintained in each school for the use of those members who have a legitimate educational interests. A member shall be notified of the impending enrollment of a pupil transferred for adjustment reasons. Within a reasonable length of time before the arrival of said transferred student, the AT-19 form stating the reasons for the transfer shall be forwarded to the receiving school and its contents made available to his/her teacher prior to the time he/she reports to class. Where a student has had a pupil adjustment transfer and is returned to the Office of Student Services on another disciplinaiy matter after good faith efforts in the second placement to cause satisfactory adjustment, an expulsion hearing shall be held. Subsequent placement shall only be made after review by a committee. The Superintendent shall designate the chairman of the review committee conducting the meeting and no more than two members of the committee. The President shall designate no more than two (2) members of the committee. In addition to the chairman and the four committee members to be designated, where appropriate, the psychologist conducting a child study and a representative from the Summit County Juvenile Court shall be members of the committee. The authority of the Superintendent to assign students is not
35
diminished by the existence of the review committee; however, the Superintendent shall weigh the concerns expressed by the committee in making his/her decision.
A pupil suspected of emotional or social disabilities may be referred by the member to Psychological Services for further study as provided by Board policy and the student’s due process rights under the law; and if found to be emotionally disturbed or socially maladjusted, the pupil shall not be returned to a regular classroom except on the recommendation of the Coordinator of Psychologists.

Building level penalties may include, but are not limited to, school supervised detention, office administered corporal punishment, suspension, etc. These penalties may vary' from building to building. The principal has the discretionary authority to go beyond the minimum punishment based on the incident. Each building’s policy of penalties shall be filed with the Superintendent annually, and the committee shall meet regularly to review the effectiveness of the policy. The committee shall also file a report of its findings not later than the last day of each school year. The report shall include the policy of penalties for the following school year.

In recognition that negotiation is a shared process, all parties shall negotiate in “Good Faith". "Good Faith" required that the AEA and the Board representatives be willing to react to each other’s proposals; if a proposal should prove unacceptable to one (1) of the parties, that party is
100
obligated to give its reasons therefore. In case of disagreement, procedures outlined in Article XIII will be in effect.
11.04 Furnishing Information
The Board and the Superintendent agree to furnish the AEA on request all compiled available information concerning the financial resources of the district and any other public data that will assist the AEA in helping to develop intelligent, accurate and constructive programs on behalf of the members, the students and the educational program.
ARTICLE XII	- AGREEMENT
When the participants reach agreement, such agreement shall be reduced to writing and signed by the members of the committees. Within five (5) work days thereafter, said Agreement shall be submitted to the membership of the AEA for ratification. If such membership ratifies said Agreement by a majority vote of those voting thereon, upon written certification by the President of such ratification to the Superintendent, the Board shall consider the ratification at its next meeting. The Board may also elect to defer consideration of the Agreement to the following meeting when seventy two (72) hours have not passed between written notification of AEA ratification and the next Board meeting.
ARTICLE XIII	- IMPASSE
13.01 Fact-finding
Should the AEA and the Board fail to reach agreement by June 30, either side may request, in writing, that all unresolved items be submitted to a fact-finder. This item does not apply to Section 13.07 In-Term Bargaining.
13.02 Appointment
Within three (3) days of the notice to refer the unresolved issues to a fact-finder, the parties shall request from the American Arbitration Association (AAA) a list of five (5) names to serve as potential fact-finders. The parties shall meet within two (2) days of receipt of the list from AAA and strike names to select a fact-finder to hear the unresolved issues.
13.03 Procedures
Within ten (10) work days of selection, the fact-finder shall conduct a hearing on all unresolved issues. The Fact-finder shall have the authority to request that both sides submit the unresolved issues prior to the hearing date. Unresolved issues are those proposals on the table at the time fact-finding is requested on which tentative agreement has not been reached.
Within ten (10) days of the final hearing day, the fact-finder shall submit a set of recommendations of the unresolved issues to both sides. The nature of these recommendations shall be advisory and not binding on either party.
13.04 Recommendations
Within ten (10) days of the submission of the fact-fmder’s report, said recommendations shall be submitted to meetings of the membership of the Association and the Board, respectively, for acceptance or rejection. The report must be accepted or rejected in its entirety. If the membership of the AEA accepts the recommendations by a simple majority of those voting on the
101
recommendations, the report shall be considered ratified by the Association. If the membership of the Board accepts the recommendations, the report shall be considered ratified by the Board.
13.05 Mediation
If either the AEA or the Board rejects the fact-finder’s report, the rejection shall be considered a request for mediation. The rejecting party shall, within two (2) work days, contact the Federal Mediation and Counciliation Service (FMCS), request the services of a mediator, and shall notify the other partv7 of the request in writing. The mediator shall be selected by FMCS. Members shall have the right to strike provided the contract has expired and no agreement has been reached and the Association has given a ten (10) day prior written notice of intent to strike to the Board and SERB as required by 4117.14 of the Ohio Revised Code.
13.06 Costs
All costs incurred as a result of the use of a fact-finder and/or mediator shall be shared equally by the Association and the Board except that each shall be responsible for the costs of its own representation and presentations.
13.07 In-Term Bargaining
Any negotiations required under this Agreement or otherwise by law are subject to the factfinding procedures outlined in Article XIII of this Agreement. In the event either party invokes the provisions of Article XIII in an impasse involving bargaining an issue during the term of this Agreement, the fact-finding and mediation procedures in Article XIII shall apply to this in-term negotiations impasse except that the ten (10) day limits in Sections 13.03 and 13.04 will become five (5) day limits and the entire fact-finding mediation process shall not be extended beyond thirty (30) calendar days.
ARTICLE XIV - DURATION
14.01 Effective Date
The effective date of this Agreement shall be July 1, 2002, and it shall remain in force until June 30, 2005, except that it may be altered by the reopening of negotiations as provided herein.
14.02 Initiation of Negotiations

14.03 Year-Round School
Initiation of year-round school format in any school in which the length of the school year as defined in this Agreement is extended shall require the reopening of negotiations on items that concern wages, fringe benefits and on other items mutually agreed upon surrounding that yearround program.
102

Within sixty (60) days after the effective date of legislation or U.S. Supreme Court decisions which modify or have direct effect upon any portion of this Agreement, a meeting shall be held, upon request by either party, to determine whether or not the parties wish to reopen negotiations on the affected sections of the Agreement.
