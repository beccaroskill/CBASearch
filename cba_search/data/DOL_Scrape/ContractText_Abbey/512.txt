| .Layoff and Recall	_________________________________ __________________________________________
SEC. 5. If it becomes necessary to effect a layoff (or separation) in the District Office or the Telephone Services Department, the Company will confer with the Union, in advance, to discuss the positions which shall constitute the occupational group (or groups) affected, for the purpose of applying the provisions of Article XIII, Section 3. If the layoff is a direct result of a technological change, the Company shall notify the Union at least three months in advance of the anticipated layoff. Employees shall be laid off (or separated) in the inverse order of their Combined Office* seniority, subject to the conditions specified below.
In the specific position in which a reduction in force is to be accomplished, the employee with the least occupational seniority, shall be laid off, provided the employee has least Combined Office* seniority within the office. If the employee has not, the employee shall be returned to the employee's previous position in the employee's former occupational group or one in the same salary grade, whichever is agreed by the Company and the Union to be more practicable. From the reconstituted arrangement of the personnel of that occupational group, the selection for layoff shall be made, provided under this arrangement the employee subject to layoff in such group has the least Combined Office* seniority within the office. If such is not the case, additional rearrangements of the type heretofore described shall be made until the employee to be laid off has, except when such would be impracticable, the least Combined Office* seniority within the office.
In those cases in which an employee so concerned shall have had no position other than the employee's present position within the District Office or Telephone Services Department, and provided the employee does not have least Combined Office* seniority within the office, then the employee may elect the option to be placed in his/her previous position at his/her former location if a permanent vacancy exists in that position. If the employee declines the option, or if a vacancy does not exist in the employee's previous position at the former location, then the employee shall be assigned to another position at the current location for which the employee is qualified in the same salary grade, or if that is impracticable, the employee shall be assigned to a lower classification agreed upon by the Company and the Union. An employee assigned to a lower classification under the foregoing conditions shall be given the option of being placed in his/her previous position at his/her former location when a permanent vacancy exists in that position. If there is no position in any lower classification at the current location for which the employee has the necessary qualifications, the employee shall then be laid off.
| __In addition to the recall rights outlined below, an employee who has been laid off shall have the option of
being placed in his/her previous position at his/her former location if a permanent vacancy occurs in this position within the two-year period following the date of layoff.
When a permanent vacancy occurs in a position from which employees were bumped, such employees shall be given the option, in the order of occupational seniority, to return to the vacant position before it is posted or before employees are recalled.
An employee declining the option of returning to his/her former position within his/her current location or previous position at his/her former location shall forfeit his/her right to such offers in the future. In all cases, employees who have been laid off shall have the right to be recalled before employees are given the option for placement.
Employees scheduled to be laid off may, provided they are qualified, displace a temporary employee. The employee will be reclassified as temporary and the displaced employee shall be discontinued.
When additional employees are needed in a specific position, from which employees have been laid off, within a two-year period, such laid-off employees shall be offered the jobs before they are filled by the promotion or transfer of employees with less Combined Office* seniority or by the hiring of new employees. Recalls to such work shall be in the inverse order of layoff (last employees laid off shall be rehired first) provided that the physical condition (which is understood to include mental condition) of the former employee is no worse than it was at the time of separation. The Company shall not be required to recall any employee who has been laid off for a continuous period of more than two years at the time occasion arises to issue a recall. Employees recalled after layoff shall have, upon reemployment, the same seniority status they had
25
attained at the time of their layoff. The salary to be paid shall be in accordance with the provisions of the plan of job evaluation. During the period of recall, if none of the employees who are on layoff are eligible for recall to a vacant position, the Company shall offer the position to such employees, in the inverse order of layoff, prior to hiring from the outside. In such cases the employee must possess the minimum qualifications for the position. Employees who accept such positions will not forfeit their recall rights to the specific positions from which they were laid off. If employees are recalled to positions other than the positions from which they were laid off and subsequently recalled to the positions from which they were laid off, such employees will be paid at the wage progression step at the time of layoff. In addition, employees who are offered, but decline a position, will not forfeit their recall rights. However, they will not be offered another of these positions until all other employees on layoff have been offered a position.
Upon failure of an employee to reply after ten (10) days' or to return to work after twenty-one (21) days' written notice, by registered mail return receipt by the Company, addressed to the last address on record, the employee shall forfeit the rights secured under this Agreement, and the Company shall have the right to recall the next employee in order of Combined Office* seniority, or if there is none available then a new employee may be hired.
Seniority of Union Officers in Layoff or Recall
SEC. 6. The procedure established in Section 5 of this Article shall be modified as follows, in the case of the stewards of the Local Council, elected officers of the Local Council (limited to four in number except in District Offices which now have five), and members of the Executive Committee of the Union (limited to seven in number), in the event that the required reduction in force would result in the layoff of such employee during the term of office, the employee shall not be laid off as long as the required reduction in force can be accomplished by the layoff of another employee, even though the latter employee may have more Combined Office seniority, than,the Union steward or elected officer. The Local Council shall provide the Manager in writing with the names of the stewards and elected officers.

Should any dispute or grievance arise between the Company and the Union, or any of its members, as to the performance, application, or operation of any provisions of this Agreement, not specifically settled in said Agreement, both parties shall endeavor to settle the question in the simplest and most direct manner. The procedure shall be as follows (unless any step thereof is waived, combined or extended by mutual consent):
FIRST:	Between the Union steward and the supervisor. If not disposed of within three days
(exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays), the matter may be taken up as provided for in step "SECOND" following:
| SECOND:	Between the Manager and/or the Manager's ^designated representatives and members of a ■ {Deleted:
local Committee appointed by the local chairperson of the Union (no fewer than two and no more than five, except for the limits defined in Article XVIII, Sec. 1 of the Agreement).
The party initiating the matter shall submit it in writing to the other. The written statement of the grievance shall include a full explanation of the nature of the grievance, the claimed basis for the grievance and references to Sections of the Agreement, if any, which are claimed to have been violated. Both parties shall confer promptly on the grievance and dispose of it as soon as possible, but in any event within ten days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays).
At the option of the local Union a further discussion in the second step shall be held. The President of the Union and the Industrial Relations Manager may participate in such meetings. The local Manager shall confirm the decision in writing within ten working days after it has been given in the final meeting in the second step. If a grievance is not presented in this step within forty-five calendar days after its occurrence, it shall no longer exist.
It is the desire of both the Union and the Company that grievances be disposed of locally. Both parties will make earnest efforts to accomplish that objective. In the event, however, that the matter is not settled locally through one of the above methods, it shall be carried to step "THIRD" below or in the case of discharge step "Fourth" below. In such cases involving discharge, the Union's request that the matter be referred to arbitration must be made within 60 calendar days after the written reply was given in step "SECOND" above. The demand for arbitration must be submitted to the American Arbitration Association within 60 calendar days after the date of such request. If either of these time limitations are not met, the grievance shall no longer exist. In addition, if a hearing is not held within one year of the date of the Union's fourth step letter, the grievance shall no longer exist. The one year period may be extended only by mutual consent of the parties. In no case will the Company's period of liability exceed sixteen months.
THIRD:	Between members of the Executive Committee of the Union (which shall not be in excess
of seven in number) and the Vice President-Customer Operations or designated representatives. The grievance shall be in writing. The Company will meet with the

Union within 120 days of receipt of the grievance at the third step for those grievances received on or after May 1, 1996. A reply in writing shall be given within fifteen calendar days. If a grievance is not submitted in this step within forty-five calendar days after the reply was given in step "SECOND" above, it shall no longer exist.
FOURTH:	It is the stated intent and purpose of both parties at all times to reach agreement by
negotiation between the Company and the Union, without recourse to arbitration. In the event, however, that such dispute or difference is not settled, either party may request that the matter be referred to arbitration provided this request is made within 60 calendar days after the written reply was given in step "THIRD" above. The demand for arbitration must be submitted to the American Arbitration Association within 60 calendar days after the date of such request. If either of these time limitations are not met the grievance shall no longer exist. In addition, if a hearing is not held within one year of the date of the Union’s fourth-step letter, the grievance shall no longer exist. The one-year period may be extended only by mutual consent of the parties. In no case will the Company's period of liability exceed sixteen months.
The arbitration board shall consist of three arbitrators. The Company shall choose one arbitrator and the Union shall choose one arbitrator, and these two shall then select a third arbitrator. If the said two arbitrators fail to agree within five (5) days upon the selection of a third arbitrator, the latter shall be selected from a list of arbitrators supplied by the American Arbitration Association. The parties may receive up to three lists of neutral arbitrators from the American Arbitration Association from which to select an arbitrator. Should the parties be unable to agree upon an arbitrator from the first two lists, a third list consisting of five names shall be forwarded to the parties. Each party may z. _._ |	strike a maximum of two .names and indicate the order of preference for the remaining ^Deleted:
three. The party initiating the grievance shall prepare a statement setting forth the exact nature of the grievance for submission to the arbitration board.
After the appointment of the third arbitrator, the arbitration board shall meet for the purpose of reaching a determination in the dispute or difference, and the decision of the majority of the board, submitted in writing, to the Company and the Union, shall be final and binding upon both parties.
In the case of discharges, the above procedures shall be modified to the extent that a single arbitrator, selected in accordance with the above, shall be used. Accordingly, there will be no need for an arbitration board meeting following the close of the hearing.
Each party shall bear the expense of its own arbitrators and witnesses, and the expenses of the third arbitrator and any general expenses of the arbitration shall be bome equally by both parties.
I Nothing herein shall be construed as restricting the right of an employee or group of employees to present their problems or requests directly to their supervisor or the Manager at any time. Any individual employee or a group of employees shall have the right at any time to present grievances to their employer and to have such

EXHIBIT “B” STATEMENT OF PROGRESSION POLICY
General
In all references to salary treatment within this Agreement, the following guidelines shall apply:
Salary Rate Upon Assignment to a Position
( (Note: See Letter of Agreementdat^9Z?^
When employees are first assigned to any position, they shall receive:
(a)	The minimum salary indicated for that position, or
(b)	If they are promoted from another position in a lower salary grade (or, in the case of employees hired on or after May 22, 1996, a position with a lower maximum rate) and the salary they are then receiving is higher than the minimum salary for the newly assigned position but less than the maximum salary for that position, their salary will be raised to the next step of the scale for the newly assigned position.
If the employee is scheduled to receive a progression increase in his/her permanent position within the 14 calendar day period after a scheduled permanent promotion, the promotion shall be made effective on or after the scheduled date of the progression increase. Accordingly, in such cases, the promotional rate in the new position shall be based on the rate (including the progression increase) in the former position.
(b)	If employees are transferred from another position in the same salary grade (for employees hired on or after May 22, 1996, another position with the same maximum salary rate), their salary will not be changed as a result of such transfer.
(c)	In the case of new employees who have special training and experience, such employees may upon their employment be paid a rate in excess of the minimum salary (but within the range) for the position in which they are employed.
(d)	If employees have less than one month in a temporary or permanent position and are promoted to a position in a higher salary grade (for employees hired on or after May 22,1996, a position with a higher maximum rate), their salary rate upon assignment to the new position shall be based upon their salary rate prior to appointment to their existing temporary or permanent position.
Full-day and part-day temporary assignments to a higher position since January 1, 1975 together with time spent on temporary assignments in a higher position with a temporary change in nomenclature shall be credited to an employee’s progression time upon permanent or temporary assignment (including upgrading) to such higher position. “Higher position” is determined by the relative standing of salary grades in the case of Exhibit “A” or, in the case of Exhibit “Al", the relative standing of the maximum rates of the positions.
40
In-Classification Progression
At the intervals indicated in the Salary Progression Rates, management will review the employees’ performance and progress in their assigned positions. If their performance and progress are satisfactory, the scheduled progression step will be made effective at the stated time as set forth in the Salary Progression Plan, until their salary equals the maximum rate specified for that position.
Procedure in Case In-Classification Progression is Withheld
At any time during the interval between progression step salary increases, when it becomes apparent to management that a progression step increase may be withheld from any employees, because of substandard work, the Manager will confer with the individual employees and with the Union, in order to afford the individuals in question the opportunity to improve their work.
When the review made just prior to the end of the progression interval indicates that the employees have not made satisfactory progress on the job by demonstrated ability and performance so as to qualify them for an increase to the next progression step, and for that reason an increase in pay is not warranted, the employees may be retained in their positions at the same rate, or be transferred, or separated from the payroll, but the employees shall be informed of such determination by a personal interview in advance of the date of the scheduled increase, and the Union shall be notified in writing. The Union may request a review of such a decision, provided such request is submitted in writing to the Manager within five working days of the date the Union receives the notification. The Manager will confer with the Union representatives, and inform them in writing of the results of the review, within five working days after receipt of the request for review. From this point on if the Union is dissatisfied with the Manager’s answer, the case may be taken up through the established grievance procedure, at step “SECOND,” subject to the time limitation therein stated.
An employee so retained in a position at the same rate shall have the case reviewed within three months. If satisfactory progress on the job by demonstrated ability and performance has been made so as to qualify the employee for. the previously withheld increase to the next progression step, the employee shall receive such next progression step immediately and the period for the next progression step shall start on that date.
Salary Rate During Temporary Period in Higher Classification
Employees hired prior to May 22, 1996 shall continue to be compensated in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Exhibit “A”, and as outlined below when assigned to work in a higher classification. Employees hired on or after May 22, 1996 who are assigned to work in a higher classification shall receive an additional $ 1.00 to their hourly wage rate for time spent performing the assigned work in the higher classification, provided that the total hourly wage does not exceed the maximum hourly wage rate for the position to which they are upgraded. In cases where the addition of $1.00 to their hourly wage rate would exceed the maximum rate for the position to which they are upgraded, they shall receive the maximum rate for the position to which they are upgraded for each applicable hour.
Employees hired prior to May 22, 1996, who are assigned to work in a higher classification shall be paid for the time worked, but for no less than one hour, the starting rate for the higher classification, or if their existing rate is higher than said starting rate, they shall receive the next step above their existing rate. This minimum
41
will be the minimum for all work in the higher classification and will not apply separately to each assignment to work in such higher classification for an employee so assigned more than once during the same workday. Employees hired on or after May 22,1996, who are assigned to work in a higher classification shall be paid for the time worked, but for no less than one hour, at the applicable rate as established in the paragraph above. It is not the intention of the Company that employees perform work in a higher classification without specific assignment..
It is the sole responsibility and prerogative of management to determine whether it is necessary to fill a temporary vacancy by as’signment of another employee to that work. When such temporary vacancy is filled, it shall be by an employee who is qualified to do the work. It is understood and agreed that employees in the same or higher classifications, who are qualified to do the work, may be assigned by management to fill temporary vacancies, if such employees are available.
If the temporary vacancy is filled by upgrading, and if the period of the temporary vacancy is expected to exceed forty-five calendar days, the vacancy shall be posted in accordance with the provisions of Article XIV.
Employees who are temporarily promoted to higher classifications shall be returned to their permanent positions if unavailable to perform in die temporary positions, and if replaced by other employees through the re-posting of such vacancies. The effective date of return to the permanent position shall be the date when the re-posted temporary vacancy is filled.
Salary Rate in the Event of
Assignment to Lower Classification
Employees hired prior to May 22, 1996 shall continue to be compensated in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Exhibit “A”, and as outlined below, when assigned to work in a lower classification. Employees hired on or after May 22, 1996 shall continue to be compensated in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Exhibit “Al", and as outlined below, when assigned to work in a lower classification.
Employees assigned for a temporary period to a lower classification shall receive their regular rate of pay during the period of that assignment.
If the assignment is to be made permanent, the case will be reviewed with the Union and the employee will then be notified. Employees with more than 6 months’ service, shall be given a rate above minimum in the lower classification which gives credit for their total service in positions of equal or higher grade/classification covered by payroll recommendation. Their new rate shall be applicable ninety calendar days after the date of assignment.
Employees with more than 6 months’ service, who voluntarily apply for a posted vacancy (either permanent or temporary) in a lower classification shall be given a rate above minimum in the lower classification which gives credit for their total service in positions of equal or higher grade/classification covered by payroll recommendation. Their new rate shall start immediately upon assignment to the new position.
Employees who become incapacitated for their regular work may, at the option of the Company, be placed at any work they can do at an appropriate rate of pay and without regard to the seniority provisions of the Agreement. The Company will first consider available positions for which the employee qualifies in the District prior to placing the employee elsewhere in the area (areas are defined as follows: The Northern area shall consist of Newark, Garret Mountain, Paramus, Roseland, Harmon Cove and the Telephone Services Department. The Southern area shall consist of the Southern Customer Inquiry and Accounting Center, East
42
Gate, Bridgewater, Princeton, and the Customer Payment Processing Center. The Northern Inquiry Center, Northern Accounts Center, Cranford and the Credit and Collection Center shall be included in both the Northern and Southern areas). “Appropriate rate of pay” shall be determined by the circumstances in each individual case, including length of service with the Company, and shall not be considered to be limited by the maximum rate of pay of the position to which such employee is assigned. Further, in the case of employees, who, at the time of their assignment to a lower position because of incapacity, are 60 years of age or over, their existing rate shall not be lowered by virtue of the assignment to the lower-rated job. Incapacitated employees, with five to twelve years’ service who have not been placed by the Company, will be paid separation allowance upon discontinuance in accordance with Article XVII, Section 2.
Incapacitated employees who have been placed in a position because of their incapacity may be subsequently reassigned, at the option of the Company, and without regard to the seniority provisions of this Agreement, to a position that they can fill, within the area, in a salary grade/classification equal to or above that of the position to which they have been assigned, but below the salary grade/classification of their position prior to assignment due to physical disability. Incident to such reassignment they shall be given an “appropriate rate of pay” to be determined following the same considerations which applied at the time of their first assignment because of incapacity. In the event the employee provides medical certification of ability to perform in the position from which originally downgraded, and such certification is approved by the Company doctor, the employee may be assigned at the option of the Company, to that position.
If employees who are 60 years of age or over, are assigned to a lower classification not for incapacity, but because of the elimination of their jobs, their existing rate shall not be lowered by virtue of the assignment to a lower-rated job.
Reclassification
The classification of employees agreed upon at the start of the job evaluation program has been jointly determined as an equitable basis for initiating the plan. It is not intended to serve as the basis for determining the number of employees to be assigned to each classification in each office in the future.
It is understood and agreed that the Company has the right to arrange work assignments, subject to the provisions of the job specifications, and that in the future, as changes in organization occur, this will result in certain redistribution of the number of employees by classification; for example, in the event a 323 Bookkeeper, who is so classified at the start of this plan, vacates the position, the work may be so arranged that the employee, who, in effect, fills the vacancy will perform the duties described under the Classification of Assistant Bookkeeper, and will be assigned to that position. As changes in organization occur, reductions will be made in the number of employees in the higher classifications until the proper ratio exists in accordance with the job descriptions.
Postponement of Increase
Because of Absence
"' The date on which an increase is due will be postponed by the number of working days which an employee is away from work, with or without pay, in excess of the following number of working days (during the salary progression step interval) because of illness, sick leave, disciplinary action, layoff or leave of absence of more than one week at a time (except military service leave of absence): 6 days for a 6-month progression step interval, and 9 days for a 9-month progression step interval. Separate absences of one or more full days and individual leaves of absence of more than one week (including holidays observed on days in the basic workweek which fall during the leave of absence), for the above purposes, within the salary progression step
43
interval shall be accumulated to determine the total days of absence. A holiday occurring during a full-day disability absence, does not count as a day of disability absence and accordingly shall not be included in the total days of absence. A holiday occurring during a period when the employee is being paid at State Plan rate is counted as a day of disability and shall be included in the total days of absence.
In the case of an employee who has entered, or who enters, military service and whose scheduled increase is due after the last day worked, such increase will not be applicable in determining any compensation payable by the Company (Military Service Salary Roll) during any portion of the time the employee is on military leave of absence.
Increase Under Wage Progression
Schedule for Employee Returning
From Military Service
When employees return from military service as defined in Article XI, Section 1, of the Agreement, their rate of pay shall reflect, in accordance with existing practice in District Offices, all salary adjustments which they would have received had they not entered military service.
The adjusted rate, as determined above, will be payable effective with the employees’ reinstatement on the Company’s active payroll.

Temporary Assignments ’
It is understood that employees may be temporarily assigned to other kinds of work of equal or lesser grade within their capabilities. However, the Commercial Manager shall discuss in advance with the Union, the general principles to be followed in selecting employees for such temporary assignments. Such discussion shall include consideration of the effects such temporary assignments shall have upon the workload in the occupational group from which the assignment is made, and upon the assigned employee’s workload upon return to the employee’s regular classification. Disagreements between the parties to such discussion may be resolved by use of the grievance procedure outlined in the current Agreement between the Company and the Union.
In instances where the necessity for temporary assignment cannot be foreseen, sufficiently in advance to permit discussion with the Union, and therefore, cannot be scheduled in advance, the above procedure shall not apply.

MEMORANDUM CONCERNING PERFORMANCE OF “ELIGIBLE” WORK BY “INELIGIBLE” EMPLOYEES AGREEMENT REFERENCE: Art. I, Sec. 2
Specific provision in the Agreement covering performance of “eligible” work by “ineligible” employees is as follows:
“...It is understood that employees in supervisory and confidential positions may perform work assignable to employees of the bargaining unit, when occasion requires.”
The following general principles shall govern such work performance by ineligible employees:
1.	Basically, ineligible supervisors have bona fide supervisory responsibilities and authority.
(a)	However, depending upon the size of the department and circumstances, supervisory duties may not require the full time of the supervisor. The supervisor can, under such circumstances, perform “eligible” work as occasion requires.
(b)	In addition, a supervisor may perform routine work covering:
Lunch periods
Emergencies and to handle special rush work
Illness
Vacations
Expediting service to customers; for example, Supervisor-Service will handle customers.
Present practice of performance of eligible work is to be continued. Examples:
The Supervisor-Service will continue to handle customers.
2.	However, the plan should not be applied to permit so-called “abuses”.
Ineligible supervisors should not be assigned to “eligible” work which would result in depriving eligible employees of overtime, except where this may be a by-product of the above (Example: Supervisor-Service handling customers during peak period just before 4:30 P.M.).
Ineligible supervisors should not be assigned to such work to avoid overtime on special jobs (Example: Work of the type involved in the gas load survey in February and March, 1953).
3.	Ineligible supervisors shall not be assigned to “eligible” work for the sole purpose of avoiding the upgrading of an employee to perform necessary work.
Examples:
The Supervisor-Customer Accounts should not go into a station and do the full-time job of a Senior Bookkeeper in order to avoid a temporary upgrading of another employee to the Senior Bookkeeper position. However, the Supervisor-Customer Accounts can handle the work assignment functions of a Senior Bookkeeper in the temporary absence of the Senior Bookkeeper when it is not necessary to fill the temporary Senior Bookkeeper vacancy.
The Supervisor-Customer Accounts can assist in locating errors in cycle balances in the absence of a Senior Bookkeeper, but should not perform the normal balancing operation.

Dear Mr. Sweeney:
SECOND STEP GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
As part of the negotiation of the Agreement to be effective May 1, 1961, a change was agreed upon in the grievance procedure as it relates to the second step of that procedure. This change will provide in the future for the attendance, if the Union desires, of the President of the Union, or in the President’s absence, another member of the Union Executive Committee, at second-step discussions under certain conditions as follows:
1.	Matters may be discussed informally, as at present, between the Commercial Manager and representatives of the Union outside of the grievance procedure.
2.	As at present, local consideration of a second-step grievance, as such, shall be preceded by the submission of the grievance in writing by the party initiating it.
3.	Upon completion of the local second-step discussions, the Commercial Manager shall state a decision and shall permit the Union representatives up to three working days (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) to request the optional second-step meeting. The present 10 working day period for confirming the decision in writing shall start with the workday following the decision to use or not to use the optional meeting provision or following the optional meeting, whichever is later.
4.	It is fully understood that the Company may designate any Management representatives it wishes to attend meetings held under the optional second-step procedure.
5.	It is further understood by the President of the Union shall in no way increase the extent of time away from work by local office employees beyond what would be expected in the absence of this procedure, except for the time required to attend the optional meeting.
Very truly yours,
(Sgd.) D. S. Lord

Dear Mr. Sweeney:
CONSIDERATION OF PERMANENT AND MILITARY SERVICE REPLACEMENT (M.S.R.) EMPLOYEES IN MILITARY SERVICE FOR POSTED VACANCIES
During negotiations of the Agreement between the Company and the Union, effective May 1, 1967, it was agreed to amend Article XIV, Section 1, Promotions and Transfers - Positing Vacancies and Applications, to provide for considering permanent and military service replacement (M.S.R.) employees in military service as having filed an application for a posted vacancy provided such employees have at least the minimum qualifications for the position being filled.
This letter will confirm the understanding reached covering the various aspects involved in the administration of the amendment to the Agreement as follows:
1.	Permanent and “military service replacement” (M.S.R.) employees in military service shall be considered as applicants for job vacancies posted during their absence provided such employees have at least the minimum qualifications for the position being filled.
2.	(Revised in accordance, with the letter to “Benjamin Percario, President, Utility Co-Workers’ Association”, dated December 18, 1975.)
When an employee in military service is considered as an applicant for a job vacancy and is the successful candidate, the permanent position to which the employee has been promoted shall be reserved until return from military service. However, while in military service the employee shall earn all progression credit in the position to which the employee was promoted. When the employee returns from military service the employee shall be reinstated in the permanent position to which the employee was promoted and shall receive all progression credit the employee would have earned had the employee not been in the military. A trial period shall be established in accordance with Article XIV, Section 6, of the Agreement.
3.	The temporary vacancy created because a permanent position is being reserved for an employee in military service shall be filled on a temporary assignment basis pending the return of the employee from military service. Effective on the date of reinstatement, all employees affected thereby will be returned to their former status.
4.	When an employee is awarded more than one promotion while in military service, the promotion to the last position shall be effective on the date of the employee’s reinstatement and shall be administered as outlined in the preceding paragraphs. In such cases, the temporary vacancy in the position to which the employee in military service was first promoted will become a permanent vacancy upon selecting the employee in military service for another promotion.
5.	Where possible, the Commercial Manager will notify the employee in military service of the employee’s selection for promotion and that the position will be reserved for the employee pending the employee’s return from military service unless the employee declines the future promotion.
Very truly yours, (Sgd.) F. A. Brock, Jr.

Dear Mr. Sweeney:
LANGUAGE INERPRETING ASSIGNMENTS
This is to confirm the understanding reached between the Company and the Union regarding interpreting at the office for customers unable to communicate in English.
It is understood and agreed that employees working within the office demonstrating bilingual ability may be called upon to perform as interpreters for inquiries received by telephone, mail or in person from customers unable to communicate in English. When an employee is designated to interpret and performs as an interpreter, the employee shall be paid for such interpreting at the appropriate step of the rate one salary grade above the salary grade in which the employee is assigned, or an additional $1.25 per hour, whichever is greater. Employees performing less than ten hours of interpreting in a week will be paid at the higher rate for a minimum of ten hours for that week. The minimum upgrading of ten hours in a week may be less than ten hours in a week may be less than ten hours if the employee is not at work for a full week. Attached are some examples of the application of the minimum upgrading provision.
It is further understood and agreed that interpreting assignments will be distributed equitably among qualified employees on a weekly basis, so that in each office one employee will be designated to receive such assignment each week, provided a qualified employee is available to receive such assignments. A record will be maintained in each office of the weekly rotational assignments and the time spent in such .assignments.
Should an employee designated for interpreting in a specific week be away from work when an interpreting assignment is to be made, then a second qualified employee may be designated and will become eligible for minimum upgrading on the basis of two hours per workday so assigned. Under such circumstances, the second designated employee will not lose a turn in rotation for receiving future interpreting assignments.
The minimum upgrading provision often hours per week will apply only to interpreting assignments in the language predominantly requiring interpretation in the office. When an employee is assigned to interpreting in a language other than the principal language requiring interpretation, the employee shall be upgrade on the basis of two hours per workday so assigned. An employee possessing multilingual ability will be upgraded on the basis of minimum upgrading of ten hours for the week, or two hours per workday so assigned, as appropriate, regardless of the number of languages used in interpreting assignments.
It is also understood and agreed that the weekly rotational and minimum upgrading provisions referred to above apply solely to language interpretation assignments to employees working within the office.
Very truly yours, (Sgd.) F. A. Brock, Jr.
General Manager — Industrial Relations
Notes: Gender identification has been eliminated throughout.
The letter was amended effective 5/1/89 to include option to increase pay rate by $1.00/hr.
The letter was amended effective 5/1/91 to include option to increase pay rate by $1.25/hr.

EXAMPLES OF APPPLICATION
OF MINIMUM UPGRADING
FOR LANGUAGE INTERPRETING ASSIGNMENTS
Example No. 1
Employee “A” is designated to receive interpreting assignments for a given week and performs as an interpreter on Monday. However, the employee is absent from work for the balance of the week. Employee “B” is designated to replace employee “A” for interpreting assignments for the balance of the week and performs as an interpreter on Friday of the week.
In this case, employee “A” would receive minimum upgrading of two hours for Monday. Employee “B” would receive minimum upgrading of eight hours for the days of Tuesday through Friday. Employee “B” would not lose a tum in rotation for receiving future interpreting assignments.
Example No. 2
Employee “A” is designated to receive interpreting assignments for a given week and performs as an interpreter on Monday morning. During lunch hour of employee “A”, a need arises for interpreting in the language predominately requiring interpretation, and employee “B” is assigned to such interpreting. Employee “A” returns to the office and during the afternoon becomes ill and is directed to go home, returning to work on Friday of that week. Employee “B” is designated to replace employee “A” for interpreting assignments and performs as an interpreter on Thursday. There were no other interpreting assignments in that week.
In this case, employee “A” would receive minimum upgrading of fours hours for Monday and Friday, the two days the employee was at work. In addition, employee “B” would receive minimum upgrading of two hours for the lunch-hour assignment on Monday, plus minimum upgrading of six hours for Tuesday through Thursday. Employee “B” would not lose a tum in rotation for receiving future interpreting assignments.
Example No. 3
Employee “A” is designated to receive interpreting assignments for a given week and performs as an interpreter on Tuesday. The employee is at work for the full week, except for the holiday on Thursday. In this case, the employee would receive minimum upgrading of eight hours, for the days the employee was at work.
Example No. 4
Employee “A” is designated to receive interpreting assignments for a given week. However, the need for interpreting arises during the lunch hours of employee “A” on Monday, Tuesday and Friday; employee “A” performs no interpreting assignments, while employee “B” performs such assignments during the lunch hours of employee “A”. In this case, employee “A” would receive no upgrading, but employee “B” would receive minimum upgrading of six hours for the three days so assigned. Neither employee “A” nor employee “B” would lose a tum in rotation for receiving future interpreting assignments.

WAGE RETENTION
During negotiation of the Agreement, effective May 1, 1975, the company stated that in the event of a layoff or curtailment it would endeavor to retain the wage rate of employees with eighteen or more years of Combined Office seniority unless prudent financial judgment dictates that such a policy cannot be supported at the time.
The implementation of this policy may require transferring of such employees to different job classifications and, if necessary, providing for their transfer to other District Offices.

SHIFT ASSIGNMENTS - UNION REPRESENTATIVES
This letter confirms the agreement reached on September 25,1980, with regard to certain Union representatives subject to shift work at the Customer Inquiry and Accounting Centers.
Members of the Executive Committee of the Union (limited to 7 in number, including member(s) on full-time leave of absence), the Chairperson - northern Customer Inquiry and Accounting Center and the f Chairperson — southern Customer Inquiry and Accounting Center, if subject to shift work, shall be given the option of working the 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. shift, Monday to Friday.
A Union representative covered in the above paragraph, if assigned to a shift other than 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (Monday - Friday), shall exchange his/her shift assignment with the employee having least Combined Office seniority on the 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. shift (Monday — Friday), unless another employee on the 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. shift is willing to exchange shifts.
If in any one payroll week the change to the new schedule would result in an employee working less than 40 hours, due to the way in which the scheduled days off occur under the two schedules, the employee shall be scheduled to work at the straight time rate so as to give him/her 40 hours for the week. The Company will not assume any additional costs resulting from such changes in shift assignments.

Dear Mr. Bello:
IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE VI, SECTION 12 WORK ON OTHER THAN REGULAR SHIFT
During negotiation of the Agreement (CAMS) effective May 1, 1982, it was agreed to add the above Section to the Agreement. As agreed, the Company will designate six G308 Service Representative positions at the northern Customer Inquiry and Accounting Center and four G308 Service Representative positions at the southern Customer Inquiry and Accounting Center as “floaters”. The regular schedule for the employees who fill these positions will be Monday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. However, the employees who fill these positions will be subject to transfer to different shifts and/or workday schedules on a rotational basis. The terms and conditions of such transfers are outlined in Article VI, Section 12.
In order to designate the positions involved, as permanent Service Representative vacancies occur in the Monday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. work schedule, Service Representatives, in the order of Combined Office seniority, will be asked if they want to work the open (“floater”) schedule. Employees selecting these positions will be informed of the “floating” requirement. In the event that the schedules are not filled by employees exercising their option, the positions will be posted in accordance with Article XIV, Section 1, of the Agreement. The “Notice of Vacancy in Organization” will include the “floating” requirement. The employees who fill these positions will not be permitted to reselect shifts on an annual basis.
Although it is not expected to occur frequently, in the event that al) of the “floaters” are utilized, a maximum of six Service Representatives at the northern Center and four Service Representatives at the southern Center may be transferred. Such employees will be transferred from the 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. work schedules (Monday to Friday) or if additional employees are necessary, from the 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. work schedule (Monday to Friday), depending on operating conditions.

This letter supersedes letters dated May 1, 1987 and May 1, 1996 entitled, “Meter Reader Transportation.” During negotiation of the Agreement between the Company and the Union, effective May 1, 2002 it was agreed that 369/370 Meter Readers hired on or after August 31, 1987 must have and maintain, in good operating condition, a motor vehicle for use in performing assigned duties.

Meter Readers will not be required to use their personal vehicles on assignments which require that the vehicle be used to travel to each premise.
If the assignment requires the use of a personal vehicle, and the vehicle is under repair because it cannot be driven, a Company vehicle or transportation will be afforded to the Meter Reader for up to five days in any one calendar year.
Permanent 369/370 Meter Readers, hired before August 31, 1987, may use their personal vehicles or use Company transportation to perform assigned duties; on an annual basis if any of these Meter Readers elect to utilize their personal vehicle for an entire year, and job site report, they will receive a $500 lump sum payment in addition to the mileage reimbursement.
The Company will provide all Meter Readers who use their personal vehicles to perform assigned duties with automobile insurance liability coverage in excess of their personal liability insurance coverage. This additional insurance coverage will protect the employee from claims arising out of accidents occurring during their assigned workday. In addition, Meter Readers will be reimbursed the appropriate mileage expense.

During negotiation of the Agreement, effective May 1, 2002 without setting a precedent, the Company and the Union have agreed to assign each permanent full time employee in the 367B Residential Credit and Collection Representative classification at the time of the signing of the Agreement, a 367A Credit and Collection Representative position at the next higher rate closest to their current rate of pay. The terms of this agreement shall not apply to part time 367B Residential Collection Representatives.
101
Permanent full time employees in the 367A classification at the time of the signing of the Agreement will continue to follow their normal progression in the position.
At the present time, the Company has no plans to fill additional full time permanent 367B positions. However, if the need arises to fill these positions in the future, discussions will be held with the Union in advance. The union retains the right to grieve the action.
Very truly yours,
William Dwyer
