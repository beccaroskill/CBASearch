Bargaining unit members who work less than full time shall be entitled to that portion of the appropriate leave as the number of hours per week of scheduled duty relates to the number of hours for a full-time bargaining unit member in a comparable position. Unused days will be accumulated by bargaining unit members for use, if necessary, during succeeding years.
6.12.2	Consistent with Education Code 44977, if additional absences are necessary, and after all earned sick leave days set forth in 6.12.1 above are exhausted, the bargaining unit member, for each illness, shall receive the difference between his/her own salary and the amount paid a substitute, or, if no substitute is employed, the amount which would have been paid to a substitute, at the current per diem substitute rate up to a total of five (5) calendar months in which schools are in session, exclusive of the earned personal illness and injury leave days at full pay. The amount of salary deducted shall not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the salary due him/her. This section is subject to the provisions of 6.12.3 below.

tion is then forwarded to the Director of Human Resources. A committee consisting of four (4) representatives chosen by the Exclusive Representative, five (5) management representatives, including the appropriate subject area coordinator, shall screen applications and recommend candidates to the Superintendent for consideration by the Board of Trustees. Whenever possible, the Board will take action on Sabbatical Leaves within thirty (30) days of receiving the Superintendent's recommendation.

6.13.6	If death prevents the bargaining unit member from fulfilling the agreement to return to the service in the District, no repayment of salary will be required of the bargaining unit member's estate.
6.13.7	Incremental credit will be given for paid sabbatical leave taken.

The final selections, which shall not be arbitrary or capricious, shall be made by the Superintendent or designee. The District shall acknowledge receipt of the voluntary transfer request form within a reasonable amount of time. All applicants for a specific tentative opening will be notified electronically after the opening is filled. The goal is to maintain a list of open positions on a District web page, which will be updated every two (2) weeks.
7.2.1	No later than the first workday in June of each year, the District shall publish on the District’s website and post at all District school sites a list of tentative certificated openings and reductions by school and department for the next school year.

Involuntary transfers may be made when there is a need to reduce staff at the school from which the transfer is made or the transfer may be initiated by the Superintendent/designee when based exclusively on the legitimate educationally-related needs of the District. The District’s selection of transferees will be made with due regard for the bargaining unit member’s qualifications, credentials, record of service with the District, the Education Code and will not be arbitrary or capricious.

7.4.1.1	Efforts shall be made to secure voluntary transfers from the school which must reduce staff before considering involuntary transfers.
7.4.1.2	No bargaining unit member shall be involuntarily transferred outside his/her credential area. If it is educationally unsound to move the least senior member, the next least senior member shall be transferred.

7.4.2.5	The Superintendent/designee shall consult with the Association President/designee with respect to and prior to the implementation of an involuntary transfer. Such consultation shall specify the educational need(s) and confirm that such transfer is not arbitrary or capricious.
7.5	Priority Transfers
A full time bargaining unit member who requests a transfer for two (2) consecutive years and does not have the transfer granted shall be guaranteed a transfer upon his/her third consecutive request. This guarantee shall be dependent upon the existence of open positions for which the bargaining unit member is "credentialed and qualified.” A bargaining unit member may request a particular placement and/or assignment; however, a bargaining unit member is only guaranteed a position, not a specific site or assignment. If a position is offered and rejected by the bargaining unit member, the bargaining unit member loses priority transfer rights. For the purposes of this provision, a bargaining unit member who submits his/her third request and finds that there are no openings available shall be entitled to submit subsequent requests on a consecutive year-by-year basis until an appropriate opening becomes available. A bargaining unit member who has been served with a notice of unprofessional conduct or incompetence as specified in Education Code Section 44938, or where the most recent evaluation has been unsatisfactory, or where the member is currently in a remediation

program shall not be eligible for transfer under this section. Should a bargaining unit member who is otherwise qualified for transfer under this provision be exonerated of charges pursuant to the dismissal provisions for permanent employees specific in the Education Code, or be exonerated of the unsatisfactory evaluation rating through the grievance procedure, he/she will be eligible to apply for this priority transfer upon determination of his/her case. For the purpose of this section, the term "credentialed and qualified" means possession of an appropriate California Credential authorizing service in the subject area in which the bargaining unit member has requested a transfer. In the case of a General Secondary Credential or a multiple subject credential, experience teaching in the given subject area for at least one (1) semester in the last ten (10) years shall be required. Before a bargaining unit member who qualifies for a priority transfer is offered an assignment at another site, the Association and the District will meet and confer. The same timelines for acceptance apply as in Section 7.2.4.
7.6	Open Position(s)
7.6.1	Full-time teaching positions which become open during the course of the school year will be opened to those who have requested transfer to the site involved and are qualified. Minimum qualifications for the purposes of this article means possession of the appropriate credential.
7.6.2	Full-time, non-teaching, bargaining unit positions which become open during the course of the school year will be opened and the positions and qualifications posted to the entire bargaining unit.
7.6.3	Part-time non-teaching bargaining unit positions which become open during the course of the school year may be filled "in-house" for the duration of the school year. Should such position(s) exist the pursuant year, the posi-tion(s) will be opened and posted to the entire bargaining

7.7	Split Assignments
Bargaining unit members normally assigned to one (1) school who, on a daily basis, are subject to a split assignment between sites, shall teach no more than four (4) periods in a school day unless otherwise requested by administration and agreed upon by the bargaining unit member. The bargaining unit member shall have a travel period as part of his/her working day. If a bargaining unit member is assigned to three (3) or more sites, two (2) travel periods will be assigned. If the total travel time is more than two (2) hours per day, a timecard will be provided for the travel time over two (2) hours.
7.7.1	Bargaining unit members on a split assignment between sites may agree to teach a fifth period class for which they will be paid for the extra period taught. (See Appendix B, Extra Period Taught).

8.1	Assignment is the initial placement of a newly-hired bargaining unit member or the yearly placement within the department to which the bargaining unit member is assigned.
8.2	Reassignment is the placement of a bargaining unit member in an assignment within a different department at the same school site.
8.3	Reassignments will not be arbitrary or capricious. Such placements must conform to Education Code and credential requirements.

8.5	The District will make every effort to balance teacher schedules so that equal opportunity is afforded all bargaining unit members who request to teach all levels of courses, regardless of seniority.
8.5.1	The process by which bargaining unit members are considered for such assignments will include consultation with the appropriate parties involved in the particular instructional area. These parties may include department chairpersons, other subject area leaders, other administrators, SACs, evaluators, and any of the individuals who have made specific requests for certain course assignments. This process will also include examination of the qualifications, credentials, training and experience of the individuals who are candidates for the position.
8.6	The District will make every effort to accommodate request/s by bargaining unit members to be reassigned from one department to another within a school site. The process by which bargaining unit members are considered for such reassignment shall parallel the procedures used in implementing Article 8.5.

Grievance Procedure
13.1	A "grievance" is a formal written allegation by a bargaining unit member or the Association acting on behalf of a named bargaining unit member(s) that there has been a violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of the specific provisions of this Agreement. Actions to change the policies of the District or administrative regulations and procedures must be undertaken under separate legal processes. Other matters for which a specific method of review is provided by law, with exception noted below, are not within the scope of this procedure.
13.1.1	Bargaining unit members with concerns or complaints outside the terms of this Agreement have available District Policy 4161 which provides an opportunity for redress.
13.2	A grievance cannot be filed on, and this grievance procedure does not apply to, the content of evaluation of members of the unit, except for alleged violation of procedural matters.
13.3	A "grievant" may be any bargaining unit member of the District covered by the terms of this Agreement.
13.3.1	A group grievance is a grievance which involves the same or similar factual situation and the same District management employee, provided the claim is signed or initialed by those involved in the group grievance.
13.4	A "day" is any day in which the District Office is open for business. A “school day” is any bargaining unit member’s mandatory working day.
13.5	The "immediate supervisor" is the management person having jurisdiction over the grievant as designated by the District.

13.6	Level 1
Within ten (10) school days after the occurrence of the act or omission giving rise to the grievance, the grievant shall notify his/her immediate supervisor, in writing, of his/her intent to file a grievance. After this written notification, the parties have ten (10) days to resolve the issue. The parties are encouraged to solve the issue informally, and if this is not successful, to have a formal Level 1 meeting which will, at the grievant’s request, include an Association site representative and to which the Director of EmployerEmployee Relations may be invited. Both parties shall make a good faith effort to resolve the issue at this level. A grievance resolved at Level 1 may be recorded on the Problem Resolution Form. If the issue is not resolved, the Grievance Form will be completed in order to proceed to Level 2.
13.7	If a grievance arises from act or omission on the part of a member of management at a level above the principal or immediate supervisor, the grievant shall submit such grievance in writing to the person(s) designated at the next highest level and the processing of such grievance will be commenced at Level 2.
13.8	Level 2
If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of his/her grievance at Level 1, he/she must, within five (5) school days (as documented by postmark or by e-mail date) of the conclusion of Level 1 present such grievance to the Director of Employer-Employee Relations. The grievance shall be agendized for the Level 2 Grievance Panel review.
13.8.1	The Level 2 Grievance Panel, which shall be comprised of two (2) Association members and two (2) certificated administrators, shall meet the first Tuesday of each month, with the exception of June, which may have a special hearing schedule which facilitates completing the Level 2

13.8.2	No person who will be involved in the Level 3 process shall participate on the Level 2 Panel.
13.8.3	Level 2 Committee: By the second week of school the Association and District shall each compile a list of ten (10) people who are qualified and willing to participate on the Level 2 Panels. From this list and prior to the October panel hearing, the Association President and Director of Employer-Employee Relations shall assign Panel members and alternates to particular hearing dates.
13.8.3.1	Training for Level 2 Committee Members: The twenty (20) members of the Level 2 Committee shall participate in a joint training process.

Within five (5) days, the District shall deliver to the Association a written response to the Level 2 findings.
13.9	Level 3
If the Association chooses to move the grievance to Level 3, the Association shall notify the District of this determination, in writing, within ten (10) days from receipt of the District’s response to Level 2 findings. Following such notification, the Association shall contact the appropriate arbitrating body within five (5) days. The Association may request that the District participate in State funded, non-binding mediation. If the Mediation is not successful, the timelines for arbitration remain intact. The Association may also request that the District participate in a Mediated Arbitration, which would be binding on the parties. Should Mediated Arbitra

13.9.1	Should the grievance be submitted to Level 3, none of the paperwork submitted at Level 2 shall be used in the positions forwarded either by the District or the Association.
13.9.2	The Association and the District shall attempt to agree upon an arbitrator. If no agreement can be reached, they shall request the State Conciliation Service or American Arbitration Association to supply a list of five (5) names of persons experienced in hearing grievances in public schools. Each party shall alternately strike a name until only one (1) name remains. The remaining name on the list shall be the arbitrator. The Association shall strike the first name. The hearing shall be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect at the time of the Arbitration. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator and the hearing shall be borne equally by the District and the Association. All other expenses shall be borne by the party incurring them. The arbitrator shall, as soon as possible, hear evidence and render a decision on the issue or issues submitted to him/her. If the parties cannot agree upon a submission statement, the arbitrator shall determine the issues by referring to the written grievance and the answers thereto at each step. The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of this Agreement or the written policies, rules, regulations and procedures of the District. After a hearing and after both parties have had an opportunity to make written arguments, the arbitrator shall submit in writing to all parties his/her findings and recommendations which shall be final and binding.
13.10	Reporting to the Board of Trustees: A bi-monthly report, jointly compiled by the District and the Association, shall be made to the Board of Trustees reviewing the status of grievances. This report

13.11	The Association will notify the District annually of its designated grievance representatives who will receive time off from duties for the processing of grievances past Level 1.
13.11.1	Whenever possible, the designated representative shall inform his/her immediate supervisor at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to his/her release from duties for grievance processing. Such time off shall be limited solely to representing a grievant in a conference with a management person, beyond Level 1, and does not include use of time for matters such as gathering information, interviewing witnesses, or preparing a presentation.
13.12	If a grievance is not resolved by the end of the school year, and the grievant is unable to carry it through the vacation period, it shall be continued to the next contractual year. Upon resumption of the procedure, the time limits as agreed to in the grievance procedure shall be adhered to.
13.13	Should a grievance not be resolved by the end of the terminating dates of the contract, the grievance procedure as set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect until resolution of said grievance.

14.1	The bargaining unit member’s regular workday is seven (7) hours, exclusive of a duty-free lunch. These seven (7) hours include fifteen (15) minutes before and after the students’ school day. For purposes of this section, "students' school day" shall include such time modules as might be set at each school for independent study, concilium or similar individual oriented periods. In no event shall a bargaining unit member's workday exceed seven (7) hours exclusive of a duty-free lunch.

Participation by the bargaining unit member in such a modified supervision schedule shall be voluntary.
14.3	All bargaining unit members shall be entitled to a duty-free lunch period of at least thirty (30) minutes duration and at the same time as the lunch period established for students.

Specific preparation hours and availability shall be agreed upon by the part time employee and his/her supervisor at the start of the semester in which the part time status begins. Should no agreement occur, the part time person will be available for a percentage of his/her preparation time during one (1) established period.
14.6	Bargaining unit members who are assigned to more than two (2) preparations for the ensuing year shall be notified by the Principal or designee(s) as to the reason for said assignment prior to making the assignment. For the purposes of this section, bilingual and sheltered courses constitute separate preparations. Combined courses taught during one (1) period are considered a single preparation.
14.6.1	The District shall make every effort to assign bargaining unit members no more than three (3) preparations unless agreed to by the member.

14.10	The District will make every effort to hire a new teacher whenever the need in a subject area at one (1) site reaches a .60 FTE. Should a suitable candidate not be available, sixth (6th) period assignments will first be offered to properly credentialed tenured teachers. If it becomes necessary to offer the position to a temporary or probationary teacher, an ESTA representative will be involved in the process.
14.11	Department chairpersons shall be confirmed by a simple majority vote of all members within a department at each site. The principal will submit one (1) name (or more in the event of co-chairs) for a yes or no vote by the members of the department. Should a majority of the department members vote no, the principal shall submit one (1) new name (or more in the event of co-chairs) and proceed with the same voting process. If the vote results in a tie, the principal may cast the tie-breaking vote. The voting shall be by secret ballot. Voting shall be monitored by the site principal and an ESTA representative.
14.11.1	The selection will be held every two (2) years on even-numbered years (May 2000, May 2002, etc.) The selection will follow the process outlined in 14.11. This selection process shall occur between May 1 and May 15 of those even-numbered years, and the transition shall become effective July 1 of those years.
14.11.2	Any department chair position that becomes open will be filled using the process outlined in 14.11 above.
14.11.3	Members have the right to vote in each department to which they are assigned.

By the end of the third week of August, all sites will provide the Deputy Superintendent copies of scheduling runs which show a minimum of 90% of the total (aggregate) student body placed in six (6) classes. These classes shall not include non-instructional titles such as “Open Period”, “See Counselor,” “See Administrator” and so forth. Any site needing to make changes in teacher allocations will notify the Deputy Superintendent at this time.
E.	Sites which have not met the 90% standard will take steps (designated by the Deputy Superintendent) to remedy this condition within a stipulated timeframe. Such steps may include the assignment of additional workdays for site staff, the District-level management of the scheduling process and/or other actions deemed appropriate and necessary by the Deputy Superintendent in order to achieve the standard. Such steps will be communicated to the Association on a site-by-site basis.
F.	Prior to the opening of school, class size maximums shall be reset to limits as outlined in this Article.
G.	Dates in section 15.2.1 are predicated on an opening of school in the last week of August. Any earlier school opening will adjust these dates accordingly.

15.2.	5 Each site Associate Principal (APED) or equivalent administrator shall meet with his/her site Association Representative in the two (2) summer weeks prior to the opening of school for the purpose of sharing information relative to the status of the site master schedule.
15.	3 As soon as possible in July of each year, the District and the Association shall agree upon the choice of an arbitrator to be used should an expedited arbitration as described in section 15.7 become necessary. A date will be agreed to which falls as close as possible to the twenty-fifth (25th) day of the beginning of the first semester for the appearance of the arbitrator.
15.3.	1 The cost of the arbitration, except for representation fees, will be shared equally by the parties. Any of the above timelines may be extended by mutual written agreement.

If a teacher voluntarily accepts an instructional aide, the class size limit will be increased by five (5). The administration reserves the right to assign an instructional aide to a teacher; should this occur, the class size limit will not be affected.
15.	6 On a voluntary basis, bargaining unit members may agree to teach six (6) periods during one (1) semester and four (4) periods in the other semester. A part-time bargaining unit member may teach more sections during one (1) semester than the other. A full-time assignment is ten (10) periods per school year.
15.	7 Before the seventeenth (17th) day of each semester, the District and the Association shall meet at the District Office or other mutually acceptable location to review current class size loads at every site. Agreement shall be reached about possible solutions for solving overages. These solutions shall be formally transmitted to every site within one (1) day, with a copy provided to the Association. The Associate Principal (APED) at each site shall respond to each proposed solution, with a copy provided to the Association. By the end of the twenty-first (21st) day of each semester, a review of the current master schedule by these same parties shall either yield agreement that compliance has been met, or, in the case of a disagreement, the grievance(s) relative to class size will be consolidated and heard according to the following “expedited” arbitration.
Procedure:

28.1.1	The bargaining unit member will be advised of the existence and substance of the complaint within five (5) workdays of the receipt of the complaint.

Representation
Representation at conferences, as provided in this Agreement (for example, section 5.3, 13.9, 18.4 and 28.1.3), is expected to occur immediately before or after school or during the bargaining unit member's preparation period unless another time is mutually agreed to between the parties. If the agreed-upon time is during the bargaining unit member's or the onsite ESTA representative's instructional time, either or both, as appropriate, will be released from duties during the time of the conference.
If the nature of the conference is such that the bargaining unit member believes it necessary to have an off-site representative present, the conference time will be mutually agreed upon and scheduled within three (3) workdays; provided, however, that if the nature of the conference is such that the administration reasonably believes that the conference needs to occur immediately or before an off-site representative is available, then the bargaining unit member will attempt to obtain an on-site representative or witness before the conference is held.
The three (3) workday timeline may be waived if:
1)	a mutually agreed upon meeting is to occur later than the three (3) day limitation, or
2)	a meeting time cannot be mutually agreed upon. The Association shall make every reasonable effort to accommodate the individual bargaining unit member's and administrator's schedule. In any case, a meeting shall occur within three (3) working days and the administrator involved will schedule the meeting at a reasonable time and a reasonable place.
If the off-site representative is released from duties, he/she shall inform his/her site administration ofhis/her departure and return.

Such replenishment may occur no more than once per year.
A Sick Leave Bank Committee will be established consisting of five (5) members designated by the Association. The Committee is responsible for its own internal organization and for establishing application procedures. The decisions of the Committee are final and binding. Such decisions are not subject to the grievance procedure.
The District shall administer the Sick Leave Bank. The Human Resources Office will set-up and maintain the Bank’s records.
The Sick Leave Bank will become operative when the number of days reaches 100.

b.	Adequate evidence of serious illness or disability.
c.	Evidence of calamity in the immediate family.
