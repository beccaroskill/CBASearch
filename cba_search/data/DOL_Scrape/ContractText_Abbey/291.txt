Attention: Mr, Marc Stepp
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations the Corporation proposed amendments to Section (51) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement and comparable sections of the Parts Depot, Office and Clerical and Engineering Agreements as they apply to Financial Secretaries, Recording Secretaries, and Treasurers. The Union declined on the ground the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has not sufficiently clarified its position on superseniority regarding Financial Secretaries, Recording Secretaries, and Treasurers, Recognizing the legitimacy of the Corporation's concern, however, the Union agrees as follows:
(1)	If and when the NLRB clarifies its position on superseniority regarding Financial Secretaries, Recording Secretaries, and Treasurers, the parties will review Section (51) and comparable sections of the other Agreements in the light of the NLRB's action and make any amendment(s) they agree are appropriate, pursuant to Section (115)(b)(ii) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement and comparable sections of the other Agreements.
(2)	If a complaint is issued by the NLRB challenging the exercise of superseniority by a Financial Secretary, Recording Secretary, and Treasurer the superseniority provisions will be deemed suspended pending the NLRB's final decision in order to toll possible back pay.
(3)	Any final NLRB back pay order against the Union and the Corporation or against the Corporation alone will be shared equally.

(5)	Grievance Procedure
A
International Union, UAW
Attention: M.r<Nat^Q9dpn
Dear Sirs:
Both parties to the Production and Maintenance Agreement signed today acknowledge the desirability of ensuring prompt and fair resolution of employee grievances. The parties also acknowledge the importance of the requirements set forth in Sections (40) Notice of Suspension, Disciplinary Layoff or Discharge and (41) Union Representation. The attached flow chart illustrates the proper sequence of procedural steps to be used in processing employee grievances.
The Corporation assures the Union that it is interested in seeing that all grievances receive prompt and objective consideration on their merits. The Union assures the Corporation that it will make a sincere and determined effort to keep the procedure free of unmeritorious grievances.
Also, during our recent contract negotiations the Corporation pointed out that Special Conferences, as provided for in Section (21), are in some instances being used to circumvent the Grievance Procedure. Such action hinders the expeditious handling of grievances. The parties agree Section (21) was not intended to provide the means for circumvention and abuse of the Grievance Procedure and will put forth their best efforts to eliminate any such abuse.
To further assist in expediting the handling of a grievance, it is understood if a grievance has not been resotved tn Step 2 or Step 3 of the grievance procedure within forty-five (45) days after its appeal from the previous Step, unless held over by mutual agreement between the parties for further discussion, the representative of Management at that Step may answer the grievance in writing without a meeting.
The parties also discussed problems created as a result of the submission of written grievances containing insufficient information. It is agreed that each grievance submitted in writing shall set forth in reasonable detail the date and nature of the grievance, identity of the employee or employees involved by name, seniority date, classification or location, insofar as diligent
10
effort will allow, and the provisions of the applicable agreement, if any, that the Union claims the Corporation has violated. Management's answers will set forth facts taken into account in answering the grievance.

Attention: Mr. Stan Marshall
Dear Sirs:
During the negotiations of the Production and Maintenance Agreement and Parts Depot Agreement dated today, the parties agreed to extend the application of the Special Arbitration Program to each of the Corporation plants covered by this Agreement.
The agreement to extend the Special Arbitration Program is based on the understanding of the parties that the program is designed to provide an expeditious way of submitting to arbitration a limited number of certain discharge and discipline grievances and other arbitrable grievances that involve only credibility issues. The parties agree that grievances which involve any contract interpretation or involve discipline for violation of Section (5) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement or Parts Depot Agreement shall not be subject to the Special Arbitration Program. Further, only grievances filed in writing not more than forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the third step answer, as provided in Section (26) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement or Parts Depot Agreement, will be subject to the Special Arbitration Program, except as provided in Appendix A.
The standards and guidelines for the Special Arbitration Program are attached hereto as Appendix A.

(7)	Reinstated Grievances
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Marc Stepp
Dear Sirs:
During negotiations of the National Production and Maintenance, Office and Clerical, Engineering and Parts Depot Agreements, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its (i) Executive Board, (ii) Public Review Board, or (iii) Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the UAW Chrysler Department may
16
inform the Corporate Labor Relations Staff in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the grievance procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is agreed, however, that the Corporation will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either (i) are already barred under the provisions of the aforementioned National Agreements at the time of reinstatement of the grievance or (ii) that relate to the period between the time of the original disposition and the time of reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Corporation in the grievance procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, provincial, state, or municipal agency.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the Impartial Chairman of the Appeal Board or any other arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved and the Corporation and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations of the parties under the terms of the aforementioned National Agreements, except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any Appeal Board decisions or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this letter agreement and the Corporation's obligation to reinstate grievances as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.

(8)	Grievance - Disciplinary Action
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Marc Stepp
Dear Sirs:
In response to your demand made during the current negotiations, we have agreed that during discussions as early as Step 2 ot the grievance procedure of grievances over discipline, discharge and other terminations from employment, each party will present a statement of position reciting facts then known on which it relies, and a copy of a document or statement on which the party relies to support its position.
In the case of a document covering, or statement by, an employee who is not the grievant, the party relying on it may excise, block out, or otherwise remove, information on it that is not relevant or that would disclose the identity of the person who made the statement or concerning whom the document refers.
In cases where a prior disciplinary record is involved, the Corporation may present a written summary of the grievant’s disciplinary record.
The statement of position and other statements and
documents that a party has provided the other shall become part
of the grievance file and may be referred to in subsequent steps of the grievance procedure, including the Appeal Board.
The failure or refusal of the Union to present a full oral explanation of its position shall relieve the Corporation from presenting any statement or document on which it relies. The failure or refusal of a party to make available to the other a copy of a document or statement which it has in its possession and on which the party relies shall preclude the party from using it before the Appeal Board.	<
‘i
The Corporation expressed its concern that its providing to j Local Union representatives involved in processing grievances 4 copies of employee statements and corporate documents i relating to employees may lead to abuses unless the statements j and documents (i) are used solely in connection with the proper | processing of a grievance, (ii) are otherwise kept confidential, j and {iii) are not in any way used by any member of the |
18
bargaining unit to attempt to harass or intimidate an employee giving a statement or providing a document. The Union assured the Corporation that it will instruct its Local and International Representatives of these restrictions on the use of such material and the need to maintain confidentiality. The Union further represents that if a copy of a statement or document provided it in accordance with this Letter Agreement is used by its representatives or those under their control for any purpose other than the proper processing of a grievance or is publicized outside of the grievance procedure, the Corporation would be relieved of any obligation under this Letter Agreement at the plant where the abuse occurred.

Dear Sirs:
In the past there have been limited situations in which the Corporation and the International Union have mutually agreed that, notwithstanding the provisions of Section (31) Time Limit on Claims, equity and fairness dictated that the time limits be waived regarding (a) claims by an employee or by the Union, including claims for back wages, and (b) deductions from an employee's wages to recover overpayments.
This letter will confirm that in such instances of mutual agreement between the Corporate Labor Relations Department and the Chrysler Department of the International Union, the limitations set forth in Section (31) may continue to be waived in order to provide equitable and fair resolution of such matters.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Marc Stepp
Dear Sirs:
During the negotiations (of the 1985 National Production , and Maintenance Agreement - Representation and Grievance Procedure Subcommittee), the Union requested the parties extend Letter (9) Time Limit On Claims to the local level, citing a question of Payment In Lieu Of Vacation for a number of former Mack Avenue employees presently receiving Workers • Compensation payments.	;
While Letter (9) is silent as to the mechanics for dealing 3 with these or other matters, the practice has been for the i Corporate Labor Relations Department and the Chrysler | Department of the International Union to deal only with grievances that have been appealed to the Appeal Board. The -Union's position was that this practice, in cases like those cited, creates an unnecessary delay in payments to employees when » both the Corporation and the Union clearly agree that these ! payments would be proper.
As a result, the Corporation and the Union did agree that ! cases where the Corporate Labor Relations Department and the Chrysler Department of the International Union clearly agree that payments to or deductions from an employee's wages to recover overpayments would be proper that the local parties would be ' given the authority to settle the matter without a grievance j having to be appealed to the Appeal Board. In cases where the i Corporate Labor Relations Department and the Chrysler ]
20
Department of the International Union do not clearly agree that payments to or deductions from an employee's wages to recover overpayments would be proper, the present practice of requiring grievances to be appealed to the Appeal Board shall be continued by the parties.

SUBSTANTIATION OF ILLNESS-RELATED ABSENCES --Employees absent due to medical reasons are not required to provide a diagnosis if they were seen and treated by a physician 21
on the first day of an absence. Employees absent due to medical reasons, who are not treated and seen by a physician on the first day of absence, may be required to provide a diagnosis.
A
This agreement will be communicated with Corporation HR staffs by the following:
"In order to receive excused absence reason coding,
An employee absent for medical reasons for one (1) day is no longer required to submit a diagnosis on the doctor's letter substantiating the absence if treated by a physician. All other information as noted in the Corporation’s policy regarding medical substantiation remains required.
An employee absent for medical reasons for two (2) to four (4) days must treat no later than the second day of absence. If treated on the first day of absence, no diagnosis is required. If treated on the second day, the employee must provide a diagnosis (if requested), and the substantiation must cover the employee's first day of absence. All other information as noted in the Corporation’s policy regarding medical substantiation remains required.
Note: The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) requires that information obtained regarding the medical condition of an employee/bargaining unit member be treated as a confidential medical record. Consequently, a bargaining unit member's medical condition must be accorded the highest level of privacy possible. It should only be discussed on a need to know basis.
Diagnoses remain required for leaves of five (5) or more days. In addition, a diagnosis would continue to be required if : employee seeks FMLA (FML1, FML2, and FML3) or Workers’ : Comp (WRKC) coding, or if the employee seeks a PQX restriction."	.

iv)	Definition of One (1) Week -- For the purposes of calculating the "rolling" nine (9) month and "locked" twelve (12) month periods of active, on-roll employment, a layoff period of one (1) week means seven (7) consecutive calendar days,
v)	Holidays - Days designated as holidays pursuant to Section (95) of the National P&M Agreement shall be considered to be active, on-roil days of employment.

A
Gabriel N. Alexander, Esquire
21910 Greenfield
Oak Park, Ml 48237
Dear Mr. Alexander:
In Appeal Board Case No. 1664 the Impartial Chairman said that "the mere presence of proof of failure to meet a rate of production requires the Chairman to approve the propriety of discipline unless, by some means other than a showing of non-compliance with Sections (46)-(48) (now Section (44)) it is established that the fault did not lie with the employee." Nevertheless, the undersigned agree that the provisions of Section (44)(c) of the National Production and Maintenance Agreement dated November 2, 1961, give the Appeal Board power and authority to determine the propriety of the penalty imposed by management in disciplinary discharges and layoffs for violation of Section (59), Work Standards, of said Agreement, and that the mere presence of proof of an employee's failure to meet a disputed work standard does not require the Appeal Board or the Chairman to approve the propriety of the discipline assessed to an employee.
The disposition of any such case shall be on the merits but shall not involve the propriety of any disputed work standard or work load assignment performed by the grievant or grievants.
In any such determination, the Appeal Board will take into consideration any relevant facts occurring prior and subsequent to the time the penalty in question was imposed.
This letter shall not be construed to limit or otherwise impair any right Section (2) reserves to the Corporation, including the right to establish and maintain work standards.or rates of production and to discipline employees.

Dear Sirs:
ft During the recently concluded negotiations, the Union Eft expressed great concern regarding employees who have been sk indefinitely laid off for an extended period of time and who are Ig. unlikely to be given job placement opportunities under the work opportunity provisions of the Production and Maintenance Agreement within their own labor market area because of the
H number of employees on layoff.
|& The Corporation stated it shared the Union's concern and ft advised the Union that during the term of the Agreement, it ft intends to continue the current practice of extending the work O opportunity provisions of the Agreement to such employees who ft are hired at a plant outside their labor market area.

[v Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations the Union claimed some plants utilized forty-five (45) days to displace lesser seniority employee pl pursuant to Section 61(d) of the 1993 P&M Agreement even Ifwhen such displacements could have occurred sooner without [g adversely impacting operations.
34

The Corporation pointed out there were instances where | the excessive number of employees to be placed, the number of displacements in a particular department, the need to train | employees, or anticipated layoffs or recalls, required the | Corporation to utilise up to 45 days.	I
The parties agreed that displacements under Section 61(d) shall occur within thirty (30) days of an employee's layoff. The Union agreed, however, that where there are substantial * numbers of employees to be placed pursuant to Section 61(d) or s
a large number of displacements will occur in a department or || where training is required, the Corporation and International || Union may agree to extend the time provided by up to two (2) fa weeks so that displacements can be made on a programmed u and the efficiency of &

In this connection, the Corporation is willing, pursuant to Incorporate Employment, Placement and Development Bulletin No. 82-4 dated July 7, 1982, to waive a medical examination for an employee who has been laid off from a closed plant for less H than one year, provided the employee did not experience an |j|.illness or injury during that layoff period.
Ot In addition, the Corporation agreed that in the case of an ^employee whose medical record from the closed plant shows a ■^medical restriction and in the case of an employee subject to a fjlmedical examination, the Employment Department of the receiving plant will advise such an employee of the nature of any l^medical restriction which prevents the employee’s hire at that implant.

International Union, UAW
Attention^ Mr? NateGooden
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations the parties discussed at length I the problem concerning the inability of long service employees to i transfer between departments when employees on indefinite ] layoff had recall rights to those departments pursuant to Section 1 61(e).	j
It was agreed an employee with 10 or more years of seniority may transfer, notwithstanding Section 61(e), to a department that has employees on indefinite layoff.
Dear Sirs:
R
Eg During the negotiations concluded today, the parties held [p extensive discussions regarding the Corporation’s contention EX that employee transfers under Section 66(c) would adversely Lv affect product quality and the efficiency of plant operations during certain periods, such as model launch, line speed change, model mix, major production increases and the addition ft or elimination of a shift, when it is usually impractical to |X effectuate such transfers.
In view of the seriousness of the problems discussed, the m parties agreed that employee transfers under Section 66 (c) may r£ be suspended during the aforementioned periods. However, it is understood that Plant Management will allow employees who are denied transfers during such periods to later displace probationary employees hired in a department before such Eg' employees gain seniority provided the efficiency and product re quality of the involved departments are not adversely affected.

(34) Utilization of Skilled Trades
;	Manpower and Facilities
| International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Marc Stepp
Dear Sirs:
i During the negotiations leading to the Production and ^Maintenance Agreement today, the Union raised its serious ^ concerns over outside contracting of skilled trades work and the fuse of outside contractors to perform maintenance and
& construction work. The Corporation raised its equally serious ^concern with certain restrictive work practices.
gf.	j
W The Union expressed an interest in establishing procedures
assure maximum utilization of the Corporation's manpower,
^‘machinery and facilities.	:'■
Sr
Ip The Corporation expressed an interest in correcting certain	)|l
^work assignment practices which limit the efficient performance	•
igpf some skilled trades work in the Corporation's plants.
Hk'
Therefore, in the interest of resolving these inseparable
^mutual concerns, the parties have discussed various aspects of	; j
|lhe problem and reached the following understandings.
^Maintenance and Construction	> I
if
t'	43
1.	It is the policy of Chrysler Corporation to perform | maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the | manpower, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do | the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and | within the projected time limits. At times the Corporation does | not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the | past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any | particular work or let the work to outside contractors. This letter | is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.	«
2.	The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its | general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own I skilled trades employees to perform maintenance work to the 1 extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past. 1
3-	The Corporation is genuinely interested in maintaining S maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades || employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation. Therefore, in making these determinations, the Corporation || intends always to keep the interest of Chrysler personnel in mind.	1
4.	In applying the provisions of Paragraph (11)(f) of the j| Supplemental Agreement-Special Provisions Pertaining to |1 Skilled Trades Employees it is our intention that, except where a time and circumstances prevent it, any "advance discussion’ b held tn accordance with those provisions take place before any |l final decision has been made as to whether the work should be || contracted out.
5.	In those cases when the work to be performed is not 0 started by the contractor within forty-five (45) days following the || approximate starting date given to the Union pursuant to Section || (11)(f), and the Union believes the circumstances in the plant&r| have changed sufficiently to warrant review of the initial decision®] to let the contract, the Union, upon request, will be given an ?1 opportunity to comment on the changed circumstances. To the^ extent practicable, the Corporation will give weight to suchS! comments.
It is important that the Corporation advise the Union of any| or all of the factors mentioned in the above provisions which It* will take into consideration in determining whether a particular^' contract should be let out or not. Information provided in the" course of the "advance discussion" will include, where applicable, cost data, blue prints and time constraints so that the Union will be given a better opportunity to make its comments’
44
and the Corporation will also be given an opportunity ,lto give weight to those comments in the light of all attendant fc circumstances."
Equipment Rental

The Corporation further stated that when the lack of equipment is the only factor upon which the decision turns to let work to an outside contractor, the Corporation will first give proper consideration to renting or leasing such needed equipment provided it is readily available at a cost which, when added to other factors, does not exceed the cost of having the work performed by an outside contractor.
Warranty and Service Agreements
On the matters of warranty and service agreements, the Corporation cannot agree to any limitation or restriction on its right to enter into such agreements. However, in making decisions as to the need and duration of such agreements, the Corporation will give proper consideration to the operating needs of the business, the efficiencies and economies involved and all other relevant considerations, including the effect of the decisions on its skilled trades maintenance employees. Upon expiration of a warranty agreement, management will consider assigning such repair work to the plant skilled trades employees. In cases where management is contemplating placement of a , service contract, the written notice and discussion provisions * usually applicable to Outside Contracting shall be utilized.
Too! and Die Contracting

You have discussed with us at great length the possible effect on our skilled tool and die and model employees of decisions of the Corporation to buy some of its tools, dies, and models, rather than make them.
As we have pointed out to you in current negotiations, there Ew are many and varied factors that may influence any particular decision to make or buy. We do not believe it is feasible to list 1®. general criteria. However, the Union has stated in our fit discussions that it recognizes a number of them, such as the |J£need, among other things, to contract work that requires '■"specialized tools and equipment and special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model changes and rearrangement deadlines.
In view of the foregoing, we have advised you that the -'-^Corporation cannot agree to any limitation or restriction on its
45

right and responsibility to decide whether to make tools, dies, and models, or to buy them. However, we wish to make clear to you that it is our policy, in making such decisions, to give proper < consideration to the operating needs of the business, the ' efficiencies and economics involved and all other relevant j considerations, including the effect of the decisions on work opportunities of tool, die and model employees.	1«
j *■
Where the Corporation considers that work practices or provisions of local agreements in its Tool, Die and Model Departments may be having an adverse effect in the Corporation's ability to compete in this field effectively, it will discuss such matters on a timely basis with the Local Union and explore with it fully the possibilities of taking practical steps with ® respect to such matters to the end of improving the employment opportunities of such employees. The Skilled Trades & Representative of the Corporation is also willing to meet from $ time to time with the Skilled Trades Representative of the International Union to discuss, and provide information relative S to plans the Corporation is formulating and decisions it is contemplating concerning tool and die contracting on a 41 corporate-wide basis. A representative of an affected plant is -’a wilting to meet from time to time with the Skilled Trades Committeeman at the plant to discuss, and provide information relative to plans the plant is formulating and decisions it is II contemplating concerning tool and die contracting by the plant, j
In addition, the Corporation agrees to review the work load 1 capacity of its Tool, Die and Model Departments against the 4 operating needs of the business on a corporate-wide basis to Ute 1 end of improving the employment opportunities of such skilled | trades employees.	1
Work Assignment Practices	$
The International Union, UAW, recognizes that certain work I assignment practices exist which limit the efficient performance of some skilled tradesmen and that such inefficient practices || must be corrected. The International Union will assist local || unions and plant management to achieve this objective. O
In each plant, the skilled trades committeeman and the $1 superintendent shall endeavor to correct these inefficient work$| assignment practices in a cooperative and non-adversarial JI manner. If, however, agreement cannot be reached, the matter, |] may be referred to the Skilled trades Representatives of the1 UAW Chrysler Department and of the Corporate Labor Relations || Staff who shall jointly review the matter and assist in resolution JI of the issues in dispute.	W
» In those cases where corrections are made, the £ Corporation will retain existing work or, where appropriate, return to the bargaining unit work which had previously been ® contracted out. Further, improvements in plant operations that S may result from more efficient work assignments will not result in S the indefinite layoff of affected Journeymen and Permanent Employees who the parties agree may, in such circumstances, be used on other work. It is understood this application shall not Eg adversely affect the seniority provisions pertaining to skilled g? trades employees. However, factors such as schedule or volume changes, technological improvements and other changes not K related to more efficient work assignments, may continue to result in reductions or increases in the number of employees
Lj; required.

Supplemental Agreement - Special Provisions Pertaining to ii Skilled Trades Employees, or such other courses that may be designated by the Corporation such as the Industrial Electronics ^ Training Program, for each week the employee attends class ■ while on temporary layoff as specified below. The Corporation reaffirmed that position during the current negotiations.
% An employee will earn the training bonus by attending the specified training courses while on temporary layoff and satisfactorily completing the applicable training courses in which the employee was enrolled at the time of temporary layoff.
j . The amount of each week's bonus will be calculated by ^multiplying the employee's straight-time hourly rate on the last

(b)	The actual number of hours the employee attends class during a week for which an employee does not receive a Supplemental Unemployment Benefit.
The total training bonus will be an amount equal to the sum of the training bonus for each week the employee may earn it.

September 29.V2003. Shall apply to employees in skilled trades classifications.
Pursuant to agreements made in our discussions of the matter, it also understood that any system of sharing time off between Journeymen, Temporary Employees, and Temporary Employees With Seniority must take into consideration the relative numbers of such employees in each trade at the plant and the nature of the work to be performed during the period of each temporary layoff. On this basis therefore, we are in agreement that following the temporary layoff provisiohsZof teprvCQO), the manner in which the principle of inverse seniority is thereafter implemented may be resolved on a mutually satisfactory basis between the Local Union and Management at each plant provided that in each instance of temporary layoff the number of Journeymen or Temporary Employees with Seniority who have the necessary skills to perform the available work will be retained.
In the event any such local system of implementation becomes unsatisfactory it may be terminated at any plant by either the Local Union or the Management, upon written notice to the other party, in which event the matter shall immediately be referred to the DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union, UAW and the Corporate Union Relations Staff for resolution.

During these negotiations the Union expressed its deep .4 concern over outside contracting matters which are addressed in £ Letter 34, "Utilization of Skilled Trades Manpower and Facilities." $ In particular, the Union cited failure to follow the advance notice and discussion provisions of said letter.
In response to the Union's concern, the Corporation '4 informed the Union a letter would be sent to Group and Plant 3 Personnel Managers following negotiations which would read as ,4 follows:
"During the current agreement we have experienced many .$■ labor relations problems in the plants in handling contracting • | matters.
S. "In many of these instances the root cause of the problem is lack of communication. The Chrysler-UAW National P&M

^Dear Sirs:
During the current negotiations, the Union complained there ■Julias been inconsistent administration of the "Warranty and [^Service Agreements" provisions of Letter (34) - Utilization of \Skilted Trades Manpower and Facilities. The Union indicated that plant managements insist on warranties beyond normal ^periods of time and that our skilled trades employees are not .assigned to the new equipment or machinery until long after it , has been in the plant. This does not provide the opportunity for /our own skilled trades to learn how to keep such equipment ■'Operating effectively.
The Corporation informed the Union that good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to ■assure that the equipment purchased by the Corporation 'performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract.
The Corporation agreed to remind the purchasing representatives that the training and expertise that will be required of our own skilled trades must also be kept in mind as ^important business consideration. The transition from vendor to our employees and the training and timing of the transition are important parts of that consideration.
jg Jn addition, the Corporation reaffirms its commitment that ( written notification and discussion provisions applicable 67
under Letter (34) - Utilization of Skilled Trades Manpower and Facilities shall be utilized where placement of Warranty and Service Agreements are contemplated.

Dear Sirs:
This will confinn our understanding that a Temporary^ Employee With Seniority indefinitely laid off from a closed plant | shall be credited with the seniority date he had at the closed plant when placed in the same apprenticeable classification in j another plant in accordance with the provisions of the | Memorandum of Understanding On Plant Closings.	S
| The parties have agreed to utilize the DaimlerChrysler five-|. minute hourly placement test as a base line for the selection and I placement process for the Skills Improvement Program (SIP). | Prospective candidates who express an interest in becoming a I Temporary Employee and who are working at facilities interested [. in utilizing Temporary Employees in the Skills Improvement I' Program, will be required to take the test battery and score a I, minimum of twelve (12) points for passing. A facility-specific | listing of employees who scored a minimum of twelve (12) points | will be maintained by the Corporation and provided to each | affected facility for utilization in completing the selection process.
t A local selection committee consisting of the Skilled Trades | Committeeman and a specified member of local Management
78
79
will review other relevant factors such as previous applicable work experience in the particular trade, employee attendance records, discipline history, and non-skilied seniority. The most qualified candidate'’ will be jointly selected as a Temporary Employee for placement into the available skilled trades opening. When the local selection committee determines that two or more candidates are equally qualified, the employee with the highest plant seniority date will be selected for placement into the available opening.
The parties recognize it is more desirable to secure Journeymen by hiring and by training through established apprentice training programs and the above understanding is not intended to in any way restrict the Corporation's rights in that regard.

f In the negotiations of the National Production and ? Maintenance Agreement between Chrysler Corporation and the i UAW dated today certain interpretations were developed. The Corporation's interpretation of the applicable sections of the
* Agreement will be as follows:
1.	Saturday work. Section (86) provides:
S "Time and one-half will be paid as follows, except as || provided in Section (88):
„	"(b) - For time worked on Saturday, except when a shift
; starts on Friday and continues into Saturday; provided, that vhours in excess of eight (8) per day or forty (40) per week on i’ such shift will be paid at time and one-half."

:	In interpreting Section (86)(b), it is understood that
• employees who work a shift on Saturday or Friday into Saturday £that normally would be their sixth day worked but have not yet iworked five (5) straight-time shifts in the workweek due to an Sabsence during the workweek will receive time and one-half for the hours worked on Saturday. This interpretation is intended to ^tcover the third shift Sunday Night Start employee who works a ,&sixth scheduled shift, and the first or second shift employee in Rthe situation covered by Appeal Board Case No. 3855.
?£	2. Saturday following a holiday. Except as specified in
^Paragraph 1 above, employees whose shift begins on Friday Stand who work into a Saturday do not receive time and one-half §for work on Saturday. A holiday falling during a workweek has no ^effect on the payment of premium for Saturday work.
3.	Work into a new workweek. The workweek is ^defined in Section (93).
"The regularly scheduled workweek starts at 12:01 a.m., ^'Monday, and ends 168 hours thereafter, except those ■employees on third shift operations starting Sunday night in ■which case their regularly scheduled workweek starts with the ■beginning of their shift Sunday night and ends 168 hours K	91

thereafter? It is understood that this includes those employees on seven-day operations.
B determining the same employee's eligibility for payment pursuant to Subsection (c).
Accordingly, (1) a third shift employee who begins a shift on Sunday and wo?ks into Monday will receive double time for hours worked on Sunday and straight time for the hours worked on Monday; (2) a second shift employee who works a shift that starts Sunday and continues into Monday will be paid double time for hours worked on Sunday and time and one-half for hours worked on Monday, provided such hours on Monday are in excess of 40 straight-time hours worked during the week in which the Sunday falls. If such hours on Monday are not in excess of 40, such hours will be paid at straight time until the employee accumulates 40 straight-time hours, and then hours in excess of 40 will be paid at time and one-half. If Monday is a holiday, such hours will be paid at double time.
P "(e) - Double time and one-half for time worked on any of M the days on which any of the designated full holidays is observed unless the holiday fails on one of the employee's tg- regularly scheduled days off in which event the employee, in & addition to his holiday pay under Section (101), will be paid double time for time worked.

tf. 5. The provisions of Sections (86) and (87) shall not Mp preclude mutually satisfactory local arrangements to the effect rrthat when an employee is transferred to a different shift as the result of a reduction in the working force his previous twenty-four & (24) hour period shall terminate for purposes of computing overtime, and the shift to which he is transferred shall be regarded as the beginning of a new twenty-four (24) hour period.
P This provision shall not require a change in any existing local arrangement on this matter.
6. Section (85), Shift Premium and Hours, provides:
«	"(a) - Employees regularly employed on the second or third
shift shall receive in addition to their regular pay for the pay |%period five (5) percent and ten (10) percent, respectively, ^additional compensation.

Consistent with the need to run our operations efficiently, and fully realizing the problems caused you by excessive&l absenteeism, every reasonable effort should be made by the-? 1 plants to accommodate requests for Paid Absence Allowance® made in advance by employees who have good attendance.

The following rules of rounding shall apply to the. determination of the Consumer Price Index:
1.	It the leftmost of the digits discarded is less than 5, the preceding digit is not affected. For example, when rounding to five digits, 130.6§46 becomes 130.§6.	;
2.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is greater than 5, or is 5 followed by digits not all of which are zero, the preceding digit is increased by one. For example, when rounding to Effl digits, 130.55§7 becomes 130.^6.

3.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5, followed by zeros, the preceding digit is increased by one if it is odd and remains unchanged if it is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit retained is even. For example, when rounding to five digits, 130.§5500 becomes 130.§6 and 130.^6500 becomes 130.&6.

f ^International Union, UAW
’ Attention: Mr.aNateGoo3en
i Dear Sirs:
?. DaimlerChrysler Corporation and the UAW continue to > recognize that alcoholism and drug dependency are health ^problems which may be successfully treated, given early £ identification and appropriate rehabilitation therapy. | Furthermore, as with alcoholism and drug dependency, ^emotional disorders and serious personal problems can ^adversely affect job performance.
It is in the Corporation's and Union's mutual interest to [’provide a framework within which UAW-represented ^DaimlerChrysler employees voluntarily and confidentially may ®seek professional counseling, treatment, family intervention, or | other assistance and information about what benefits are ^available to address such problems. Similarly, it is in the parties' interests to generally encourage, educate and otherwise help ^employees pursue more healthful life styles, and expand Educational opportunities in this area for the entire family. ^Working together the Union and the Corporation can achieve ^common goals in those areas. In this regard, the parties ^accordingly established a joint Employee Assistance Program Bunder the UAW/DaimlerChrysler National Training Center
Ek?
The Program provides for: (1) early identification and ^voluntary assessment of seniority employees having alcoholism K.br other drug dependency problems as well as emotional Edisorders or serious personal problems; (2) referral of such ^employees to recognized providers for professional diagnostic Revaluation, counseling or treatment; and (3) an ongoing support ^system with appropriate follow-up on their counseling or ^rehabilitation progress. While the Program's primary purpose is Kto assist employees having such problems and help Union and ^Management Representatives deal effectively with such Ksituations, it also encourages employees to obtain information ■(about the dangers of substance abuse and other addictions, and Eserious family and personal problems?. Additionally, the Barogram covers how to recognize the existence of such ■problems, and the availability of counseling or treatment referral Eservices for immediate family members having such problems.
E	133
Employees with alcoholism, drug dependency, emotional, family, or other personal problems will be able to seek help ■ 4? voluntarily without having to be concerned that their employment-Js status will be affected because they have sought help for such problems. Such employees, however, would continue to be subject to the same standards of performance and conduct expected of any other employee, irrespective of participation in -the Employee Assistance Program. Employees requiring a leave of absence for the treatment of health problems will be issued such leave in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Insurance benefits, if any, for treatment and the absence will be determined in accordance.^ with the Agreement.
The parties recognize the value of conducting criticaL'f^ incident "stress debriefings" after a trauma, such as arjMI employee suicide, a major injury accident, violence or death at^j the work site, etc. Appropriate debriefings for employees^ traumatized by such events are in the best interest of the UnionpJ and the Company. In this regard, the parties agree to continue^ the Critical Incident Response Program. Also, in light increasing workplace violence, the parties have implemented ,e£j| comprehensive Workplace Violence Prevention Program?® ThroughJoint Workplace Violence Prevention Local Response;, a Teams[LRT)l at every location, vrtwse ■ activitiesshal|-^M-! governed by the -rntfotfCMHafeMmMB Procedural Guidelines! designated representatives of union and® management have the opportunity to work cooperatively toward® preventing troubling situations from worsening, while maintaining^! the integrity of their respective roles. The parties agree that the£ ! best way to prevent threats and potential violence from® becoming a reality is by treating all employees with respect and® through early identification, intervention, and referral gftl employees who may be having such problems, to their EAPj® Representatives. The parties also agree to continue updating.® the Workplace Violence Prevention procedures, including Local Response Team Policy and-Procedural Guidelines, an^JI providing awareness, education and training on procedures .for® Local Response Team members through the National Training/.3 Center.	^Tfl
The Joint Activities Board (JAB) will continue to fund tha.W development, central administration and arrangement fl necessary services regarding delivery of the Employee® Assistance Program. The National Training Center will continue® to assist locations in implementing the Program. In that conteJd^fl the National-Training Center will provide training or instructions® deemed necessary to qualify Employee Assistance Program®

Also, the National Training Center will continue its support of alternative counseling techniques, such as a Chaplaincy Program, in support of local 'EAP programs and EAP representatives. Recommendations in this area will be presented to the Joint Activities Board as .appropriate.

respectively by the UAW Vice President and Director of the ^National DaimlerChrysler Department and the Corporation's 'Senior Vice President, Employee Relations.

and
The Plant/PDC Manager, or Human Resources Manager and the local union President will meet monthly with [the EAP representatives to coordinate all EAP Program activities, including promotion of the program to employees, the training of supervisors and union representativesr at their locations, and continuous improvement of the Program, consistent with the provisions of this letter and the guidelines established by the JAB. The EAP representatives will also participate in, and report data reflecting their activities, in a manner not to violate confidentiality, at meetings of the Local Employee Participation Council, (LEPC).
Proposals and requests for funding concerning delivery of ilocat programs and related services under the Program will be previewed by the National Training Center and be subject to •approval by the JAB, In reviewing such proposals, consideration will be given to the availability of funds and proposal consistency with the Program's objectives.
Early identification and assessment of employees needing assistance is a key element of the Program and increases the possibility of a successful outcome. Also, follow-up by EAP Representatives, and on-going support through on-site support groups and family awareness is critical to maintaining healthy Mestytes. The parties further recognize that while it is the •responsibility of management to maintain discipline and to invoke disciplinary measures where and when appropriate, both
135
local management and union representatives at all levels have ^ the responsibility to exercise their best efforts toward the >’ objective of early identification of employees whose behavioral.! problems may be finked to medical and/or personal causes and a to strongly encourage them to seek assistance. To facilitate! their critical roles in the intervention process, participation in ds EAP education and training by supervisors and chief stewards is f
st
essential, and valuable for other local union and management! leadership. This education and training will be provided inreV
variety of formats. In addition, educational materials and;?, information on resources available through EAP, such as a^ newsletter and a telephone access EAP Resource and Referral? Service will be made available by the National Training Center to; employees and their families as a means to further support early f intervention.
The parties recognize the value of providing social support^ to employees making positive lifestyle changes, and where the; local parties agree, on-site, employee-conducted support group meetings will be permitted for employees, on their own time. EAP representatives, with the assistance of the LEPC, will bej-responsible for arrangements.
Further, it is recognized that a perceived stigma may be $ attached to involvement with EAP. Therefore, joint local EAR-'
teams, along with the LEPC, will work to generate a climate| which reduces the effects of social stigma associated with^ mental disorders, alcoholism, drug dependency and others personal problems that act as a barrier to employees receiving^, needed help to resolve personal problems. To this end,^-
consideration will be given to the location of the EAP's office'iriCl^K&loiritty with the Health Care Benefit Joint Insurance Committee to the plant ensuring the greatest privacy and confidentiality. i^j^Hyresearch the most beneficial treatment practices.
The parties agree to continue improving the quality and*?1 performance of the EAP Program and EAP representatives'^ services. Therefore, the National Training Center will^ benchmark other programs and develop National^ j UAW/DaimlerChrysler EAP Program standards based on. ttje^l most successful practices, standards developed by other joint>| programs and professional organizations, and input from EAR?| representatives. The National Training Center will provide!! training on the implementation of these standards and assists!
with the resolution of any implementation problems.

Also, newly-appointed EAP representatives will receive rep thorough orientation on the background, history, development^ and focus of EAP Program standards, as well as methods.fqrHl coordinating a -local EAP Program. To ensure that newty-3* appointed EAP representatives become proficient in EAP cdire^
I
technology, and are able to provide a professional level of

service, they will be required to meetalLNTC-aDproved.EAR Feouirem^tsT tor-certification] within three (3) years of their
jj appointment. Newly-selected EAP representatives must possess | the skills necessary to take and pass such a certification ^examination. Failure to achieve such a credential within the | allotted time period could result in the representative being Removed from the Employee Assistance representative position e:by the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department. Newly appointed representatives will, where feasible, be selected two weeks prior to the departure of the preceding representative, for purposes of j training and a smooth transition of responsibilities.
Confidentiality is a critical element in the success of an EAP ^Program. To preserve the integrity of the Program and employee trust, EAP representatives will adhere to professional standards of confidentiality, except where limited by federal, state, local or corporate rules and regulations regarding confidentiality, disclosure of client information, or threats. These limits will be explained to employees. Because violations of confidentiality may destroy a program at the local level, and £ embarrass and offend employees who have placed their trust in | the EAP, proven violations of confidentiality by EAP i representatives, either by omission or commission, will be taken seriously. If it is alleged that a violation has occurred, a joint [investigation will be conducted, and appropriate action taken, up J to and including termination of their appointment.

(116)	National Equal Application Committee
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr, Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
For many years the Corporation and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders rn adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, status as a qualified person with a disability, sexual orientation, union activity or membership in any legally protected class, and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated in their Agreement an "Equal Application" provision that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at DaimlerChrysler Corporation and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violations of that principle.
The parties now recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (i) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive contractual method for the prompt resolution of all claims of denial of equal application rights or claims of sexual harassment, (ii) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (iii) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal, provincial and state civil rights agencies for the following purposes: (a) to increase understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, nonproductive to relieving employee problems, (c) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange information, expertise and advice.
Accordingly, the parties have established a National Equal Application Committee and Local Plant Equal Application Committees.
The National Equal Application Committee will be composed of three (3) representatives of the International Union, one of whom will be a member of the International Union's Civil Rights Committee, or his designee, and three (3) representatives
145
of the Corporation, one of whom will be active in the Corporation's equal employment opportunity programs. The National Committee shall meet during January, April, July and November or at times mutually agreed upon, but no fewer than four (4) times a year, and its functions shall be the following:
a.-Review and discuss ways and means of encouraging employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive contractual method to resolve claims of denial of equal application rights.
b.-Advise and counsel Union and Corporation representatives on the Appeal Board, other than the Impartial Chairman, on grievances alleging such claims.
c.-Conduct or arrange for investigations and/or studies into ;
the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions in an attempt to prevent such problems from arising or recurring.
d.-Maintain liaison with appropriate federal, provincial and state agencies for purposes set forth in the second paragraph of this letter.

e.--Advise and counsel Local Plant Equal Application -■$
Committees.

fl
II
At each plant or facility that the National Production and Maintenance Agreement covers, a Local Plant Equal Application Committee shall be established consisting of up to three representatives of the Local Union and three (3) representatives of Plant Management. The representatives of the Local Union shall be limited to the Local Union President, or an Officer of the y Local Union on a full time Leave of Absence For Union^ Business, the Chairman of the Plant Shop Committee, and the^ Chairman of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union or a^ i. designated representative. The representatives of Management ’.'^ shall be the Plant Manager, or his designated representative,^ and two (2) Plant Management representatives at least one qf^j whom is active in the Corporation's equal employment^., opportunity program. Local Plant Equal Application Committees^ shall meet during January, April, July and November or at times/> mutually agreed upon, but no fewer than four (4) times a year.'Q Copies of minutes from these meetings will be made available to';' the Union. Such Union representatives if not on a full timeL Leave of Absence For Union Business, and if working in the^“ plant, shall'receive pay from the Corporation at their regular^ hourly rates tor time spent in such meetings or when jointly ,
146
i investigating and/or studying a complaint with a management i member of the Local Plant Equal Application Committee, that they would otherwise have worked in the plant. Local Plant Equal Application Committees shall have the following duties:
a.-Recommend to the National Committee ways and means of promoting use of the grievance procedure as the exclusive contractual method for resolving claims of denial of equal application rights.
b.-Suggest guidelines for Union and Corporation representatives active in the grievance procedure in the proper and prompt handling of grievances alleging such claims.
c.-Conduct or arrange for investigations and/or studies into the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination 5 problems and tensions in an attempt to prevent such problems [ from arising or recurring.
d.-Recommend to the National Committee means for ? determining the cause of equal employment opportunities and discrimination problems and tensions in the plant.
The parties continue to recognize their legal and moral ^ responsibility for assuring that all DaimlerChrysler Corporation ^employees have equal employment opportunities and freedom gfrom discrimination as set forth in Section (4) of the National ^Production and Maintenance Agreement. Consequently the ^function of the National Equal Application Committee and Local Plant Equal Application Committees shall be advisory, ’£ consultative and cooperative. While the Corporation and the Union will welcome the recommendations the Committees may make, the Committees may not commit either party to a specific ^course of action. However, the Union agrees that it will discourage its members from bypassing the grievance and arbitration procedure with respect to any claim or complaint
a
against the Corporation which may be made the subject of a grievance under the contract.

(117)	Sexual Harassment Prevention
International Union, UAW

Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
The following is the text of DaimlerChrysler Corporation's written and published guidelines regarding sexual harassment prevention:
2$
POLICY STATEMENT:
A-
Sexual harassment violates DaimlerChrysler Corporation's long-standing policy against discrimination on the basis of sex. Sexual harassment in the workplace is also illegal. It violates Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 § and .various state fair employment laws in locations in which the Corporation does business. The Corporation's policy to prohibit the occurrence of sexual harassment is based on concern for& the individual as well as good business judgment.	A
DEFINITION:
■
For the purpose of determining whether a particular act or course of conduct constitutes sexual harassment under this policy, the following definition will be used: Sexual harassment includes any unwanted conduct of a sexual nature that adversely affects an individual's work environment,3 * 5 including but not limited to the following: unlawful sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and otherJn
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:

1.	submission to such conduct is made either explicitly odp implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, ,
2.	submission to or rejection of such conduct by an A individual is used as the basis for employment decisions^ affecting such individual, or
3. such conduct has the purpose or effect of^
unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance^; or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working^,
environment.	A
148
PROCEDURE:
Employees, applicants, suppliers, Independent contractors, customers, business invitees, and other outsiders who come in contact with DaimlerChrysler Corporation employees who in good faith believe they have been subjected to or witnessed unlawful sexual harassment activity or behavior in the workplace by other DaimlerChrysler Corporation employees (including managers, supervisors and co-workers), applicants, suppliers, independent contractors, customers, business invitees or outsiders are encouraged to promptly report this occurrence. For the purposes of this policy, the DaimlerChrysler workplace will be defined as any place where DaimlerChrysler Corporation work is being performed. Individuals wishing to make the Corporation aware of unlawful conduct may use any or all of the following methods:
notify immediate management,
notify the Human Resources Office, notify the Corporate Diversity and Work/Family Office.
Employees covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement may utilize mechanisms provided under the terms and conditions of their applicable contracts. Sexual harassment grievances shall be processed expeditiously and confidentially, and shall exclude from the grievance procedure a Management Representative and/or Union Official who is implicated in the grievance. Further, DaimlerChrysler Corporation employees who are included under the provisions of the UAW-DaimlerChrysler Equal Application Program may also report occurrences of unlawful sexual harassment as noted above to their Local Plant Equal Application Committee.
All sexual harassment complaints will be investigated in a
lawful, timely and impartial manner. Maximum confidentiality will be maintained throughout the investigation process and information will be shared only on a need-to-know basis. . Because of the sensitivity of sexual harassment issues, all investigations will be designed to protect the privacy and ; reputation of all individuals concerned. The Corporation will take £ appropriate steps to assure that a person who in good faith ? reports, complains about, or participates in the investigation of a ■ sexual harassment allegation will not be subjected to any [ retaliation. Confidential counseling is available through the r Employee Assistance Program. The Corporation will also take ? appropriate steps to assure that a person against whom such an
allegation is made is treated fairiy.
149
The Corporation is firmly committed to providing a work
environment free of hostility and will not tolerate sexual harassment in the workplace. Violations of this policy will result in immediate and appropriate corrective action. In cases where an employee is found to have engaged in misconduct of a sexually harassing nature, the transfer of that employee or the transfer of the employee who made the complaint, will generally not be considered appropriate corrective action nor the sole remedy in resolving the complaint. Appropriate discipline, up to and including discharge, may be imposed.
The Corporation and the UAW are in agreement that complaints of sexual harassment should be dealt with promptly and fairly under existing internal procedures as provided under Section (4) of the National Agreement, Letter (116) and Appendix A, the joint UAW - Management Sexual Harassment Complaint Investigation Process.
Further, the parties have agreed to provide training for Civil Rights and Equal Application Committees as specified under a separate Letter (158) of this Agreement.

■X,
Appendix A
Sexual Harassment Complaint Investigation Process

Complaints of sexual harassment originate via many different avenues, i.e., an employee to Management, an employee to a Union Representative, from either a Management or Union

representative directly, or anonymously. Accordingly, immediately upon any member of Management becoming aware of an allegation of sexual harassment when a Bargaining Unit ''-y employee is either the accused or the complainant, the following process is to be followed:
The involved facility Human Resources Manager (or designee) must be advised of the allegation of sexual harassment. They, in turn, will immediately contact the Local Union President (or designee) to make them aware of the allegation. In cases when a complaint is received from an anonymous source, the aforementioned parties will, before commencing with an 150
$

investigation, confirm with the employee who is allegedly harassed that he or she, in fact feels sexually harassed. The local Human Resources Manager is also responsible for notification to the appropriate Group Human Resources Office, as well as the Diversity and Work Family Office of the sexual harassment complaint.
The involved Human Resources Manager (or designee) will advise the accused party that an investigation will be conducted and, accordingly, they could be placed "on notice" of potential disciplinary action, and that any act(s) of retaliation will not be tolerated. Dependent on the circumstances of the individual case, the Human Resources Manager may deem it prudent to suspend the accused individual(s) until the investigation is concluded.
An Investigation Team will be formed that will include at least one (1), but not to exceed two (2) representative^) from the Local Union, which may include members of the local Civil Rights Committee, tn accordance with Section (4) and Letters 116 and 117 of the National Agreement. Recognizing the desirability of an investigative team made up of one male and
one female; each facility will attempt to structure the team
accordingly. The Diversity Office may elect to name a representative to serve as an additional member of die
Investigative Team or, where the Diversity Office is not part of the Investigative Team, local facilities are encouraged to confer
with that activity for any guidance that may be required. In conjunction with Diversity Office presence, the DaimlerChrysler Department - UAW may elect to also name an additional representative to the Team. Also, where the Diversity Office is not part of the investigation, the local Human Resources Manager will, upon completion of such investigation, forward to that activity a confidential copy of the file. Investigations of sexual harassment are to be conducted in as expeditious a manner as possible.
During interviews conducted tn conjunction with a sexual harassment complaint, only members of the Investigative Team and the interviewee will be present. If the interviewed employee is a bargaining unit employee, he or she can have a Union Representative present during the interview. As part of the investigation, attempts will be made to obtain signed statements
/ from all parties, including the complainant, accused, and witnesses where applicable. In cases where disciplinary action results, copies of all documentation and notes relied on as the
basis for such action will be provided to the Union and Management Investigators. All individuals involved in the handling of sexual harassment complaints, from the original 151
receipt of such complaint through the entire investigative process, are required, to the extent possible, to maintain confidentiality of any information obtained or prepared during the process. No copies of information obtained or prepared by the Investigative Team will Qe provided to any employee.
Once the investigation has been concluded, the local Management, i.e., Human Resources Manager and facility operating head, shall review the facts with management team members and determine the appropriate action to be taken. The union team members will have no role in this determination and will make no recommendations regarding disciplinary action.
In cases, however, where the Diversity Office participated on the Investigative Team, the investigation results will be reviewed for final disposition by designees from:
•	Diversity and Work Family Office
■	Group Human Resources
•	Corporate Union Relations
Note: The Office of the General Counsel will, upon request, provide advice and counsel.
Actions Taken in sexual harassment cases will be reported by the local Human Resources Manager to his or her respective Group Human Resources Manager, as well as the Diversity Office. Or in the case where Diversity participated, final disposition shall be reported to the local Human Resources Manager by his or her respective Group Human Resources office. In all cases, the complainant is to be advised when the case is "closed." Such actions shall be monitored to ensure closure to all allegations is accomplished and corporate wide consistency relative to actions taken is maintained. Any discipline assessed shall be done consistent with normal requirements for notification, representation, etc.
Where the investigative process determines an allegation of sexual harassment was made falsely or maliciously, the complaint may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Obviously, this is not applicable to complaints that are brought forth in good faith, but are found to be inconclusive.
While the foregoing is an attempt to put in place guidelines which will allow the local facilities to investigate and dispose of the majority of sexual harassment complaints, it is important that care is taken to ensure all complaints are taken seriously, that an objective and thorough investigation consistent with
152
DaimlerChrysler policies and applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements is conducted, and that fair and equitable action results.
The Corporation bears the ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of the laws and corporate policy which prohibits sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is something that cannot be tolerated by Management or the Union. Accordingly, the Corporation and the DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union, UAW are committed to ensuring investigations of sexual harassment complaints are to be conducted in the spirit of determining the truth and subsequent sharing of all available pertinent information between the parties. The Union's involvement in no way precludes its grieving and resultant disciplinary action, since the assessment of such discipline would remain the sole discretion of Management.

Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the parties acknowledged their mutual goal of a strong and viable corporation which can provide long term job security for its employees. We agree that our future success in accomplishing this goal depends on our ability to market profitably products of the highest quality at a competitive price. We further recognize that with intense competition both at home and abroad, there is an unparalleled need to find new ways of doing business.
Our recent past experiences have demonstrated that substantial progress can be achieved when individual and group interests are subordinated to mutual goals and when conflict is replaced by cooperation. Thus, the parties are in accord that we need to expand upon the spirit of cooperation exhibited by the Union, the Corporation and our employees, which has served as the cornerstone for the Corporation's dramatic resurgence.
In order to enhance future cooperative efforts and create a framework which will promote understanding, improve relationships and provide tor constructive, non-adversarial problem solving, the parties have established the Roundtable -an Alliance for Progress.	"f
The establishment of the Roundtable does not replace the collective bargaining process or the grievance procedure. Rather it is intended to provide an opportunity for discussion of business developments that are of interest and significance to the Union, the Corporation and our employees.
The Roundtable shall meet semi-annually, unless otherwise required, to address agenda items proposed in advance by either party. The Co-Chairmen of the Roundtable shall be the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department,-UAW, and the Senior Vice President of Employee Relations of the Corporation. Additional representatives for the Corporation -will include appropriate senior executives who can provide information relative to the issues and/or agenda of the scheduled meeting. The Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler;
156


Department, UAW, will designate appropriate representatives from the International Staff, UAW. The Roundtable shall provide a structure designed to:

Improve communications and the exchange of information among the Union, Management and employees;
Determine approaches for improving operational competitiveness in order to enhance job security;
- Identify and recommend new approaches for improving product quality; and





Discuss the Corporation's general operations and other global business developments on a broad, corporate-wide basis.











Finally, the parties recognize that information provided is frequently of a sensitive nature which can have important competitive implications. Accordingly, it is agreed that data shared at the Roundtable meetings shall be accorded appropriate confidential treatment and not disclosed to outside firms, agencies or persons without the consent of the party providing the information.

Attention: Mr.NatoGooden
Dear Sirs:
The parties devoted much time during negotiations discussing many concepts that will ensure employee input into day-to-day operations, including everything from the layout of the work site to the way in which work is performed.
We acknowledged that our long-standing, voluntary PQI process provides interested employees with the mechanism to improve employee morale and the competitiveness of the business in our very demanding industry and that our jointly developed employee participation programs should be ’administered, along with our other joint programs, under the leadership of the National and Local Employee Participation 'Councils.
159
The parties acknowledged that involving employees in key phases of the business such as quality, continuous improvement initiatives, operating efficiency, joint problem solving and waste elimination, using <>our Joint Activities Operating Principles (JAOP), is extremely important if we are to realize our joint vision of DaimlerChrysler becoming the premier automotive manufacturing company worldwide.
Among other things, we explored in depth the importance of an operating system and the interrelationship of JAOP with our many joint initiatives. The parties recognize that the successful implementation of an operating system and the sustainment and growth of our joint programs are vitally important to the long term job security of all DaimlerChrysler employees in that such programs and processes provides the framework necessary to more efficiently and effectively operate the enterprise.


The Corporation and the Union were in accord that without

The parties agreed to continue to identify the best^ processes and work policies that will encourage employee?/ participation and also to continue the previously established National Employee Participation Council (NEPC) composed five (5) Representatives of the International Union, UAW and five^i (5) senior level Representatives of the Corporation. The NEPCj-| will continue to be co-chaired by the Vice President and Director of the UAW National DaimlerChrysler Department and the^jJ Corporation's Senior Vice President - Employee Relations.

The parties will | continue to jointly identify what should occur at DaimlerChrysler || in terms of employee involvement and participation to be fully || competitive, improve product quality and assure job security of I UAW members.

(125) New Technology
International Union, UAW.
Attention: Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
The Corporation is mindful of the Union's concern regarding the scope and work content of job classifications of represented employees and how each may be affected by new and advancing technology. The Union has also voiced concern about the possibility the new, technologically impacted bargaining unit work will not be awarded to represented employees because they are insufficiently trained to perform it.
In view of the parties' interest in affording maximum opportunity tor employees to progress with new and advancing technology, the parties shall seek to identify appropriate jointly developed technical training programs, including programs that provide employees an understanding of the purpose of new technology, so that employees will be capable of performing new or changed work normally performed by represented personnel.
168
During these negotiations, the parties have recognized that technological progress, better tools, methods, processes, equipment or materials have improved the quality of work life and standard of living for all employees, as well as, the Corporation's competitive position. Over the years, the scope and work content of job classifications of both represented and non-represented employees have been changed by the methods and processes associated with technological progress.
Advancing technology has created, and will continue to create new and more complex problems bearing upon the work content of job classifications of employees represented by the Union. It is not the Corporation's policy to assign to non-represented employees work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at a particular plant location. The Corporation recognizes that mere novelty or sophistication of new technology alone is not grounds for withdrawing work from represented employees. At the same time, it is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of performing a work function will not serve to shift the work function from represented to nonrepresented employees.
In this regard, the National Committee (comprised of an appropriate number of Union and Management members of the current Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee) will meet periodically to discuss the development of new technology, methods, and processes at the Corporate level and its possible impact upon the scope of the bargaining unit. The parties will discuss other matters concerning new or advanced technology that may be referred by UAW Sourcing Representatives as issues arise in their day-to-day interactions with their respective platforms, by Local Unions or by local management, as welt as any claims of erosion of the bargaining unit, occasioned by the introduction of new technology.
In addition, the Corporation agrees to continue to provide as much advanced written notification to the Internationa) Union and the impacted Local Union at a location planning the introduction of new or advanced technology as it reasonably can, so as to permit the Union an opportunity to make comments and allow for meaningful discussions of its impact, if any, upon skilled or non-skilled employees. Examples of situations where notification should be given are:
A.	The first introduction of a technology as compared to previously existing plant technology.
169
B.	Introduction of a new, more advanced generation of existing technology having a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
C.	Introduction of a new application of existing technology which has a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
The written notification will describe the technology involved, the anticipated impact on the bargaining unit, the equipment being introduced, its intended use and the anticipated installation date(s).
The local Plant Management Representatives shall meet with the Local Union Representatives to review the various matters of concern relative to the introduction of the new technology involved.
During those discussions the President or the Skilled Trades Committeeperson or their designated representative(s) shall include, as appropriate and necessary, other Local Union Representatives such as the Health and Safety Representative, a Representative from the Local Skill Development and Training Committee, or a member of the Local Apprentice Committee, in order to review the various matters of concern relative to the introduction of the new technology involved.
Likewise, the local Management Representatives shall include representatives from appropriate functions including, but not limited to, Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Personnel in order to enhance meaningful discussions. Those discussions shall take place with all parties present as -a; group or separately according to individual disciplines as practicable.
Jointly, the Corporation and the Union shall seek to identify? appropriate specialized training programs to afford maximum/ opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology and shall submit to the UAW/DaimlerChryster National Training Center their recommendations for any training programs intended to assist present employees to perform work within the bargaining unit which is new or changed as a resultof technological improvement.	H
In the event the Vice President and Director of the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department considers it appropriate, he may arrange a meeting with the Senior Vice President of Employee Relations of the Corporation to discuss the impact of such
170
। technological changes and any proposed responses to such । changes.
k
? Any problems not resolved in such discussions may be
* submitted to the Grievance Procedure, or to any other procedure ; which the parties may agree.

(126) ESS Program - Volume Related Layoffs - BEL
£ International Union, UAW
‘ Attention: Mr. Jack Laskowski
Dear Sirs:
, During the course of these negotiations, the Corporation ■ and Union have provided Chrysler Corporation employees with $ substantially increased job security through the ESS Program, £ which protects eligible employees against layoff for virtually any ^reason except volume related market conditions. The parties j recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a f result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry. The ■^Corporation acknowledges, however, the importance of ^.minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume related declines are unavoidable. In particular, the Union stressed the importance of reducing overtime and shifting dual sourced .production requirements to UAW-Chrysler plants in the event of overall market declines. The Corporation agrees to take these and other actions whenever practical.
In any event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in line with the National Agreement and local supplemental seniority agreement and, if otherwise eligible, receive benefit treatment in
171
accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the 1996 Chrysler/UAW National Agreement.
Identifying the complex inter-relationships of all the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a difficult task. The parties agreed, however, that for purposes of determining BEL related protections they must identify just those volume declines that are attributable to market related conditions, and in turn just those declines that are not affected by Corporation sourcing choices of vehicles arid components that compete with or act as replacements for vehicles and components produced by Chrysler employees covered by this National Agreement. In other words, volume declines that are attributable to the Corporation's production and purchase arrangements with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, captives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.) would be considered an exception to the overall volume related exclusion in Section l(D> of the ESS Program.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that the Corporation provide Local ESS Committees adequate notice of any impending volume-related layoff, as well as all information necessary to fully evaluate Its underlying causes, the extent to which such decline is associated with a Corporate sourcing action and the appropriate number of BEL eligible employees that should be affected by the layoff.
The Corporation recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context of the protections spelled out in the ESS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Corporation also accepts the responsibility of proving that the proper number of employees are recalled to BEL positions when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the ESS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.
The following are to be considered as illustrations to assist the parties in determining when volume related declines support reductions in employment. These illustrations should not be considered all inclusive.
Market Related Conditions - Included in this category is customer preference of one vehicle over another that might result in a decline in sales of a U.S.-built Chrysler vehicle that requires the layoff of employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of increased sales or increased market share of competitive captive imports or joint venture vehicles or any other vehicle sold in the U.S. by Chrysler but not produced in a UAW-Chrysler plant.
Example of Market Related Conditions
(1)	There Is a decline in economic activity which depresses retail sales of UAW-Chrysler vehicles. Lower production levels require the layoff of employees. Assembly Plant A, employing 4,100 BEL-eligible employees, is the sole source of Vehicle Z for the U.S. market; it is required to lay off one shift, or 2,000 employees. The number of BEL-eligible employees at the plant remains at 4,100, including 2,000 open positions for laid-off employees.
While the plant is down to one shift, the Corporation decides to outsource the cushion room, which reduces employment requirements by 250 employees per shift. Two Hundred and Fifty (250) employees are placed on Protected employee status. There is no impact on the BEL numbers.
U.S. car demand picks up to pre-layoff levels and the second shift is called back. Active employment at the plant goes back to 4,100.
As the second shift is called back and the plant is back to pre-downtum production levels, an additional 250 employees are placed on Protected employee status which now holds 500 employees. The number of BEL-eligible employees at the plant remains at 4,100.
(2)	Assembly Plant B (5,000 BEL-eligible employees) is not the sole source of Vehicle Y, which Is also produced in Canada for the U.S. market, In Plant BC. Plant BC supplies one-fourth of the U.S. demand for Vehicle Y. An economic downturn in the U.S. reduces demand for Vehicle Y by 160,000. In accordance with BEL guidelines, volume related employment reductions cannot exceed Plant B's share of pre-downtum volume levels (three-fourths) applied to the reduced level of overall sales. Production in Plant B is therefore reduced by no more than 120,000 units, causing layoffs of 2,000 workers. Plant B's number of BEL-eligible employees remains at 5,000, including 2,000 open slots for laid off workers.
Vehicle Y demand in the U.S. market picks up by 60,000. The Corporation decides to produce 30,000 of those units in Plant B, requiring the recall of 500 employees, and the rest in Canadian Plant BC. The increase in production is not accomplished in proportion to pre-layoff production shares; to comply with BEL, the Corporation must recall 250 employees which it assigns to Protected employee status in addition to the 500 employees required for the pick up in production.
173
Product Discontinuance - Because of the introduction $0 of a new U.S.-built Chrysler vehicle or a non-allied company vehicle not sold by Chrysler, sales of another Chrysler manufactured vehicle may decline, and production of the latter r® vehicle must be curtailed necessitating reductions in O employment. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
- Examples ot Product Discontinuance or Phase Out and Changes in Retail Preference	O
(1)	A new U.S.-built Chrysler vehicle (or any other new is non-allied company vehicle which is not marketed by the 41 Corporation) is introduced. Sales of Vehicle X decline by 50% O and assembly must be curtailed. The necessary reductions in jja employment are made through layoffs, keeping the number of BEL-eligible employees at the assembly plant at the same level.
(2)	Engine Plant C, employing 1,400 BEL-eligible people, produced half of the engines for Vehicle X, the other half are O produced at a Corporate Plant in Mexico. The volume reduction .13 is made totally at Plant C rather than split proportionately between Plant C and the plant in Mexico. Therefore,' in .SI accordance with the ESS guidelines half of the 700 employees who are not required any longer in Plant C due to this event are assigned to Protected employee status, and the other 350 '-^3 employees would be laid off. The number of BEL-eligible employees at Plant C remains at 1,400, including 350 open volume related positions.	4111
Faulty Product - Vehicle line volume may decline because of faulty parts in a vehicle that cause customers to place the product in disfavor. Such reductions would be 4^3 considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
Changes in Retail Preference - Chrysler Corporation volume may decline because of customer preference shifts -in 13 turn affecting mix and therefore demand, e.g., small car preference shifts to large car; option preference swings; high S9 product content to low product content. Such reductions would -SB be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of <4^9 the Program.	19
Non-Chrysler Corporation Commercial Customer ^9 Preference -Cancellation or declines in product volume Chrysler Corporation manufactured parts that are sold to unrelated firms may cause volume changes. Such volume JOB
174
j reductions would be considered volume related dedines under p Paragraph l(D) of the Program.
E - Examples of Non-Chrysler Corporation Commercial ; Customer Preference
Plant A produces parts for off-the-road construction f equipment. Volume is reduced as a result of a decline in the I construction industry. One hundred fifty (150) employees are laid e off; the same number of open volume-related positions are L established.
l At the time production is back to pre-layoff levels the S Corporation introduces two (2) robots which replace 25 I employees. According to BEL guidelines all of the 150 t employees are recalled from layoff, 25 of them are assigned to & Protected employee status, and the BEL number of BEL-eligible employees remains equal to its pre-layoff level.
-- Non-Chrysler Corporation Produced Vehicles - If sales ? of a new or replacement vehicle manufactured by an allied ! company for Chrysler Corporation, that competes with a vehicle manufactured by the Corporation, results in reduced sales of the | Corporation-manufactured vehicle, the action would not be | volume related and layoffs under Paragraph l(D) of the Program | would not be permitted.
|	- Examples of Non-Chrysler Corporation Produced
| Vehicles
I; The Corporation sources or outsources a vehicle that it markets in competition with Vehicle W manufactured by UAW-| Chrysler Corporation employees. This results in reduced sales of | Vehicle W. Employment requirements are reduced, but this | event is not covered under Paragraph l(D) of the ESS Program | and layoffs are not permitted. This protection also extends to I employees producing UAW-Chrysler Corporation components | which are manufactured for Vehicle W.
I - Engines, Transmissions, Stampings and other | Components or Materials
I It is recognized that reductions in vehicle production will I often be accompanied by reductions in component production. £ When reductions in vehicle production are volume related, pro-| rata reductions in component production will normally be I considered volume related as well. However, to the extent a jt reduction in component production results from a shift in sales to	|
vehicles sold by Chrysler Corporation but not produced in UAW-
I	175
Chrysler Corporation plants, the reduction will not be considered volume related. Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dual-sourced from a UAW-Chrysler Corporation and a non-UAW-Chrysler Corporation plant, production declines at the UAW-Chrysler Corporation plant will only be considered volume-related to the extent the dual-sourced component produced at that plant continues to be produced in its pre-production decline proportion.
--Examples:
(1)	Plant A receives regular automotive batteries from a UAW-Chrysler Corporation plant and heavy duty batteries from a non-UAW-Chrysler Corporation plant. A volume decline occurs in regular automotive batteries because of customer preference for heavy duty batteries. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under the Program but would not have to be taken proportionately because the batteries would not be considered like or similar components.
(2)	Plant B receives regular batteries that have plastic fastening brackets from a UAW-Chrysler Corporation plant and regular batteries that have steel fastening brackets from a non-UAW-Chrysler Corporation plant. The batteries are used interchangeably and would be considered like or similar components. Therefore, any volume declines in battery production would have to be taken proportionately to be considered volume related.
As implied by these examples, there are many variations to be considered when determining volume actions. This letter is intended to provide a framework within which Local and National ESS Committees may review the applicability of Paragraph l(D) to volume reductions.
If a Local ESS Committee cannot agree on a situation being defined as volume related, the matter may be appealed to the National ESS Committee for resolution.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Jack Laskowski
Dear Sirs:
Re: National Job Security Committee - Unique Attrition Credit
During these negotiations, the parties agreed that the principle of replacing normal attritions of eligible employees would be continued in this Agreement as the genera) rule. In addition, it was recognized that exceptions to this concept are appropriate in unusual situations. For example, if a location has a large number of Protected employees who cannot be effectively utilized, yet more Protected employees would be required because of the replacement concept, it may be appropriate not to do so.
Accordingly, this will confirm our understanding that the National Job Security Committee is specifically empowered to investigate unique situations and evaluate requests for full attritional credit at a particular location, and implement mutually satisfactory adjustments to Paragraph ll(B) of the Memorandum of Understanding on Employment Security System (ESS).

(139)	Liberty Project/Small Car Commitment
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Marc Stepp
Dear Sirs:
During the course of the current negotiations, the Union has expressed serious concerns about the job security of its members, particularly as it relates to sourcing actions on the part of Chrysler Corporation.
The Corporation recognizes the importance of the employment it affords its employees and shares the desire of the Union to preserve and create jobs on a competitive basis. The Corporation reaffirms its desire to remain a viable domestic enterprise and a major American employer and declares its objective to achieve a competitive posture within a framework that contributes to the job security of employees and that is responsive to the changing dynamics characterizing our industry.
The Corporation has been and is committed to having a manufacturing presence and employment in North America (i.e., U.S. and Canada). This commitment requires flexibility if it is to be achieved in a competitive manner, tn addition, Chrysler cannot be unfairly penalized relative to competitors who have aggressive foreign sourcing plans or capabilities in place. The Corporation has been and continues to be reluctant to engage in a higher level of foreign vehicle and component sourcing in the hope that it can become a competitive producer of small cars.
The Corporation and the Union are keenly aware of the significant penetration achieved by the Japanese motor vehicle manufacturers in the U.S. small car market. Moreover, the parties are aware that of the major domestic automobile manufacturers, Chrysler Corporation has the largest percentage of its total production devoted to the production of small cars.
Given these conditions, it is understandable that the Union expressed considerable concern during these negotiations about the job security of its members, particularly as it relates to sourcing decisions by the Corporation. This is to advise that the long-term strategy is for Chrysler to continue with the major portion of its facilities, people, spending and assembly capacity
187
186
in this country. To do this, however, the Corporation must be fully competitive on a worldwide basis in quality, design, cost and fuel economy. The success of this strategy involves modernized facilities, planning, and new products. The ability and willingness of both the Corporation and Union to produce fully competitive vehicles will be paramount.
In 1983, when the Corporation returned to profitability, it undertook extensive capital investment and product development programs. The purpose of these programs was to increase the efficiency of our existing facilities by adopting the latest state-of-the-art technology, production processes and design concepts, and to redesign and resize its vehicles in an effort to capture a larger share of the domestic market.
During this period, the Corporation spent about $6 billion. Major investments during this period were directed toward file production of the T-115 Van, the Laser and Daytona and Lancer and LeBaron GTS. The investments undertaken between 1983 and 1985 are part of a long-range strategy of the Corporation to spend about $11.5 billion in North America during the next five years to modernize and expand our existing facilities and to develop new products.
The Corporation and the Union jointly acknowledge that if the Corporation is to remain a viable producer of small vehicles in the U.S. as exemplified by the Liberty Project, a new and innovative labor relations approach must be established which emphasizes cooperation, mutual trust and good faith. Conversely, to the extent possible, traditional adversarial roles must be minimized.
We invite the UAW's participation in planning a new concept small car project seeking innovative approaches to product design, engineering and manufacturing - The Liberty Project, To this end, we will explore ways in which the Union's role can be expanded beyond its current levels of involvement in all aspects of the project including future development work.
In recognition of our common interest in the success of the Liberty Project, the parties acknowledge the desirability and need of achieving greater cooperation between the Union and Management in improving work practices and undertaking other measures which will permit the Corporation to effectively compete domestically in the manufacture of small vehicles. To the extent that the efforts of this project are successful, they would form the basis for Management's recommendation that the Board of Directors approve domestic production of these vehicles.
188
A key element ot our strategy is Chrysler's commitment to provide the training necessary to promote the personal growth and development of our employees. The commitment made in hie 1985 Agreement is expected to provide more than $45 million for the training of our employees and is further evidence of the Corporation's enduring and fundamental commitment to its work force. The increased skills acquired through this training will enable Chrysler employees to form an effective partnership with tomorrow's technology to make a highly efficient team for the continued production of high quality, state-of-the-art vehicles and components in the United States.

The Corporation stated that it is committed to the U.S.-Canada Automotive Products Trade Agreement principle that its operations in both countries should participate on a continued fair and equitable basis in the North American vehicle market.

Attention: Mr. Marc Stepp
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the Union has expressed concern regarding possible changes the Corporation may make in its corporate structure during the term of the next National Collective Bargaining Agreements. Representatives of the Corporation and the Union have met and discussed this subject, with the result that each of the parties has gained a better understanding of the other's interests and concerns.
The Corporation has advised the Union that Management has certain structural changes under review. Other than this letter agreement, no specific provisions were negotiated or agreed upon with respect to this matter; but if any structural changes are made, the Corporation agrees that it will meet to fully review them with the Union. In reviewing such structural changes, Management will explain the nature and purpose of each and their potential effect, if any, on the Union and its members covered by these Labor Agreements.
Further, if there is likely to be any significant impact on the bargained-for rights of UAW-represented employees, good faith discussions between the parties will be undertaken promptly.
Any alleged violation of Chrysler Corporation's contractual obligations to the UAW and to its UAW-represented employees that is in dispute after such good faith discussions will be subject to special expedited arbitration within 60 days after being placed in issue regarding such restructuring. The Chairman of the Appeal Board designated in the National Agreements or another agreed upon arbitrator will have jurisdiction to remedy violations of this letter.
It is the objective of this letter to satisfy Chrysler's basic contractual commitments to the UAW and to its UAW-represented employees as if no restructuring had occurred. Therefore, Chrysler agrees that it and any holding company created as a member of the Chrysler family will agree to be bound by the results of the above-mentioned arbitration to the extent necessary to remedy a violation of such contractual commitments by Chrysler.

The Corporation and the Internationa) Union agreed that contemplated discipline should be discussed in a calm manner allowing for an objective evaluation of the facts. In those situations where emotions preclude this from happening, the parties agreed that as a matter of practice and when possible such discussions should be postponed until such time that, in the opinion of Management, a constructive exchange of information could occur.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties recognized that certain actions such as assault, or other serious acts of misconduct, would render the "cooling off" period totally inappropriate.
Additionally, it was mutually recognized that providing or not providing a "cooling off* period will be without prejudice to either party in the application of any terms of the National Agreement and will not be cited or relied upon by an employee, the Union, or Management as a basis for any claim.

Moreover, the parties acknowledged the best way to minimize the incidence and impact of sexual harassment is to have positive training and education programs to sensitize supervisors, union officials and employees to sexual harassment concerns.
Accordingly, it was agreed that the National Training Center and the Corporation's Diversity & Work/Family Department will jointly develop and provide such training under the direction of the Joint Activities Board.

(161)	New Payroll System
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stan Marshal!
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern regarding problems employees have experienced with their paychecks. During the course of the discussions, Ore parties acknowledged that not all payroll problems are related to the payroll computer system nor is it reasonable to expect that all errors can be avoided in the future. Administrative as well as human errors can be expected to occur during the normal course of business.
However, the Corporation stated it shared the Union's concern regarding the type of problems that are attributable to the payroll computer system. The system is old and is reaching the limit of its capacity to accommodate programming changes required in order to property make payments of the wages and benefits provided by the Corporation to all of its employees.
In this connection, the Corporation informed the Union that a new payroll system has been purchased. Management Information Systems and Payroll Department-personnel, in appropriate phases, are analyzing both the current system and new system to determine what changes to the payroll process are required; defining how the new system will interface with other Corporate functions drat have payroll input; entering Chrysler specific data into the new system; developing testing procedures; developing a pilot program to run the new system in parallel with the current system; developing training programs; training Corporate personnel; and planning the process to convert from the current to the new payroll system.
Current problems are being addressed as they are encountered and the new payroll system is being implemented. In order to keep the Union informed, beginning in the calendar year 1991, the Corporation agrees to meet semiannually with two (2) representatives of the International Union and provide them a report on the status of this project. These meetings will continue to be held as long as they are required or until the new system is implemented and operating.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr, Jack Laskowski
Dear Sirs:
During our continuing discussions surrounding the new provisions of the ESS Program, we addressed the desirability of having a new mechanism to help reduce the number of Protected employees in those situations where the sudden creation of a large number of Protected employees made it impractical to find meaningful assignments for those employees. The Corporation was concerned about large numbers of employees who could return to a plant that had no available work tor them. The Union, on toe other hand, expressed an interest in longer seniority employees being able to take advantage of a program which would permit them to take a layoff and grow into retirement, while being replaced by Protected employees.
A mutually acceptable program has been developed that permits the utilization of Protected employee slots for voluntary pre-retirement leaves or other appropriate leaves. Such leaves
213
will continue to be paid at eighty five percent (85%) of straight time pay and the BEL will be reduced as if the separation had occurred under a Special Program under Attachment A of this MOU.

During these negotiations, the parties discussed a program that is under review by the Corporation to replace over a five (5) year time frame its current fleet of industrial trucks. Under the proposal, the Corporation may either lease or purchase these new vehicles.

With respect to the maintenance of this new fleet, the Corporation indicated that it will utilize its internal Jitney Repair workforce, under the guidance of the supplier whose equipment is either purchased and/or leased. The supplier's management would undertake a training program for Chrysler's Jitney Repair workforce and be responsible with respect to maintenance schedules, both predictive and preventative, as well as repair methodologies and procedures. Until this new fleet is acquired at a location, it is the Corporation's intent to perform jitney repair in the same manner as it is presently performed at that facility.

Given the fact the Temporary Part-Time Employee Program is extremely critical to the efficiency of plant operations, the parties recognize the need to eliminate abuses and ensure temporary part-time employees are utilized as intended. Accordingly, the parties agreed to periodically conduct a joint review at each location currently utilizing TPT employees, and to re-emphasize the proper application of the S-1 - Supplemental Agreement Temporary Part-Time Employees.
In order to ensure that TPT employees are only being called to report to work pursuant to tire provisions of S-1 -Temporary Part-Time Employees, the Corporation will instruct its Plant Personnel Departments to administer and coordinate the TPT Program. The Local Unions will be advised of the new policy.
Should the Local Union discover that authorization to report for work is being given without the Local Personnel Department's knowledge or approval, the matter may be brought to the attention of the Plant Labor Relations Department for resolution.
To ensure further compliance, Corporate Union Relations Administration will closely monitor the use of TPT employees and vwll give notice to the International Union, UAW in advance of hiring TPT employees.
The Union was assured that TPT employees would not be hired to circumvent the hiring of regular full-time employees. Notwithstanding the above, the Corporation will establish a process for considering TPT employees for Temporary Vacation Replacement or Full Time Employment

During the current negotiations, the parties discussed the ongoing Joint Safety and Health Audit Program. With regard to this audit program, the parties agreed that future joint safety and health audits will continue to be conducted by a team of trained safety and health professionals under the direction of the National Joint Committee.
A joint audit team has been established at the National Training Center consisting of three (3) UAW International Representatives appointed by the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department UAW and three (3) Management Safety and Health professionals appointed by the Senior Vice President of Employee Relations. Both parties recognize the need to maintain a staff of qualified safety and health auditors. The National Joint Committee will develop specific training requirements for audit team members. Depending upon knowledge and health and safety experience, new members may be required to complete up to four (4) weeks of training within ninety (90) days of appointment or as soon thereafter as class availability permits.
A Nurse and a Fire Supervisor will accompany the audit team to verify plant compliance in medical and fire security programs and procedures. It is understood that these positions will be filled by utilizing existing staff on a rotational basis and that their time spent on the audit will be limited to their specific audit function.
The National Joint Committee will continue to review and provide input to the audit team on the audit program criteria as required.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stan Marshall
Dear Sirs:
During the course of these negotiations, the parties discussed at great length the placement election system as it is currently administered and the need to provide greater latitude for employees faced with an election which may adversely impact them. In order to alleviate these concerns, it was agreed that, following the effective date of the Agreement, the election process at the time of an indefinite layoff would be accomplished as follows:
I.	tn Labor Market Area Placement
(a)	An employee indefinitely laid off from their primary ("Home") plant who is placed pursuant to Memorandum No. M-7
224
at, and is subsequently indefinitely laid off from, a second plant in their Labor Market Area, will retain seniority at both plants and shall not be required to make a seniority election until he/she is recalled or returns to their primary ("Home") plant. At such time, the employee shall elect to (i) retain seniority at the second plant and in such case their seniority at their primary ("Home") plant shall terminate or (ii) return to their primary ("Home") plant with full accumulated seniority and in such case their seniority at all other plants shall terminate.
(b)	An employee who is indefinitely laid off by the second plant who is neither recalled by or returns to their primary ("Home") plant and is subsequently recalled and returns to work at their secondary plant will retain seniority at both plants until one of the conditions outlined in (a) above occurs or he/she is placed at a third plant in the same Labor Market Area.
(c)	An employee who is indefinitely laid off by their secondary plant and who is then placed at a third plant in the Labor Market Area shall, at the time of such placement, elect either their primary ("Home") or secondary plant as the plant at which he/she choose to retain seniority along with that gained at the current plant.
In no event shall any employee retain seniority at more than two (2) plants.
II.	Out of Labor Market Area Placement
a)	An employee who is indefinitely laid off from their primary ("Home") plant and who is placed at, and is subsequently laid off from, a secondary plant outside of their Labor Market Area, will retain seniority at both plants.
b)	An employee on indefinite layoff from their secondary plant who refuses placement at their primary ("Home") plant shall have their seniority terminated at that plant.
c)	An employee on indefinite layoff from their secondary plant who is placed at a third plant in that same Labor Market Area, shall elect to have their seniority at either the secondary or third plant, along with the seniority at ttieir primary ("Home") plant.
d)	An employee on indefinite layoff who accepts placement at their primary ("Home”) plant shall have their seniority terminated at their former plant.
225
In addition to the above, the following understandings shall apply:
1.	Employees retaining seniority at two (2) plants shall have no rights to return to their former plant unless they have a "Return Home" application on file or until they have been indefinitely laid off frorrTthe new plant.
2.	The separation of an employee from one plant for a reason other than specified in Section (64) of the P&M Agreement shall result in the termination of their seniority at all Corporation plants.
3.	An employee who maintains seniority at two plants shall retain any rights accrued for purposes of holiday pay, payment in lieu of vacations, pensions, insurance and the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan.
The parties recognize that the provisions of this Letter have complex administrative implications. Accordingly, the Corporation shall not incur any operational problems or any liability for claimed violations or errors in administration of the understanding.

Attention: Mr. Stan Marshall
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern for employees of closed plants who on or after February 13, 1982 were placed at another Corporation plant in a different Labor Market Area pursuant to the provisions of the Memorandum of
226
Understanding on Plant Closings. In some instances such placement created a personal hardship and, therefore, the Union requested those employees be provided an opportunity to return to work in a plant in their former Labor Market Area,
The Corporation agreed to allow such employees to make a one (1) time request to return to their former Labor Market Area. Within thirty (30) days following notice of ratification of this Agreement, such employee may make a single application on a form to be provided at the Employment Office at the plant in which the employee is working. A copy of the signed application will be given to the employee. Any employee on an approved leave of absence spanning the aforementioned thirty (30) day period shall within five (5) days after their return to work be given an opportunity to make the request provided for in this paragraph. The application may be revoked at any time prior to notice of transfer, however once the employee is given notice of transfer, it may not be revoked.
When hiring to fill open jobs in any plant in a Labor Market Area, the Corporation will review and consider the applications of employees requesting transfer to that Labor Market Area. Where reasonably practicable, employees with a valid application on file will be given preference over new hires. In any event, the release of any employee is subject to the condition that they have the ability and are physically able to do the available work at the new plant and the productivity and efficiency of the current plant is not affected adversely.
An employee transferring pursuant hereto shall (i) retain their seniority in the plant from which they were transferred for a period of twelve (12) months from the date they last worked in the plant but shall have no right to return to the former plant unless and until they are indefinitely laid off from the new plant during the aforementioned twelve (12) month period; (ii) rank for seniority as of the date of entry in the new plant; (iii) retain any rights accrued for purposes of holiday pay, payment in lieu of vacations, pensions, insurance and the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan.
An employee accepting transfer will be eligible to receive a relocation allowance as provided in the exhibits to the National Agreement after providing documentation satisfactory to Management that the employee has changed permanent residence and relocated.
The Corporation shall not incur any liability for claimed violations or errors in the administration of this Understanding.

(176) Additional Bereavement Provisions
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Jack Laskowski
Dear Sirs:
This letter will serve to confirm the understandings reached in previous negotiations and the current negotiations concerning the application of the bereavement pay provisions in Section (81) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement in the following instances:
- An employee who, in conjunction with an approved absence due to bereavement, requests limited additional time off for the disposition of financial, administrative or legal matters associated with the death of an immediate family member as defined in Section (81), should be given consideration for additional time off (up to three (3) days) as unpaid personal time or unused available Paid Absence Allowance. It is further understood that the request must be in advance and the time off, itself, should not negatively impact operations.
An employee who is notified of the death of an immediate family member and meets the eligibility criteria for bereavement pay during a week(s) in which the employee was previously scheduled and approved for vacation leave, may request equivalent hours of Paid Absence Allowance for each day (eight (8) hours) up to three (3) (or five (5) in the case of the death of an employee's current spouse, parent, child or stepchild) total, in lieu of bereavement pay for which the employee otherwise would be eligible except for the employee's nonwork status during such vacation week(s). Such requested hours will be in addition to those Paid Absence Allowance hours
228
which the employee is otherwise eligible and are to be scheduled under the terms of Section (104)(e).
In the event an employee’s spouse of five (5) years or longer has predeceased his or her parent, and in the event of the death of a parent of that former spouse, the provisions of Section (81), Bereavement Pay, of the National Production and Maintenance Agreement will apply, provided the employee has not remarried.
Notwithstanding the bereavement pay eligibility requirements of Section (81), this will confirm our understanding that representatives of the UAW National Chrysler Department and representatives of Union Relations Staff of the Employee Relations Office, may discuss the disqualification of certain employees from bereavement pay due to the unique circumstances associated with the death of an immediate family member to determine on a case-by-case basis the possibility of providing bereavement pay to these otherwise ineligible employees.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. The Company assured the Union that it will comply with the provisions of the FMLA.
As part of its compliance, the Company presently plans to establish a new category of unpaid leave called "FMLA Leave".
229
In some instances, FMLA Leaves will be concurrent with leaves of absence covered by Section (66) (a) and (78)(a) of the Office, Clerical and Engineering and Production and Maintenance Collective Bargaining Agreements, respectively. Accordingly, in those cases where the employee is eligible for leave under the DaimlerChrysler-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement and the leave also qualifies under the FMLA, the Company intends to comply with the requirements of the FMLA as well as the separate provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement regarding covered leaves of absence.
Pursuant to the Company's present plan for compliance with the FMLA, the Company's rights under the Act will be modified to:
-	Provide that an employee on FMLA Leave will continue to accumulate seniority in the same manner as the employee also would be eligible under Section (66)(a) and (78)(a) of the Office, Clerical and Engineering and Production and Maintenance Collective Bargaining Agreements, respectively, as appropriate;
Permit but not require employees to substitute vacation and/or excused absence allowance for. unpaid FMLA Leave;
-	Provide that employees who are married to each other will be each entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks of qualifying leave under the Act;
Provide that, when a third opinion is necessary under the medical certification and dispute resolution sections of the FMLA, the neutral provider will be selected jointly by the Company and the Union from a list, provided by the appropriate local or state professional medical association, of board-certified specialists in the field of medicine in which the point of controversy exists;
Continue Company-paid Group, Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Disability Insurance during all FMLA Leaves that are not also DaimlerChrysler-UAW Medical Leaves as if such leaves were DaimlerChrysler-UAW Personal Leaves of Absence.
In addition, the Company's plan for compliance would:
-	Not automatically designate and apply absence time that is compensated under the Sickness and Accident Insurance
230
provisions of the Life, Disability and Health Care Benefits Program against an eligible employee's FMLA entitlement.
Use, initially, a calendar year as the 12-month period of the leave entitlement (for example: in 1993, from the effective date through December 31, 1993; in 1994, from January 1,1994 through December 31,1994);
Require repayment of the cost of health care coverage provided during the leave from employees who fail to return from FMLA Leave to the extent permitted by law.
The Department of Labor has not yet issued final regulations regarding this Act. The Company may make changes in its compliance plans to reflect final regulations and/or subsequent court decisions and the gaining of additional administrative experience but without reducing leaves provided by the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Problems related to the implementation of this letter may be discussed by representatives of the UAW National Chrysler Department, and the Company's Employee Relations Staff.

(182)	Support Order Deductions
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stan Marshall
Dear Sirs:
During the 1993 bargaining, the parties discussed a variety of unusual payroll related issues impacting certain employees' pay. While a number of issues were covered, a specific area of concern involved employees subject to support orders when certain lump sum payments are made. For these employees, such payments can be delayed because of the legally required arrearage verification and adjustment procedures.
The Company advised the Union of existing procedures for the advance notification to the respective courts, in a manner consistent with legal requirements, of pending lump sum payments to employees subject to support orders. Further, the Company recognizes that processing adjustments to those lump sum payments should be done in a timely manner consistent with the law.
234
Following negotiations, the respective Plant Personnel Manager will advise the Chairperson of the legal notification and adjustment procedures and timing applicable for employees subject to support orders at their locations.
Where these procedures are not functioning in a timely manner, the respective Chairperson may bring the matter to the Plant Personnel Manager for appropriate corrective steps. If the matter continues unresolved, the National Chrysler Department may bring it to the attention of the Employee Relations Office of the Company.

(185)	Vacation Replacement Hiring
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Jack Laskowski
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the Union voiced concern regarding the hiring of vacation replacement employees to fill temporary openings which in effect were regular full-time jobs.
To address this concern, the parties agreed to the following procedure:
Vacation replacements may be utilized for the period beginning the first Monday in May and ending no later than the first Saturday following the Labor Day Holiday to replace seniority employees who take vacation leaves of absence.
Plant Management will give advance written notification to both the Local Union and Corporate Union Relations Administration with regard to the anticipated number of
vacation replacement employees that will be required. Upon receipt of this information, Corporate Union Relations will meet with the International Union no later than the third Monday in April and identify the number of vacation replacement employees that may be hired at each respective location.
' Notwithstanding the above procedure, the parties recognize that some local unions and plant managements have negotiated X periods, other than the summer months, when employees may >. take vacation leaves of absence. In order to provide leaves of absence for vacation purposes during such periods, it is agreed i vacation replacement employees may be utilized subject to ■ mutual agreement with the International Union.
When implementing this understanding, the Corporation will ; advise local managements to meet with the Local Plant Shop ‘ Committee to review the vacation requests received. In addition, ; whenever vacation replacements are employed, management ■ will, upon request, provide to the appropriate Plant Shop ! Committee person the names and departments of the vacation . replacement employees working in their district.
237
Although the parties agreed that the Corporation has the right to determine which prospective temporary employee may be selected for additional employment opportunity, the Corporation commits to giving serious consideration to a vacation replacement employees becoming regular full-time employees provided the vacation replacement employee expresses the wish to become a seniority employee, there is a regular, full-time opening in the plant, and management agrees to make such change in the employee's status. If such employees are not made seniority employees, they shall be separated from the roll. Corporate Union Relations will meet with the International Union and apprise them of the number of temporary employees that are scheduled to be laid off. It is further agreed that the International Union, UAW and the Local Union will be provided the names of those vacation replacement employees who have been separated from the rolls and those whose status will become that of a regular fuil-time employee. In the event the Local Union claims the layoff of a vacation replacement employee is not for cause, it shall promptly refer the matter to Corporate Union Relations and the International, UAW for resolution.
Problems relating to the implementation and administration of the above provisions may be raised by either party in a timely fashion each year, before vacation schedules have been finalized, and resolved by mutual agreement of the Local Plant Shop Committee and the Company. In the event a problem cannot be resolved by the local parties, the matter may be submitted to the International Union, UAW and Corporate Union Relations.

Vehicle recyclability and the use of recycled materials are an increasingly integral part of the Company's vehicle program planning and development process. The Corporation's goal is to facilitate recycling of our products through such means as material selection, assembly techniques and manufacturing
240
processes. We also encourage recycling by purchasing recycled materials.
The Corporation continues to be a strong supporter of recycling programs and has implemented numerous recycling initiatives at its locations. Chrysler is also active in recycling initiatives in the various communities in which it operates. Chrysler supports many community projects to increase the awareness of environmental issues and to promote ways of establishing recycling as a way of life. The involvement of Chrysler employees in these projects has been well received and is a major reason for their success.
The Corporation will continue to encourage and support recycling efforts of local communities, Local Unions and employees, consistent with Corporate Policy, which will support the protection and the conservation of the environment, both at the Corporate level, as well as the Local level.

Attention: Mn^ateGooderi
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed at length the exposure levels of metal working fluids within the Corporation's facilities. The parties recognize that the Corporation has made great strides in the past few years in
251
improving our plants' environments. Our new facilities have been engineered with significant attention to employee health and safety, resulting in metal working fluid levels well below 1.0 mg/m3. Moreover, as new equipment has been placed in existing facilities, similar results have been achieved. Likewise, in existing facilities, a variety of means and efforts associated with current systems have resulted in impressive improvements over pre-existing conditions. These efforts and new tooling (installed and projected) at existing facilities have dramatically reduced our overall Corporate mist levels. In fact, in those locations with new installations, we believe the overall environmental average for the area or plant is at or below 0.5 mg/m3.
The Corporation advised the Union of our intent to continue similar efforts throughout the life of the current Agreement. To that end, we will endeavor to engineer and design new equipment to attain a level of 0.5 mg/m3 time weighted average (TWA) for initial production start-up. Furthermore, efforts will be made to attain this level after start-up. Moreover, the Corporation agreed that, for its existing equipment, it will strive to obtain a DaimlerChrysler exposure guideline of 1.0 mg/m3 or less on or before the year 2004.
Medical surveillance (consisting of a standardized respiratory symptoms questionnaire) for respiratory effects of machining fluids will be offered to employees who regularly work in operations with machining fluids.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Jack Laskowski
I Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations lengthy discussions were held ,regarding in-plant training of employees.

257
The Union expressed concern that maximum participation is being hindered because of a pay practice which results in the loss of shift premium to employees who attend training on a shift other than the shift on which they would otherwise normally work. TheA Union further maintains such loss of shift premium has adversely impacted morale and plant efficiency, resulted in certain employees not attending such training thereby, missing the opportunity to upgrade their skills.
In an effort to seek maximum participation in available in-plant training, the parties have agreed that notwithstanding the provisions of Section (85) of the National Production and Maintenance Agreement, employees who are required to attend in-plant training necessary to upgrade their skills in their classification on a shift other than they would otherwise normally work, will be paid the shift premium normally paid for their regularly assigned shift during the period they are attending such training.

1.	If he works any part of the ninetieth (90th) day and is laid off on that day, he will be considered a seniority employee, if he is discharged before the end of his shift on the ninetieth (90th) day, he will be considered a probationary employee.
2.	Days lost during the probationary period for the following, reasons will not be considered as "days of employment."
a)	Any period of five (5) or more consecutive normal work days on which the employee does not work such as model change, temporary adjustments, inventory, non-occupational disability, or personal absence or any combination thereof.

(209)	Full Utilization of Skilled Trades
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs
During our discussions relative to outside contracting, the utilization of DaimlerChrysler skilled trades employees has been a matter of mutual concern. Although no agreement was reached regarding the definition of "full utilization", the parties did agree that the appropriate forum in which to address this issue is at the local level, in conjunction with the outside contracting review process. It was indicated that the definition of full utilization will vary from location to location, depending upon the circumstances of each contract, including the number of skilled personnel involved, the number of hours allocated to the project, and the extent to which outside contractors are contemplated for utilization on weekend work.
The parties agreed that the following additional ■ considerations may also bear on the definition of full utilization:
i)	Whether a contractor will perform work on overtime during the workweek and/or on a weekend.
ii)	Whether skilled trades employees are on layoff or in Protected status.
262
iii)	The necessity for specialized equipment not readily available at a cost which, when added to other factors, exceeds the cost of a contractor performing the work and/or contractor work skill sets or competencies that the Company may not possess.
iv)	The percentage of affected trades, if any, to be assigned work along with outside contractors.
v)	The requisite number of plant skilled trades employees available and/or willing to work overtime during the workweek and/or on a weekend which may be required to complete the project under review, consistent with cost and timing parameters.
Although no one of these considerations is necessarily controlling, each may be instrumental in assisting the parties in determining whether the skilled hades workforce is fully utilized as that concept relates to the decision to use an outside contractor.

International Union, UAW
Attention; Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the utilization of skilled trades employees on project work and the effectiveness of the Skilled Trades Project Coordinator classification, which was first established on a pilot basis with the 1996 Production and Maintenance Agreement.
The parties have agreed that the classification of Skilled Trades Project Coordinator will be expanded and made available to all U.S, manufacturing and assembly plants, covered by the 1999 National Agreement under the following conditions:
Both local parties agree to participate;
264
The plant submits a joint request in writing to the Corporation and the DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union defining the scope and anticipated duration of the project; number of employees by classification in the project work group; training plans and the role to be performed by the Skilled Trades Project Coordinator;
The local parties jointly establish selection criteria for the Skilled Trades Project Coordinator which assures that the most qualified employee(s) are selected. Suggested criteria guidelines may include, but are not limited to, blueprint reading (if required), knowledge of the work content to be performed, planning and communication skills.
The rate for the Skilled Trades Project Coordinator who leads such work groups will be $1.00 above their normal classification rate for the duration of a specific project meeting the guidelines of this letter. The Project Coordinator must assume the key responsibilities as well as the majority of the representative task, contained in the attached exhibit;
Normally no more than three (3) employees at a location may be classified as Skilled Trades Project Coordinators at any given time. In the event a plant determines that there is a legitimate need for additional Project Coordinator(s), a joint written request shall be submitted to the Corporation and the DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union for their consideration;
The local parties will evaluate and measure completed projects for cost, timing, quality and efficiency and provide such information prior to requesting approval for any additional projects; and,
The program may be suspended at any plant based upon the recommendation of either party and with the concurrence of the DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union and the Corporate Union Relations Staff.

(212)	Warranty and Service Agreements international Union. UAW
Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
?£ During the 1999 Negotiations, there was considerable discussion regarding the subject of warranty and service agreements. The Union expressed serious concern relative to g| warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided by suppliers and certain service contracts. They further II? asserted that certain locations fail to provide the Union with rg proper notice when suppliers are in the plant to perform particular warranty or service agreement work, especially during K& off-shifts and overtime periods. The Corporation reaffirmed that
HF good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that equipment purchased by the Corporation performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract. The Corporation further explained that to
266
267
remain globally competitive, it must be able to utilize warranty arrangements and/or service contracts ordinarily provided by suppliers.
In an effort to address the Union's concerns, it is agreed that any time a supplier visits a facility to perform warranty or service agrearnent work, as provided in the purchase agreement between the parties, the Union will be notified and an employee on that shift with the appropriate skilled trades classification will be assigned with the supplier. Additionally, in the event other employees from the same supplier are performing different warranty or service agreement work in other areas of the plant, an employee with the appropriate skilled trades classification will be assigned with the supplier. The purpose of this assignment is for the employee to receive training, become familiar with the new equipment, and to help ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities to our skilled trades upon expiration of the warranty and/or service arrangements.
♦
Where concerns or abuses are cited by either party regarding the aforementioned understanding, such matters will be discussed in Outside Contracting Review Team Meetings in an attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution.

(1)	Eight (8) hours X EMPLOYEE'S annual eligibility in days for Vacations, Paid Excused Work Days and Floating Holidays (if any) = total annual hours of PTO eligibility.
(2)	Total annual hours of PTO eligibility shall be pro-rated based on the EMPLOYEE'S Equivalent Work Week (EWW).
(3)	Such pro-rated PTO will be established in January of each CALENDAR YEAR and adjusted in July if the Part-Time EMPLOYEE’S EWW changes.
(4)	In the event a Full-Time EMPLOYEE converts to a Part-Time EMPLOYEE during the year, the PTO will be established at the time of the conversion by applying a factor of 40 for the number of weeks prior to the conversion and a factor based on an EWW for the remainder of the year. The PTO shall be further adjusted in July, as applicable.
(5)	In the event a Part-Time EMPLOYEE converts to a Full-Time EMPLOYEE during the year, the PTO will be adjusted at the time of the conversion by applying a factor of 40 for the remaining number of weeks in the CALENDAR YEAR.

During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern about employees not being provided the opportunity to request payment of Paid Absence Allowance entitlement when the employee is pre-excused by management from having to work a scheduled Saturday overtime shift.
The parties recognized the need to run production operations efficiently and agreed that excessive absenteeism adversely impacts the Corporation in terms of product quality, operating costs, efficiency of operations and employee morale and places an unfair burden on those employees who regularly work as scheduled.
The parties agreed that an employee who is scheduled to work a Saturday overtime shift and who, in advance of that Saturday shift, is pre-excused by management from working such shift, may request payment of Paid Absence Allowance for such pre-excused shift.
An eligible employee will be paid for eight (8) hours (or the balance of unused Paid Absence Allowance hours if the balance is less than eight (8) hours) at the employee's straight time base hourly rate inclusive of applicable cost-of-living allowance and shift premium but exclusive of overtime premium.

The Corporation has no disagreement with the Union's interpretation of Section (43) as it regards management's initial act of “imposing’’ a penalty on a current charge. However, when presenting appeals to the Chairman the Corporation may respond with evidence as to the employee’s total disciplinary record unrestricted by Section (43), if a grievant or the Union advances a claim of prior lengthy good conduct as a ground for reduction of penalty, tn the absence of such claims the Corporation will not attempt to include in the arbitration record, either orally or in writing, disciplines which occurred prior to the

(221)	NEPC Joint Study Group Agenda
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
Letter 124 appended to the Production, Maintenance and Parts Agreement and Letter 30 appended to the Office, Clerical and Engineering Agreement, provide for a joint study group appointed by the chairpersons of the National Employee Participation Council (NEPC), empowered to use whatever resources it believes necessary to develop the UAW-DaimlerChrysler Employee Participation Process. The joint study group is to meet regularly and report its findings and make recommendations to the NEPC, which may then agree on a plan of action on how new employee participation processes contemplated by the two letters will be implemented.
Among those issues, programs and processes the joint study group will examine during the term of the 1999 Agreements, beginning within thirty (30) days following ratification, with the requirement to make recommendations to the NEPC as soon as practicable thereafter, are the following: [i] the manner in which the several Modem Operating Agreements can be made more meaningful and productive; [ii] how, using third party facilitators if needed, the team coordinator concept at Modern Operating Agreement (MOA) locations can be energized, improved and made more meaningful and, then, launched at non-MOA locations, considering the peculiar and
277
unique attributes and direction of each location, using joint design teams, hopefully obtaining maximum local participation, ownership, accountability and commitment; [iiij how the contractual language providing for the many joint programs, should be updated to reflect the thrust and intent of Letters 124 and 30; and [ivj what redeployment guidelines and processes should be established and followed relative to those instances when employees are impacted by jointly initiated product quality and operational effectiveness improvements, such redeployment guidelines placing emphasis on the redeployment of effected employees to meaningful, regular and/or "non-traditional" work including, but not limited to, LEPC-directed training and/or facilitating assignments, as well as efforts to competitively retain or insource work.

Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During the current negotiations, the Union requested that all DaimlerChrysler facilities, where employees are represented by the UAW, fly the UAW flag. As discussed, flying of flags at DaimlerChrysler locations is a matter of Corporation policy administered by the Corporate Identity Office.
In view of the historical ties between the UAW and the DaimlerChrysler Corporation, the Corporation indicated a willingness to change its policy on flags to meet the Union's request.
It is agreed that all DaimlerChrysler facilities, where employees are represented by the UAW, will make the necessary arrangements to fly the UAW flag. UAW flags will be
278
provided to the Plant/Distribution Center Manager at each DaimlerChrysler facility by the Local Union President or Unit Chair Person.

Full Utilization of Skilled Trades
International Union, UAW
Attention: MrTNate~Go6deri
Dear Sirs:
In our negotiations leading to the Production and Maintenance Agreement dated today, we discussed in great detail the meaning of full utilization of skilled trades manpower, as referenced in Letter (209) Full Utilization of Skilled Trades, during periods when outside-contractors are being utilized to perform work on the plant premises.
The Union insisted that the Company do everything it can to "perform maintenance^cx>nsfructk>n and tool & die work with its own employees," placing "primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees", "fully utilize its seniority employees," and maintain "maximum employment opportunity", and "always keep the interest of our personnel in mind".
In response to this matter, the Corporation assured the Union that its policy is to fully utilize its own employees to perform maintenance, tool & die, and construction work provided skilled trades employees are available to work and can complete the project under review consistent with cost and timing parameters as well as supporting production requirements of the plant.
The parties agreed the definition of "full utilization" may not necessarily be limited to skilled trades employees working five (5) days per week, eight (8) hours per day but, also, is not necessarily seven (7) days per week, twelve (12) hours per day
280
but may extend to daily, weekend and other overtime periods, when outside contractors are on the plant premises and are performing work customarily and historically performed by UAW bargaining unit personnel.
Any alleged abuses of the aforementioned may be referred to Corporate Union Relations and the UAW DaimlerChrysler Representatives to assist in resolving these issues.

Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During negotiations leading to the 1999 National Production and Maintenance Agreement, the Union cited instances of work being performed by outside contractors while Journeyman or Permanent Employees in that trade have been assigned to work in another skilled trade classification.
In response to this concern, the Union was informed that it is not the intention of the Corporation to assign skilled trades employees to work in another skilled trade classification for the sole purpose of utilizing outside contractors to perform work in their trade. Furthermore, in those instances where the Union has evidence to support assertions that a plant has acted contrary to the intent of this letter, the matter may be referred to the International Union's Skilled Trades Representative who will discuss the issue with the Corporation's Skilled Trades Representative.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During discussions leading to the 1999 Production and Maintenance Agreement, the Union expressed concern that there have been incidents wherein a small number of plants were using apprentices as "regular manpower" which, among other things, precludes the apprentice from receiving the required schedule of work process training under the guidance of journeymen.
The parties agree such alleged inappropriate activity should be investigated and resolved by the Local Apprentice Committee. In the event the matter is not resolved, the Local Apprentice Committee will submit a report, with supporting documentation, to the DaimlerChrysler UAW National Apprentice Committee (DUNAC) for resolution.

Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations the parties discussed the need for specialized training of skilled trades employees and making available supporting documentation and materials such as
283
instruction manuals and software relevant to new machinery and equipment.
The Corporation recognizes that equipment downtime will be minimized and quality and performance improved if training and supporting dpcumentation relevant to the servicing of new equipment is provided to its skilled trades workforce. Toward that end, the Corporation, through the Equipment Supplier Training Group, will monitor new equipment purchases to ensure training and supporting documentation are, when not considered proprietary in nature, made part of the purchase specifications.

(229)	Clarification of Letter 34 - Utilization of Skilled Trades Manpower and Facilities
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
During the course of these negotiations, the Union raised objections and cited examples of alleged abuse by Management of the "except where time and circumstances prevent it" provision of Section (11) (f) of the Supplemental Agreement -Special Provisions Pertaining to Skilled Trades Employees, and as outlined in Letter (34) Item (4) Maintenance and Construction - of the Production & Maintenance Agreement.
The parties acknowledge there are legitimate instances, such as emergencies, where time and circumstances prevent the required advance discussions with the Union prior to work being contracted out. However, absent legitimate reasons, the aforementioned provisions will not be used by Management solely to circumvent the contractual requirements relating to outside contracting notification.
284
In order to address the concerns of the Union, the importance of the requirement of holding "advanced discussions" before work is contracted out will again be communicated to the appropriate parties at each location. In the event a Local Union experiences continued problems in this regard, the matter may be referred to the DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union, which may then raise it with the Skilled Trades Representative of the Corporate Union Relations Office.

(230)	Product Development and
Product Transformation
International Union, UAW
Attention: Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations the parties discussed various issues related to product development and product transformation. Both the Company and the Union recognize that future jobs depend on, among other things, continuing investments in product development. Shifting markets, changing consumer tastes, new governmental regulations, international harmonization of such requirements, and a host of other factors have a direct impact on vehicle development and manufacturing. The products manufactured and services delivered must meet evolving customer preferences and demands at a competitive price.
The Company fully understands the Union's concerns relative to investment in new products and services, and that such investments, while absolutely necessary, may not alone guarantee good future jobs. New products require additional skills, spur changes in labor demand, and entail new sourcing 285
decisions. The parties acknowledge that involving the Union at the earliest stages of the product development cycle is key to attaining job security while meeting the global challenges of improved quality, speed to market, product innovation, and lowering total costs. To that end, the Corporation has been, and continues to be, fully committed to working with the Union to seek and identify appropriate jointly developed technical training programs that will match new skill requirements with evolving technologies, products and services, along with the implementation of new programs to cushion unavoidable dislocative effects of rapid product transformation and development. The Company recognizes that working together will help preserve and grow good paying jobs for all current and future UAW-represented employees at DaimlerChrysler Corporation.
In preceding National Agreements and during these negotiations, the parties have recognized the importance of the Union's role and involvement in the product development cycle and product transformation through provisions, such as the Memorandum of Understanding-Sourcing (M-1), which provide a mechanism for early UAW involvement in the Corporations' plans to proceed with a new or redesigned vehicle. To that end, it is understood and reaffirmed that early during the product development cycle, matters such as sourcing patterns, possible changes in assembly, sub-assembly, stamping, power train and other component sourcing patterns, possible insourcing opportunities, and technology which may impact the represented workforce will be reviewed with the International Union in accordance with the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding-Sourcing (M-1). Such early and up front involvement will allow the Union to continue to be provided with current and anticipated major product developments/product transformations that are having, are expected to have, or could potentially have an effect on employment levels such as projected changes in the major components for motor vehicles (e.g. shift to new propulsion technology and energy storage devices), in materials (e.g. increased use of plastics and/or aluminum in body panels, shift to aluminum castings), in assembly and design (e.g. tor easier assembly/rnanufacturing methods and for disassembly for recycling purposes).
Further, the Union's early involvement during the product development process allows for discussions relative to issues such as the impact of a traditional gas-fueled internal combustion engine vehicle, and, for example, the comparable electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, or dedicated and flexible altemative-liquid-fuel vehicle with respect to major components, materials, and assembly methods. In each case, the Company
286

will indicate the extent to which changes in specifications will handled through the revamping of existing UAW operations, means of technology residing in other divisions of Corporation or by outside sourcing arrangements.
Finally, it is recognized that the Memorandum of Understanding-Sourcing (M-1) provides an avenue for discussions as early as practicable in the product development cycle relative to projected production volume of new materials, components, and products, and the potential impact, if any, on UAW represented jobs.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING | . SOURCING
During the 2003 negotiations the Union raised 1 numerous concerns about the Corporation's | sourcing actions and the impact on employment | opportunities. To that end, the Corporation will $ work with and assist the Union at both the Local | and International levels to preserve jobs, replace | jobs which may be lost by outsourcing action, and | to create jobs for Protected employees and laid off | employees. It is the Corporation's intention tojgrow § the business by;ihcr^w^^^ket^share7hrduqR | new product offerinqsfand to continue to rely upon g its employees and facilities as the source of its | products.	j

National Committee Members	J
The parties have agreed to maintain the i National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee (National Committee), S comprised of Corporation and Union $ representatives. The National Committee shall be co-chaired by the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW (or his g designated representative) and the Senior Vice President of Employee Relations (or his designated representative). The members of the National Committee shall have specific responsibility for

I ProdiictTMn Sourcing Meetings
I The Corporation and Union representative for 4 each Product^Team will meet on an as required Jt basis, as frequently as weekly, but no less than f twice a month.
B In order to facilitate these discussions, the Corporation shall also appoint one Ji) Product Team Specialist from each ProductTe$m to ensure
B that information regarding Product.-Tearn sourcing ® is provided on a timely basis to the designated 8 UAW Sourcing Representative for the respective B Product Team while new or redesigned vehicles are S being developed, and to serve as the Corporation B representative through whom the UAW Sourcing § Representative may arrange for a meeting to || present their competitive in-house alternatives to K Corporation sourcing decisions. In addition, the p; Product Team Specialist shall be responsible for advising the UAW Sourcing Representative of
K meetings, which may occur as frequently as nJ weekly, but no less than twice monthly, and Bl assuring access to same, regarding Corporation S- soyi2!!19_c!edsions[^SeJg^<^^SaE3S0^H^ iMilTalSQ^rwide notice of potential make/buy

ProqramStart Meeting
During these negotiations, the Union expressed || concern relative to full involvement at the earliest gj stages of the decision-making process. To that end, ft the Corporation Product (Team Specialist shall J inform the respective UAW Sourcing | Representative of New Major Vehicles or Major s Redesigned Vehicles at the ProgramZStart Meeting. | Information discussed at this meeting will typically | include program objectives, fePS-qualltypate dates, | marketing objectives and customer requirements, | and potential assembly and stamping plant loading 8 capability.	f

It is imperative that sourcing discussions and notification become an effective and trusted tool. It is recognized that early involvement by the UAW Q g the; CDS, process will greatly enhance the chances || for mutual success and will not jeopardize the fl br^uct^wation objectives of quality, speed to fl market, product innovation, and lower total cost. jl

fluctuate depending on the risk inherent in each product program. Therefore, future sourcing notification timing will vary uniquely with each program on a case-by-case basis. Specific CDS g^dityygi^Jarget dates will be disclosed at the ProqramStart Meeting. The reality of variable program timing and ongoing system change dictates frequent and structured communication for effective sourcing discussion and notification.
Supplier Selection Period
The International Union will be notified in writing by the Corporation of plans to proceed with a new or redesigned vehicle, sub-system or component part. At or around the cdmpjetion of the PrelirhinarvProqram^Specification^Rahmehhefty date, provided in the Program Start Meeting, the National Committee Co-Chairs, Administrative Assistant(s) to the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW, Assistant Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW responsible for Sourcing, other designated senior management representatives, and the appropriate UAW Sourcing Representative(s) shall be provided a Program Overview by senior ProducVTeam management. Such information shall include a review of current sourcing patterns, including the names of suppliers producing components for the current vehicle, any possible changes in assembly, sub-assembly, stamping, power train and other component sourcing patterns which have been identified by the Product Team, possible insourcing opportunities, targeted market and cost objectives, and technology which may impact the represented workforce.
All contemplated sourcing decisions which impact tooling programs, process changes, die
308
309
construction, die design, tool design, stamping tooling, assembly tooling, processes, technology and design and prototype work at Assembly, Stamping, a Power Train and Component manufacturing locations shall also be provided subsequent to the Program Overview. With the information provided during the PrograrrvStart Meeting, Program Overview and subsequent meetings, and as appropriate during the meeting cycle with the UAW Trades Effectiveness Coordinator, the UAW Sourcing Representative may provide input or alternatives to sourcing pattern(s) during the Supplier Selection Period which coincides with the programTStart Meeting and the Final - Program ■S&^ificatidn^ftAstehheftj Bate. If, during these meetings, issues between the UAW Sourcing Representative and their respective Product.Tearri cannot be resolved, the matter may be referred to the National Sourcing Council (Council) for early resolution. The Council shall consist of the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW, Administrative Assistant(s) to the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW, Assistant Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW responsible for Sourcing, Executive Vice President of Manufacturing, Executive Vice President of Product Development, Vice President of Corporate Quality and Senior Vice President of Employee Relations, and other appropriate designates.

310
Specif i cat io ri~~( Laste nheftj, the UAW Sourcing Representatives and UAW Trades Effectiveness Coordinator shall be provided updated and confirming sourcing documentation of the types provided during the Supplier Selection Period as notification of contemplated changes in sourcing patterns. The Corporation's Rrpduct^T^m Director of^Rroqraffn^Maha^rnent and ProductvftTearn management will also supply a copy of such documentation to the Union Relations Sourcing Administration office. This documentation, which will provide the design and engineering sourcing information and prototype sourcing information where different than the production source, shall be forwarded to the appropriate Salaried Local President or Unit Chairperson.
National Committee representatives will monitor sourcing, address sourcing concerns, as well as monitor and oversee employment levels and the administration of the ESS Programs. They shall be provided timely access to all data, including financial and cost information, to evaluate potential sourcing actions and their impact on UAW-represented jobs.
The National Committee shall meet on a quarterly basis. At the quarterly meeting, data j regarding work brought in-house and work outsourced will be provided and discussed. Moreover, the members of the National Committee shall be advised of all Appropriations Requests as they are received, including the number of potential jobs affected. (In addition to providing hard copies, the Corporation will provide a summary of this data on a computer disk.)
Roundtable Meeting
311
An annual Roundtable Meeting will be conducted involving senior management from Source Planning, Procurement and Supply, Product Strategy, Engineering, Manufacturing, Union Relations and the National Committee and the leadership from the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department. The agenda for meetings will include a review of vehicle plans for assembly, stamping, power train and components. Related Source Planning actions to support these plans also will be the subject of the meeting.
It is understood that the Corporation's frank discussion with the Union about sourcing and related plans may require the Union to keep information confidential until the Corporation consents to its release. The Corporation, on its part, also agrees not to use the results of such J discussions to obtain more attractive contract terms j from outsiders in lieu of keeping the work in-house,	i’
Power Train Meeting	|
An annual Power Train Meeting will also be conducted by senior management from Power 1 Train Operations for the National Committee and § the leadership from the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department. The agenda for meetings will include | a review of the Power Train Long Range Plan | (LRP) and the anticipated effect on Power Train 1 plant product loading.	|

Sourcing Rationale	J
The rationale for sourcing actions will consider I the following criteria: the degree to which the J Corporation's resources can be allocated to further | capital expenditures, cost, technology, timing, | quality, statutory requirements, proprietary rights, 1 overall financial stability of affected facilities, |
&
| occupational and related environmental health and | safety issues, the impact on related facilities, and * the impact on long-term job stability. Other factors | considered by the Corporation before a final | sourcing decision is made will include the effect on I employment, and job and income security costs on | both a short and long-term basis. Such criteria ( shall give equal weight to the full impact of a t sourcing action on DaimlerChrysler Corporation-| UAW represented employment levels and the job | and income security of DaimlerChrysler | Corporation-UAW represented employees. The I National Sourcing Committee may form Joint Task | Forces to ensure full implementation of such criteria I throughout the Corporation and, on an as needed | basis, to address any specific sourcing areas of < concern identified by the Union.
The National parties will jointly further develop 1 the above criteria to be used to address sourcing S issues. In developing financial criteria, appropriate S; Corporate return on investment and burden will be ij considered. Pertinent criteria will be applied B consistently in comparisons of internal and external g. supply capability.
if Local Committee
| The appropriate member(s) of the National ? Committee will assist the Local Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee | (Local Committee) in implementing the provisions I of the Sourcing Memorandum. If the parties cannot J resolve a sourcing issue, the Local Union may file a 1 grievance at the third step of the regular Grievance 1 Procedure. If the grievance cannot be resolved, the 1 grievance may be appealed to the Appeal Board in J accordance with the Grievance Procedure. In the f event the Appeal Board is unable to resolve the issue, it may be appealed to the Impartial
313
312
Chairman. The Impartial Chairman can only provide a remedy where he finds that (1) a violation of the express commitments set forth in this Memorandum has been Established; (2) the established violation resulted from the exercise of improper judgment by Management; and (3) any employee who customarily would perform the work in question has been laid off or was allowed to remain on layoff as a result of work being outsourced or not being brought in-house. The Impartial Chairman's remedy shall be limited to back wages for the affected employees, and the recall and/or placement of affected employees on regular productive work.
Temporary Offloading
When a temporary offloading action is being contemplated, the Plant Manager or his designate will provide to the President of the Local Union, a written notice containing the reasons under consideration for the temporary offloading at that location. The notice of the offloading action will be given as soon as practicable, consistent with the reasons such offloading becomes necessary and expected date of return. Copies of this notice also will be provided to the UAW Assistant Director responsible for Sourcing and other National Sourcing Council members.
Temporary offloading notification is not intended to provide a means for circumvention and abuse of the normal outsourcing notification procedures outlined in this Agreement. Should circumstances arise that an offloading action may be viewed as no longer temporary, the local parties will meet to discuss their respective concerns relative to the projected return of the work. Should these issues remain unresolved at the Local Union and Plant Management level, such matters shall be 314
referred to Corporate Union Relations and the Assistant Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW responsible for Sourcing in an attempt to reach a resolution. If after discussions, it is deemed appropriate, the Corporation shall forward a copy of the temporary offloading notice to the Vice President and Director of the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department.
In addition, the following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of UAW members:
Insourcing
The National Committee and, where appropriate, the Local Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Union identifies as that which might be performed competitively within the location based on the criteria outlined above.
To assist in this process, the International Union will be furnished a complete list of work similar to that currently performed at the location that (1) has been outsourced from that location, or (2) is currently performed by non-DaimlerChrysler UAW suppliers for DaimlerChrysler Corporation. These lists will be updated and will include the suppliers' location (city and state), union affiliation and the supplier contract expiration dates, if any, and will be furnished on an annual basis during the second quarter. The parties will initiate efforts to insource particular work consistent with the aforementioned criteria to create prospects for growth and to provide jobs for Protected employees and employees on layoff.
315
If it is established that certain work can be performed competitively, judged by the above criteria, Management will adopt the Committee’s proposal and, barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work in-house. The Union shall obtain any necessary approval or ratification within thirty (30) days of the decision to bring the j work in-house.
Outsourcing
Outsourcing as used herein means the Corporation's sourcing of work from j DaimlerChrysler Corporation UAW locations, j including work connected with current, new or I redesigned vehicles, fabricated parts, power trainx | component products, dies and fixtures.	|
If changes to the published and distributed 1 sourcing pattern are contemplated at any time | during the vehicle development or production cycle | through the initiation of make/buy studies, or when | any change in sourcing direction for a process | unrelated to vehicle development is contemplated, the International Union, the UAW Sourcing Representative, and the Local Union at the affected location will be given written notice. When the Source Planning function, or the equivalent function at either the Corporate, Division or plant level, contemplates an outsourcing decision^ the International Union, the UAW Sourcing Representative, and the affected Local hourly and salary Unions will be provided written confirmation of the action. The notice shall be provided to the Union as far in advance as possible or promptly following approval, and consistent with the timing requirements of the product's development cycle. The notice will provide, on a confidential basis, the reason for the outsourcing, a description of the work involved, the number of jobs affected on both
316
a short-term and long-term basis, it known, at both the affected facility and any other DaimlerChrysler Corporation-UAW represented facility, the identification of the sourcing authority, the quality status of the recommended supplier, and all financial and cost information. Proposals to keep the work in-house will be made by the Union within ninety (90) days of the receipt of written notice.
If it is established that the work can be performed competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in the Memorandum of Understanding, Management will, barring unique and unforeseen circumstances, keep the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approval or ratification within thirty (30) days of the decision to keep the work in-house.
Where make/buy study findings do not impact
the current sourcing pattern, the notice contemplated sourcing will be withdrawn.
5 When such an outsourcing decision 4 contemplated at any level of the Corporation,
of
is the
written notice will be given to the Vice President ) and Director, DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW. ?■ A copy of such notice will be given to the Chairperson of the Local Committee at the same ? time.
When such a contemplated outsourcing
4 decision is initiated by the Corporation at a level

1 external to the affected location(s), the Corporation jjr will provide sufficient advance written notice to J allow the designated Management representative at >: the affected location(s) to comply with the ; notification procedure.
317
Additionally, International Union and Local Union input will be sought by the Corporation as early as possible in the outsourcing decisionmaking process. The intent of the evaluation period and Union input being sought as early as possible is to allow for more thorough discussion and to permit the parties to better assess the impact of outsourcing on the long-term job stability of employees and the financial viability of given Corporate locations.
The Corporation will not enter into a contractual relationship with a non-DaimlerChrysler UAW supplier until such time as the designated Management representative of the impacted location provides written verification that the above notification procedure and discussion by the Local Committee has taken place.
The Corporation agrees to a full disclosure to the International Union of the procedures utilized in the sourcing decision-making process.
Full implementation of the processes contained within this Memorandum should provide the parties the mechanisms to take advantage of every opportunity to use internal resources.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON OVERTIME U.S. PLANTS
Introduction
The parties recognize that the manufacturing operations of the Corporation are highly and completely integrated. An interruption at one stage of the production process, whether during the regular workday, workweek, or overtime or other, premium hours, can, and probably will, cause costly interruptions of the process at earlier and/or later stages. This Memorandum represents an accommodation between the needs of the Corporation and the rights of individual employees to decline overtime work on occasion for a variety of individual and personal reasons.
The parties have earnestly sought during negotiations resulting in the contract dated today, feasible steps that the Corporation might take in scheduling overtime work to provide employees an opportunity to accept or decline work opportunities during such periods, and have reached the following understanding which shall constitute a supplement to the National Production and Maintenance Agreement.
1.	Daily Overtime.

VIII. Ergonomics
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed the comprehensive ergonomics program covering facilities under the National Production^ MaintenanceV/and^Rar^ Supplemental Agreement which had been agreed to by the Corporation and the UAW.
The Corporation explained to the Union that Advance Manufacturing Engineering (AME) has developed a set of internal guidelines for ergonomics. These guidelines erne contained within
be^gn? Standard^and j^jllj^bf reviewed with the UAW Ddimlefehrvsle^e ° Department ' ' and * the* International Union. The parties understand the
importance of implementing sound ergonomic guidelines at the earliest stages of the product/process development cycle.	In that
context, Design and Process person nelf including buppliefs}lfwili review the principles of the 347
baimlerChrysler.Do's and Ddn'fg and take them into account when working on advance programs. The Corporation will review the internal guidelines for ergonomics with the NJC every six (6) months.
The parties agreed that to facilitate proper control, training and communication of ergonomic factors, the various phases of the jointly developed ergonomics program will be applied to employees at all UAW represented facilities including Skilled Trades, O&C and Engineering Bargaining Unit employees.
(A)	Coordination of Activities
The UAW-DaimlerChrysler National Training Center shall coordinate its ergonomic activities under the direction of the NJC with coordination of Corporate Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) and Advance Manufacturing Engineering ergonomic activities and provide on-going technical support to plant/PDC ergonomic efforts.

A quarterly report of their activities will be submitted to the NJC.
4.	This individual's duties are to be determined by the NJC.
5,	Tools used in analyzing jobs shall include ErqoPAE to identify general risk factors, the NIOSH 1981 Lifting Formula to look at lifting and lowering conditions, the Snook-Cirello Tables to evaluate push and pull motions, and the DaimlerChrysler manufacturing engineering ergonomic guidelines. Additional requirements will be jassesSed'by tl UointStudyTCommittee definedinXetter 162 ai reviewed by the NJC for approval.
6.	The NJC shall annually review the program’s performance and effectiveness and make appropriate modifications as required.
350
(C)	Control Measures and Skilled Trades
The parties agree, to the extent possible, to encourage the use of all reasonable control methods to prevent MSD's. Ergonomic remediation efforts may be based on the results of a variety of tools, including job analysis. Job analysis on skilled trades jobs will be performed as required. Members of the Local Ergonomics Committee will consider solutions within a combination of feasible
controls such as:
a.	Re-design or re-orient parts, tools and equipment
b.	Use of mechanical devices or power tools
c.	Provide adjustable fixtures and work surfaces d. Job re-design










As interim measures pending engineering changes, or where engineering changes are limited in controlling risk factors, administrative controls and feasible work practices will be implemented. Members of the ergonomics committee could : consider solutions for reduction of repetitive motions within a combination of feasible administrative controls such as job sharing and job ; rotation. The recommendations of the Local Ergonomics Committee shall be mutually agreed upon with the Plant Shop Chairman and the Labor ^Relations Supervisor. Problems not resolved at the local level will be forwarded to the National Joint ’ Committee for final resolution. Jobs considered ; potential candidates for administrative control i practices will be reviewed by the health and safety trainer/ergonomic analyst to determine that the original condition will not be further aggravated. Any type of control established should be evaluated 'after three (3) months of its implementation to ; confirm its effectiveness.
351
(D)	Job Analysis and Time Lines
Jobs wifi be identified as candidates for analysis by reviewing injury/illness and lost time data, including the ”54-08" Report arid~appropriatd OHMreportfs). A good faith effort shall be made to conduct an initial job analysis, as required, within two (2) months of when a job is identified as having a potential MSP risk factor. Each facility will use a documentation process to record progress with ergonomic modification efforts, in that regard, a monthly report will be required of the Local Ergonomic Committee to be forwarded to Corporate OSH and the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department. Each facility shall implement feasible measures to control MSDj risk factors. A good faith effort will be made to implement ergonomic solutions within a six (6) month time frame after the Local Ergonomics Committee determines that corrective action is required and it prioritizes the remediation. The parties acknowledge that there may be times when it may take longer than six (6) months to make the proper correction, and the reasons need to be documented. The Local Ergonomics Committee is to; develop ajTpp	the-most^nceminc

If not resolved, the matter should be referred to the National Employee Participation Council (NEPC) for immediate resolution.
(E)	Ergonomic Support Equipment

I Seats, chairs and mats are considered > appropriate solutions to control ergonomic risk i factors. The Corporation agrees that it will not \ remove ergonomic support equipment that is : currently in use for ergonomic reasons without mutual agreement with the Local Ergonomics
• Committee.

(F) Program Management


The Corporation will continue to support a medical management program for early detection, treatment and placement of employees with
The NJC will continue to review and, when
necessary, revise audit procedures in an effort to ensure the effectiveness of the ergonomic process. The NJC will also review periodic reports of the occurrence of cumulative trauma from all UAW
represented facilities. Problems arising regarding the proper functioning of Local Ergonomics Committees may be referred to the NJC for review and resolution by appropriate Corporate and Union representatives.
The NJC will continue to develop and sponsor an annual conference'^ubiect to^tlieAJoint^Activities Board^apbrovsti! for ail designated Local Ergonomics Committee members to disseminate information about state-of-the-art application, to review project funding procedures and other ergonomic administrative matters and to share information on successful local ergonomics projects.
353
Acceptable new methods of employee training, j medical evaluation, and Ergonomics Committee I training will be evaluated and implemented by the ] NJC, as appropriate, to assure efficient control of 1 MSB's.	|
New workable ergonomic concepts, including specific technical information, will be distributed by J the NJC to all UAW-represented plants. A video library of corrective actions taken regarding j ergonomic	problem areas, by various 0
DaimlerChrysler facilities with documentation for fi
dissemination to facilities will be maintained at the National Training Center.
$
The parties recognized that ergonomic activities are being conducted at many

DaimlerChrysler facilities, including ergonomics committees established during the previous agreements. It is not the intent of the parties to ® reduce any currently existing efforts in ergonomics, fl
This procedure shall not preclude the filing of a
Health and Safety Grievance at Step 1 of the ®

(7)	TERMINATION OF CHECK-OFF. An employee who loses seniority for any one of the reasons specified in Section (49) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement or the corresponding Section of the Parts Depot Agreement or who is transferred to work outside the bargaining unit before the pay period from which Union membership deductions are made, shall cease to be subject to Check-Off deductions beginning with the month in which the loss of seniority or transfer took place. An employee who loses seniority as provided herein, or who is transferred to work outside the bargaining unit, during or after the pay period as to which Union membership dues deductions are made shall cease to be subject to Check-Off deductions beginning with the month immediately following the month in which the loss of seniority or transfer took place.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING 1
COLA FOLD-IN

Effective the beginning of the first pay period following receipt by the Corporation from the International Union of written Notice of Ratification of the applicable agreements, and in accordance Ji with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Mlj dollars, ($2.00) shall be added to the base hourly|| rates of non-incentive employees and to the4| minimum and maximum base hourly rate for each'Ij such employee's classification and, in the case of incentive employees, to the incentive earned rate^j and shall not be taken into account for purposes of incentive calculation. An equal amount of
dollars. ($2.00) shall be deducted from the iwci^ dollars- and five :<oentsS ^2.05) CosW-Uvingji
Allowance that was in effect on September 2^
I
2003, and thereafter the allowance shall be$ computed in accordance with Subsection (c), of$
Section (109) of the Agreement covering| Production; Maintenance and^Parts employees. ,
t Accordingly, the parties have agreed to this r ESS Program, and have pledged to work together, r- consistent with this Program and other provisions of
| the National Agreements, to enhance | Corporation's competitive position.
the
| The cornerstone of the ESS Program I commitment to certain pre determined | employment levels (BELs), a series of
is a base BEL
I Benchmark Minimums, and protection against J indefinite layoff for eligible employees as expressly I' provided herein.
SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM
B Base Employment Levels
t (A) Base Employment Levels (BELs) (i.e., [numbers of eligible employees or positions covered ';by this Program as defined herein) initially shall be (established as of the Effective Date for each Unit as ^listed in the Index of Units contained in the JProduction and Maintenance and Parts Depot I Agreements.
376

377
Separate Unit BELs shall be established for non-skilled and skilled employees. The transfer of an employee between a skilled and non-skilled unii will cause the Unit BEL for the unit receiving the employee to increase and the other to decrease unless the movement occurred to satisfy the BEL BenchmarkMinimum, in which case the Unit BELfl will remain the same in each unit.
The j199^ initial BEL for each Unit wag determined^ as being equal to the sum of 1) the number of active employees with one or more years seniority at work and on roll in the Unit, on the Effective Date; 2) the number of active employees with less than one (1) year of seniority occupying BEL slots on the Effective Date; and 3) the number of unfilled new hire obligations as of the Effective Date due to application of the outsourcing/new hire provisions of the 1996 Agreement (Article II (B) 2.c.) . Such active employees will be BEL eligible and the term active employee will, include an employee at work as well as an employee not at work who is:

1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
on vacation,
receiving paid absence allowance,
receiving bereavement pay, on jury duty,
on leave of absence of ninety (90) days
duration,
6)	on temporary layoff, and
7)	any other employee having attachment to the active workforce.

Covered Events
(C)	A covered event hereunder is any event that, absent the protection provided herein, would cause the layoff of one or more BEL eligible active employees for any reason except those actions or events specified in Section (D) below.
The obligation to provide benefits hereunder shall not arise unless one (1) or more covered events would otherwise result in a reduction or further reduction, during the term of this Agreement, in the number of BEL eligible active employees.
Excluded Events
(D)	No employee will be laid off during the term of this Agreement except for the following reasons:
1)	volume related declines attributable to market related conditions as described in Letter (126), ESS Program - Volume Related Layoffs -BEL, not to exceed fortv-eiqhl (4§) weeks (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks except for shutdowns taken during periods of model change over or plant rearrangement) over the term of this Memorandum of Understanding;
BEL Benchmark Minimums
(B) A series of BEL Benchmark Minimums will g be established for each Unit effective Septembe||| 30-,2003..equal to 90% :oQ^e lihit^ Initial Basdll 378	11
379
2)	acts of God or other such reasons beyond the control Qf the Corporation;
3)	the sale of a part of the Corporation's operations as an ongoing business;
4)	where the employee has been recalled or reassigned to fill an opening known in advance to be temporary; or
5)	model change or plant rearrangement until the employee otherwise would have been recalled.
An employee impacted by any of the above reasons is, if otherwise eligible, covered by the appropriate Supplemental Agreements which are attached to the National Agreement as Exhibits.
(E) The number of employees Protected by this ESS Program will be the equivalent of the employees within the BEL who would otherwise have been laid off as a result of any event other than those described in paragraph 1(D).
II. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BEL -ELIGIBILITY
Following the initial determination of a Unit BEL, it will be adjusted as follows:
(A)	An employee shall become BEL-eligible for any of the following reasons, at which point the Uriif BEL will be increased by one (1) position for each such employee: (1) an employee in the active workforce, as defined by Paragraph l(A) who had less than one (1) year seniority on the Effective Date who subsequently attains one (1) year of seniority; (2) an employee with one (1) or more years seniority who is recalled, except if recalled to
380
satisfy the BEL, and who is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the Effective Date; (3) an employee with less than one (1) year seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the BEL, who subsequently attains one (1) year seniority and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the Effective Date; (4) an employee newly hired/rehired after the Effective Date who attains three (3) years seniority; (5) an employee deemed to be eligible, recalled or newly hired in order to satisfy a BEL Benchmark Minimum. Notwithstanding the above, the National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing (JSOES) Committee is authorized to establish special mechanisms, including BEL eligibility provisions, for the purpose of attracting new work.
(B)	The Unit BEL will be reduced for the attrition of eligible employees who quit, retire or die.










(C)	Unit BELs will be adjusted in the event of a transfer of operations or consolidations between Units on a one-for-one basis by reducing the sending Unit's BEL and increasing the receiving . Unit's BELs by the corresponding number of jobs






involved in the transaction.
Similarly,





corresponding adjustments will also be made to the BEL Benchmark Minimums of each affected Unit.




(Q) Each employee who leaves the bargaining : unit for a permanent salaried position will be ; replaced immediately with no effect on the Unit ’ BEL. For each salaried employee returning to the r bargaining unit, the Unit BEL will be increased by
381
one (1). The transfer of an employee between non-skilled/skilled and salaried will cause the Unit BEL for the bargaining unit receiving the employee to increase and the other to decrease.
A
(g) BEL-eligible employees off roll will maintain their eligibility upon reinstatement.
® Notwithstanding the above, BEL Benchmark Minimums will not be established for a facility determined to be closing.
(§) BEL Benchmark Reviews/Actions
1.	Following the last pay ending of each month and within ten (10) working days of the following month (BEL Benchmark Review), the number of BEL-eligible employees in each Unit shall be compared to the Unit's corresponding BEL Benchmark Minimum. Adjustments will be made consistent with the provisions of this Memorandum, and attrition replacement obligations will be fulfilled as set forth below.
2.	When the number of BEL-eligible employees exceeds the Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-two basis by recalling employees on layoff in accordance with the procedure described in Section (3)(b) below.
3.	When the number of BEL-eligible employees would otherwise fall below the Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-one basis by the following actions in order to maintain eligible employment at the Benchmark Minimum:	I
a.	First, by allowing an ineligible active seniority employee at the affected facility to become eligible.
382
I b. Second, by recalling employees on layoff i from that facility, and employees on Return to | Home Plant. Next, the highest seniority volunteer | on the combined Labor Market Area List would be I called, in accordance with Section lll(D). If there | are no employees on that list, the employee with | the highest seniority between the Out of Labor | Market Area List and the Return to Former Labor I Market Area List would fill the opening on a | voluntary basis.
| c. Or third, by hiring new employees up to the | net number of jobs outsourced minus those J insourced (as defined in MOU-1 of the Agreement | and determined by the National Committee) I subsequent to the Effective Date. Such positions | will be filled on a Unit BEL basis no later than ninety R (90) days following the BEL Benchmark Review, R except when the affected Unit is encountering E	volume-related layoffs jjn?has
R pipldvees ib proterted'status'^Seasons^othe^
H 4. Notwithstanding the above, the net H outsourcing/new hire obligation provided in Section H (3)(c) above shall be activated earlier than required E therein if and when the number of BEL-eligible K employees is less than the greater of: (1) the^BEL H Benchmark Minimum for the quarter; or (2) 9Q% of j| the Unit's Snapshot BEL under the 1999 K Agreement.
H 5. If, after fulfilling the above requirements, subsequent attritions would cause the number of BEL-eligible employees to fall below the Unit's E Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on the following basis:
E a. When the number of BEL-eligible E employees is greater than 90% but less than 100%
Kt	383
of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each three (3) attritions.
b.	When the number of BEL-eligible employees is ^greater than 80% but less than 90% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each two (2) attritions.
c.	When the number of BEL-eligible employees is below 80% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each one (1) attrition.
d.	Such positions will be filled on a Unit BEL basis no later than ninety (90) days following the BEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected unit is encountering market-driven voIume-related layoffs	fas

384
7.	In the event new hire obligations are fulfilled through the placement of new employees at a Unit other than the one at which the obligations were created, BELs for the respective Units will be s adjusted on a one-for-one basis, by reducing the BEL at the Unit where the openings occurred by the ; number of new hire fulfillments and.correspondingly ■ increasing the BEL(s) at the Unit(s) where the new ; hires were placed. Similarly, offsetting adjustments ; will also be made to the BEL Benchmark Minimums ; of each affected Unit.
If the BEL number results in less than a whole number, the Engineering Method of Rounding will ? be used to determine the BEL.
I III. PROTECTED EMPLOYEES
_ (A) If an event, other than those described in 1(g), would otherwise cause the number of BEL eligible employees to be laid off, the employees so Protected, as provided for in l(Q), will be placed on Protected employee status after application of the seniority provisions of the National and Local ; Seniority Agreements.
(B	) The parties recognize that covered events may occur during the course of this Agreement that ) will cause the number of BEL Protected employees I to exceed the Corporation's production I, requirements. The parties recognize further that ■ the scope of this program requires flexibility with regard to the assignment of such employees.
;	(C) In this regard, the Local Job Security,
< Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee D will ensure that assignments are made on a basis J consistent with the seniority provisions of the
385
Collective Bargaining Agreement and local seniority agreement, while also meeting plant needs, minimizing workforce disruption and enhancing the personal growth and development of employees. After a decision by the Local Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee, an available Protected employee may be (1) placed in a training program, (2) used as a replacement to facilitate the training of another employee, (3) placed in a job opening at another DaimlerChrysler Corporation-UAW plant provided there is no employee on layoff from the plant with a seniority recall entitlement to such opening, and no employee on layoff in the same Labor Market Area who would otherwise be entitled to that opening pursuant to Section (64) of the National Agreement, unless otherwise directed by the National Committee, (4) given a job assignment within or outside the bargaining unit which may be non-traditional, (5) placed in an existing opening or (6) given other assignments consistent with the purposes of this Memorandum of Understanding.
In Labor Market Area Placement
(D) The placement provisions outlined in this MOU, including Return to Home Plant and Return to Former Labor Market Area, remain in effect, irrespective of the status of the Fund. For In Labor Market Area Placement, job opportunities will be filled in seniority order from a combined list of Protected and laid off employees in the same Labor Market Area. The number of Protected employees made available for placement cannot exceed the number of employees who have been laid off for the duration of the forty-eight (48) week volume related layoff limit. For placement purposes, employees on the Labor Market Area List will be offered, in seniority order, the opportunity to volunteer for openings based on a canvass at time 386

VI

& of layoff or placement into Protected employee | status. Volunteers will be placed in seniority order. | Absent volunteers, the junior employee on the b combined Labor Market Area List must transfer to I the new location. The Unit BEL will be increased I by one (1) at the location to which the employee is I transferred and reduced by one (1) at the location | from which the employee transferred, unless the I transfer satisfied the BEL, in which case the BEL I will remain the same at both locations.

I. Employees permanently transferred to another t location may remain at the secondary location until | laid off from that location, at which time they may I elect options available under Letter (176) or elect to | return to their "home" plant under the terms and L conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding -| Return to Home Plant.
£
K A Labor Market Area is comprised of all plants | within a fifty (50) mile radius of a given plant or | larger as may be agreed upon by the National Job H Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing i. Committee.

i Out of Labor Market Area employees will be | offered the opportunity to volunteer. If the f employee refuses the opportunity, he/she will | remain at his/her facility.

S (E) In the event there is an opening due to a | volume increase, the highest seniority available i Protected employee, seniority permitting, will be B placed in this opening, unless the Local Committee ^determines the employee should first complete the | employee's current assignment. If seniority B employees are on layoff from that plant, a number Hl of such employees, equivalent to the number of
387
Protected employees placed in openings due to $ volume increases, will be recalled from layoff. A
'|ri
Protected employee transferred to another fl DaimlerChfysler-UAW plant due to a volume f| increase who is subsequently laid off from the fl secondary plant due to a volume decrease will be 11 returned, should he/ she so elect, to available gl openings at the employee's home plant, seniority permitting.	fi
(F)	A layoff caused by an event described in 1(D) will have no impact on the number of Protected employees, except for an employee who is
T

Protected from a layoff attributable to a market-related volume decline in excess of forty-eight (4g) j
weeks (inclusive of Vacation Shutdown except for^ Model Change or Plant Rearrangement). In suctra
instances, those Protected employees having the least seniority will be laid off and replaced by an :

equivalent number of greater seniority employees ® who would otherwise have insufficient seniority to J remain in the plant.	11
(G)	A Protected employee will continue to '<! receive his/her regular straight time hourly rate of 3 pay. The regular rate of pay for an employee under 3 an incentive plan will be the employee's average tj straight-time hourly earnings for the hours worked $1 in the last four (4) pay periods immediately preceding the pay period during which he/she was® determined to be Protected. In the event aJ| Protected employee is assigned to another JI classification, the employee will receive the rate of--Ml pay as provided by the National Agreement.
■ ■■ W
(H)	Protected employee assignments will be <1 considered temporary and not subject to provisions governing permanent filling of vacancies or the application of shift preference, except for *
388	S
| assignments to fill openings resulting from volume I increases. Experience gained from these temporary ft assignments will not be used to advantage such I. employees over other employees for selection to fill | permanent vacancies, nor will such employees ft have seniority in the department to which they have | temporarily been assigned.
I (1) An employee replaced by a Protected | employee will receive his/her regular straight-time ft hourly rate of pay, and will be returned to the same classification and job assignment upon completion | of the replaced employee's assignment. The | regular rate of pay for an employee under an I incentive plan will be the employee's average I,- straight-time hourly earnings for the hours worked in the last four (4) pay periods immediately | preceding the pay period during which he/she is | replaced by the Protected employee. In the event H the employee has insufficient seniority to return to II the formerly held classification, the employee will k be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of B the local supplemental seniority agreement.
H (J) if an employee would have been B transferred pursuant to Sections (66) or (71) of the National Agreement or placed in an Apprentice || program were it not for participation in a training ||- assignment provided by this Program, the employee will be so transferred upon completion of K the training assignment, tn the event the employee U would have been selected for an Apprentice H assignment the employee's date of entry will be H adjusted as if the employee's assignment had not H been delayed.
1	(K) A training assignment will be voluntary on
if the part of an employee being replaced by a > Protected employee, unless such training is to S.	389
develop or improve technical skills relevant to the employee's current job assignment or anticipated future job needs.
(L)	Within the Labor Market Area, no Protected r employee will be temporarily assigned to a job & outside of the bargaining unit except on a voluntary; * basis, subject to the direction of the National ; Committee.
Outside the Labor Market, permanent transfers: ; of Protected employees are voluntary. Such an1 employee will remain Protected at his/her facility upon refusal to transfer.
(M)	A Protected employee who is permanently ; transferred out of the Labor Market Area in accordance with this paragraph, or if so transferred^ later, after being laid off, elects to return to a former location, will be eligible to receive a relocation^ allowance as provided in the Exhibits to thet^ National Agreement after providing documentation^ satisfactory to Management that the employee has^j changed permanent residence and relocated:'^ Married applicants may initially apply for the "singleO employee" amount and within one (1) year the-^ balance of the "married amount", when theif^ families are relocated. Applicants may receive maximum of two (2) such relocation allowance^ payments during the term of this National^ Agreement. A Protected employee temporarily^ transferred out of the Labor Market Area who does'’ not change permanent residence as a result of thej transfer will receive reasonable transportation andf living expenses for the duration of the assignment^ Any problems connected with the above may befc raised with the National Committee.
*k
390
















(N)	In the event the National Committee determines that the number of Protected employees exceeds the number of expected openings at the plant or within its Labor Market Area within the next succeeding twelve (12) months, Special Programs as set forth in Attachment A may be triggered upon prior approval of the National Committee. Thereafter, to the extent Protected employees still exceed expected openings, such employees, under the direction of the National Committee, may be transferred out of the Labor Market Area pursuant to Section lll(M) above. The National Committee may also explore the extension of Attachment A to other locations to create job opportunities for excess Protected employees within the Labor Market Area.



(O)	Earnings, including wages and wage related payments, received by employees while on Job Security assignments, will be charged against the maximum liability amount. The cost of benefits and other payments made or incurred on behalf of Protected employees, specifically, health care (including dental and vision), group insurance, pensions, legal services, training fund contributions and FICA will be charged against the maximum liability amount. Moving allowance payments and the cost of benefits provided under Attachment A of the Memorandum of Understanding will not be charged against this liability. Earnings received and the cost of benefits and other payments made bn behalf of Protected employees while assigned to ‘fill permanent job openings resulting from volume increases or assigned to other regular and ■productive work (e.g., absentee replacements) will 'Jnot be charged against this liability.
(P)	Charges against the Corporation's liability hll commence with the first payments made to I	391
ii
r
Protected employees and will continue until the® maximum liability is reached or the expiration of the ® Program as provided in this Memorandum oM Understanding, whichever occurs first. The records of such charges will be maintained by theffl Corporation and will be available to the Union at® appropriate times.
IV. ADMINISTRATION OF THE ESS PROGRAM
The Corporation and Union agree that:
(A)	At each bargaining unit covered by this ^ National Agreement, a Local Job Security,^ Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee will be established to administer the Program.

(B)	The membership of the Committee wilful consist of the local Plant Manager, or the.#] Manager's designated representative, and other® representatives selected by Management; the Local Union President or the Local Union President's^ designated representative; and the Plant Shopi|: Committee.

Accordingly, in addition to the Local Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing (JSOES) Committee's responsibilities for the ESS Program and participation in discussions provided in related Letters of Understanding, each committee will focus on cooperative efforts toward our common goal to improve the effectiveness of operations and remove barriers to improvements, increase job opportunities and fully utilize the workforce. The
402
local committees will jointly develop a plan through an exhaustive analysis of the location's operational efficiency.
Within six months of the effective date of the Agreement each Local JSOES Committee will review with Divisional/Group Management and the International Union the overall competitiveness of the location's products and their plans indicating actions, and/or changes needed to improve quality and efficiency at their location and to stimulate job security of the existing workforce and attract new work. Such plans must then be approved by the National JSOES Committee.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING DRUG TESTING
(Return to Work from Substance Abuse Related Medical Leave - Illegal Drugs and Unauthorized Prescription Drugs)
During these negotiations, the Corporation and the Union discussed their firm commitment to helping employees who are affected by substance abuse problems. In particular, the parties reviewed circumstances pertaining to an employee returning to work from substance abuse related medical leave of absence who is still using illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs. The parties agreed that permitting such an employee to return to the workplace jeopardizes the employee's safety and the safety of fellow employees. It also hampers the ability of the Corporation and the Union to meet today's challenges, including the ability to achieve continuous improvement in quality, safety, customer satisfaction, and operating effectiveness.
To address this problem, the parties agreed that drug testing will be included as part of physical examinations for each employee returning to work from a first substance abuse related medical leave for treatment of illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drug use or dependency. For purposes of this Memorandum, only medical leaves occurring after the effective date of the 1996 Agreement will be considered.
Drug testing will be conducted in accordance with established Corporation practice, and the reason for conducting the test and the test results
426
will be strictly confidential and will be made known only to the employee, the Managed Care Program (Help-line) or the employee's Hearth Maintenance Organization (HMO), whichever is applicable, plant physician, and plant Employee Assistance Program (EAP) representatives having a business reason to know.
An individual who tests positive for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs will not return to work except under conditions set forth below. To facilitate recovery, the employee will be referred to the Managed Care Program (Help-line) or the employee's Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), whichever is applicable, and the Employee Assistance Program for assessment and/or followup. Upon meeting the objectives of the prescribed course of treatment and a negative drug test the employee may return to work, but will be subject to drug testing for the following twenty-four (24) months, it being understood that such testing will be conducted no more frequently than six (6) times in any twelve (12) month period. The decision as to when an employee must have such a drug test will be made by the plant Medical Department, and will not be a supervisory determination. If the employee subsequently tests positive for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs, the employee will not be allowed to continue work and will be placed on medical leave. Criteria for returning to work following this subsequent medical leave will be as described above.
The 1996 Letter of Understanding, Employee Assistance Program, reads in part: "Employees with alcoholism, drug dependency, emotional or personal problems will be able to seek help voluntarily without having to be concerned that their
427
employment status will be affected because they have sought help for such problems." This provision notwithstanding, any employee who has
three (3) positive retum-from-medical leave tests I within any three (3) year period may return to work after the third positive test only if, in addition to 1 meeting the criteria specified above, that employee | agrees to a twelve (12) month waiver which will in part require the following:	|
■I
(1)	Drug testing during the period of the waiver.	|
(2)	Termination upon a positive drug test | result.	1
(3)	No access to the grievance procedure to protest the reasonableness of any penalty, including discharge, as the result of a positive test ’ for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs during the twelve (12) month period.	?
Other terms and conditions of the waiver may be determined locally by the Company and the Union.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RETURN TO "HOME" PLANT
The parties recognize that some employees placed pursuant to Memorandum of Understanding -Employment Security System (ESS) Program of the P&M or Parts Depot Agreements may have the desire to return to their "home" plant. The parties recognize also that, in affording such employees the opportunity to return, it is necessary to do so in a manner consistent with the maintenance of quality and efficiency in both the releasing and receiving plants. Accordingly, the purpose of this Memorandum is to provide methods and procedures and to detail the circumstances whereby eligible employees will be offered the opportunity to return to their "home" plant.
1. Eligible employees are those active employees who have been assigned to a plant other than their "home" plant or to a plant outside the Labor Market Area pursuant to the ESS Program. Eligible employees are further defined as those placed:	'
a.	Prior to the effective date of the 1993 Agreement who were not offered an opportunity to return to their "home" plant pursuant to the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding, or
b.	Subsequent to the effective date of the 1993 Agreement and who have worked at least six (6) months at the new plant.
430
2.	Eligible employees may file an application to return to their "home" plant at the Employment Office on or after their anniversary of the sixth (6th) month following placement. Employees will be provided a copy of their application.
3.	Eligible employees who have applied to return to their "home" plant shall be placed (in seniority order) on a "return home" list at the "home" plant.
4.	Each facility will maintain an applicant listing for use by the local parties.
5.	Should a plant with a "return home" list have employment requirements, it will combine its Protected employee, "return home" list and recall list (if any) in seniority order and recall from such combined list until its needs are met or such combined list is exhausted. Should the combined list be exhausted and additional employment required, it will fill further openings in accordance with other applicable agreements between the parties and then by hire.
6.	Should an employee return to his "home" plant under the provisions of paragraph 5 above, the employee will forfeit seniority rights at the "releasing" plant. Should an employee, having requested return under paragraph 2 above, subsequently refuse an offer of return, the employee shall lose seniority at all plants of the Corporation except the plant at which he is working.
7.	It is recognized that the plant from which the eligible employee is released must do so in a manner consistent with the maintenance of quality and efficiency. Accordingly, no eligible employee
431
will be released until a fully trained replacement is available. Consistent with these principles, it is recognized that the rate at which employees are released may vary due to the types of jobs held by ''retumees”, the availability of replacement personnel, product or new model launch, releasing plant staffing requirements, etc. In all cases, management will endeavor to release employees as quickly as possible. Disputes regarding this issue may be referred to the Company's Employee Relations Staff and the UAW's National DaimlerChrysler Department for resolution.
8.	Employees transferring pursuant to the provisions of this Memorandum will be placed on available work and will not be eligible to alter the vacation schedules in effect at the time of their return.
9.	An employee accepting transfer will be eligible to receive a relocation allowance as provided in the Exhibits to the National Agreement after providing documentation satisfactory to Management that the employee has changed permanent residence and relocated.
10.	It is understood that this Memorandum in no way alters the placement provisions as set forth in the Memorandum of Closed Plants.
11.	The parties recognize that the provisions of this Memorandum have complex administrative implications. Accordingly, claims of violation are not subject to the Grievance Procedure but instead may be referred to the Corporation's Employee Relations Staff and the UAWs National DaimlerChrysler Department for resolution.

(1A) Grievance Procedure
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr.^NateGooderi
Dear Sirs:
Both parties to the Parts Depots Agreement signed today acknowledge the desirability of ensuring prompt and fair resolution of employee grievances. The attached flow charts illustrate the proper sequence of procedural steps to be used in processing employee grievances.
The Corporation assures the Union that it is interested in seeing that all grievances receive prompt and objective consideration on their merits. The Union assures the Corporation that it will make a sincere and determined effort to keep the procedure free of unmeritorious grievances.
Also, during our recent contract negotiations the Corporation pointed out that Special Conferences, as provided for in Section (21), are in some instances being used to circumvent the Grievance Procedure. Such action hinders the expeditious handling of grievances. The parties agree Section (21) was not intended to provide the means for circumvention and abuse of the Grievance Procedure and will put forth their best efforts to eliminate any such abuse.
440
To further assist in expediting the handling of a grievance, it is understood if a grievance has not been resolved in Step 3 of the grievance procedure within forty-five (45) days after its appeal from the previous Step, unless held over by mutual agreement between the parties for further discussion, the representative of Management at that Step may answer the grievance tn writing without a meeting.
The parties also discussed problems created as a result of the submission of written grievances containing insufficient information. It is agreed that each grievance submitted in writing shall set forth in reasonable detail the date and nature of the grievance, identity of the employee or employees involved by name, seniority date, classification or location, insofar as diligent effort will allow, and the provisions of the applicable agreement, if any, that the Union claims the Corporation has violated. Management's answers will set forth facts taken into account in answering the grievance.

(4A) Memorandum of Understanding on
Overtime U.S. Plants
Internationa) Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Jack Laskowski
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations the Union requested the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Overtime -U.S. Plants which supplement the National Production and Maintenance Agreement, be extended to the Parts Depots.
In the course of these discussions, the parties recognized that in view of the need for customer satisfaction and the strong competition in the market place, the parts distribution operations must be highly responsive to the needs of the dealer body, 444
including the timely processing and delivery of parts. Therefore, notwithstanding the limitations set forth in the aforementioned Memorandum, the parties further recognized the essential need to continue providing full support to the requirements of the Dedicated Delivery Service. Any interruption in the delivery schedule can be costly to the Corporation as well as prevent dealers from properly servicing their customers and could influence their decisions to purchase parts from independent distributors rather than the Corporation.
In consideration of the above, the Corporation agreed to extend the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Overtime - U.S. Plants to the Parts Depots with the following understandings:
1.	New Systems, processes and Technological Changes
When the Service and Parts Operations launch a new system, process or technological change, any location or locations so designated shall, for a period of ninety (90) days after such designation, be exempt from the provisions of the Memorandum, provided, however, that fifteen (15) days prior to making such designation, the Corporation will inform the Chrysler Department of the Internationa) Union, which will indicate its objections, if any, to such designation. It is understood this circumstance may occur at any location more than once during the term of the Memorandum.
2.	Christmas Holiday Period
The provisions of the Memorandum that limit daily and weekend overtime shall be inoperative at each Parts Depot during seven days of the four (4) weeks following the Christmas Holiday Period except the local parties may mutually agree to extend the inoperative period an additional three (3) weeks.
3.	New Depots
The provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding that limit or restrict the right of the Corporation to require daily overtime work or work on Saturdays or Sundays shall be ineffective at any Depot the Corporation builds, buys, leases or remodels for a period of one (1) year after regular production In such Depot commences.
The Local Union at each Parts Depot has made its selection of one of the alternatives provided for under 11 C. of the Memorandum.

VIII.	Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict any employee's rights under Section 502 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended by the Labor Management Act. 1947.
IX.	During the 2003 negotiations, the parties discussed the comprehensive ergonomics program covering the Parts Distribution Centers which had been agreed to by the Corporation and the UAW. The parties agreed that to facilitate proper control, training and communication of ergonomic factors, the various phases of the jointly developed ergonomics program will be applied to employees at all UAW represented Parts Distribution Centers.
(a)--Local Ergonomics Committees
Each facility has established a Local Ergonomics Committee with the objective of introducing and exploring ways to reduce injuries and illnesses through the application of sound ergonomics principles. Upon request, the NJC shall assist the Ergonomics Committees in determining proper allocations of resources. The.Local Health and Safety representatives will serve as co-chairpersons of the Local Ergonomics Committees as specified in the appropriate NJC directive. In the event Corporate Health and Safety representatives and/or Regional
458
Safety/Ergonomic remediation specialists visit a facility to work on an ergonomic issue, they will coordinate their activities with the Local Co-Chairpersons.
Due to the effect that ergonomic injuries may have on employees and the costs ‘ associated with Workers' Compensation, we collaboratively conceived an innovative approach towards addressing the interrelationship between Workers' Compensation and ergonomic injuries in our Parts Distribution Centers. Accordingly, we agreed to the following:
1.	The PDC's Health & Safety Trainer will be allowed time away from their job to perform ergonomic functions and to assist in reducing Workers' Compensation costs.
2.	This individual shall be allowed to function in these activities up to sixteen 06) hours per week for PDC operations.

(b)-Control Measures and Skilled Trades/Power House Maintenance Personnel
The parties agree, to the extent possible, to encourage the use of all reasonable control methods to prevent M&D^. Ergonomic remediation efforts may be based on the results of a
459
variety of toots, including job analysis. Job analysis on skilled trades/Power House Maintenance jobs will be performed as required. Members of the Local Ergonomics Committee will consider solutions within a combination of feasible controls such as:
a.	Re-design or re-orient parts, tools and equipment
b.	Use of mechanical devices or power tools _
c.	Provide adjustable fixtures and work surfaces
d.	Job re-design
As interim measures pending engineering changes, or where engineering changes are limited in controlling risk factors, administrative controls and feasible work practices wifi be implemented. Members of the ergonomics committee could consider solutions for reduction of repetitive motions within a combination of feasible administrative controls such as job sharing and job rotation. The recommendations of the Local Ergonomics Committee shall be mutually agreed upon with the Plant Shop Chairman and the PDC Manager. Problems not resolved at the local level will be forwarded to the National Joint Committee tor tinal resolution. Jobs considered potential candidates tor administrative control practices will be reviewed by the health and safety trainer/ergonomlc analyst to determine that the original condition will not be further aggravated. Any type of control established should be evaluated after three (3) months of its implementation to confirm its effectiveness.
(c)--Job Analysis and Time Lines
Jobs will be identified as candidates for analysis by reviewing injury/illness and lost time data, including the ’'54-08" Report mtoaPorooriateOHM reoortlsi. A good faith effort shall be made to conduct an initial job analysis, as required, within two (2) months of when a job is identified as having a potential fflSD risk factor.

(7A) Uniform Tardiness Procedure Parts Depots
International Union, U.A.W.
Attention;

Dear Sirs:
During a series of discussions in 1963, the parties recognized the desirability of having a Uniform Tardiness Procedure applicable to employees of Chrysler's Parts Depots. Therefore, effective December 1, 1983, a six step Tardiness Procedure, set forth below, was implemented which supplanted all other tardiness procedures then in effect.
During the recent Negotiations, the parties agreed that as of the effective date of the 1993 Agreement, an employee returning to the Depot late from lunch would not be placed into the tardiness procedure, however, could subject themselves to the normal disciplinary procedure for misconduct.
An employee will continue to be subject to the first step of the six (6) step Tardiness Procedure upon the occasion of their seventh (7th) unexcused tardiness within a period of six (6) consecutive months. Thereafter, on each occasion of two (2) unexcused tardiness', the employee win be placed into the next step of the procedure, defined as follows:
Step 1 Step 2 Step 3	Counseling Written Warning Five (5) Day Disciplinary Layoff (serving of disciplinary time off may be waived)
Step 4	Fifteen (15) Day Disciplinary Layoff
Step 5 Step 6	Thirty (30) Day Disciplinary Layoff Discharge
To encourage punctuality, an employee who is in the above procedure, but has not been tardy unexcused for a period of forty-five (45) consecutive days, excluding days the employee is not on the active roll, is to repeat the prior step of the procedure in the event of the employee’s next two (2) unexcused tardiness*. An employee who is in the procedure, but has not been tardy unexcused for one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive cafendai days, excluding those periods when the employee is
463
not on the active roll, will be removed from the procedure and will begin with Step 1 if the employee again meets the criteria for inclusion in the Tardiness Procedure.
Disputes undec this procedure, including whether tardiness should be excused or unexcused, may be subject to the Grievance Procedure?

It is mutually recognized and agreed that the best form of job security is created in an environment in which Management and Union work together in all aspects of the operation.
Continuous Communication
During these negotiations the parties discussed at great length the need for continuous, open communications and regular meetings. The parties acknowledged that good communication does not just happen, and thus cannot be created by mandating meetings or the exchange of verbal and written information, although such formats are sometimes necessary and productive. Therefore the parties agreed that Local Management and the Local President or Chairperson will meet on an informal basis at least weekly, at a mutually
469
agreeable time, to discuss issues and topics of interest to the parties.
Joint Quality and Efficiency Initiatives
The parties will work together to develop joint initiatives to improve quality, enable cost effective methods, processes, improved operating efficiencies and remove barriers to improvement, while ensuring the product is available when the customer wants it. In developing those initiatives, the parties recognize the importance of measuring progress and of communicating to all employees such progress towards quality and efficiency objectives. In establishing the foregoing, the local parties shall review and modify as required operating processes, ensuring that equipment, facility or personnel issues do not inhibit an employee's ability to achieve personal and/or organizational quality and efficiency objectives.
Utilization of the Workforce
The parties discussed at length how the parts distribution business is becoming increasingly more competitive, and how our customers are continuously demanding shipments of parts in a fashion which is quicker cheaper, and more accurate than ever before. The parties recognize that job security is created through our ability to exceed customer expectations and meet the competition head on.
Manpower Utilization during Holiday Periods
The parties also discussed at length the need to secure a workforce to perform work to satisfy customer demand during holiday periods while also affording employees the opportunity to enjoy negotiated holidays. The parties discussed past difficulties in securing an adequate workforce to meet customer demand, and agreed such 470
difficulties may have been the result of poor planning and poor communication. To ensure that an appropriate balance is reached in future scheduling, the parties have agreed that the Parts Distribution Center Manager and Local President or Chairperson shall meet at least four (4) weeks prior to such holiday periods to thoroughly review a location's specific means and methods, which can be acted upon to ensure that customer demand will be met.
To that end it was agreed that the required discussions relative to holiday work schedules shall be open, honest and sincere. The parties shall, through their best efforts, first attempt to obtain sufficient volunteers to complete the required work within the required period of time. When sufficient volunteers can not be secured to meet demand during these periods, the parties will seek other alternatives (e.g„ cross classification utilization of employees; alternative start times; partial work days; utilization of temporary part time employees; utilization of vacation replacement employees outside the traditional window; extended shifts; pre and post holiday premium period overtime; parts order preplanning coordination with dealers; stock keeping on a day(s) other than the holiday(s); and/or other methods which may apply from time to time).
If despite the good faith efforts of the local parties, the projected available manpower during the holiday period is insufficient to adequately address the needs of customers and the dealer body, the matter will be referred to Corporate Union Relations and the International Union, UAW who will jointly provide their best efforts toward ensuring that the needs of customers and the dealer body are met.
471
Conclusion
The Corporation and Union recognize that quality and operating efficiency are vital to job security and that a high level of quality and operating efficiency requires mutual respect, communication, and recognition of each others problems and concerns. Within six (6) months of the effective date of the Agreement, each Local PDC Manager and Local Union will review with Divisional Management, Corporate Union Relations and the International Union, UAW the PDC’s plans with respect to the above items and other issues relative to its ability to compete in the market
Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness may require change or waiver of certain agreements or practices. It is understood that any such waivers, modifications or changes will not be effective unless agreed to by the local parties involved and approved in writing by the Union Relations Staff of the Corporation and the UAW, DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union. Such changes will be effective only at the location(s) specifically designated and would require no further ratification.

Payment to a part-time EMPLOYEE for hours worked in excess of an equivalent normal daily TOUR or work week for a comparable full-time EMPLOYEE shall be at the applicable overtime rate for a comparable full-time EMPLOYEE, based on such part-time EMPLOYEE'S HOURLY ADJUSTED RATE. Any regular EMPLOYEE who was on the active payroll of a COMPANY of Lucent's predecessor, or former affiliates or subsidiaries of Lucent’s predecessor, as of December 31, 1980, and worked part-time on or after January 1, 1981 with Lucent Technologies Inc. or a COMPANY of Lucent’s predecessor, or former affiliates or subsidiaries of Lucent’s predecessor, and whose employment has been continuous since December 31, 1980 with a COMPANY of Lucent’s predecessor, or a former affiliate or subsidiary of Lucent’s predecessor, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to be paid, on a pro rata basis, under the terms of this Agreement as applicable to regular full-time EMPLOYEES.
3	The classification of a part-time EMPLOYEE is based on the EMPLOYEE'S "part-time equivalent work week" which shall be determined prospectively by dividing the EMPLOYEE’S total normally scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration; 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6 rounded to a "part-time equivalent work week" classification of 16.)
4	The Part-Time "Equivalent Work Week" (EWW) classification of each part-time EMPLOYEE shall be reviewed by the COMPANY during December and June of each year and adjusted as appropriate and become effective on January 1 and July 1 respectively of each year. In determining the appropriate EWW, the COMPANY will consider the actual average number of hours worked in each of the two (2) quarters during the preceding six (6) month period except that any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate shall not be counted in computing the average number of hours
147
Appendix D
worked. If the result in both of the preceding two (2) quarters is a number higher than the EMPLOYEE’S existing EWW, the EMPLOYEE will be reclassified to the classification represented by the lower of the two (2) quarters. If the result in one (1) of the two (2) preceding quarters is equal to or lower than the EMPLOYEE’S existing EWW, and the result of the other quarter is equal to or greater than the EMPLOYEE’S existing EWW, then the EMPLOYEE’S existing EWW will remain unchanged. If the result in both the preceding two (2) quarters is a number lower than the EMPLOYEE’S existing EWW, the EMPLOYEE will be reclassified to the classification represented by the higher of the two (2) quarters.
5	Treatment of Part-Time EMPLOYEES
(a)	For payment purposes, all Vacations, Paid Excused Work Days and Floating Holidays will be converted to a Paid Time Off Bank (PTO) calculated as follows:
(1)	Eight (8) hours X EMPLOYEE’S annual eligibility in days for Vacations, Paid Excused Work Days and Floating Holidays (if any) = total annual hours of PTO eligibility.
(2)	Total annual hours of PTO eligibility shall be pro-rated based on the EMPLOYEE’S Equivalent Work Week (EWW).
(3)	Such pro-rated PTO will be established in January of each CALENDAR YEAR and adjusted in July if the Part-Time EMPLOYEE’S EWW changes.
(4)	In the event a Full-Time EMPLOYEE converts to a Part-Time EMPLOYEE during the year, the PTO will be established at the time of the conversion by applying a factor of 40 for the number of weeks prior to the conversion and a factor based on an EWW for the remainder of the year. The PTO shall be further adjusted in July, as applicable.
(5)	In the event a Part-Time EMPLOYEE converts to a Full-Time EMPLOYEE during the year, the PTO will be adjusted at the time of the conversion by applying a factor of 40 for the remaining number of weeks in the CALENDAR YEAR. Such result will establish the Full-Time EMPLOYEE’S entitlement to remaining Vacation, Excused Work Days and Floating Holidays in that year.
148
Appendix D
(6)	All payments made to a Part-Time EMPLOYEE for Vacation, Excused Work Days and Floating Holidays will be deducted from the EMPLOYEE'S prorated PTO-

RESOLUTION OF MEDICAL DISAGREEMENTS
June 6,1998
Ms. Janine Brown
CWA Staff Representative
Communications Workers of America
Dear Ms. Brown:
This will confirm the Company's intent regarding medical disagreements over an employee's ability to return to work.
The following administrative procedure will be followed where a difference in professional medical opinion exists between an employee's doctor and the Company Medical Organization, involving an employee's fitness to return to work, which cannot be reconciled by the two parties involved.
While the Company Medical Organization's recommendation is final, the Company nevertheless will endeavor to reconcile such differences through contact with the employee’s attending physician. If, in the.Company’s judgment, the opinion of a.doctor specializing in the field of the employee’s ailment may be of value in resolving the difference, a third doctor may be selected by the Company to examine the employee.
Sincerely,
/s/ Charles R. Reichold District Manager Workforce Relations

Appendix F
OPERATIONAL APPENDIX A INVOLUNTARY DOWN GRADES/ADVANCE NOTICE
Before an employee is involuntary downgraded pursuant to the applicable functional Article, the Company will provide advance notice to the local Union. Within fifteen (15) days from such notice, the Union may initiate discussions relative to alternatives prior to involuntary downgrades. Where appropriate discussions will be at the Business Group Planning Council.
RPPP UNDERSTANDING
If the Company and the Union agree to establish a Cash Balance Pension Plan, either party may notify the other, within 30 days after agreement, of its desire to discuss the impact upon Article 21 Paragraph 1(h), Reassignment Pay Protection Plan (RPPP).
OPERATIONAL APPENDIX A TRANSFERS AND
RECLASSIFICATIONS TO
PART-TIME DURING SURPLUS
During our recent negotiations, we have discussed the Union's claim that individuals have been reclassified to part-time or laterally transferred from a title in which there is an impending surplus to a title that will not be affected by the impending surplus declaration, for the purpose of protecting the employee from the surplus declaration. Both the Company and Union agree that such a practice is not in the best interest of employees and the Company wilt not support or condone such a practice.
If the Union believes that such a transfer or reclassification has occurred, it may, notwithstanding any contrary provision of Article 8 - Grievance Procedures,'notify the Company, in writing, of its claim within 30 days of the involved surplus declaration. Representatives of the Company and the Union will meet, within seven days of the Company's receipt of the written notice, to review and attempt to resolve the Union's claim. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the Union may submit its claim to arbitration and the Company agrees it will process the demand for arbitration in an expeditious manner. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to employee movement pursuant to the Lucent Transfer Program.
164
Appendix F
EXCUSED WORK DAYS
After a surplus declaration, the Company will make every reasonable effort to grant time off for unused Excused Work Days to those employees in the at risk group prior to their scheduled off roll date.
AGENCY TEMPORARIES
Agency Temporaries
The Company and the Union understand and agree that Agency Temporaries who hold a position normally filled by a bargaining unit employee will be removed from that position at the end of three months unless there is agreement otherwise between the Union and the Company.
The Company, as appropriate, shall provide information to the Union on the use of agency temporaries.
SUBCONTRACTING SUBCOMMITTEE STRUCTURE AND GUIDELINES
In an effort to reach a better understanding of the complex issue of subcontracting, the parties agree that it is in their mutual interest to establish appropriate subcommittee(s) for advanced information sharing and open and thorough discussions of matters involving subcontracting.
Accordingly, on this 30th day of May, 1998, Lucent Technologies (the "Company") and IBEW Systems Council T-3 and the CWA (the "Union") have agreed to establish a Subcontracting Subcommittee during the life of the 1998 collective bargaining agreement.
During 1998 negotiations, the Company and the Unions expressed mutual concerns over the employment security of on-roll Lucent employees represented by the Unions and their desire to retain work traditionally performed by those employees. The parties also understood the Company’s need to maintain flexibility in making business decisions involving subcontracting of work traditionally performed by represented employees and the potential that such decisions may have a detrimental effect on the employment security of on-roll Lucent employees.
In recognition of these mutual concerns, the parties agree that a process should be developed to address the issues. Thus, it is agreed that the Unions will be provided, in advance, pertinent information such as but not limited to, the economics, skills necessary to perform the work, and the impact such subcontracting may have on the employment security of on-roll Lucent employees. In addition, the Unions will be given an opportunity to discuss such
165
Appendix F
matters relating to the Company's intentions to subcontract work traditionally performed by members of the affected bargaining unit. It is further agreed that any process cannot interfere with the Company's right to make timely decisions consistent with the overall interests of the business, including the employment security of on-roll Lucent employees.
Subcommittee Structure and Purpose
A Joint Subcontracting Subcommittee will be established consisting of up to (4) four representatives from the Union, ((2) two designated by the CWA and (2) two designated by the IBEW) and four (4) representatives from the Company designated by the Business Group Vice-President or appropriate mutually agreed upon group. Specific composition of this subcommittee will be jointly determined by October 31,1998’.
The purpose of the subcommittee is to give the parties the opportunity to conduct open and thorough discussion concerning the Company's intention and rational on subcontract work presently performed by on-roll Lucent employees.
Subcommittee Information Sharing Guidelines
Sharing information on the Company's intention and rationale to subcontract will include the following:
1	The establishing of subcommittees at the Services General Manager level for the purpose of sharing information in more detail. Such information will include items such as amount of hours or jobs, the names of the contractors being utilized, locations of contracted work, (more specific than a zip code level), discussions of the quality of such work, and other pertinent information pertaining to the subcontracting of traditional work that has been regularly performed by members of the bargaining unit in the geographic area.
2	Advance information of intention to subcontract consistent with the principles established above will be provided to local unions or GM level subcommittee union representatives as appropriate.
3	List of Lucent employees on re-call or the extended compensation option under the Lucent Option Plan.
4	Economic conditions of such subcontracting
5	Skills that are necessary to perform the work
6	Impact subcontracting may have upon on-roll Lucent employees at the affected location(s).
7	Other pertinent information (e.g. time constraints, market conditions, hiring opportunities via Lucent Transfer Plan or job advertisements, flexibility, other and viable alternatives)
166
Appendix F
8	Identify specific areas or locations where hours of subcontracted work performed in the previous (6) month period are sufficient for the purpose of hiring new employee / employees.
Role of Workforce Relations
Corporate Workforce Relations will have the final responsibility to assure that the Information Sharing Guidelines are followed. Any dispute that may arise as to whether the Information Sharing Guidelines have been followed shall be submitted to the Workforce Relations Vice President for final resolution.

1925 K Street, NW
Washington, DC 20005
Dear Mr. Bahr:
I am writing to respond to the expressions of concern raised at the Operations bargaining table regarding the Company’s contracting out of work, which have focused on situations in which a layoff is pending or has occurred (and exbargaining unit members retain recall rights) within the same force adjustment area where the work is to be contacted, and in job titles whose occupants would traditionally have performed such work.
I do not believe that CWA and AT&T have diverse views on this subject.
As to such work normally performed by our employees, we have always preferred not to contract such work out if it would otherwise be performed by bargaining unit employees in job titles in a geographical commuting area (1) where layoffs of such employees are pending; or (2) where a layoff has already occurred and such laid off bargaining unit members retain recall rights and are available to perform such work.
In the future, the Company will not contract out such work, under the conditions outlined above, except when it has no other reasonable alternative. Under such circumstances, the Company will discuss its decision with the Union.
Very truly yours,
/s/ RAYMOND E. WILLIAMS

Gentlemen:
Re:	ATS Trial: Consideration of Recall Candidates Concurrently with
Surplus Candidates
The Unions and the Company, recognizing that unforeseen circumstances may result in the need to fill positions from which individuals were recently laid off, agree to conduct a trial for one year in which, under the circumstances described below, Recall candidates will be considered for ATS vacancies concurrently with Surplus candidates.
ATS staffing of job requisitions in Business Units which utilize ATS to administer recall will be accomplished using the following order of consideration: when a position is advertised in a Business Unit which utilizes ATS to administer recall and there is an individual who was laid off by that BU in the same LPA and title being advertised (or its predecessor), who has exercised his/her recall rights, .who is still within his/her period of eligibility for recall and who has greater net credited service than any surplus candidate who has requested consideration for the position, the recall candidate will be placed in the position. The recall candidate must comply with all provisions for recall as outlined in the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
The Joint ATS Review Board will evaluate the success of the trial and will report the results to the National Bargaining Team at the end of the trial or when requested.
Very truly yours,

ELECTRONIC MONITORING
Sampling of service, used in the spirit of trust and respect, is a valuable tool to enhance customer service. To assure courteous treatment, accurate information and superior service, customer calls may be monitored to assist in the training and development of employees, identification of customer needs and product evaluation.
Feedback of all calls sampled will be provided to the employee by the end of the day of the completed contact (defined as the day the employee being sampled has initiated and/or provided the service requested by the customer). The employee will be notified of exceptional service or gross customer abuse immediately.
No employee shall be disciplined, nor documentation made in any personnel or Company record, as a result of service sampling except for gross customer abuse, fraud, violation of privacy of communications, or when developmental programs have not been successful. A developmental program will be jointly developed by the associate and the coach to bring the best quality service to the customer.
Process monitoring is defined as any call sampling other than individual call sampling. Employees will not be disciplined as a result of process monitoring. However, if gross customer abuse is observed and the specific employee can be identified, it may be documented and reviewed with the employee in an effort to correct the behavior. Such documentation will not be placed in the employee's file.
It is agreed that all past practices and local letters of agreement which restrict the practice of service observing and monitoring are eliminated. The Company will continue to comply with any applicable laws regarding service monitoring or observation.

Appendix F
ALTERNATE WORK SCHEDULES
In order to implement Alternate Work Schedules, modifications to certain contract articles will have to be made. In addition, new provisions for Hourly Time Bank and Residual Time will have to be added. The parties recognize the following contract areas may be changed as a result of local negotiations to implement a four day basic work week and a rotating three and four day basic work week. The Constructive Relationship Council shall approve each specific plan for alternative work schedules negotiated at the local level, including trials and implementation. The following uniform provisions shall apply for all Alternate Work Schedules:
Four Day Work Week (FDWs)
The hours of a Scheduled Daily Tour will be based on the normal'hours of the location divided by four. A Basic Work Week will consist of either four 10 hour days, four 9.375 hour days, or four 8.75 hour days.
Continuous Operations (ConOps) [Rotating Three and Four Day Work Week]
The hours of a Scheduled Daily Tour will be twelve (12). A basic work week will consist of either three 12 hour days or four 12 hour days and will be scheduled on a rotating basis so that over a three week period an employee will average forty (40) hours of work.
Hourly Basic Rate
Is determined by dividing the five (5) day weekly basic wage rate by the number of hours contained in the Scheduled Weekly Tour for the location (i.e., 40, 37.5, 35).
Night Tour
1.	For FDWs is a lour which falls within the time period beginning at 6:00 P.M. and ending at 6:00 A.M.
2.	For ConOps schedules there shall be one (1) Day Tour and one (1) Night Tour. Starting and stopping times of each tour are to be determined locally.
Overtime
For those employees on the Four Day Work Week:
1.	Daily overtime will be paid after ten (10) hours in a day.
2.	Weekly overtime will be paid after forty (40) hours in a week
3.	Double time will be paid after eight (8) overtime hours (paid at 1.5) have
been worked, (subject to successful negotiation of "Payroll Simplification*).
For those employees on the ConOps Rotating Three and Four Day Work Week:
1.	Daily overtime will be paid after twelve (12) hours in a day.
172
Appendix F
2.
3.
Weekly overtime will be paid after forty (40) hours In a week.
Double time will be paid after eight (8) overtime hours (paid at 1.5) have been worked, (subject to successful negotiation of "Payroll Simplification").
Hourly Time Bank
Vacations, Excused Work Days, Designated Holidays and Floating Holidays will be converted to an hourly total and taken on an alternate tour length basis. Any remaining time (time less than an AWS Scheduled Tour) will be designated as "residual time" and will be credited to the employee's Hourly Time Bank.
Residual Time
Time remaining in the Hourly Time Bank after an employee has taken either a holiday, vacation day, or excused work day on an alternate tour length basis. Residual Time may be taken as excused paid time in conjunction with Vacation, Designated Holiday Time, Floating Holiday Time or Excused Work Day Time.
If, at the end of a calendar year, the total Residual Time in an employee's Hourly Time Bank is equal to or greater than the number of hours in such employee's AWS Scheduled Daily Tour, the employee must take the necessary number of days off to reduce the number of hours to below the number of hours in such employee's Scheduled Daily Tour. If total Residual Time is less than the number of hours in such employee's AWS Scheduled Daily Tour, the employee may take the Residual Time as excused paid time in one or more increments, of no less than 2 hours each.
Residual Time that is not used in accordance with the previous provisions may be "Bought Out" by the Company at the basic hourly rate (including any evening or night differentials when applicable). This will be limited to a single buy out per calendar year. In no case will the amount of Residual Time that is to be bought out be greater than the number of hours in an employee's Scheduled Daily Tour. "Pay in lieu of situations applicable to vacations because of separations through dismissal (except misconduct), layoff, resignation, retirement, or death will also apply to Residual Time.
Leave of Absence
Employees on leaves of absence will be changed to the five day, standard hours per day for their location for the duration of the leave.
Termination Payment
For an employee assigned to an Alternate Work Schedule, Termination Payment shall be computed based on the standard weekly tour at that employee's location.
Employee Benefits
173
Appendix F
For an employee assigned to an Alternate Work Schedule, Sickness or Accidental Disability shall be based on the standard weekly tour at that employee's location.
Personal Illness
Sickness Wait Period will be converted from days to hours based on the existing articles contained in the local agreements.
Discretionary absence, whether paid or unpaid, will be charged to the employee at the alternate daily tour hour basis.
Rest Period
For FDWs and for ConOps employees one (1) rest period of 20 minutes during each one-half Scheduled Daily Tour.
Incidental Absences (Jury Duty, Military Duty, Death in Family, etc.)
Payment will be made for the number of days specified in the local labor agreement. Incidental absences will not be converted to hours.
174
Appendix F
APPEARANCE GUIDELINES
The parties recognize and agree that, consistent with the professional image vital to the Company, all employees are expected to be neat and well groomed at all times. Appearance should be appropriate for the community in which the employee works, in keeping with the job assignment, and consistent with what is acceptable for employees in other similar type business establishments.
Explicit in the parties’ expectations is recognition between the Company and the Union that all employees should wear appropriate attire for the work assignment expected to be performed.
In the event of a dispute concerning whether appearance guidelines promulgated or in effect in a particular office or facility are consistent with these expectations, the grievance procedure shall be utilized. If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute in the grievance procedure, the Union may proceed to arbitration pursuant to toe provisions of Article 9 of the Agreement. The arbitrator shall determine whether the appearance guidelines promulgated or in effect are reasonable.

1992 LETTERS EXTENDED
The following items were agreed to in 1992 local bargaining and will continue in accordance with their original terms.
(a)	LOCAL AGREEMENTS
Local agreements, other than those that are specifically provided for in the Agreement, that violate the provisions of the Agreement will be null and void immediately upon the effective date of the Agreement. Other local agreements will continue to effect unless and until either party gives 45-days written notice of their termination. During that 45-day period, either party may initiate negotiations pursuant to Article 2 (Collective Bargaining), Paragraph 2.10 of the 1992 Agreement. If no agreement is reached during that 45-day period, the local agreement will no longer be effective and binding upon either Company or the Union.
(b)	INDEMNIFICATION
It is the policy of the Company to indemnify and hold harmless from liability, employees who are determined to be liable to others as a result of the actions and/or simple negligence of the employees arising in the scope of their employment. Employees who participate in the Motor Vehicle Usage Program will be considered to be acting within the scope of their employment while operating the Company-provided vehicle between work locations, and between work locations and their residences or other places of vehicle storage, provided that employees are traveling in a reasonably direct route between their work locations and their residences or other places of vehicle storage and are traveling within a reasonable period of time before or after the start or end of their work day.
(c)	OVERTIME EQUALIZATION
The Company will continue existing overtime equalization agreements as they exist unless and until they are canceled pursuant to Item (a) of the Settlement Memorandum. All such agreements shall be subject to the grievance procedure of Article 8. Only those that were subject to the provisions of Arbitration of the 1989 Agreement shall continue to be subject to arbitration.
(d)	SCHEDULE CHANGE ■ PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
During our recent negotiations, we discussed the Union's concern that part-time employees' schedules were sometimes changed on very short notice resulting in fewer scheduled hours on a given day or for a given week. It is not the Company's intent to reduce the regularly scheduled hours of part-time employees without adequate notice.
185

VACATION SCHEDULING
During the 1998 negotiations between Lucent Technologies and Communications Workers of America, the Union expressed a concern relative to service and coverage requirements in connection with vacation schedules and personal holiday schedules.
The Company recognizes the importance of vacations to our employees and believes that vacation schedules should be prepared in such a manner as to permit a maximum number of vacations during the most desirable vacation periods to the extent that service and coverage requirements permit.
It is also our belief that special consideration should be given to the traditionally observed holidays that were replaced with personal holidays in the 1989 Agreement. The new holiday language, in and of itself, should not change the coverage requirements for those days that were designated as holidays in past contracts. Every effort should be made by managers to make available as many of these days as possible for selection as personal holidays.
1989 PROVISIONS - INDIVIDUAL
For the term of the 1992 Agreement, the Company will continue to apply the following provisions of Part II of the 1989 Settlement Memorandum to individuals which were eligible for coverage under the terms of those paragraphs and who were covered by these paragraphs on May 30, 1992, under the circumstances provided in those paragraphs:

(e)	Return to Former Classifications
(1)	If a vacancy is not filled in accordance with Paragraph c, the following will apply:
(i)	Current EMPLOYEES within the classification where a vacancy exists, with more SENIORITY than downgraded or LAID OFF EMPLOYEES, shall be given an opportunity to fill those vacancies before downgraded or LAID OFF EMPLOYEES. The openings will be advertised to the UNION and the Request for Change in Work Assignment (RCWA) form must be submitted within 5 business days.
(ii)	If there are no current EMPLOYEES with more SENIORITY who submit a RCWA to fill a vacancy (Paragraph 1, (i) above), then, based on SENIORITY, LAID OFF EMPLOYEES who are currently on the recall list and were LAID OFF from the classification in which the vacancy exists or current EMPLOYEES who have been downgraded within the last 24 months from the classification in which the vacancy exists will be offered the opportunity to fill that vacancy. Where multiple vacancies exist in the same classification, SENIORITY will be the determining factor for location preferences.
(iii)	If an EMPLOYEE refuses the above options of Paragraph (1) (i), or (1) (ii), above or does not respond within two (2) working days of receipt of the offer, the COMPANY considers its obligation to that EMPLOYEE completed.
(2)	The foregoing procedure shall apply to the Indian Hill Laboratory as one and to all other locations as a second unit.

(v)	Have refused an offer of re-employment at the same work location and same classification that had been held prior to LAYOFF; or
(vi)	Do not respond within two (2) working days of receipt of a COMPANY offer of recall. (The COMPANY shall send a copy of this offer to the UNION.)

Term of Employment	Termination Allowance (Equivalent of Regular Wages for)
1 year and less than 2 years	1 week

Equivalent of 30 weeks’ pay plus 5 weeks’ pay for additional full year of service for 20 or more years up to a maximum of 104 weeks.
(b)	Effective June 1, 1986, Bell Laboratories will offer to regular EMPLOYEES who are LAID OFF or terminated from the active payroll
214
Article 29 - Appendix B
of Bell Laboratories due to force surplus conditions and who are eligible for a termination allowance the option of receiving such payment (1) as income continuation in periodic installments, less applicable deductions, or (2) in a lump sum, less applicable deductions.
Such payments shall be in addition to earned pay, payment in lieu of advance notice, and any vacation payment to which EMPLOYEES may be eligible, but are subject to the following provisions:
(1)	If the periodic installment option is chosen, the frequency of these installments will match the EMPLOYEE'S normal pay cycle. The amount of each income continuation installment will be determined by multiplying the' number of weeks in the EMPLOYEE'S pay cycle by the Termination Allowance Factor applicable to the EMPLOYEE. (Any odd balance will be carried forward into another pay cycle.) An EMPLOYEE'S Termination Allowance Factor is the dollar figure used as a "week of pay" in calculating the total termination allowance to which that EMPLOYEE is entitled.
(2)	Income continuation periodic installments shall continue until the earliest occurrence of any of the following events:
(i)	The total amount of the income continuation installments to the EMPLOYEE equals the total amount of termination allowance which the EMPLOYEE is to receive.
(ii)	The EMPLOYEE is recalled or re-employed as a regular EMPLOYEE by Lucent Technologies or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries or entities.
(3)	EMPLOYEES who have received or elect to receive a termination allowance in a lump sum, shall as a condition precedent to being recalled or rehired as regular EMPLOYEES of Lucent Technologies or any Lucent Technologies affiliate, subsidiary or entity, make a repayment of any Excess Termination Allowance they may have received. As used in this Section, Excess Termination Allowance shall be the amount of Termination Allowance EMPLOYEES may have received which is over and above the figure derived by multiplying their Termination Allowance Factor by the number of weeks (or fraction thereof) from the date of their termination to the date of their recall or rehire as regular EMPLOYEES of Lucent Technologies or any
215
Article 29 - Appendix B
Lucent Technologies affiliate, subsidiary or entity. EMPLOYEES who are recalled or rehired as other than regular EMPLOYEES and who are subsequently reclassified as regular EMPLOYEES shall, as a condition precedent to such reclassification, also make a repayment of the Excess Termination Allowance.
(4)	The amount of Termination Allowance for an individual (1) who has been previously LAID OFF or terminated by Lucent Technologies or any Lucent Technologies affiliate, subsidiary or entity; (2) who has received Termination Allowance either in a lump sum or in the form of periodic income continuation installments; (3) who is re-engaged; and (4) who is again LAID OFF or terminated after having been re-engaged, will be calculated as follows: The number of weeks of Termination Allowance originally received (or, in the case of a lump sum payment, the number of weeks of pay received and not repaid as Excess Termination Allowance) shall be deducted from the number of weeks of Termination Allowance that is determined to be payable as of the date that the EMPLOYEE is again LAID OFF or terminated.
3	Technological Displacement
If during the term of this Agreement Bell Laboratories notifies the UNION in writing that technological change (defined as changes in equipment or methods of operation used by Bell Laboratories bargaining unit EMPLOYEES in the performance of their job assignments) has or will create a surplus in any job title in a work location which will necessitate reassignments of regular EMPLOYEES to different job titles involving a reduction in pay or to locations requiring a change in residence, or if a force surplus necessitating any of the above actions exists for reasons other than technological change and Bell Laboratories deems it appropriate, any regular EMPLOYEE (1) who is in the affected job titles and work locations; and (2) who is not eligible for a service pension, may elect not to accept such reassignment to a job title involving a reduction in pay or to a location requiring a change in residence and shall be paid a Termination Allowance. Any such regular EMPLOYEE who refuses to accept a transfer to a job title having the same or greater rate of pay and which does not require a change in residence shall not be paid a Termination Allowance.
EMPLOYEES eligible for a termination allowance under the terms of this provision alternatively may elect to participate in the Lucent Career Transition Option Program providing they meet the eligibility requirements of that program. (See National Section.)

Subject: PRC EMPLOYEES Temporarily Assigned to Facilities Construction Group
This is to renew our previous agreement dated August 4,1986.
It is agreed that while this Letter of Agreement is in effect AT&T Bell Laboratories may, as the needs of the business require, temporarily assign EMPLOYEES in Prototype Realization Center (PRC) classifications, except Indian Hill, to only Facilities Construction Group work as helpers in accordance with the provisions set forth below.
It is further agreed that while this Letter of Agreement is in effect, EMPLOYEES holding classifications in the PRC Group, as set out in Exhibit IV of the General Agreement between Bell Laboratories and the Communications Workers of America dated May 31,1992, shall be classified in the occupations covering the major portion of their regular work assignments, except those assigned to work with the Facilities Construction Group. In no case will any EMPLOYEE with a PRC Group classification be reclassified to reflect the fact that he/she may be spending a major portion of his/her time in Facilities Construction Group work, nor shall his/her rate of pay be changed from that rate which he/she currently receives or may receive at any time in accordance with his/her PRC Group classification during the term of this Letter of Agreement.
Bell Laboratories shall select PRC Group EMPLOYEES for Facilities Construction Group work within their base work unit as follows:
1	. Bell Laboratories will designate the PRC Group classifications, the number of EMPLOYEES to be selected from those classifications, and the unit or units (unit as described in Article 14 of the General Agreement) to be affected.
2	EMPLOYEES shall be selected first on the basis of volunteers from each classification designated by Bell Laboratories up to the number required of such classification and second, if the required number has not been
230
Article 29 - Appendix C
reached by volunteers, then by inverse order of SENIORITY of EMPLOYEES in the classification up to the number of the classification.
3	Bell Laboratories will notify the UNION of the names of the EMPLOYEES to be selected, in accordance with Paragraph 2 above, for Facilities Construction Group work and the effective date for the assignment as far in advance as practicable. All EMPLOYEES will be advised that those assigned to Facilities Construction Group work may be subject to NIGHT TOUR work. If so assigned, the 10% NIGHT TOUR differential will be paid in accordance with the terms of the General Agreement.
4	Bell Laboratories may exclude from the above selection process for 60 days, EMPLOYEES it deems essential to the operation of numerically controlled lathes. Bell Laboratories shall exclude PRC Group EMPLOYEES who are disqualified by its Medical Group departments from working on
- Facilities Construction Group assignments and UNION REPRESENTATIVES in PRC Group classifications unless they volunteer with the approval of the Local President.
If Bell Laboratories decides that the work done by a selected EMPLOYEE in the Facilities Construction Group is unacceptable, it shall return him/her to his/her previous PRC Group work without prejudice. Bell Laboratories will assign a selected EMPLOYEE to Facilities Construction Group work for a minimum of one week. However, if Bell Laboratories decides that he/she is needed on his/her previous PRC Group job before one week has been completed, he/she may be returned to his/her previous job.
Selected EMPLOYEES will work the hours of the Facilities Construction Group to which they are assigned.
If Facilities Construction Group night shift work is necessary at a particular unit, Bell Laboratories will select EMPLOYEES for assignment to such work on the basis of:
(a)	volunteers, and then
(b)	inverse order of SENIORITY from EMPLOYEES who have already been assigned to Facilities Construction work at that particular location.
Bell Laboratories will furnish, replace, and continue to own any tools required by Bell Laboratories in order that EMPLOYEES selected for Facilities Construction work can perform their assigned work. EMPLOYEES shall return any such furnished tools to Bell Laboratories as the need for that tool ends.

Article 29 - Appendix C
All overtime in the Facilities Construction Group will continue to be assigned to Facilities Construction Group classifications and not to PRC Group EMPLOYEES assigned to Facilities Construction Group work. PRC Group EMPLOYEES assigned to Facilities Construction Group Work will be afforded the opportunity to work overtime in their PRC Group classifications in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the General Agreement.
Article 11, Vacations, of the General Agreement shall apply to PRC Group EMPLOYEES assigned to Facilities Construction Group work in the same manner as it would have applied to them had they continuously worked in their PRC Group classifications.

Note k will not be applicable to any PRC Group EMPLOYEE assigned to Facilities Construction Group work. Note i will not be applicable to Facilities Construction Group classifications merely because they are working with PRC Group EMPLOYEES.
The provisions of this Letter of Agreement will be subject to the grievance procedure in accordance with Article 16 of the General Agreement.
The General Agreement shall remain in effect except for the deviations made by this Letter of Agreement.
This Letter of Agreement shall be in effect for the duration of the current Agreement, or until 30 days after Bell Laboratories notifies the UNION of its desire to terminate It, whichever occurs earlier.

CWA - Staff Representative
Re: Work Currently Performed at Merrimack Valley
During the course of 2003 Bargaining, the CWA expressed concerns regarding Lucent's intentions to move work traditionally performed by the bargaining unit at the Merrimack Valley Works to a new location(s).
The parties hereby agree that for the term of this agreement, in the event the Company relocates its Merrimack Valley Works operations to a new location(s), it will continue to recognize the Union as the representative of employees performing the relocated operation(s) at such new location(s) and it will apply the existing collective bargaining agreement to such employees.
This understanding is intended to apply to al) bargaining unit work at the Merrimack Valley Works where the work locationffacility is changed, but the employer continues to engage in essentially the same business operations. Any changes in employee job titles or work functions should not alter the obligations contained in this agreement.

PRODUCTION OCCUPATION LEVEL DIFFERENCE CRITERIA
The Merrimack Valley Works Corridor/Level Plan for PRODUCTION OCCUPATIONS is a classification plan. A classification plan is, by definition, nonquantitative. The differentiation of Levels is not arrived at through assigning points to attributes. Rather, it is a “banding" of well-recognized functions separated by one of three things. These are: Prerequisite job knowledges/skills & formal education prior to entry into the Level and the responsibility for assigning work to others. The Plan has to be understood by all parties involved. Misadministration by line supervision and improper classification of new jobs by Wage Practices is Intended to be minimized. Secondly, on-going maintenance of this plan should be virtually eliminated. By utilizing clear or “benchmark" functions the affect of changes in job tours can be quickly ascertained by using a pair comparison methodology with the Job Administration Guide.
The parameters for each of the three levels and the logic behind their slotting is as follows:
Level I - Production Associate
This Level encompasses all base and non-base functions which can be learned by the average employee without prior experience with the COMPANY or post-high school training, education, or other experience. This only applies to duties performed at Level I. If a new job or product is introduced and the skills and knowledges needed to perform this job are more closely matched with those benchmark functions identified as Levels II or III, then it will not be slotted in the Level I category.
Level II - Senior Operator
This level requires skills and/or knowledges which, due to their depth or breadth, cannot be performed in a reasonable time period without previous Lucent Technologies experience in one or more “corridors’ or by post-high school training or experience. This Level will require certification by the COMPANY to verify Uie employee's abilities prior to entry into a job. A job which includes plating, for example, requires specific understanding of the basics of chemistry. The employee must bring a related background to this Level of work in order to function successfully. Also, an employee must have an in-depth knowledge of most operations within a “corridor" in order to be effective when assigning work to Level I Operators. Certification is required prior to entry into this Level.
497
Manufacturing P&M Job Descriptions
Level III - Process Analyst
This is the highest and most difficult of the three levels. It requires post-high school training and/or experience prior to entry into a job. It also requires responsibility for assigning work to lower Levels. The skills needed must be of an in-depth variety in a technical or mechanical field. Certification is required prior to entry into this Level.
TL-T • Tester Analyst - Replaces Legacy of former Tester Levels A, B & C
This level requires advanced technical education in electronics, skill and/or knowledge which, due to their complexity, cannot be performed in a reasonable time period without previous experience. It includes all base and non-base functions. This level will require certification by the Company to verify the employee’s ability prior to entry into a Tester position. Also, an employee must have in-depth knowledge of testing operations in order to be effective when assigning work to other tester analysts (TL-Ts).
