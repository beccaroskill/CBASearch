INTRODUCTION
The management of Delphi Corporation recognizes that it cannot get along without labor any more than labor can get along without the management.

(4il)	Once each month, the designated financial officer may submit to Local Management a list showing the name and social security number for each employee who is certified as owing an initiation fee and/or monthly dues, specifying the amount of the liability and the period to which any such monthly dues liability applies.
(Svc Par. (4d>I
(a)	This list shall be dated and shall be submitted on or before the first Tuesday following the third pay day in the month.
(b)	Such'amounts will be deducted from the first pay received following the first payroll period ending in the next following calendar month provided the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover the liability.
6
(4j) A properly executed ■ copy' of such “Authorization for Check-Off of Ducs” form for each employee for whom Union membership dues are-to be deducted hereunder, shall be completed by the employee and submitted to die Local Management before any dues deductions are made, except as to employees whose authorizations have heretofore been delivered to Local Management. Deductions shall be made thereafter, only under the applicable “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues? forms which have been properly executed and are in effect. Local Management shall deliver to the Local Union an “Application for Membership’’ form for each employee for whom Union membership dues are to be deducted under the provisions of the Check-Off except as to employees whose authorizations have heretofore been delivered.

, (41) The initial monthly dues deduction from the pay of an employee who completes an “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues” form shall be made from the second pay received by the employee following the date on which the authorization was executed. It shall be presumed that employees owe initiation fees, unless they had previously executed an. “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues” form at that plant, and such initiation fees will be deducted simultaneously with the initial deduction as specified in this paragraph. Thereafter, the Union membership dues for each succeeding calendar month shall be deducted as follows:

7

Any liability will be carried forward until the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover the deduction or breaks seniority, whichever occurs first. However, deductions will only be made from Regular Benefits provided the employee has an applicable '‘Authorization for Check-Off of Ducs” form in effect as of the date the deduction is made.

(c)	(This paragraph was deleted during 1993 National Negotiations,)	.
(d)	In the event of a retroactive change in an employee’s job classification of record for the pay period in which dues have been deducted, there will be no retroactive adjustment in the Check-Off of Union membership dues.

8
pay pursuant to these provisions shall be in addition to an amount which may be authorized by a Local Union pursuant to the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union and of which the Local Union has given notice to Local Management.	.
(0 In the event an employee does not receive a paycheck for a payroll period ending in a dues deduction month prior to the receipt of a Regular Benefit applicable to any such period, union dues in the amount of five dollars ($5.00) or such other amount as may be established as dues shall be deducted from the Regular Benefit, provided the employee has the applicable “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues" form in effect as of the date the deduction is made. Tn the event such an employee subsequently receives a paycheck for a payroll period ending in the same dues deduction month, the difference between the amount of union dues paid and the' amount then owing will be deducted from such paycheck, '	‘	'
(4m) In the case of employees rehired, or returning to work after layoff or leave of absence, or being transferred back into the bargaining unit, who previously have properly executed “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues" forms, deductions will be made for membership dues as provided herein. t
(4n) In cases where a deduction is made which duplicates a payment already made to the Union by an employee, or where a deduction is not in conformity with the provisions of the Union Constitution and'By-Laws. refunds to the employee will be made by the Local Union.	‘

Local Management shall furnish the designated financial officer of the Local Union, monthly, with the names, social security numbers, department numbers and clock numbers of those for whom deductions have been made, the amounts of the deductions and the amounts deducted, by employee and in total, respectively, for initiation fees, regular monthly dues, and S.U.B. dues. Regular monthly dues and S.U.B. dues shall be identified as to the period to which such deductions apply. This information should be furnished along with the dues remittance. The designated financial officer will be advised of the order in which the names will be listed and of any future changes in the order of the listing as far in advance as possible. The foregoing notwithstanding, deductions made on a declining balance basis, deductions of a past dues or initiation fee liability from a Regular Benefit and deductions from pay for a liability incurred more than six (6) months prior to the actual deduction date will wot be identified to a specific deduction month.
ISeePar. (4d),(4n)l [See Doc. 18,19}
(4p) Any dispute which may arise as to whether or not an employee properly executed or properly revoked an “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues” form, shall be reviewed with the employee by a representative of the Local Union and a representative of Local Management. Should this review not dispose of the matter, the dispute may be referred to the Umpire, whose decision shall be final and binding on the employee, the Union and the Corporation. Until the matter is disposed of no further deductions shall be made. '
(See Par. (4a)J
(4q) Neither the Corporation nor the Trustee of the

I See Par. (4n}J [See CSA 1*61
(4r) In the event net earnings are sufficient to cover Union membership dues for only one dues deduction, month and an employee has a dues liability for more than one (1) month, the deduction will be for the current dues deduction month.

' This Paragraph (63) will be openly displayed in each department in each plant in such a manner that it may be reviewed by the employees so that they will be aware of transfer and promotional opportunities that may become available to them and the procedure for expressing their desires. All classifications within a department and their rates of pay will also be openly displayed in that department so that employees will be aware of transfer and promotional opportunities that may become available to them. Local agreements that have been negotiated pursuant to sub-Paragraph (63)(b) below will also be so openly displayed in each department in each plant.

Thereafter, as openings’ occur, selection for the promotion will be from among such applicants and applicants for that classification that have filed pursuant to sub-Paragraph (2) below, who have applied at least one (1) week in advance of the opening in question, and where ability, merit and capacity are equal, the applicant with the longest seniority will be given preference.
[See Par. (120)1 [See Doc. 69]
(63) (a) (2) Employees who desire advancement within the plant to higher paid classifications in another department or to higher paid classifications where the employee is working outside an established scope of selection that is broader than a department may make application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department on forms provided by the Corporation on which they may state their qualifications and experience. Thereafter, as openings occur, such applicants will be considered in the selection process for that promotion provided they have so applied at least one (1) week in advance of the opening in question. Each employee may have two (2) such applications on file. An employee who has been transferred and established seniority under this Paragraph (63)(a)(2) will not be eligible to reapply for consideration for another such promotion until six (6) months have elapsed from the effective date of transfer. An employee who has been offered a transfer and refused the transfer under this Paragraph (63) (a)(2) will have such application for transfer cancelled and thereafter, for a period of six (6) months from the date of such refusal, may be entitled to only one (1) valid application for transfer under these
48
provisions. Such transfer or offer of transfer to employees working outside a scope of selection shall be without prejudice to the establishment or identification of such scope. ’
Promotions made pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph (63)(a) in the preceding week will be openly displayed in mutually satisfactory locations in the plant which are frequented by large numbers of affected employees.

If an employee is transferred pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph (63)(a) and Che employee is subsequently reduced from the new classification prior to establishing seniority, the provisions requiring advanced application for an opening in that classification will be waived, provided the employee refiles for such classification within one (1) week from the date of being reduced.
[See Par. (120)] [See Dec. 7I.72J
(b) It is the policy of Management to cooperate in every practical way with employees who desire transfers to new positions or vacancies in their department. Accordingly, such employees who make application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department stating their desires, qualifications and experience, will be given preference for openings in their department provided they are*capable of doing the job. However, employees who have made application as
49
provided for above and who are capable of doing the job available shall be given preference for the openings in their department over new hires. In case the opening is in an equal or lower rated classification and there is more than one applicant capable of doing the job, the applicant with the longest seniority will be given preference. Any secondary job openings resulting from filling jobs pursuant to this provision may be filled through promotion; or through transfer without regard to seniority standing, or by new hire.
Any claim of personal prejudice or any claim of discrimination for Union activity in connection with transfers may be taken up as a grievance. Such claims must be supported by written evidence submitted within 48 hours from the time the grievance is filed.
In plants where departments are too small or in other cases where the number of job classifications within a department is insufficient to permit the practical application of this paragraph, arrangements whereby employees may make such application for transfer out of their department may be negotiated locally, subject to approval by the Corporation and the International Union.

fScc Par.
(78a) Model mix shall be taken into account in establishing and/or changing production standards on car, body or truck line assembly operations. The speed of such assembly lines will not be increased beyond the level for which they are staffed for the purpose of gaining additional production or for the purpose of making up for loss of production due to breakdowns or unscheduled line gaps or stops.
(See Par.	.
(78b) Work assignments on conveyor lines will be made in accordance with line speeds and available work space and the expected normal ratio of model mix and optional equipment. When it is necessary to adjust the normal scheduled mix on conveyor lines which results in more or less work being required, compensating adjustments in work assignment, number of employees, spacing of units, line speed or any combination thereof will be made. Arrangements will be made locally to establish procedures which will provide advance
62
knowledge of mix changes that require compensating adjustments so that such adjustments will be made in a timely manner. On conveyor line operations, Management will designate specific off-line operations from which employees will be made available to compensate for such mix changes when one of the compensating adjustments requires an increase in the number of employees and in such case the assignment of employees to the conveyor line operation will be given priority over the off-line operation. Upon request, Management will advise the Union of the arrangements made.

Such employees shall receive credit as time worked in a skilled classification for time spent on approved leaves of absence from that classification up to but not exceeding an aggregate of thirty (30) calendar days within the calendar year, Such employees will
189
not receive credit as time worked in a skilled classification for any portion of the leave that they would have been laid off in a reduction in force or returned to their production classification had they not been granted such leave.
3.	Employees-in-training '(E.l.T.), who arc Committecpcrsons or in-plant full time Union Representatives, shall be credited with seven days worked in a skilled trades classification for each pay perio'd during which they function in such capacity until they acquire employce-in-training-seniority (E.I.T.S.) status.

INTERPRETATION OF PARAGRAPH (4) THRU (4c) AND PARAGRAPH (57)
■Rules for Computing Seniority of Employees Who Acquire Seniority by Working 90 Days Within Six Continuous Months, and Computing the Period Specified in Paragraph (4) thru (4c)
t. Credit toward acquiring seniority will begin with the first day worked by the new employee and will include the subsequent days of that pay period.
2.	Thereafter during six consecutive months until the employee acquires seniority the employee will receive credit for seven days for each pay period during which the employee works except that credit will not be given for any days the employee is on layoff.
3.	No credit will be given for any pay period during which for any reason, the employee does not work except as provided in Paragraph (108) and in the case of the pay period in which the full week of Christmas holidays or the Independence Week Shutdown falls, provided the employee would otherwise have been scheduled to work.
4.	Unless employees are at work on the 90th day of their accumulated credited period, they must work another day within their probationary period to acquire seniority. If the 90th day of their accumulated credited period falls on a holiday or an Independence Week Shutdown Day, the employees will be considered as having seniority as of the holiday or the Independence Week Shutdown Day. If the 90th • day of their accumulated credited period falls on their vacation pay eligibility date, the employees will
191
be considered as having seniority as of the vacation pay eligibility date.
5.	In the event temporary employees are summoned and report for jury duty as prescribed by applicable law during the period of six continuous months preceding the date they acquire seniority pursuant to Paragraph ' (57), the employees’ seniority when acquired will be adjusted to give*the employees credit for seven additional days for each week in the period in which they did not work and during which jury duty was performed. The employees must furnish evidence that the jury duty was performed in order to receive seniority credit in accordance with this provision.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:	' "
It is the policy of Delphi Corporation to perform maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the labor, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits. At times the Corporation does not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or Let the work to outside contractors. This letter is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way,
The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees to perform maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past.
tn this regard, we have seen the use of joint Management and Union work schedule and business opportunity teams work very successfully in many of our locations. This approach has not only enhanced job security, but has allowed a better understanding as to the competitive challenges facing the parties. As such, each location is encouraged to establish a skilled trades subcontracting planning team involving both Management and Union representation who will review forecasted work schedules, including projects and jobs
193
which may be subject to subcontracting, in order to develop the most efficient approach to the work to he perfanned. Plants who have experienced success with this approach have found that meetings scheduled weekly, if necessary, were most beneficial, and therefore such meetings should be scheduled accordingly at all plants.	■	■
The Corporalion is genuinely, interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades employees consistent with the needs of the ' Corporation. Therefore, in making these determinations, the Corporation intends always to keep the interests of Delphi Corporation personnel in mind.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker; ’
During the 1979 negotiations, the Union discussed with the Corporation serious problems affecting the job security of employees resulting from contracting out of work. ■
During the course of negotiations, the Union complained that in certain instances the work farce in maintenance and tool and die trades particularly was reduced through attrition and then work was contracted out io the point where there was insufficient manpower available within the plant to perform the work; that in certain instances EIT's were reduced to production jobs and work in their trades which they historically performed and which they were capable of performing was subsequently contracted out for extended periods without recalling the ETT's to the skilled trades jobs from which they had been reduced; and that in certain instances skilled trades employees were permanently laid off and new work which they had historically performed was contracted out for extended periods, instead of recalling these employees to their jobs. Similar complaints were made relative to work in the Corporation's engineering departments. In certain instances, the Union alleged that work historically performed in the Parts Division had been contracted out accounting in part far the reduction in the number of employees in that division.
The essential elements in the complaints registered by the Union went to the question of job security.
195
During the 1996 National Negotiations, the parties reviewed the competitive advantage of the Corporation's talented skilled trades workforce. Discussed were the Union's concerns for the integrity of the apprenticeable trades, the job security of the skilled trades workforce, the content of skilled trades work assignments, and the status of work functions historically performed by the bargaining unit.
At times it is not practicable for the Corporation to do the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve the right to decide whether it will do particular maintenance, tool and die and engineering skilled trades work, or contract it out The Union recognizes that in making such decisions the Corporation must consider among other things, the efficiencies and economies involved, the need for specialized tools and equipment, special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model change and plant rearrangement deadlines. *	-
In our discussions we agreed that employees' jobs should not be eliminated by reason of a practice of contracting out, and we agreed that existing employment opportunities of seniority employees should not be unnecessarily reduced by reason of management contracting out work. The Corporation, moreover, states that it is its policy to fully utilize its seniority employees, under circumstances in which it is reasonable and practicable to do so, in the performance ■ of work which they have historically performed to produce its product and perform its services.
While Delphi intends to provide this opportunity to its skilled trades workforce, the parties agreed that prolonged schedules involving substantial overtime were not in the best interest of employees or the Corporation and, as a result, Delphi must consider the availability of its skilled workforce when scheduling _ potential overtime. The parties are expected to work out acceptable means by which Management will have reliable information as to the hours employees will work when planning such work schedules.
196
Accordingly, the Corporation states that it will make a reasonable effort to avoid contracting out work which adversely affects the job security of its employees and that it will utilize various training programs available to it, whenever practicable, to maintain employment opportunities for its employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation.

Special Skilled Trades Representative
I.	In any Plant on a shift where there are 30 or more skilled trades employees (E.l.T., E.I.T.S., Journeymen/women) who are not represented by a District Committeeperson who is classified as a skilled trades employee, a Special Skilled Trades Representative may be selected as specified below to assist in handling skilled trades grievances as provided hereinafter.
A.	In those plants where there is a District Committeeperson on the shift classified as a skilled trades employee, such District Committeeperson shall be the designated Special Skilled Trades Representative on that shift. If there is more than one District Conunitteeperson on the shift classified as a skilled trades employee, only one shall be selected as the Special Skilled Trades Representative by the Union.
B.	Where there is no District Committeeperson on a shift classified as a skilled trades employee, the Local Union will select a skilled trades employee from among those working on that shift to be the Special Skilled Trades Representative and a reservoir of 12 scheduled straight time hours for Monday through Friday will be established for that representative to handle the duties specified below without loss of pay except that time spent attending the regular Shop Committee meetings pursuant to Section Il.C. below will not be charged . against this reservoir.
201
II.	Upon written notification designating (he Special Skilled Trades Representative selected pursuant to Paragraph I above, that representative will be allowed to leave regular job duties without undue delay to perform the following duties;
A.	If a District Committee-person who is not a skilled trades employee is called pursuant to Paragraph (29) to represent a skilled trades employee to handle a specified grievance concerning an alleged violation of one of the provisions of Paragraphs (152) through (183), such committeeperson may request that the supervisor call the Special Skilled Trades Representative for that shift. Before a grievance is reduced to writing by the District Committeeperson, the Special Skilled Trades Representative may assist the District Committeeperson in a consultative and advisory capacity, and in doing so, if necessary, may make an independent investigation of the grievance and submit a report to the District Committeeperson. The Special Skilled Trades Representative may not function as a committecperson nor initiate a grievance.
B.

APPENDIX K
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING JOB SECURITY (JOBS) PROGRAM
The Corporation and the Union are committed to enhancing the job security of Delphi Corporation employees. The Patties also recognize that such job security can only be realized within a work environment which promotes operational effectiveness, continuous improvement and competitiveness.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to this JOBS Program and have pledged to work together, consistent with this Program and other provisions of the National Agreement to enhance the Corporation’s competitive position.
The cornerstone of the JOBS Program is a commitment to pre-determined Secured Employment Levels (SELs), a series of SEL Benchmark Minimums, and protection against indefinite layoff for eligible employees as expressly provided herein.
L SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM ~ The Corporation and the Union agree that:
(A)	The secured employment levels (SELs) (i.e., numbers of eligible employees or positions covered by this Program as defined herein) initially shall be established as of the Effective Date of the Agreement at each bargaining unit for skilled and non-skilled employees will be continued. The transfer of an employee between skilled and non-skilled will cause the SEL for the group receiving the employee to increase and the other group from which the movement occurred to decrease unless the movement occurred to satisfy the SEL, in which case the SEL will remain the same in each group.
205
(B)	. The initial Secured Employment Levels for each Unit shall be equal to the sum of: (1) the number of active employees with one or more years seniority at work and on roll in the Unit on the Effective Date; (2) the number of active employees occupying SEL slots in Che Unit on the Effective Date; and (3) the number of unfilled new hire obligations in the Unit as of the Effective Date due to the application of the outsourcing/new hire provisions of the 199699 Agreement. Appendix K (Article II (O)(2)b.3.J. Such active employees will be SEL eligible and shall include employees
* not at work who are:
(1)	on vacation,
(2)	receiving bereavement pay,
(3)	on jury duty,
(4)	on any leave of absence of 90 days duration or less,
(3) on temporary layoff, and
(6)	any other employee having a direct attachment to the active workforce.
(C)	A series of SEL Benchmark Minimums will be established for each Unit on the Effective Date, representing projected SEL-eligible employment minimums as of the close of each calendar quarter beginning with (be quarter ending December 31, 2003 through the quarter ending June 30, 2007. Each quarterly Benchmark shall be determined by subtracting from the
. immediately preceding SEL Benchmark an
206
amount equal to .333% of the Unit’s Initial SEL, so that the June 30, 2007 Benchmark shall equal 90% of the initial SEL. (If this calculation results in something other than a whole number, sequential rounding adjustments may be made to even out the calculations over the term of the Agreement.)
(D)	No employee will be laid off for any reason, other than described in 1(E), if such layoff would cause the number of active employees in the unit to fall below the then current SEL or otherwise result in the layoff of one or more SEL eligible employees.
(E)	Paragraph 1(D) notwithstanding, an employee protected from layoff by Che SEL may be laid off for any of the following reasons:
(1)	volume related declines attributable to market related conditions as described in Document No. 10, JOBS Program - Volume Related Layoffs -SEL, not to exceed 48 weeks (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks) over the life of the Agreement;
(2)	acts of God or other such reasons beyond the control of the Corporation;
(3)	the sale of a part of the Corporation’s operations as an ongoing business;
(4)	the layoff of an employee recalled or reassigned to fill an opening known in advance to be temporary; or
207
(5)	model change or plant rearrangement until the employee otherwise would have been recalled, ,
An employee impacted by any of the above reasons is. if otherwise eligible, covered by the appropriate Supplemental Agreements which are attached to the National Agreement as Exhibits.
(F)	The number of employees protected by this JOBS Program will be the equivalent of the employees within the SEL who would otherwise have been laid off as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph 1(E).
II. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SEL AND SEL ELIGIBILITY - Following the initial determination of the SEL, it will be adjusted as follows:
(A)	An employee shall become SEL-cligiblc for any of the following reasons al which point the SEL will be increased by one position for each such employee: (I) an employee in the active workforce, as defined by Paragraph 1(B) who had less than one year seniority on the Effective Date of the Agreement who subsequently attains one year of seniority; (2) an employee with one or more years seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SEL, and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the effective date of the Agreement; (3) an employee with
■ less than one years seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SEL, who
208
subsequently attains one years seniority and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the effective date of the Agreement; (4) an . employee rchired pursuant to Paragraph (64)(e), except if rehired to satisfy a SEL, who subsequently attains one years seniority and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the effective date of the Agreement; (5) an employee newly hired after the effective date of the Agreement who attains three years seniority; (6) an employee deemed to be eligible, recalled or newly hired in order to satisfy a SEL . . Benchmark Minimum. Notwithstanding the above, the National JOBS Committee is authorized to establish special mechanisms, including SEL eligibility provisions, for the purpose of attracting new work.
(B)	The SEL will be reduced for the attrition of eligible employees who quit, retire, or die.
(O Unit SELs will be adjusted In the event of transfers of operations or consolidations between Units. The Unit SEL will be decreased by one at the transferring location and increased by one at the receiving location by the corresponding number of employees who transfer, unless otherwise agreed to by the National parties.
, Similarly, corresponding adjustments will also be made to the SEL Benchmark Minimums of each affected unit.
(Di Each employee who leaves the bargaining • • unit for a permanent salaried position will
209
be replaced immediately with no effect on the SEL by recalling an employee from layoff or from the Area Hire List, or by hiring a new employee if no such laid off employee is available. For each regular salaried employee returning to the bargaining unit, the SEL will be increased by one.
(E) SEL eligible employees off roll will maintain their eligibility upon reinstatement.
(£> (1) Following the last day of each month and within 15 days of the following month (SEL Benchmark Review), the number of SEL-eligible employees in each Unit shall be compared to the Unit's corresponding SEL Benchmark Minimum. Adjustments will be made consistent with the provisions of this Memorandum, and attrition replacement obligations will be fulfilled as set forth below.
(2)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees exceeds the Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-two basis by recalling employees on layoff in accordance with the procedure described in Section (3Xb) below.
(3)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees would otherwise fall below the Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-one basis by the following actions in order to maintain . eligible
210
' employment at the Benchmark Minimum:
(a)	. First, by allowing an ineligible active seniority employee at the affected facility to become eligible.
(b)	Second, by recalling a seniority employee from layoff . from the facility, or rehiring an employee with a Paragraph (64)(e) rehire right, or from the Area Hire list.
(c)	Or third, by hiring new employees up to the net number of jobs outsourced minus those insourced (as defined in Appendix L of the
.	Agreement and determined by
the National Committee) ’	subsequent to the Effective
Date. Such positions will be filled on a Unit basis no later than ninety (90) days following the SEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected Unit is encountering market-driven, ‘ volume-related layoffs.
(4)	Notwithstanding the above, the net outsourcing/new hire obligation provided in Section (3)(c) above shall be activated earlier than required therein if and when the number of SEL-eligible employees is less than the greater of: (I) the SEL Benchmark Minimum for the quarter;
211
or (2) 95% Of the Unit's Baseline SEL under the 1996 Agreement
(5)	, If, after fulfilling the above requirements, subsequent attritions would cause the number of SEL-eligible employees to fall below the Unit's Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on the following basis:
(a) When the number of SEL-eligible employees is greater - than 90% but less than 100%
of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be
• hired for each three (3) attritions,
(b) When the number of SEL-eligiblc employees is greater than 80% but less than 90% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each two (2) attritions.
■ (c) When the number of SEL-eligible employees is below 80% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each one (1) attrition,
(d) Such positions will be filled on a Unit basis no later than ninety (90) days following the SEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected unit Is encountering market-driven, volume-related layoffs.
212
(6)	Employees recalled, hired, or rehircd to fulfill the above obligations may be assigned within their Unit at Management’s discretion, subject to applicable seniority provisions of the Agreement.
(G)	If on the evaluation date the SEL number results in less than a-whole number, the Engineering Method of Rounding will be used to determine the SEL.
(H)	Notwithstanding the above, SEL '	Benchmark Minimums will not be
established for a facility determined to be dosing.
HL JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS - In recognition of the fact that job security can only result from joint efforts to improve operational effectiveness, the Corporation and the Union agree that:
(A)	For a period commencing with the Effective Date of this Memorandum of Understanding and for the life of the current Agreement, no employee within the SEL will be laid off as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph KE).
(B)	An employee whose regular job is eliminated will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the National Agreement and Local Seniority Agreement.
(C)	The number of employees protected from layoff due to the JOBS Program will be that determined in Paragraph 1(F). Each Protected employee will be identified by application of the Local Seniority
213
Agreement provisions as if such job security were not provided.
(D)	If an event, other than those described in 1(E), would otherwise cause the number of active employees in a unit w fall below the then current SEL, the employees so protected, as provided for in 1(D), will be placed on Protected employee status. The Parties recognize that events, other than those described in 1(E), may occur during the course of this Agreement that will cause the number of SEL eligible employees to exceed the Corporation’s' production requirements. The parties further recognize that the scope of this program requires flexibility with regard to the assignment of such Protected employees and the selection of employees for training. In this-regard, the Local JOBS Committee (described in Section IV, below) will insure that assignments are made on a basis consistent with the seniority provisions of the
. Collective Bargaining Agreement and Local Seniority Agreement while meeting plant needs, minimizing work force disruption and enhancing the personal growth and development of employees. After a decision by the Local JOBS Committee a Protected employee may be (1) placed in a training program, (2) used as a replacement to facilitate the training of another employee, (3) placed in a job opening at another Delphi plant provided there is no employee on layoff from that plant with a seniority recall or Paragraph (64)(e) rehire right or an Area Hire applicant who has not been offered a job at that plant, (4) given a job assignment within or outside the bargaining
214
unit which may be non-traditional, (5) placed in an existing opening or (6) given other assignments consistent with the purposes of this Memorandum of Understanding.
(E)	(1) Notwithstanding the above, an available Protected employee may be placed on the Area Hire list by Management for selection to an available opening at another location within the area. The number of such ‘ Protected employees made available for placement cannot exceed the , number of Protected employees who have been laid off for the duration of the 48 week volume-related layoff ’ limit (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks). Protected employees will be made available for Area Hire placement in inverse seniority order.
(2)	A location that has no one on layoff with a seniority recall or Paragraph (64)(e) rehire right may fill a job opening with an available Protected employee from another location within the Area Hire Area pursuant to Paragraphs M (1) and (2), or an Area Hire applicant who has not been offered a job in the Area Hire Area.
The SEL will be reduced by one at the plant from which the employee is transferred and increased by one at the plant to which the employee is transferred, unless the transfer satisfied the SEL, in which case the SEL will remain the same at both plants.
215
An available Protected employee transferred permanently to another location may remain at the secondary location until at the employee’s home location (1) there is an available opening in the regular active workforce to which the employee is entitled, or (2) the employee is recalled to Protected employee status, or (3) the employee is laid off from the secondary plant, at which time the employee will return, seniority permitting, to the active workforce.
(F)	Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness will be encouraged and supported by the national parties including, as may be appropriate, approval of requests to waive, modify or change the National Agreement.
(G)	A Protected employee will continue to receive their regular straight time hourly rate of pay. In the event a Protected employee is assigned to another classification, the employee will receive the rate of pay as provided by the Local Wage Agreement.
(H)	Protected employees' assignments will be considered temporary and not subject to provisions governing permanent filling of vacancies or the application of shift preference, except for assignments to fill openings resulting from volume increases. Experience gained from Wiese temporary assignments will not be used to advantage such Protected employee over other employees for selection to fill permanent vacancies, nor will the Protected employee gain seniority under Paragraph (62) of the
216
National Agreement from such assignments.	-
(1)	An employee replaced by a Protected employee will receive their regular straight time hourly rate of pay, and will be returned to the same classification and job assignment upon completion of the replaced employee's assignment. In the event the employee has insufficient seniority to return to the formerly held classification, the employee will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Local Seniority Agreement.
(J)	W an employee would have been transferred pursuant to Paragraphs’ (63)(a)(l), (63)(a)(2), (<53)(b) or (153) of the National Agreement or placed in an Apprentice program were it not for participation in a training assignment provided by this program, the employee will be transferred to this classification upon completion of the training assignment. In the event the employee would have been selected for an E.I.T. or Apprentice assignment the employee's date of entry will be adjusted as if the employee’s assignment had not been delayed.
(K)	A replaced employee returned to a job assignment under this Program will be credited with all overtime hours the employee worked while out of the equalization, group, but not with the Overtime hours the employee would otherwise have worked in the group had the employee not have been replaced by the Protected employee.
217
(L)	A training assignment will be voluntary on the part of an employee being replaced by a h Protected employee, unless such training is to develop or improve technical skills relevant to the employee’s current job assignment or anticipated future job needs.
(M)	No Protected employee will be temporarily . assigned to a job outside of the bargaining unit except on a voluntary basis, subject to the direction of the National Committee. Permanent transfers of Protected employees outside the bargaining unit to other Delphi-UAW represented plants within the Area Hire Area will be handled as follows;
(1)	Management may place a Protected employee’s name on the Area Hire list. The number of names so placed may not exceed the number of employees . who have been laid off for the duration of the 48 week volume-related layoff limit (inclusive of vacation shutdown). Protected employees will be made available for Area Hire placement in inverse seniority order. Thereafter, such employees may be selected in seniority order to available jobs at other locations. The seniority used by a skilled trades employee in administering these provisions will be the employee’s date of entry or joumeyman/woman date.
(2)	A Protected employee who is transferred permanently out of the Area Hire Area in accordance with this ;; paragraph, or if so transferred later accepts a recall or rehire at a former • '	location, will be eligible to receive a

relocation allowance and other relocation services as provided in Paragraphs (96a) (I), (2), (3) and (4) of the National Agreement. A Protected employee temporarily transferred out of the Area Hire Area who does not change permanent residence as a result of the transfer will receive reasonable transportation and living expenses for the duration of the assignment. Any problems connected with the above may be raised with the National Committee.
(N)	In the event there is an opening due to a volume increase, the available Protected employee with the highest seniority will be placed in this opening, unless the Local Committee determines the employee should first complete the employee’s current assignment. If seniority employees are on layoff from that plant, a number of such employees, equivalent to the number of Protected employees placed in openings due to volume increases will be recalled from layoff. A Protected employee transferred to another Delphi plant due to a volume increase who is subsequently laid off from the secondary plant due to a volume decrease will be returned to available openings at the employee’s home plant, seniority permitting.
(O)	A layoff caused by an event described in Paragraph 1(E) will have no impact on the number of Protected employees except for an employee who is protected from a layoff attributable to a market related volume decline in excess of 18 weeks (inclusive of
219
vacation shutdown weeks). In those instances, Protected employees, having the least seniority, will be laid-off and replaced by an equivalent number of greater seniority employees who would otherwise have insufficient seniority to remain in the plant.
(P)	In the event, the Local or National Committee determines that the number of Protected employees exceeds the number of expected openings at the plant or in the Area within the next succeeding 12 months, special programs as set forth in Attachment A may be triggered upon prior approval of die National Committee. Thereafter, to the extent the number of Protected employees is still in excess of expected openings, such employees, under the direction of the National Committee, may be transferred out of the area pursuant to Paragraph (M). The National Committee may also explore the
' extension of Attachment A to other ■ locations to create job opportunities for excess Protected employees within the Area Hire area,
(Q)	Earn i n gs,. incl ud i n g w a ges and wage related payments, received by employees while on Protected employee assignments, will be charged against the maximum liability amount. The cost of benefits and other payments made or incurred on behalf of Protected employees, specifically, health care (including dental and vision), group insurance, pensions, legal services, training fund contributions, and PICA will be charged against the maximum liability amount. Moving allowance payments and
220
, the cost of benefits provided under ■	Attachment _A of this Memorandum of
Understanding will not be charged against this liability. Earnings received and the cost of benefits and other payments made on
.	. r * behalf of Protected employees while

[	resulting from volume increases or assigned
I	to other regular and productive work (e.g.,
absentee replacements) will not be charged against this liability.
■	(R) Charges against the Corporation’s liability
will commence with Che first payments made to Protected employees and will continue until the maximum liability is reached or the expiration of the Program as
.	' provided in this Memorandum of
Understanding, whichever occurs first. The records of such charges will be maintained by the Corporation and will be available to the Union at appropriate times.

GOALS AND
OBJECTIVES OF JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS
।	The Corporation and the Union recognize that quality
1	and operating efficiency are inextricably wed to job
security, and that a high level of quality and operating efficiency requires mutual respect and recognition of each other’s problems and concerns. Accordingly; in addition to the Local JOBS Committee’s responsibilities for the JOBS Program and participation in discussions provided in related Letters of Understanding, each committee will focus on cooperative efforts toward our common goal co improve die effectiveness of operations and remove barriers to improvements, increase job opportunities and fully utilize the workforce. The local 11 committees will jointly develop a plan through an exhaustive analysis of the location's operational efficiency. ,	,
Within six months of the effective date of the Agreement, each Local JOBS Committee will review with Divisional Management'and (he International Union the overall competitiveness of the location’s products and their plans indicating actions, and/or changes needed to improve quality and efficiency at their location and to stimulate job security of the existing workforce and attract new work. Such plans must dien be approved by the established National Job Security and Operational Effectiveness Committee.
At the national level, the Committee will have an equal number of Union and. Corporate representatives designated by .the Executive Director of Industrial Relations and by the Vice President and Director of the GM Department, International Union, UAW;
233
The National Committee will oversee implementation and administration of these Job Security and Operational Effectiveness Plans, Members of the National Committee will meet jointly with Local Committees to discuss the importance of job । preservation and job creation, the reasons for the 1 commitment to increase operational efficiency, suggest . possible topics for consideration, and encourage good' faith efforts to develop and implement meaningful local plans.
The National Committee will be available on an ongoing basis as a resource to Local Committees and will review progress at the local level at least on an annual basis.
In these efforts, it is recognized that a great deal of initiative and imagination will be required by the local parties. While not intended to limit such innovation, the following are examples of appropriate areas the local . parties may address:	.	1
1)	identification of investments in the facility or [ equipment necessary to improve product	quality or	>
operational effectiveness;	[
2)	the establishment of a team concept and/or pay- । for-knowledge wage structure;	i
3)	the identification of non-Iabor cost savings and 1 efficiencies;	"
4)	procedures and plans to review past outsourcing and outside contracting decisions, and identify opportunities for insourcing and new business;
5)	the examination of new forms of work organization, such as job assignments relating to Just-inTime or other quality enhancement systems;
6)	procedures to review supervisory staffing and
234
support for the initiatives in this Job Security and Operational Effectiveness section of the JOBS Program;
7)	a realignment in skilled classifications to a number of appropriate basic trades to support the needs of the operation or location;
8)	the implementation of skilled trades team concepts;
9)	initiatives to reduce chronic absenteeism;
10)	procedures for improved access by the Local Joint Committee to product plans and other information affecting employment security and operational effectiveness, assuring confidential treatment of such information;
11)	the establishment of work standards on operations that fully utilize employees;
12)	the examination of alternative work schedules which provide greater employment opportunities.
Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness may require change or waiver of certain agreements or practices. It is understood that any such waivers, modifications or changes would not be effective unless agreed to by the local parties involved and approved in writing by the Delphi Corporation Labor Relations Staff and the General Motors Department of the Union. Such changes would be effective only at the iocation(s) specifically designated.

APPENDIX L .
SOURCING
During these negotiations, the Union raised numerous concerns about the Corporation's sourcing actions and the impact on employment opportunities. To that end, the Corporation will work with and assist the Union at both the Local and International levels to preserve jobs, replace jobs which may be lost by outsourcing action and to create jobs for Protected employees and laid off employees. It is an objective of the Corporation to grow the business and to continue to rely upon its employees and facilities as the source of its products. During the life of the current Agreement, the Corporation will advise, in writing, the Union members of the Sourcing Committee of the Labor Policy Board meeting results relative to sourcing recommendations, including the number of potential jobs affected. Additionally, data regarding incoming and outgoing work will be given to the International Union in a quarterly meeting. (The Corporation will provide inquiry access to the International Union through the use of a computer terminal.) In this manner, the parties can judge the success of mutual efforts toward improved job security. The Corporation agrees to incorporate the procedures and structure outlined herein when making sourcing determinations during the cunent Agreement.
The rationale for sourcing actions will consider the criteria of quality, technology, cost, timing, statutory requirements, occupational and related environmental health and safety issues, the impact on long-term job stability, the degree to which the Corporation’s resources can be allocated to further capital expenditures, the overall financial stability of affected facilities, and the impact on related facilities. Other factors considered by the Corporation before a final sourcing decision is made will include the effect on
236
employment, and job and income security costs, on both a short and long-term basis. Such criteria shall give equal weight to the full impact of a sourcing action on Delphi-UAW represented employment levels and the job and income security of Delphi-UAW represented employees. The National Parties will jointly further develop the above criteria to be used to address sourcing issues. In developing this criteria transfer pricing profits will not be considered in making sourcing decisions. Only appropriate return on investment and burden will be considered.
Following the development of the sourcing criteria, the National Sourcing Committee may form Joint Task Forces to ensure full implementation of such criteria throughout the Corporation and, on an as needed basis, to address any specific sourcing areas of concern identified by the Union. Pertinent criteria will be applied consistently in comparisons of internal and external supply capability. The International Union and where appropriate the local union will be provided full and timely access to alt appropriate data, including financial information, that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and contemplated sourcing. The Union agrees to keep all such information confidential until the Corporation consents to its release. Further, in this regard, the plant Chairperson will designate in writing those Union representatives who will have access to the quote package and related information.	'
If the Local Committee cannot resolve a sourcing issue, it may file a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure.
In addition, the following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of UAW members:
237
1.	Insourcing
The Local JOBS Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Committee identifies as that which might be performed competitively within the location based on the criteria outlined above. To assist in this process, the International Union will be furnished a complete master file of commodities which will be used to generate a list of parts similar to those currently manufactured at the location that have been (I) outsourced from that location or (2) are currently manufactured by non-Delphi-UAW suppliers for Delphi Corporation. This list will be updated and expanded to include supplier expiration dales, supplier location (city and state}, annual volume, and Union affiliation if known and will be furnished quarterly or as otherwise agreed.by the National Parties. Thereafter, the parties wilt initiate efforts to insource particular work consistent with the aforementioned criteria to create prospects for growth and to provide jobs for Protected employees and employees on layoff.
If it is established that certain work can be performed competitively judged by the above criteria, management will adopt the Committee's proposal and barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approval or ratification within 30 days of the decision to bring the work in-house.

2.	Outsourcing
Outsourcing as used herein means the Corporation’s sourcing of work from Delphi-UAW locations, including work connected with current, new or redesigned components and fabricated parts.
,	When the quoting process begins, the local Union at
;	the affected location(s) will review and have access
, . to the entire request for quotation package for this work along with cost book information. Upon receipt of this package at the plant the Chairperson and the Personnel Director will indicate on the accompanying notice (Notice of Potential Outsourcing) that the information has been received. This notice will include a description of the work involved and will be mailed to the Vice President and Director of the General Motors Department of the UAW, and the Executive Director, Industrial Relations, Delphi Corporation,
Following receipt of the request for quotation package (or in the infrequent instances where a quote
239
package is not utilized), the local parties will have the opportunity to jointly develop a plan to perform the work competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix. The local Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and the potential sourcing action. Prior to submission of the initial quote response, the information contained therein will be reviewed by the local parties.
At the close of the quoting process, the local parties will be advised in writing of the most favorable quote response which best meets customer requirements and the terms and conditions contained therein. If this quote response is other than the one submitted by the affected location(s), a written notice will be issued to the Chairperson which includes the reason for the potential outsourcing, the quote price from the affected location, if applicable, the terms and conditions of the most favorable quote response, the potential jobs impact, and the anticipated impact date. Thereafter, the local parties will be given an additional 30 days, or longer when possible, to meet the terms and conditions of the quote response referenced above. A copy of this notice will be sent to the Executive Director, Industrial Relations, Delphi Corporation and the Vice President and Director of the General Motors Department of the UAW.
If it is established that the work can be performed competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix, Management will, barring unique and unforeseen circumstances, keep the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approvals or ratification within 30 days of the decision to keep the work in-house.
The' sourcing authority will not enter into a contractual relationship with a non-Delphi-UAW
240
supplier until such time as the designated ■ management representative of the impacted location provides written verification that the above notification procedure and discussion by the JOBS Committee, has taken place.
Additionally, International,Union input will be sought by the Corporation and its Divisions as early as possible in the outsourcing decision-making process in order to allow for more thorough discussion and to permit the parties to better assess the impact of outsourcing on the long-term job stability of employees and the financial viability of given Corporate locations.
The Corporation agrees to a full disclosure to the International Union of the procedures utilized in sourcing activities.	.	1
3.	Temporary Outsourcing
The National Parties agree that temporary outsourcing is not intended to provide a means for circumvention and abuse of the normal outsourcing notification procedures outlined in this Agreement, Outsourcing notices issued for temporary situations such as: breakdown of machinery or. equipment, plant rearrangement and/or modernization, spot buys, model changeovers, and factory assists, etc,, will be incorporated in the Quarterly Sourcing Report. By incorporating these occurrences in the Quarterly Sourcing Report, it is mutually understood that legitimate temporary outsourcing will not be considered in determining the Corporation’s hiring requirements, pursuant to Appendix K, due to the scheduled return of the outsourced work.
The. National Parties will monitor all temporary outsourcing to assure the return of such work in a timely fashion in keeping with the intent of this Appendix and Appendix K.
241

I
i Beginning with the effective date of this Agreement, 1 Temporary Outsourcing Notices which remain open '	30 days beyond the date the work was projected to be
' returned will be converted to permanent notices and the manpower associated with the work wilt be counted in the Net Sourcing calculation under Appendix K. Upon return of the work after a notice has been converted-to permanent status, a notice of insourcing will be issued to Che impacted Location.
The Parties understand that circumstances do arise wherein the projected return date of temporarily sourced work legitimately requires an extension and the above provisions are not intended to create Appendix K liabilities in those circumstances.
Any questions or problems that may arise relative to the meaning.and intent of this understanding will be reviewed and resolved by the National Parties on a casc-by-case basis.

WEMR GUIDELINES
The original construction of Welding and NonWelding Fixtures will be a proper part of the “Tool Maker” classification.
The construction of new details and parts for incorporating engineering changes on welding fixtures will be a proper part of the “Tool Maker” classification. Installation of these details on the fixtures during original construction will be a proper part of the “Tool Maker” classification, and the installation of these details and parts into fixtures during a model run will be a responsibility of the “Welding Equipment -Maintenance and Repair” classification.
Those fixtures constructed in this plant will be piped and wired during initial construction by employees in the “Pipefitter” and “Electrician" classifications respectively.	.	, ,,	■
The original wiring of electricaLcontrol panels performed in the plant will be a proper pari, of the “Electrician” classification of labor.	■
The original wiring to a junction box on non-welding fixtures during initial construction is a proper part of the "Electrician” classification of labor. '
The original installation of free-standing welding and non-welding fixtures into the Metal Assembly Department will be considered a proper part of the “Millwright” classification.
The Union referred to Paragraph 12 of Management's proposed Skilled Trades Settlement Agreement and inquired which classification of labor would be responsible for the installation of non-welding fixtures into a line in the Metal Assembly Department.
Management stated that the necessary wiring and
250
piping to and from non-welding fixtures which are installed into a line in the Metal Assembly Department will be the responsibility of the “Electrician” and “Pipefitter” classifications respectively during initial construction. Hie synchronization of such equipment into an existing line, however, will be a responsibility of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification of labor. If the installation of the new details required for an engineering change necessitated the installation of hew piping from the main supply valve, the work of installing the new piping Would be a proper part of the “Pipefitter’’ classification.	■
, The Union referred-to the recent addition of several operationsjon therME Line in the Metal Assembly Department which the Union had contended at that time was a new installation and inquired how Management’s proposed Skilled Trades* Settlement would affect such work in the future. ■	.	■
Management stated that it was the intent of its proposed settlement to consider such work as new installation which would, therefore, be a responsibility of the Plant Maintenance Department and ,fDie Maker -Devices” classification. As with the installation of the non-welding fixture referred to above, however, the synchronization of the new operations with the existing line would' be a responsibility of the Welder Maintenance Department.
The Union referred to the automatic turnover at the end of the door lines in the Metal Assembly Department which are currently a responsibility of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification and inquired how Management's proposed Skilled Trades Settlement would affect this work. •	f
Management stated that the turnover device at the end of the door lines in the Metal Assembly Department would be maintained by the Plant Maintenance
251
Department since it could be considered as an ouc-of-the-line operation. In this regard, however, Management stated that such a turnover in-line would be the responsibility of the Welder Maintenance Department.
Management referred to Paragraph No. 9 of its proposed Skilled Trades Settlement Agreement and stated that all fixtures constructed in this plant whether they are to be shipped to another plant or to be used in this plant will in the future be piped and wired during initial construction by employees in the “Pipefitter” and “Electrician” classifications respectively. In addition, the piping and wiring on those fixtures constructed outside the plant for use in this plant which have not been piped and/or wired will be the responsibility of the “Pipefitter” and “Electrician” classifications respectively. In the past. Management stated, the piping and wiring on those fixtures constructed in this plant for use at Chis location were the responsibility of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair" classification. Likewise, Management stated, the original wiring of electrical control panels which was previously the responsibility of the Welder Maintenance Department would in accordance with its proposed settlement agreement be a proper part of the “Electrician” classification of labor. In this regard, if, for example, it is necessary to replace individual wires in a control panel during a production run, such work will be assigned to the “Welding Equipment -Maintenance & Repair” classification; however, if on the other hand it is necessary to partially or completely rewire a control panel, whether or not such work is performed in-line, the task of rewiring the control pane) will be a proper part of the “Electrician" classification of labor.
The Union referred to a current appeal case wherein the Union is protesting the assignment of employees in
252
the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classifixation to the task of jumping the lubrication system.on a welding press in the Metal Assembly Department and inquired if Management’s proposed Skilled Trades Settlement language would affect the , assignment of such work in the future.
Management stated that the lubrication system on the welding press in question had been jumped to complete tryout of that line, and such work would continue to be a responsibility of the ‘‘Welding Equipment • Maintenance & Repair” classification. In this regard, Management stated that die repair of mechanical systems on welding presses would be a responsibility of the Plant Maintenance Department but repairs to the electrical systems on welding presses, except the press drive motor, would continue to be a responsibility of the Weider Maintenance Department
Management stated that the installation of air circuitry controls of the mechanical handling equipment during new construction will be a proper part of the “Pipefitter” classification. Modification of air circuitry will, Likewise, be a proper part of the "Pipefitter” classification of labor. Trouble shooting and maintenance of such control units will in the Press Department be a responsibility of die “Die Maker -Devices” classification and in the Metal Assembly I Department of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance '	& Repair'1 classification. Management stated, however,
that maintenance of such units referred to, for example, repairing or replacing a broken hose, changing filters, changing valves, adjusting air flow, etc., and in no way implied stripping down and rebuilding an entire control unit The stripping down and rebuilding of air circuitry control units performed by plant employees, whether performed in-line or off-line, will be a proper part of the “Pipefitter” classification.
253
The Union referred to the “dope" dispensing fixture on the MA Line in the Metal Assembly Department and stated that the maintenance of this unit has historically been a responsibility of the “Pipefitter" classification and stated that it was its opinion that this fixture should continue to be maintained by Pipefitters even though an air circuitry control unit had recently been installed on this fixture.
Management stated that it concurred with the Union tn this regard, and since air circuitry controls were installed on a piece of equipment previously maintained by die “Pipefitter” classification, such controls should in the future be maintained by that classification of labor.
Management stated that modifications on the electrical circuit on mechanical manipulators will be a proper part of the “Electrician” classification. Trouble shooting and maintenance of such units will tn the Press Department be a responsibility of the “Die Maker -Devices" classification and in the Metal Assembly Department of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair" classification. The maintenance of such units in no way implies stripping down and rebuilding the entire electrical circuit. The stripping down and rebuilding of the electrical circuit on mechanical manipulators performed by plant employees, whether performed in-line or off-line, will be a proper, part of die “Electrician'.’ classification.
It will be the general operating practice that the maintenance of shuttle rails between welding operations in the Press Department will be a proper part of the “Die Maker - Devices" classification. The synchronization of shuttle units with the welding operations wilt be a proper part bf the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification.	’’ '	'

C.	Nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding shall make ineffective any local past practice or agreement concerning voluntary overtime that is mutually satisfactory to the Local Union and the Plant Management.	'
D.	It is understood that each bargaining unit shall have the option of applying this Memorandum of Understanding to skilled trades employees as a group, and not to non-skilled trades employees as a group, and vice versa. For the purpose only of exercising this
262
option, non-skilled trades employees whose work is supportive of skilled trades employees work will vote with the skilled trades employees as a group and skilled trades employees whose work is supportive of nonskilled trades employees work will vote with the nonskilled trades employees as a group. The local Union will notify the local Management in writing of its election not later than October 1 st of that year. In plants where the election is to continue the application of this Memorandum, it shall continue without interruption. In plants where the bargaining unit elects for the first time to apply this Memorandum the effective dace at such location will be November 1st of that year.
■ Further, if a bargaining unit elects to apply this Memorandum as provided herein, thereafter the local parties may mutually agree in writing from time to time to suspend the terms of this Memorandum for specified periods during which periods previous mutually satisfactory local practices and agreements in regard to voluntary overtime, overtime equalization and augmentation will apply. A copy of all such agreements will be forwarded to the International Union and the Corporation. '
During the life of this Agreement, in the event the Local Plant Management changes its designation to schedule overtime operations from Plan A to Plan B or from Plan B to Plan A as provided herein, the bargaining unit employees may conduct another vote as provided in this Paragraph (16D) and notify the local Management in writing of its election within 30 days following the notice of change by the Local Plant Management.
E.	Nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding shall make ineffective any local agreement pertaining to overtime equalization or augmentation.
F.	Problems which may not be foreseen in the administration of the voluntary overtime concept which
263
may affect the ability of the Corporation to operate efficiently may arise during the course of the current National Agreement. In such event, the matter will be raised at the Corporation-International Union level for resolution.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON WORK CENTERS
During the 1967 negotiations, the Union requested that a Work Center be furnished in each plant where designated Union representatives could meet internally regarding representation matters, prepare statements required by the Grievance Procedure Section of the National Agreement, and keep files necessary to cany out their representation functions. By letter to the International Union dated December 15/1967 from Mr. L. G. Seaton, Vice President, the Corporation agreed to provide such Work Centers in certain plants of the Corporation with certain contingencies.
During 1976 negotiations the Corporation brought'to the attention of the International Union alleged abuses which the Corporation claimed existed in the operation of the Work Centers at some locations. As a result of those discussions, it was agreed as follows:'
1.	Local Management may bring to the attention of the Local Union Shop Committee and Regional Servicing Representative any alleged abuses in the operation of the Work Center. The parties will attempt to resolve the issue.
2.	Should the discussions between Local Management and the Local Union Shop Committee and Regional Servicing Representative fail to resolve the matter, Local Management may advise the Labor Relations Staff of Delphi Corporation which in turn may bring the matter to the attention of the UAW General Motors Department for discussion. The General Motors Department will dispatch one or more of its staff representatives to examine the alleged abuses at the plant site.
3.	If the problem is still not resolved it may be referred by either of the parties to the Labor Relations Staff of
265
the Corporation and the General Motors Department of the Internationa] Union. The International Union and the Corporation will determine the necessary corrective action.
Utilization of Work Centers
1.	Usual office type equipment such as typewriters and duplicating machines may be furnished by the Local Union for use in the Work Center. In such instances, the plant procedures for bringing and removing personal property into and from the plant must be followed.
2.	A notice will be placed at the entrance of each Union ' Work Center explaining the function of the facility and expressly prohibiting unauthorized entrance by persons other than the Shop Committee.	-
3.	Pictures, calendars, cardboard, etc., will not be affixed to the windows, nor will the view be obscured in any manner,
4.	A window opening similar to a cashier’s window will be installed in each Union Work Center so that employees with a bona fide question or inquiry can receive necessary service without entering the Union Work Center.
5.	Lighting will be provided in such a manner that it . cannot be extinguished during times that Shop Committee person are in the plant.
6.	Non-duplicating keys or magnetic keys will be issued to members of the Shop Committee, and the Work Center will be locked to prohibit entry by unauthorized persons.

An employee starts a week at 10:30 p.m. Monday. This shift is also worked Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Thursday night and Fridaynight. The shift beginning 10:30 p.m. Saturday .may or may not be worked. The employee is brought in Sunday night but instead of starting at the usual time of -10:30 p.m:, the starting time is delayed until 12:01 a.m. Monday. The next week is then started al the usual time of 10:30 p.m. Monday. The first 8 hours beginning at 12:01 a.m.
- Monday were paid al straight time. ,	.
The Corporation advised the Union that in these and similar cases, the shift that starts at 12:01 a.m. on Monday will he considered'a Sunday shift and paid at double time. The employee’s 24-hour cycle shall be considered to have started at 10:30 p.m. Sunday night.

Interpretation of Working Hours Section
(Special Double Time Case)
During negotiations the Union has cited a situation in which a third shift employee worked seven shifts in the week and received no double time under the following circumstances.
Example #1
The employee worked the first five days of die week beginning each day at the regular shift starting time. The employee’s sixth shift was advanced from 12:01 a.m. Saturday to 11:00 p.m. Friday and die employee then worked eight hours. The seventh shift was advanced from 12:01 a.m, Sunday to 11:00 p.m. Saturday.
Example *2
The employee worked the first five days of the week beginning each day at the regular shift starting time. Then the employee’s sixth shift was advanced from 12:01 a.m. Saturday to 11:00 p.m. Friday and eight hours were then worked. The seventh shift was advanced from 12:01 a.m. Sunday to 3:30 p.m. Saturday.
The Corporation advised the Union that if (his or other such cases occur where the starting time of the employee’s seventh shift is advanced from Sunday to Saturday, the employee involved will be paid at double time for the hours worked by the employee on the seventh shift worked even though the shift starting time falls on Saturday.

(Special Protracted Work Period. Case)
During negotiations, the Union cited a situation in which an employee worked for a continuous period of more than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours where the hours worked in excess of twenty-four (24) were paid for at straight time.
The Corporation advised the Union that in such a case, those continuous hours worked in excess of twenty-four (24) will be paid for at the rate of time and one-half unless such hours would otherwise be paid for at a higher premium pursuant to the provisions of the Working Hours Section of the National Agreement. Any such time worked and paid at time and one-half instead of straight'time, will be considered as having been paid at straight time for purposes of computing daily overtime within die 24-hour cycle in which such time worked occurs.

RELIEVING EMPLOYEE FOR COMMITTEEPERSON DISCUSSION
Consistent with the purpose of the Grievance Procedure, a rule of reason should be applied in determining whether an employee should be excused from the job in order to confer with the Committeeperson handling the employee’s grievance. A rule of reason should likewise be applied when, due to production difficulties, excessive absenteeism, or other emergencies, it will not be possible to immediately relieve the employee from the job. On many jobs discussion between the employee and the Committeeperson is entirely practical without the necessity for the employee being relieved. On the other hand, an employee working on a moving conveyor, in an excessively noisy area, or climbing in and out of bodies, should be permitted a reasonable period of time off the job and a suitable place in which to discuss the grievance with the Committeeperson. This shall not interfere with any local practice which is mutually satisfactory.

ATTACHMENT “A”TO THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING HEALTH AND SAFETY
I.	INTRODUCTION
The UAW and Delphi Corporation have for many years been proud leaders in adopting and effectuating policies designed to resolve employee health and safety problems and to promote a more healthful and safe work environment. To this end, the UAW and Delphi Corporation have entered into the following Memorandum of Understanding which embodies the spirit of the concern shared by the UAW and Delphi for the health and safety of employees. The parties recognize that the UAW and Delphi leadership have demonstrated a visible commitment to protecting employees from work place hazards that resulted tn a significant reduction in injuries and illnesses. The Plant Safety Review Boards fPSRBl. which consists of the joint local leadership and the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee (LJHSO at each location have received leadership training in health and safety. This jointly developed course, entitled UAW-Delphi Health & Safety Leadership Training, covered roles and responsibilities and resulted in the establishment of a leadership driven safety process. This training was subsequently extended to other members of plant leadership including supervisors and committeepersons. The parties are committed to jointly work toward a safer workplace through the joint involvement of all employees, and have developed general awareness training for hourly employees that included an overview of the health and safety leadership process and associated responsibilities.
The Corporation and_fbq UAW have worked jointly in an innovative manner to identify and correct potential hazards. The process used to correct potential hazards is
321
the "Hierarchy of Control;-", whiqh describes ^h,e process of consideration of higher level controls such as elimination or engineering before administrative procedures or personal protective equipment,
The Corporation shall continue to recognize its obligation-to provide a safe and healthful working environment for employees during working hours. The Union will cooperate with the Corporation's efforts to fulfill its obligations. To implement and coordinate these principles, a National Joint Health and Safety Committee iNJC) and Local Joint Health and Safety Committees have been formed, trained and empowered to function dealing with a broad range of the subject matter. '.Included in this Attachment ‘‘A”-to the Memorandum of Understanding is a Divisional Safety Review Board process designed to enhance Health’and Safety awareness and compliance across Delphi Corporation operating divisions, and a Plant Safety Review Board 1PSRB) process designed to review the unit's health and safety performance and monitor the implementation of its health and safety programs. The parties continue to recognize their roles and responsibilities, for assuring that all Delphi Corporation employees have safe and healthy work environments. The function of the NJC and the LJHSC should be technically constructive and problem resolution oriented.	■ ■
In keeping with the purpose and intent of this Memorandum of Understanding and other related health and safety documents contained herein, the Union reaffirmed its commitment to communicate to its members the need to utilize the internal processes available to resolve health and safety matters.
The parties recognize that a joint commitment must be directed toward achieving a safe and healthy workplace. Therefore, it shall be the responsibility of

VII.	ERGONOMICS
Delphi Corporation and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America recognize that Ergonomically-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (hereafter “EMSPs*’) are occupational illnesses present in the automobile industry.
The parties also recognize that the control of EMSDs is a complex issue often requiring the application of a
327
number of different control methods and technologies that may differ from operation to operation. These include an ergonomically appropriate design, along with feasible engineering and administrative controls that materially reduce or-eliminaie job related EMSD stressors, employee and supervisory training and education, early recognition of the problem, early and proper medical diagnosis, treatment and care. *
Delphi Corporation will continue to administer an Ergonomics Program at UAW represented locations utilizing guidelines established between Delphi Corporation and the International Union, UAW. Delphi Corporation recognizes the accomplishments of the joint ergonomics process and realizes the need for continued efforts to further reduce work-related EMSDs. Delphi Corporation is committed to progressively pursue improving and enhancing the current process with the UAW. The purpose of the program is to deal cooperatively and constructively with the problem of EMSDs in the workplace.	'
Delphi Corporation re-committed to fixing jobs that arc identified as presenting a corresponding and documented risk of employee injury. The parties -recognize that effective corrective action for jobs which present a documented risk of injury, requires the timely use of sound judgement in combination with training, experience, and the following:
* Analysis results from the risk factor checklist . and secondary analysis tools (when utilized)
• 'Injury/illoess history of both the job and the worker
• The history and future plans of the job
Also, seats, chairs and mats can be considered appropriate solutions to.control specific ergonomic risk
328
factors. The Corporation agrees to leave such devices in place when they are provided in accordance with the guidelines in the UAW-Delphi risk factor checklist.
The ESRB has the responsibility for supervising and supporting the ergonomics program. In plants with 750 or more employees, the parties will establish a Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, which.will be comprised of one full-time UAW Technician and one Delphi Management Technician. In. addition, plants with 2,000 or more employees will supplement the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team with a second full-time UAW Technician. In*plants with less than 750 employees, the PSRB will identify the resources to be trained to perform the responsibilities of the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, as needed, and to administer the Ergonomics Program. Plant Safety Review Boards in plants with 4,000 or more employees can petition the NJC for an additional UAW Technician based on the level of activity required to meet the needs of the Ergonomics Program in the plant. Plants with 750 or more employees that do not experience enough ergonomic activity to sustain the level of‘resources agreed upon can also petition the NJC for a variance. Any petition must be based on the level of sustained activity required to meet the requirements of the Ergonomic Program for that plant. In addition, the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team at any location can request additional interim resources when‘the ergonomic needs of the plant exceed what the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team can be reasonably expected to accomplish in a timely fashion. Such requests will be reviewed and approved by the PSRB:' The local parties may refer unresolved issues or concents to the NJC.
The NJC has established selection criteria for the Joint Ergonomics Technicians, The UAW Technicians will be selected from the local workforce and appointed to the position by the ViceiPresident and Director of the
329
General .Motors Department of the International Union.
The responsibilities of the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will include, but not be limited to, the following:	,
* Participating in the “Design-In” Process
• Conducting job analysis
< .	• Providing recommendations for corrective
action
'	• Monitoring the implementation of job
improvements . .
* ' Conducting review and follow up
• Reporting monthly to the Plant Safety Review Board
The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will coordinate their efforts with the LJHSC. and resources from appropriate departments; e.g., Medical, Engineering, Skilled Trades, and Production, will be made available to support the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team. The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will report monthly at each PSRB and LJHSC meeting and keep minutes specific to ergonomics. Quarterly reports will be provided to the LJHSC. the PSRB. and the NJC. The status of the ergonomics process for each facility will be reviewed at the Divisional Safety Review Board meeting with assistance from the Ergonomic Managers; Discussions concerning significant problems or roadblocks will take place at these meetings. .	'
■ The parties agreed to use the jointly developed process for the use of outside consultants in situations where in-house efforts concerning reduction of job EMSDs are not successful. The consultant's reports will
330
be made available to both the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team and the co-chairs of the NJC.
Based on the results of the job analysis program, each facility shall implement feasible measures to control EMSD risk factors. The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, in conjunction with input from the workers, engineering, supervision, skilled trades and others, as appropriate, will make recommendations for corrective actions in accordance with the current ergonomics process. Once it is determined through the agreed upon ergonomics process that a job requires correction, recommendations for corrective action will be developed using the results of the jointly agreed upon analysis tools. Delphi's Design-In Ergonomics Guidelines may be referenced for information regarding areas for potential improvement. Delphi’s Desian-In Ergonomics Guidelines is currently undergoing revision and will undergo future revisions as deemed appropriate by the Corporation. A good-faith effort will be made to accomplish correction of identified EMSD hazards at a particular job or work station within six (6) months, after the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team determines that corrective action is required. The parties acknowledge that there may be times when it may take ' longer than six (6) months to make the proper correction, and those reasons need to be documented. The corrective action will include any combination of the following:
Engineering controls such as design, selection, location and orientation of tools, parts and equipment will be used.	’
Administrative controls (e.g., job enlargement, job rotation, and appropriate job assignment) will be used in the following manner: as interim abatement measures pending engineering changes, when engineering changes are determined to be insufficient to significantly
331
reduce the EMSD stressors, and in those instances when an administrative control is the most effective fix among the possible choices for corrective actions.
The PSRB will monitor the corrective actions being implemented and any unresolved issues or concerns can be referred to the NJC.
Delphi Corporation will inform and instruct affected employees on the controls implemented at their work station and how they are to be used.
The facility will maintain documentation of modification activity, including the job or work station identified for modification, number of employees affected, the nature of modification, the projected completion date, the actual completion date and, where available, the cost of the modification when completed.
Plants and facilities will include "ergonomics” in their planning process and this information will be available to the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team.
Delphi Corporation recognizes the importance of identifying and addressing ergonomic issues early in the development process and values the importance of receiving input from plant ergonomic personnel. Input from the Joint Ergonomic Technician Team on site specific ergonomic issues and practices will be provided to the design process at the earliest appropriate planning/design stage. This will include: new technology, new products and new, processes.
The NJC will establish a joint committee consisting of UAW International Representatives and Divisional Ergonomics Managers to review the Delphi Business Systems and update the LJAWiDclphi Ergonomics Implementation Guidelines^ The updated Ergonomics Implementation Guidelines will define the involvement of die JETTs at the appropriate stage, early in the design
332
process. This team will also jointly review Corporate Ergonomics design guidelines. It is understood that final design decisions are the responsibility of the Corporation.	.

334
provide for common medical practice guidelines for patient evaluation and treatment, follow-up, workplace walk-throughs, and restricted work placement.
Delphi Corporation agrees to continue implementation of a EMSD Education and Training Program for medical physicians (including contract personnel) that render medical services related to EMSD. The introduction in this training includes the effect of poor job design, identifying problem jobs, and potential solutions based on ergonomic stressors. This training also includes medical instruction and early recognition, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of EMSDs. All medical personnel (including contract personnel) will receive EMSD education and training prior to rendering medical services related to EMSD. The Corporate Medical Director and staff will ensure that appropriate EMSD training has been provided and their training plans for medical staff willbc reviewed with the International Union. UAW on an annual basis.
Delphi Corporation shall authorize Medical Department personnel to attend education and training conferences that address EMSDs. including but not necessarily limited to regional conferences, teleconferences, and Corporate conferences. Where practical, conference proceedings will be videotaped and made available to medical personnel who do not attend the conference.
Delphi Corporation will audit a random sample of medical records, Workers Compensation reports, and work-related sickness and accident data to verify the OSHA 300 log is correct.
The Corporate Medical Director and staff are responsible for the quality, implementation, and compliance by local Medical Departments with the Delphi Medical Management Program, as it applies to ergonomics. This program will be jointly reviewed
335
periodically for continuous improvement and elimination of unnecessary complexity.	■
The NJC will monitor implementation of this process and consider changes for continuous improvement.
VIII.	HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING
The Center for Human Resources will continue to develop training programs to enhance employees’ skills and abilities to perform their jobs in a safe manner. The NJC will be responsible for identifying employee job-related health and safety education and training needs which are mandated by the government or would be applicable across UAW-Delphi sites.
It is recognized by the NJC that the UHSC should be involved in identification of what health and safety training is needed and appropriate for their particular location, including monthly safety talks.
A local training needs analysis will be conducted at each location. Based on this analysis, a comprehensive training plan consistent with the NJC requirements and local plant initiatives will be developed, and the necessary resources will be identified as part of the business planning process to provide such training. The Plan will specify target audiences, recommendations for completion dates, class size, and methods of delivery. The Plan will be reviewed by the PSRB, their Divisional Safety Review Board, and the NJC. to ensure consistency with requirements. The LJHSC shall be responsible for monitoring the progress of their local training plan.
The NJC through the Center for Human Resources will continue to provide training resources for use by the plants. The NJC wilt direct and oversee the development and administration of required training courses. Alternatively, the NJC may approve the use of
336
other commercially developed courses. The NJC with input from the Divisional and Plant Safety Review Boards will establish the appropriate selection criteria for plant health and safety trainers. Trainers selected will receive necessary instruction inconducting the specific training. Hourly plant trainers will be selected by the Local Union. •	■	'
Required health and safety training will be introduced to plants by top Union Leadership and Corporate Management. The NJC will monitor and evaluate training programs and make periodic reports to the Center for Human Resources Executive Board. The HJC encourages the participation of International and Regional Servicing Representatives and members of Management in health and safety training programs developed by the Center for Human Resources.
IX.	SAFETY TRAINING FOR CHAIRPERSONS
OF SHOP COMMITTEES WITHOUT DESIGNATED HEALTH AND SAFETY REPRESENTATIVE
The Chairpersons of Shop Committees in locations which do not have a designated Health and Safety Representative, may upon request of the General Motors Department of the International Union, attend training or instruction programs provided by the Corporation in Section II, Item C of the Memorandum of Understanding - Health and Safety.
In addition, the Corporation advises that employees who wish to enroll in courses of instruction relating to industrial health and safety at approved educational institutions will be eligible to apply for tuition refund for such courses subject to the terms and conditions of the Corporation's Tuition Refund Program.
337
x. lockout policy
During the current negotiations the UAW and Delphi Corporation discussed their mutual concern regarding fatalities and serious injuries to employees, including operators, performing repair, service and maintenance activities on machinery and equipment. The parties agreed that the Lockout - Energy Control program must be universally implemented and enforced throughout the Corporation. In order to be effective, the parties reaffirmed that the elimination of the potential for injury from hazardous energy is critical to worker safety.
It is the policy of Delphi Corporation and endorsed by the UAW that:
Lockout is required where employees may be exposed to hazardous energy which could cause injury. Exposure means that the employee is in a position to be injured by released energy.
Where an employee is exposed to potential injury from expected machine energy/motion, the exposure must be eliminated. If the exposure cannot be eliminated, the machine will be locked out.
The Corporation will utilize a common tool at all plants to generate a common lockout, placard for new machines and equipment, _The_tooj wi|l also be used to update existing placards into the common placard template Whenever machinery and/or equipment is modified after April L 2004.
All plants will also be required to conduct an annual review of lockout placards. The review Js to be conducted to ensure that the placards are Mill representative of the procedure required to lockout the equipment and that all lockout points are appropriately identified.
Each location will maintain an effective Lockout -
338
Energy Control program which will apply to all employees, based on implementation guidelines which have been published by the Center for Human Resources.
XI,	MONITORED POWER SYSTEMS
. The UAW and Delphi Corporation recognize the importance of designing processes and equipment with effective health and safety controls. Therefore, the parties agreed to integrate “Monitored Power Systems" into the existing Lockout/Energy Control procedures. The fundamental process begins with performing an initial Task Based Risk Assessment (TaBRA) on any process where "Monitored Power Systems” may be appropriately used.
The use of these systems, when integrated into the existing Lockout/Energy Control procedures, can further reduce or eliminate the risk of exposure to employees. However, it is understood by the parties that Lockout must still be performed whenever the exposure cannot be controlled or eliminated as determined by the Task Based Risk Assessment process.
XII.	REFUSAL OF HAZARDOUS WORK
A worker, who has a reasonable belief that their work assignment may result in serious physical injury, including illness, should-immediately discuss the safety aspects of the work assignment with their supervisor. Failing resolution, the issue may be discussed with the District Committeeperson.
Should technical consultation be requested by the supervisor or committeeperson, the LJHSC will be notified to respond before further action is taken. In line
* with the Memorandum of Understanding on Health and Safety, upon joint recommendation, the machine or operation will be taken out of service to perform any and all corrective action.
339
Failing resolution of the matter, it may be taken up in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Health and Safety, Section IV, Complaint Procedure,
XIII.	IMPROVEMENT OF MEDICAL AND INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE SERVICES
The Corporation reserves the right to select and hire appropriate consultants for health and safety services. The Union will be informed in advance and be provided an account based on specific legitimate requests regarding qualifications of the consultants) engaged by the Corporation to provide services. The Union may recommend consultants for Management’s consideration. Included in such recommendation should be an account of the qualifications of the consultants recommended by the Union.
The LJHSC will be informed regarding the engagement of consultants to provide industrial hygiene and safety services. Qualifications of such consultants will be provided upon request. Reports prepared by such consultants will he provided to the L.IHSC. who will provide a copy to the local Industrial Hygiene Technician and the co-chairs of the NJC. In addition, the Corporation will provide a list of consultants under Corporate contract for industrial hygiene services to the NJC and update the list when changes are made.
Management in conjunction with the LJHSC will assess the need and where required, a facility will develop and implement an air sampling plan. Such plans should be reviewed and implemented on an appropriately scheduled basis. Guidance in the preparation of such plans will be provided by the NJC. Based upon the air sampling plan, an hourly employee selected by the Vice President and Director of the * General Motors Department of the International Union, working under the technical supervision of a Delphi Industrial Hygienist, may assist in the collection of air
340
samples. Job function key elements of the Industrial Hygiene Technician will be established by the NJC, and the appointee will demonstrate competency by successfully completing required training, determined by the NJC. Reports of industrial hygiene and noise measurement surveys will be provided to the LJHSC who will provide it to the co-chairs of the NJC. if appropriate. .
XIV.	ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL
Environmental information and reports, which arc required to be reported to various governmental regulatory agencies, will be made available to the NJC on a regular basis., For example, this information may include the local Toxic Release Inventory compiled to comply with the Superfund Amendments and Re-guthorization Act, copies of environmental permits and compliance monitoring data. Delphi Corporation will notify the LJHSC of significant environmental remediation projects, and spills or releases that are subject to government reporting requirements. The LJHSC will forward such information to the co-chairs of the NJC.	.
The co-chairs of the NJC-will be invited as guest members of the Delphi Environmental Issues team for the purpose of providing them with periodic updates on environmental projects and issues that may affect UAW bargaining unit employees.	■
XV.	PERIODIC JOINT AUDITS OF PLANTS
The UAW and Delphi Corporation agree that a formal system of performance review is an effective means of obtaining and re-enforcing compliance with established health and safety requirements. The parties, therefore, agree that the NJC will conduct audits to evaluate each facility's health and safety performance. The purpose of the audits is to review the effectiveness
341
of health and safety activities reaching the operations level and being implemented across the workplace. The parties also agree to enhance the current audit process by developing methods to assure the process is consistently applied and delivers measurable results. Additionally, the parties have developed as part of the Divisional Safety Review Board Process a method to address repeat audit findings for identical deficient conditions found on consecutive audits.
The NJC has established joint review teams to conduct such reviews.
A plant visit itinerary will be established by the NJC which will be scheduled through appropriate channels. The team will meet with the Plant Manager, Shop Committee Chairperson and the LJHSC before beginning the performance review, and have a closing conference upon completion of the on-site review. The finalized report will be prepared and sent to the plant and division within thirty (30) days of the review. Following the finalized report, the LJHSC alter review by the Key Four, will reply, addressing issues contained in the report. All such review information shall remain the confidential property of Delphi Corporation and will not be released without the expressed written permission of Delphi Corporation.
The parties agree that through the joint audit process, they will verify that all facilities have an effective emergency notification system and that it is periodically tested to achieve the best possible response time for the emergency involved.
XVI.	NEWTECHNOLOGY/SPECIFICATIONS
Discussions were held during these negotiations regarding Health and Safety being designed into new equipment, refurbished equipment and/or new processes. Delphi and the UAW recognize the
342
advantages of designing processes and equipment with effective health and safety controls. The parties established a joint team from the Center for Human Resources, under the direction of the EIC. to work with the “Design-In Safety” group, established by the Corporation, to address health and safety concerns early in the development process. The main objective to the “Design-In” effort was to develop common design specifications for application across the Corporation, in the manufacturing processes, that incorporated health and safety program requirements. The joint team serves as a technical resource to work with- the engineering group to assure that UAW-Delphi health and safety program requirements are incorporated into the common design specifications.
In an effort to promote improved communications regarding such matters, as early as possible and preferably in the development phase of the planning in the design process and incorporating as described in the Delphi Design-In Health and Safety Specification, the parties agree to perform Task Based Risk Assessments (TaBRA). on new equipment and manufacturing systems, and on existing equipment and manufacturing systems where locally agreed to and approved by-'the PSRB. A Task Based Risk Assessment will be performed after the detailed designs are completed on new manufacturing equipment and/or processes. A review of anticipated equipment and/or processes with the shop committee, the UHSC. and the JETT will be held. The LJHSC and, when-appropriate, the JETT may. be required to travel to vendors, plants, or other locations to participate in a design review of such equipment or processes as outlined in the Delphi Desig nJ n Health and Safety Specification and the UAW-Delphi Ergonomics Implementation Guidelines. The Union will have an opportunity to discuss health and safety and ergonomics concerns with Management and make recommendations designed to improve the
343
equipment and/or processes, consistent with Che common design specifications where they have been established by the “Design-ln” activity in the Delphi Dcsigndn Health and Safety Specification and DesignIn Ergonomics Guidelines. Additionally, TaBRA data will be incorporated at several points or gate reviews early in the design process as described in the Delphi Design-ln Health and Safety Specification.
Reviews will be made at the appropriate level (i.e. Plant Safety Review Board, Divisional Safety Review Board, and National Joint Committee), for new technology/process awareness and to discuss safety related issues and/or concerns. Representatives from the Facility Services Group will periodically meet with the National Joint Committee on Health and Safety to review advancements in technology that mav impact the Committee’s area of responsibility. In addition, the NJC has established a joint team to identify the risks associated with high'hazard jobs, with the intent of developing recommendations for evaluating and controlling them. Recommendations from the team will be submitted to the NJC.
Machinery, equipment or processes will not be released for production without the written approval of the Plant Safety Administrator. The Plant Safety Supervisor wilt copsuit with the JETT during this process. Where required, lockout placards will be posted for all applicable energy sources. The parties discussed and recommitted themselves to continue the implementation of the UAW-Delphi Lockout Placard Guidelines. These placards will continue to be reviewed during a UAW-Delphi joint audit and should be reviewed during safety observation tours.
The LJHSC and, when appropriate. the JETT will consult with operators, skilled trades, engineers, supervisors or related personnel to ensure that required
344
safeguards and ergonomics features provide effective protection and do not interfere with their ability to perform their assigned tasks. ■	. ;
The NJC will continue to oversee the development of communications material regarding the design-in-safety activity for the L1HSC and the UAW-Delphi Ergonomics Implementation Guidelines. This material includes informational material, guidelines, standards, checklists, CD ROM Disks, and other appropriate material to clearly communicate the common design specifications.
The parties will continue their efforts to integrate health and safety into the development process of the Quality Network, which includes common design specifications, and review of such, into the earliest design phases of any new equipment, process, or operation at the appropriate level
XVII.	CONTROL OF CHEMICAL EXPOSURES
The Corporation will continue to update Occupational Exposure Guidelines (OEG’s) to assess employee exposure to chemicals in Delphi Corporation facilities, as needed. Guidelines are considered necessary whenever existing OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits do not sufficiently protect the worker, or when there is no applicable OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit. Guidelines will be based on consensus standards and recommendations in addition to available scientific evidence. Delphi Corporation will require plants to use OEG’s as the basis for evaluating employee exposures and for taking appropriate corrective or preventive action.
The Corporation will review Guidelines with the National Joint Committee on an annual basis and will discuss proposals for necessary changes. The Corporation intends to control, through professional
345
industrial hygiene practice and methods, employee exposures to the currently adopted guidelines of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists tACGIH) for Threshold Limit Values (TLV) for Chemical Substances in the work environment. In addition, the Corporation will bring to the NJC for review and discussion, all cases where OEG’s and TLV's are divergent.
When changes to the existing list are proposed, the NJC:	....	!
•	Will review the proposed change and its rationale.	•
•	Will review existing air sampling data to determine the prevailing exposure level to the chemical or substance under consideration.-
*	May seek the advice of the UAW-Delphi Occupational Health Advisory Board concerning the..proposed change. ■
The Corporation and Union agree to continue to study the potential health effects of cutting fluids for the purpose of establishing an exposure guideline and to determine the need for additional controls where cutting fluids are used. Where warranted, based on confirmed results of the current NJC-OHAB studies, the NJC will devise an action plan and make appropriate recommendations to the Corporation regarding coolant exposures. In this regard, Delphi Corporation will establish a plan to be reviewed with the NJC that reduces exposure to coolant aerosol. The plan will include a phased-in approach, as appropriate, across affected plants taking into consideration plant process and/or product changes.
The Joint Parties agree that prior to implementing new chemical tech no logy/processes and changes to current chemical processes, reviews will continue to be
346
made at the appropriate level (i.e. Plant Safety Review Board, Divisional Safety Review Board, and National Joint Committee), for awareness and discussion of safety related issues and/or concerns.
■ r- ।
The LJHSC will review process exhaust ventilation systems at facilities where air is recirculated. Such review'will be in accordance with guidelines established by the NJC. Air testing will be performed when requested by the LJHSC. To the extent feasible, these tests will be incorporated in the previously described air sampling plan. Recirculation will not be permitted where employee health and safety cannot be assured.
The UAW-Delphi Industrial Hygiene Technician Program wiilbg joiptlyrevised to include the following;
1.	A processlfpr aq assessment of intermittent exposures in skilled trades jobs and poo-routine tasks.
2.	The identification of appropriate perfonnance checks, conducted at least annually, on locaU exhaust ventilation systems to assist in_the evaluation of employee exposures, Additionally, ventilation systems will be included in the local planned maintenance program ri.e.. MAXIMO),
Medical surveillance for.respiratory effects of machining fluids will be offered to employees who regularly work in operations with machining fluids. Such medical surveillance will include a standardized respiratory symptoms questionnaire and pulmonary function test. For personnel newly-assigned to such operations, pre and post shift pulmonary function tests will be done at least once during the first year.
The,Industrial Hygiene Technician will receive notice pfinitial work related_medical cases reporting symptoms such as headaches, nausea, skin problems, and respiratory complaints.
347
Records of laboratory testing and coolant additions will be maintained and made available to the local joint committee for health and safety upon request.
XYU). ACCESS TO DATA
The Health Information System, (HIS), provides a common method for recording medical visit information in UAW-Delphi facilities.	.
During 1999 negotiations, the Joint Parties enhanced the Health Information System (HIS) for the purpose of making it easier for the LJHSC to retrieve and analyze injury/illness data.
Additionally a joint effort through the NJC developed standardized reports of information customarily used by the LJHSC in carrying out their responsibilities. The existing reports in HIS, that include the OSHA 300 log overrides, will continue to be available for access by the IJHSC.
A joint procedure has been established for review of the quarterly audit results of HIS injury/illness records with, the LJHSC. by the Medical Department (administrative joint letter dated June 10, 1999). This medical department audit includes a review of Worker’s Compensation cases as pan of the current audit of HIS injury/illness records.
In order to ntoqjtor the eftectjvcness of the programs, the narties recognize that all work-related injuries and illnesses must be reported to the medical department as soon as possible. Thyse iniuries/illnessss shalLbe reported tn accordance with procedures developed by the local PSRB. Further, the Corporation will continue io encourage the reporting of near-misg incidents ag agreed in the 1999 Negotiations. The Corporation does not endorse the use of monetary or other tangible rewards for groups_or individuals to discourage the
34S
reporting of work-related injuries or illnesses: - The parties agreed that positive recognition fop developing improved safety processes or accomplishing improved safety performance can be a valuable tool to continue to motivate managers, supervisors and workers to keep safety as an overriding priority.
The NJC has established a represented employees' mortality registry. The LJHSC may request the mortality experience pertaining to the facility they represent from the NJC. The NJC will access the Corporate Mortality Registry as it pertains to UAW represented employees for such information.
The Corporation agrees to_continne to_proyide information pertinent to the joint investigation of-health
existing databases including the Health Information . System-IHIS), ttje Mortality Registry, the.Workers Comp .database and the Sickness & Accident database. The Mortality Registry will be updated on a regular hasis.as d£icrminc<Lby-thc NIC in wnsiriMioiLwiih-thc Occupational Health Advisory Bpard (historicity every five 15) years). Tfae Corporation further agrees to keep these databases up to date apd to jointly look for ways to enhance the effectiveness of these systems and the information.	.	.
XIX. NOISE ABATEMENT/CONTROL PROGRAM
The joint parties recognize that the Corporation has had a comprehensive Hearing Conservation and Noise Control Program for the purpose of continuous incremental improvements in noise reduction. In accordance with this program, each plant is required to have a Noise Control Committee, The Noise Control Committee will consist of representatives from Plant Engineering, Operations, Medical, Industrial Hygiene, Finance, Purchasing, the LJHSC. Industrial Hygiene Technicians (where available), and others as deemed
349
appropriate by the PSRB. such as certain skilled trades personnel, and/or other employees. The Noise Control Committee has the responsibility to seek input from plant personnel in identifying noise sources and potential ways to reduce noise levels.
The Noise Control Committee will:
•	Ensure audiometric testing is performed for employees exposed above 85 dBA.
*	Perform an annual evaluation of the noise abatement plan and provide recommendation for improvement to the Plant Safety Review Board.
*	Ensure reports follow formats specified in Delphi Hearing Conservation and Noise Program SL 3.0.
•	Ensure new and rebuilt equipment meet the Delphi Sound Level Specification SL 1.0.
•	Identify planned maintenance items related to noise control.
The Corporation will continue to conduct the annual noise exposure survey and provide findings to'the LJHSC and summary noise abatement program findings to tite NJC.
The Noise Control Committee will meet regularly, record minutes, and report quarterly to the PSRB regarding progress on the Noise Abatement Plan. The annual evaluation will include:
•	Copies of the plant’s noise abatement program.
*	The number of employees that experienced standard threshold shift-
•	The number of employees that are required to wear hearing protection.	’
350
■ The number of employees at risk of exposure at or above 85 dBA.
• The number of employees at risk of exposure above 90 dBA.
XX	. PLANNED MAINTENANCE
The NJC will jointly identify health and safety requirements to be integrated into the Quality Network “Planned Maintenance Action Strategy.” These requirements will include both those that are regulated by government agencies and those established in UAW-Delphi programs. The LJHSC will also review the “Planned Maintenance Action Strategy’' to assure local regulations and/or practices currently in effect are included. Safety related information, such as established safe operating procedures, shall be included in the Planned Maintenance Program (e.p„ MAXIMO).
XXL	WORKING ALONE	*
The parties have discussed the Corporation's policy regarding the assignment of employees to tasks in isolated locations or confined entry spaces. The Corporation explained that anytime an employee is assigned to work alone in an isolated area, the Corporation has instructed Plant Leadership to ensure an appropriatcJcvcl of personal surveillance. (Sec jointly agreed to letter from Manufacturing Task Team dated February 2003.) Additionally, when work assignments involve situations hazardous to an employee, appropriate precautions will be taken in accordance with safe work practices, including air sampling and ventilation when necessary, communications systems, personal surveillance arrangements and, as required, adequate support personnel. When an employee brings to Management’s attention a situation where they are reasonably concerned that their safety is jeopardized
351
because they are working alone, Management will provide a copy of an applicable written Safe Operating Practice to the employee detailing precautions to take to perform the task safely. If one has not been developed and reviewed. Management will give the employee job instructions to perform the task safely and within 24 hours make a written request to the LJHSC for the development of a Safe Operating Practice. Safe Operating Practices will be developed by the LJHSC within 5 working days and will be reviewed by the PSRB at the next regularly scheduled.meeting. This will not change or restrict.any mutually satisfactory local practices.
XXII.	NO HANDS IN DIES POLICY .
The Corporate policy has been and continues to be 2No Hands in Dics2. Implementation of “No Hands in Dies” in the plant requires provision for expendable hand feeding tools, slide feeds, sliding bolsters, automatic or semi-automatic operation, die cutouts or other means and procedures whereby the operators are not required to place their hands into the point of operation. In addition, well disciplined procedures for use of die blocks and safety lock-outs for maintenance and setup personnel are imperative. An intensive orientation prograin for operating supervisors, and process and facilities engineers may also be advisable.
XXIII.	PLASTIC INJECTION MOLDING MACHINES
The panics recognize that hydraulically operated plastic injection molding machines may present hazards, different than mechanical power presses. Plastic injection molding machines will continue to be safeguarded in accordance with OSHA requirements and National Consensus Standards (ANSI). The NJC will continue to explore alternative methods of safeguarding the machines,	?	. ... n
352
XXIV.	CONTRACTOR SAFETY
It is the Corporation’s practice to provide outside contractors with Corporate Health and Safety policies and procedures and, where applicable, relevant site specific UAW-Delphi Health and Safety work practices. The Corporation will continue to use the'“Construction General Conditions! Delphi 1638” and, local implemented procedures as reviewed with thedJAW. The contractor’s Job Site Safety Plan will be reviewed prior to commencement ~of on-site work, and work activities will be periodically monitored thereafter for compliance. Additionally, Delphi requires that construction or maintenance contractors comply with applicable Federal, State, and Municipal Health and . Safely regulations as stipulated in the Delphi/contractor contract.	.	'
Where the nature of the construction or maintenance work requires that the contractor’s employees work ig proximity to UAW-Delphi employees, Delphi will require, as a condition of the construction or maintenance contract, the contractor’s commitment to abide by applicable UAW-Delphi’ plant/site Health and Safety work practices. The Corporation has_also agreed to continue to report contractor incidents, including serious injuries and near misses, to the UAW.
The PSRB will monitor Contractor Safety activity to insure compliance, and any unresolved issues or concerns can be referred through the safety process to. the &IC.

JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS-SEL
DELPHI CORPORATJON
September 18.2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214	,
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:	‘
Subject; JOBS Program -Volume Related Layoffs - SEL
During the course of these negotiations, the . Corporation and Union have provided Delphi Corporation employees with substantially increased ■ jab security through the new SEL feature of the JOBS Program, which protects eligible employees against layoff for virtually any reason except volume related market conditions. The parties recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry. Ths Corporation acknowledges, however, the importance of minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume ' related declines are unavoidable. In particular, the Union stressed the importance of reducing overtime and shifting dual sourced production requirements to UAW- Delphi plants in the event of overall market declines. The Corporation agrees to take these and other actions whenever practical. ■	'
In any event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in line with local seniority agreements and, if otherwise eligible, receive benefit treatment in accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the cunent Delphi-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Identifying the complex interrelationships of all the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a difficult task. The parties agreed, however, that for purposes of
359
JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS - SEL
determining SEL related protections they must identify just these volume declines that are attributable to market related conditions. and in turn just those declines that are not affected by Corporation sourcing choices of products and components that compete with or act as replacements lor products and components produced by Delphi Corporation employees coveted by this Collective Bargaining Agreement. In other words, volume declines that are attributable to the Corporation's production and purchase arrangements with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, captives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.) would be considered an exception to the overall volume related exclusion in Section 1(E) of the JOBS Program.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that the Corporation provide Local JOBS Committees adequate notice ot any impending volume-related layoff, as well as all information necessary to fully evaluate its underlying causes, the extent to which ■ such decline is associated with a Corporate sourcing action and the appropriate number of SEL eligible employees that should be affected by the layoff.
The Corporation recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context of the protections spelled out in tho JOBS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Corporation also accepts the responsibility of proving that the proper number oi employees are recalled to SEL positions when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the JOBS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.
The following are to be considered as illustrations to assist the parties in determining when volume related declines support reductions in employment. These illustrations should not be considered all inclusive.
■ Market Related Conditions - Included in this category is customer preference of one product over another that might result in a decline in sales of a U.S.-built Delphi Corporation product that requires
360
JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS-SEL
the layoff oi employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of increased sales or increased market share of competitive captive imports or joint venture products or any other product sold in the U.S. by Delphi Corporation but not produced in a UAW- Delphi plant.
, — Example of Market Eelated Conditions
(1)	There is a decline in economic activity which depresses sales of UAW- Delphi Corporation products. Lower production levels require the layoff of employees. Plant A, employing 4,100 SEL-eligible employees, is the sole source of Product Z for the US. market; it is’required to
,	layoff one shift, or 2,000 employees. The
- . number of SEL-eligible employees at the plant remains at 4,100, including 2,000 open positions lor laid-off employees. -
While the plant is down to one shift, the Corporation decides to outsource Product X, which reduces employment requirements by 250 employees per shift. Two hundred fifty (250) employees are placed on Protected * employee status. There is no impact on the SEL numbers. ■ ■	-	'
U.S. demand picks up to pre-layoff levels and . thesecond shift is called back. Active employment at the plant goes back to 4,100.
As the second shift is called back and the plant is back to pre-downtum production levels, an additional 250 employees are placed on Protected employee status which ‘	now leaves a total of 500 employees. The SEL
plant number remains at 4.100,
(2)	Plant B (5,000 SEL-eligible employees) is not the sole source of Product Y, which is also produced in Canada for the U.S. market, in Plant BC. Plant BC supplies one-fourth of the U.S. demand lor Product Y. An economic downturn in the U.S. reduces demand for
361
JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS - SEL	.
Product Y by 160,000. In accordance with SEL guidelines, volume related employment -reductions cannot exceed Plant B's share of pre-downtum volume levels (three-fourths) applied to the reduced level of overall sales. Production in Plant B is therefore reduced by no more than 120,000 units, causing Layoffs of 2,000 workers. Plant B's number of SEL-eligible employees remains at 5,000, including 2,000 open Bank positions.
Product Y demand in the U.S. market picks up by 60,000. The Corporation decides to produce 30,000 of those units in Plant B and the rest in Canadian Plant BC. The increase in production is not accomplished in proportion to pre-layoif production shares; to comply with SEL the Corporation must recall 250 employees which it assigns to Protected employee status in addition to the 500 employees required for the pick up in production.
.	• I	'
* Product Discontinuance - Because of the introduction of a new U.S.-built Delphi Corporation product or a nan-allied company product not sold by Delphi Corporation, sales of another Delphi Corporation-manufactured product may decline, and production of the’latter product must be curtailed necessitating reductions in employment. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(E) of the Program.
— Examples of Product Discontinuance or Phase Out and Changes in Customer Preference
(1)	A new U.S.-built Delphi Corporation product (or any other new non-allied company product which is not marketed by the Corporation) is introduced. Sales of Product X decline by 50%, and production must be curtailed.' The necessary reductions in employment are made through layoffs, keeping the number of SEL-eligible employees at the plant at the same level.
362
JOBS PROGRAM-VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS-SEL	-...
(2)	Battery Plant C, employing 1,400 SEL-eligible people, produced half of the batteries for Vehicle X; the other half are produced at a Corporate plant in Mexico. The volume reduction is made totally at Plant C rather than split proportionately between Plant C and the plant in Mexico. Therefore, in accordance with die JOBS guidelines half of the 700 employees who are not required any longer in Plant C due to this'event are ' assigned to Protected employee status, and the other 350 employees would be laid off. The number of SEL-eligible employees at Plant C remains at 1,400, including 350 open volume related positions. 1	\
•	Faulty Product - Vehicle line volume may decline because of faulty parts in a vehicle that cause customers to place the product in disfavor. Related Delphi Corporation product volume may also decline. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(E) of the Program.
•	Changes in Customer Preference • Delphi Corporation volume may decline because af customer preference shifts - in turn affecting mix and therefore demand, e.g., small car preference ’ shifts to large car; option preference swings; high product content to low product content. Such reductions would be considered volume-related declines under Paragraph 1(E) of the Program.
•	Nan- Delphi Corporation Commercial Customer Preference - Cancellation or declines in product volume far Delphi Corporation manufactured parts that are sold to unrelated firms may cause volume changes. Such volume reductions would be considered volume-related declines under Paragraph KE) of the Program.
— Examples of Non- Delphi Corporation Commercial Customer Preference
Plant A produces heavy duty cranking motors for off the toad construction equipment. Volume is
363
JOBS PROGRAM-VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS-SEL	'
reduced as d result of a decline in the construction industry. One hundred fifty (150) employees are laid off; 160 open volame-related ' positions are established.
At the time production is back to pre-layoii levels the Corporation introduces two robots which - replace 25 employees. According to SEL
, guidelines all of the 150 employees are recalled from layoff, 25 of them are assigned to Protected
- employee status, and the number of SEL-eligible . employees remains equal.to its pre-layofi level.
• Non- Delphi Corporation Produced Products -11 sales of a new or replacement product manufactured by
. an allied company lor Delphi Corporation, that competes with a product manufactured by the Corporation, results in reduced sales of the
’ Corporation-manufactured product, the action would not be volume related and layoffs under Paragraph 1(E) of the Program would not be permitted.
'— Example af Non- Delphi Corporation Produced Products
The Corporation outsources a product that it markets in competition with Product W manufactured by UAW- Delphi Corporation.
. employees. This results in reduced sales of Product W, Employment requirements are reduced, but this event is not covered under Paragraph 1(E) of the JOBS Program and layoffs are not permitted. This protection also extends to employees producing UAW- Delphi components which are manufactured for Product W.
• Components or Materials
It is recognized that reductions in vehicle production will often be accompanied by reductions in -component production. When reductions in vehicle production are volume related, pro-rata reductions in component production will normally be considered volume related as well. However, to the extent a reduction in component production results from a shift in sales to product sold by Delphi
364
JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS-SEL	. .
Corporation but not produced in UAW-'Delphi Corporation plants, the reduction will not be ■ considered volume related. Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dual-sourced from a UAW-, Delphi Corporation and a non-UAW- Delphi Corporation plant, production declines at the UAW-Delphi Corporation plant will only be considered volume-related to the extent the dual-sourced component produced at that plant continues to be produced in its pre-production decline proportion.
— Examples:
(1)	Plant A receives regular automotive batteries from a UAW- Delphi Corporation plant and heavy duty batteries from a non-UAW- Delphi Corporation plant. A volume decline occurs in ' regular automotive batteries because of customer preference lor heavy duty batteries. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under the Program but would not have to be taken proportionately because the batteries would not be considered like or similar components,
(2)	Plant B receives regular batteries that have plastic fastening'brackets from a UAW- Delphi Corporation plant and regular batteries that have steel fastening brackets from a nonUAW- Delphi Corporation plant. The batteries are used interchangeably and would be considered like or similar components. Therefore, any volume declines in battery production would have to be taken proportionately to be considered volume related.
As implied by these examples, there are many . variations to be considered when determining volume actions. This letter is intended to provide a framework within which Local and National JOBS Committees may review the applicability of Paragraph 1(E) to volume reductions.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations regarding the JOBS Program - SEL, the parties discussed utilization of Protected employees at some length. The Corporation and the UAW have agreed that productive utilization of Protected employees is critical to the viability of our operations, and to the continued success of our JOBS Program.
It was agreed that local JOBS Committees must make every effort to ensure that Protected employees are fully utilized on meaningful assignments. The parties have recognized that bath underutilized employees and unproductive assignments are contrary to the spirit of the Agreement. It is the intent of the Parties to utilize Protected employees in accordancewith previously agreed practices.	'
For purposes of the JOBS Agreement, "non-traditional" work could encompass any assignments) within the . facility (except regular productive work, including the direct production, assembly or fabrication of vehicles or components) which can efficiently and safely be performed by the individuals involved.

!	Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
1	During these negotiations we have explored al Length
methods to preserve and increase the job opportunities of our employees - your members. Further, we have	■-
mutually recognized that the best potential for increased job opportunities is a growing and thriving Corporation iully competitive in all aspects of its business.
During the discussions and in response to your concerns regarding the outsourcing of UAW work, a new sourcing letter has been submitted providing a mechanism for meaningful advance Union involvement so that the plant, division, or Corporate sourcing . authority may objectively consider the Union’s input. ’. The Job Security (JOBS! Program provides job security ‘ unmatched in American industry.
The major concern addressed by both the sourcing letter and the JOBS program is the retention of UAW jobs within the Corporation. The entire issue of job security, however, is broader than the continuation by the Corporation of its current business activities. The JOBS Program recognizes that long range job security must include opportunities in our traditional business lines and development of businesses In non-txaditicma) fields providing jobs for our current employees and future job entrants.
The challenge to the parties is a serious one, requiring the full range of all of our talent, experience and

imagination. To enhance opportunities for employment growth, the parties agree the Growth and Opportunity Committee will be continued during the term oi the current Agreement. This Committee is charged with pursuing opportunities in nan-tradilional business areas with an overall view toward providing new jobs not currently included in the scope oi Delphi Corporation operations. Each feature of the total business opportunity must be examined including 1} the market for the product to be produced, 2) expenditures that are required for equipment or tooling, 3) the cost of any plant modernization or rearrangement, including additions to an existing facility, 4) the availability of the necessary technology, 5) the lease or purchase of a new facility, 6) characteristics of the business including material, capital funds, and wage and benefit levels of other employers in the industry in which the new business will compete, 7) the nature of bargaining agreements needed to assure the new business is competitive, and 8) the expected return on ' investment relative to the standard in the industry in which the new venture would compete.
In analyzing the feasibility of entering into new business ventures the parties have agreed to call upon the full extent of Corporate and Union resources. As an indication of the seriousness of its commitment to employment growth through business diversification into non-traditional areas, the Corporation will make available up to $100 million of funding to provide for ’ this program during the term of the current Agreement. However, should the Growth and Opportunity Committee recommend new business funding in excess of this amount. The Corporation agrees to review such requests in accordance with the guidelines of this Document No. 12. These funds will be available ior investment in new business ventures including, as appropriate, the establishment of separate Corporate organizational structures.
Investment funds will be released on an "as required" basis. Only those ventures receiving concept approval and initial funding prior to the expiration of the current Agreement will be considered as firm commitments by
369
GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY COMMITTEE
the Corporation. Accounting for fund expenditures will be the responsibility al the Growth and Opportunity -Committee.	.
This new program will be administered by the Growth and Opportunity Committee. This Committee will be comprised of equal numbers of Corporate and Delphi' UAW representatives with multidisciplinary backgrounds. It will be the responsibility of the Committee to make recommendations to the Corporation and Union for concept approval and to request new venture funding from,the Corporation for -business opportunities deemed to be consistent with employment growth objectives of the program.
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will be responsible to; I) communicate to divisional and local managements and to regional and local union representatives the full’scope of this new business concept. 2| review and study the feasibility af proposals made by local JOBS Committees regarding entry into ‘ . new business ventures, 31 initiate studies necessary for a complete examination of new business ventures proposed locally or by the Committee, 4) make presentations and recommendations to the Executive ’ Board Joint Activities 5) report back, where appropriate, to the local JOBS Committee its findings and recommendations regarding a proposed new business venture, and 61 devise means of encouraging the entire organization, hourly and salaried, to participate in bringing new competitive business into the Corporation and creating new jobs.	’
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will be guided by the following when considering new business ■ venture proposals:	'	'
(I)	The jobs created should be in areas in which there is no significant unionized domestic competition, or in the case of traditional areas,’ where the competition is non-union or outside the U.S. ■	■	■ •	■
(2)	Work similar, but not identical to, work currently performed in-house, must be included for wage

and benefit purposes under the National' Agreement. Such proposals may include high risk ar marginally profitable projects that Delphi Corporation would otherwise not consider.
(3)	Such new business ventures must be located completely separate from facilities under this Agreement except lor those described in Paragraph (2) above. ■	-
Contingent upon the business climate and market proximity, we have agreed to pay particular attention to communities affected by the loss of Delphi-UAW employment opportunities. Accordingly, any newly created business venture developed through the efforts of the Growth and Opportunity Committee will be expected to provide opportunities for new employees, with preferential consideration given to UAW represented employees laid off from or working at Corporation facilities. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, the Corporation or other employer will recognize the UAW as the representative of the hourly employees working at businesses developed through the Growth and Opportunity Committee for the purpose . of collective bargaining. In this regard, the parties recognize the need to develop innovative approaches to labor relations and commit to negotiating new collective bargaining agreements for each venture?
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will report periodically to the Delphi Corporation Strategy Board and International Union UAW on their progress in identifying and developing viable opportunities for employment growth.
The approach to job security and new business opportunity reflected in this agreement requires a relationship typified by trust and the mutual willingness to take risks in return lor economic rewards and jab opportunities. Our enthusiasm to search for new business must be shared by divisional and local managements and by regional and local union representatives.
The success of this joint activity will be measured
371
GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY COMMITTEE
based upon results. A high level of commitment will be required from all parties to enhance the potential tor success. The commitment cd a full-time effort to seek new employment opportunities should improve the overall effectiveness of the program.

As a result of your deep concern about job security in our negotiations and the many discussions which took place over it this will confirm that during the term of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, until September id, 2007- the Corporation will not close, nor partially or wholly sell, spin-off, split-off, consolidate or otherwise dispose of in any farm, any plant, asset, or business unit of any type, beyond those which have already been identified, constituting a bargaining unit under the Agreement.
• In making this commitment, it is understood that conditions may arise that are beyond the control of the Corporation, e.g., act of God, and could make compliance with this commitment impassible. Should such conditions occur, the Corporation will review both the conditions and their impact on a particular location with the Union.
Should it be necessary to close a plant constituting a bargaining unit consistent with our past practice, the

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed situations where the Local Union was required to refund union dues to a large number of employees. This occurred when employees were laid off after a dues deduction had been made but before they had worked sufficient hours to he liable for dues under the UAW Constitution for that month.
The Corporation advised the Union that in those situations where it is known in advance that a large number of employees (100 or more) are scheduled to be permanently laid off and are not anticipated to work the necessary hours to owe dues under the UAW Constitution, the Financial Secretary may request that the plant delay far one week the deduction of monthly dues. In similar situations where the number of employees being laid off is leas than 100, the Financial Secretary may request that the regular deduction of monthly dues for these employees be suspended. These requests must be submitted to the plant Personnel Director one week prior to the payroll period that monthly dues deductions are made.

During these negotiations the parties discussed the ' ’ problems created when apprentices are permanently laid off or reduced from their apprentice classification due to the closing of their plant or the permanent' discontinuance of their apprentice classification and as a result not able to complete their apprentice training.
As a result of those discussions, the Corporation agreed to establish an informal procedure whereby such apprentices may, within seven calendar days of their last day worked as an apprentice, apply for consideration for openings in the same apprentice classification at other plants in the same area hire community as described in Document 21 of the National Agreement. Application forms will be made available upon request, and a copy of completed forms will be forwarded to other plants in.the area which have an apprentice program in the appropriate skilled classification.	'
In addition, such apprentices may apply for similar openings in other plants outside the same area hire community. In the event such apprentices cannot be placed in the same area hire community they will be offered available openings in the same apprentice classification in other plants outside their same area hire community. When such apprentices, including those who do not apply, are not placed they may be offered other available openings upon the approval of the Delphi-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee.

APPRENTICE PLACEMENT - CLOSED PLANTS OR DISCONTINUED PROGRAMS
Applicants who are employed in accordance with the above procedure may be eligible tor a Relocation Allowance under the applicable provisions oi the National Agreement covering similar circumstances.
Eligible apprentices will be given preference for openings in their same apprentice classifications over new applicants from either apprentice application list provided they are capable ol performing the work. Selections will be made from among those seniority apprentice applicants with the greater number of completed shop training hours, taking into consideration other factors such as proximity to the employing plant. Acceptance of placement and acquiring seniority at the secondary plant.by such apprentices will result in the termination of recall ■ rights to the apprentice training program at such apprentices' former plant(s).. Such apprentices will establish a new ^qte-pf-entry info the trade pt tijg secondary plant. Credit for prior experience, only fox completion oi their term of apprenticeship, may be granted at the secondary plant pursuant to Paragraph 132. N. A.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING DRUG TESTING
During 1990 National Negotiations, the, parties discussed at length the worsening drug problem in our country and the rising incidence of chemical dependency. Chemical dependence on the part of employees impacts the workplace in terms of quality, productivity, and effectiveness of operations, while threatening the safety and well-being of both the chemical ly-dependent employee and his/her co-workers. As a result, the parties agreed to institute a screening program and to periodically review it during the term of the agreement and make adjustments where deemed appropriate. This memorandum reflects such screening program and adjustments to it.
Process	.
Employees may be screened for substance abuse (alcohol and drugs) in the following instances:
1,	As part of a return to worit physical for employees returning from substance abuse related sick leaves of absence. .	. '
2.	As required by Law, such as, F.A.A., D.O.T. and D.O.D. .	. .	.	*
All testing and reporting will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by the Department of Health and Human Services. *
Implications
It is not the intent of the testing requirements to imply that an employee is impaired at the time a sample is provided for testing. An individual who tests positive will be handled in the following manner:
1,	FIRST POSITIVE: The employee will be deferred
395
from working for approximately two weeks and scheduled for follow-up testing. EAP services are to be offered to the employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be subject to further unannounced screening for a period of three months.
2.	SECOND POSITIVE: The employee will again be deferred from working for approximately two weeks and scheduled for follow-up testing. EAP services are to again be offered to the employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be, subject to further unannounced screening for a period of six months.
3.	THIRD POSITIVE: The employee will again be deferred from working for approximately two weeks and scheduled for follow-up testing. EAP services are to again be offered to the employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be subject to further unannounced screening fora period of twelve months.
4.	FOURTH POSITIVE: The employee will be discharged regardless of prior disciplinary record or length of service. Grievances protesting irregularities in the testing procedure may be taken through the grievance procedure; however, extent of penalties arguments are not subject to the Umpire’s discretion.
All positive test results will be subject to a mutually agreed to third party evaluation upon request of either party. Problems selecting a third party may be referred to the National Work/Family Committee. Employees who refuse to be tested will be treated as though they had tested positive.
Once terminated, if the employee satisfactorily documents to local management and local union six months continuous sobriety, within the 60 months
396
following discharge, the employee will qualify for reemployment under Article VII of Document 39 of the National Agreement,	■	.

If an employee who is required to be tested by law, tests positive then transfers ton non-covered classification, the employee will be removed from the drug testing pool and will not be subject to further drug testing except in the case of return from substance abuse related sick leave. Such employees will not be returned to a covered job until submitting to a further drug screen and testing negative.

For many years the Corporation and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation, and sexual harassment and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated Paragraph (6a) in their National Agreement that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Delphi Corporation and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violations of that principle.
The parties recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (1) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive method for prompt resolution of all claims of violations of Paragraph (6a), (2) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (9) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights agencies for the fallowing purposes: (a) to increase

understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the grievance and arbitration procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, nonproductive to relieving employee problems, (c) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange information, expertise and advice, and (4) to provide and monitor jointly approved diversity training modules.
Accordingly, the parties agree to establish within thirty (30) days of the ratification of the National Agreement dated today a National Equal Application Committee and Local Plant Equal Application Committees.
The National Equal Application Committee will be composed of three (3) representatives of the	'
International Union, one of whom will be a member of the International Union's Civil Hights Committee, or a designee, and three (3) representatives of the Corporation, one of whom will be active in the Corporation's equal employment opportunity programs.

While the Corporation and the Union will welcome the ' recommendations the Committees may make, the Committees may not commit either party io a specific course of action. However, the Union -agrees that it will encourage its members to utilize the grievance and arbitration procedure as the means of resolving claims or complaints against the Corporation which allege a violation of Paragraph (6a).

Dear Mr. Shoemaker
During the term of the 1984 Agreement, the parties developed a Motional Paid Educational Leave (PEL) Program which provided selected employees with a unique educational opportunity to enhance their knowledge oi the automobile industry. Sponsored candidates are approved in advance by the Center for Human Resources. Expenses and lost time for participants in the program are provided from National Joint Training Funds.
The jointly developed and administered PEL Program utilizes industry experts, university analysts and political officials to examine and discuss the economic, technological, and political forces influencing the future of the world-wide automobile industry. This innovative, jointly administered labor-management program has been enthusiastically received by attendees, and UAW and Corporation officials. Academicians, Governmental representatives, writers for world-wide news and trades publications have examined the program and view it as a positive step forward in the industrial relations process. A local version of the PEL Program has also been jointly developed and is currently operating at numerous locations. During these negotiations, the Parties reconfirmed their support of the Notional and Local PEL Programs and agreed, under the direction of the Executive Board - Joint Activities, to continue to explore methods of updating such information and sharing it

ORIENTATION PROGRAM
DELPHI CORPORATION
September IB. 2D03
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director
General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 Bast Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The parties have long recognized the importance of providing orientation programs far new employees. Many of these programs resulted from the diligent efforts of plant employee groups and have addressed such topics as quality, teamwork, safety, and joint programs in addition to those items new employees must know to perform their jobs.
"Men and women enter the work force today with little or no knowledge of what is expected of them as employees and as union members in a unionized, industrial plant community. Many of them have not been adequately prepared to cope with industrial situations in which they suddenly find themselves.
"New employees come to Delphi Corporation with little' or at best incomplete information about their employer and their union. They have little knowledge of the -extensive economic benefits available to them as agreed upon in’collective bargaining between theUAW and Delphi Corporation over a period of more than ■ thirty years.	•1	• ,
"Many new employees may be unaware of the commitment of Delphi and the UAW to fair employment practices and to the application of the National	. -
Agreement to all employees without regard to age, race, color, sex, religion; national origin, disability or sexual orientation. They are not familiar with basic contract provisions covering such subjects as transfers,
415
ORIENTATION PROGRAM
promotions, shift preference and seniority. They may be unaware of the opportunities far advancement to highly paid skilled trades fobs through the Apprentice and E1T programs. They tend to be unfamiliar with the obligations of the employee to his job, to the union and to his employer. Many are unaware of the importance oi regular attendance, quality workmanship and the need lor cooperation by all in getting the job done. Too often they are unacquainted with the various procedural matters related to their job and their relationship to their union and their employer.	.
"New employees usually have little knowledge of the long history of the UAW and of the administrative structure of the UAW at the International and local union levels. They do not understand about their relationship to the union, about the initiation fees and dues requirements and their rights within the union contained in the UAW Constitution and guaranteed by right of appeal to the Union's Public Review Board.
"Frequently, they have never seen the inside of a manufacturing plant before and are unfamiliar with the operations, the nature of the product and how it is used,"
In this regard, the parties agreed to supplement local plant programs by providing a national New Employee Orientation Program through the auspices of the Center for Human Resources. The program will be developed by a joint study team of UAW and Delphi representatives and technical consultants. The focus of the program will be on national materials that explain the respective roles of Delphi and the UAW, the state of the auto industry, the changing composition and diversity of the work force, the negotiated joint programs, and how employees. Management, and the Union work together to foster employee well-being and Corporation business success which benefits both employees and communities.
The national program ensures uniformity of message and treatment. Throughout the development of the orientation program, the Center for Human Resources
416
l
ORIENTATION PROGRAM
will obtain broad-based feedback from divisions, plant and Union representatives to ensure the program best meets the needs of its customers. The program will be made available to requesting locations, including appropriate support on how to deliver it most effectively. It is anticipated the national program will be packaged in a self-contained module to provide local parties the flexibility to incorporate it into their ongoing local orientation programs as they deem appropriate. Locations should make the program available to new employees within a reasonable period of time. The national program content will be kept up-to-date and the program will be evaluated periodically to ensure it is meeting its goals. Training will be provided as needed to Corporation and Union representatives from each location responsible far administering the program.
Development and promotion of the national New Employee Orientation Program shall be funded through the UAW-Delphi National feint Training Funds.
Ongoing costs incurred at each location may be funded through Local Training Funds. Local parties may request funding for ongoing program costs from the Center for Human Resources, as necessary.
The New Employee Orientation Program shall not he subject to the Grievance Procedure nor in any way limit communications by the Corporation with its employees or by the Union with its members.	.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
Delphi Corporation and the International Union express their determination to work jointly with personal problems including substance abuse and mental health among Delphi workers and their families.
Alcoholism and drug dependency is recognized by medical, public health authorities, Delphi Corporation and the UAW as a disease. These diseases can impair workers’ ability to function in their lives and on their jobs. Alcoholism and drug dependency as well as other personal problems contribute to increased absenteeism and tardiness and deterioration of job performance. This in turn disrupts work schedules with consequent dissatisfaction among the majority of workers who are sincerely trying to do conscientious jobs. The combination of factors is recognized as having a potentially damaging effect on plant efficiency and endangers the job security of the worker.
The causes of personal problems including alcoholism, drug dependency and mental health are not well understood and cures are difficult. Nonetheless, Delphi Corporation and the UAW believe that constructive measures are possible to deal with these problems which can be a major cause of family breakdown and are related to personal breakdown and violence in the community.
I.	Objective
The objectives of this joint effort are to help employees and their family members develop healthier life styles and enhance the effectiveness of the workforce. Further the purpose of this program is designed to help prevent the development of personal problems and provide access for treatment and after care for those already affected.
418
i
Delphi Corporation and the International Union acknowledge that neither focal management nor the local union working alone can always provide the level of motivation required by employees experiencing personal problems. As a result, joint efforts are imperative in encouraging the employee to seek EAP services, as needed, to respond successfully to treatment, and to maintain a resolve to avoid further personal problems.
II.	Guidelines for Administration
Responsibility for directing and coordinating these efforts will be the principal function of the National Wbrk/Family Program Committee. The Committee will be comprised of an equal number of representatives from the respective organizations and will be co-chaired by the Vice President, Human Resources Management for Delphi Corporation and the Vice President and Director of the GM Department of the UAW, or their designated representattve(s). This Committee will engage in joint efforts and function administratively in consultation with a Work/Family Committee comprised of local management and local union personnel which will review the efforts of the local Work/Family team on a regular basis. The Committee will meet regularly for the purpose of reviewing the administration and operation of the UAW-Delphi Employee Assistance Program, resolving issues not otherwise resolved and providing direction and consultation to local Work/Family Committees.
The National Joint Program Administrators, the National Benefits Administrators and ‘CDR Representatives will meet periodically to discuss issues impacting EAP program administration. In this regard it is important to:	.-
1.	Generate a climate at the plant level which will eliminate the effects of the social stigma associated with
419
j
mental disorders, alcoholism and drug dependency, and other persona) problems which act as a barrier to employees seeking help to resolve personal problems;
2.	Insist that local management and the local union at all levels exercise their best efforts toward the abjective of earlier identification and motivation of the employee to accept EAP services;
3.	Assure confidentiality in working with the employee;
4.	Assist in developing educational and informational materials for use at the plant level.
(II. Local Employee Assistance Program Administration
The local Work/Family Committee consists of the Plant Manager or a designated Management representative, the Plant Personnel Director, the President of the Local Union and the Chairperson of the Shop Committee. It will be the responsibility of this Committee to review on a periodic basis the local Employee Assistance Program. .
Delphi Corporation and the International Union will designate representatives of local management and representatives of the local union to work jointly on these problems. Among the responsibilities of the local Work/Family team are:
1.	In cooperation with the central review organization (CRO), the carrier and the local central diagnostic referral (CDR) agency, survey community resources to determine the availability of appropriate treatment facilities and die cost of treatment. Where facilities are inadequate or unavailable, undertake efforts to improve the situation.
There will be an assessment by a CDR within 24
420
hours of a Work/Family representative’s direct referral resulting from a medical emergency. While tire parties recognize the value of providing timely assessments, they also recognize that there may be situations where the 24-hour assessment does not occur. On a case-by-case basis, the joint parties will review such situations and undertake efforts to improve the situation.
2.	Help employees understand that they may consult on a confidential basis with the local Work/Family team, or an outside central diagnostic and referral (CDR) agency, concerning the employee's problem.
3.	Arrange for the local union benefits representative to be available to explain to the employee and others who may be involved the extent to which recommended treatment qualifies for payment under the Delphi Health Care Program.
4.	Establish and maintain active aftercare and follow-up programs. Help employees understand the therapeutic benefits of self-help groups and engage EAP participants in these group activities.
Delphi Corporation and the International Union acknowledge that:
1.	Nothing in this statement is to be interpreted as constituting any waiver of Management’s responsibility to maintain discipline or the right to invoke disciplinary measures in the case of misconduct which may result . from or be associated with the use of alcohol or drugs or personal problems. The union may exercise its right to process grievances concerning such matters in accordance with the Delphi-UAW National Agreement;
2.	During or following treatment the employee should not expect any special privileges or exemptions from standard personnel practices; and
3.	When a leave of absence is necessary so that an
421
i
employee may undergo medical treatment for alcoholism or drug dependence or personal problems in or from an appropriate facility in accordance with this program, and when the employee has voluntarily submitted to such treatment and provided the employee has unbroken seniority, sick leave of absence will be granted pursuant to the National Agreement and the employee will be eligible for benefits in accordance with the Delphi Health Care and Life and Disability Benefits Programs as negotiated with the International Union.
IV. Additional Understandings
During the course of 1996 Negotiations, the parties held extensive discussions over a wide range of EAP subjects. The following represents the highlights of those discussions and the commitments arrived at-between the parties:
1.	A key ingredient in combating personal problems lies in education, early identification and early intervention. Accordingly, the National Work/Family Committee has developed a comprehensive education and training program directed at all levels of local management, local union, and the work force. Administrative costs of the program will be funded by the Executive Board-Joint Activities. .	,
2.	The National Work/Family Program Committee through a series of meetings, with input from Work/Family Representatives in the plants, has developed Standards for UAW-Delphi Work/Family Programs. Those standards are incorporated by reference into the terms of this Memorandum, including revisions or modifications the.parties may make in the future. Problems related to the implementation of these standards will be brought to the attention of the Center for Human Resources, Work/Family Program Staff for resolution.	.	.	-
422
3 The National Work/Family Program Committee will continue efforts towards facilitating the professional development of individual plant Work/Family Representatives. UAW appointed Work/Familv * representatives mav pursue a mutually agreed upon EAP Certification recognized by the National Organization of Competency Assurance (NOCA).__________The NOCA
certification will be added to the UAW-Delphi Work/Family Program Standards.
Additionally, the parties will identify a new internal or external association for Work/Family representatives,
V,	Work/Family Representation
1.	Work/Family Representatives will be scheduled to report for Work/Family representation purposes during overtime, part-time or temporary layoffs, or inventory when 50% or more of the people they represent on their respective shifts are scheduled to work.
2,	During overtime hours, when less than fifty percent (50%) of the people they represent on their respective shifts are scheduled to work, they will not function pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding, but will be scheduled to perform Work/Family Program activities if they would otherwise have work available in their equalization group.
VI.	Drug Testing '
Because of the recent emergence of a substantial body of legislation requiring drug testing of many of the Corporation's employees, both represented and nonrepresented, the parties have had extensive discussions surrounding drug testing and have agreed to the following;
1. All drug testing performed will be conducted in accord with applicable laws mandating or regulating such testing; such as. Federal Aviation Administration,
423
Department of Transportation, or Department of
Defense.	'
VII. Conditions of Employment Guidelines - For those Employees In the Employee Assistance Program Whose Seniority has been Broken
When Employee Assistance Program participants or other employees suspected of being in need of EAP services return to work, the following can be agreed upon between the bargaining unit representative. Labor Relations, the Work/Family team and the employee.
The specific items to be included will depend on the individual case and should be developed to meet the particular circumstances. Accordingly, items one through five may be recommended for inclusion in a condition of continued employment by the joint Work/Family team.
1.	Participation in in-plant self-help meetings. Length of participation that will be required and frequency of meetings can be cither specified in advance or left up to the discretion of the Work/Family team.
2.	Participation in outside self-help groups and mandatory completion of an aftercare plan which might include antabuse recommended by a treatment facility and monitored by the Work/Family team.
3.	Mandatory cooperation in follow-up and monitoring for a period of time specified by Work/Family team members,
4.	Periodic scheduled urine screening when it is fell this procedure could be of value in monitoring and encouraging abstinence. In cases of positive findings, the results must be confirmed by a second testing method.
424
5.	A specific period of total non-use of alcohol or other drugs can be agreed to between the parties. The Work/Family team and the employee must concur with this probationary period which is defined as not less than six months nor more than two years and it must be understood by all parties that resumed usccould result in termination of employment during this period.
The above items (one through five) will be administered jointly by the Work/Famiiy team for those employees returning under these conditions. Any conditions of continued employment agreed to by Management, the Union and the employee are considered contractually binding and non-compliancc could result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The employee’s previous disciplinary record and action which may be taken for further misconduct will be matters reserved to the actual settlement of any grievance(s) involved and/or will be resolved between the bargaining unit representative and Labor Relations.
The seniority status of the employee must be specified as either a new hire or reinstatement of former seniority. If seniority is reinstated, all rights and privileges which would normally accrue in line with the reinstated seniority under the terms of the national or local agreement must be granted.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING QUALITY NETWORK
During the course of prior negotiations, Delphi Corporation and the International Union, UAW, held extensive discussions about the quality of our products and services. There is ongoing recognition on the part of both parties to the National Agreement that the cornerstone of job security for all Delphi Corporation employees is the design, engineering, and manufacturing of the highest quality, customer-valued products and services. This is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality, both on the national and local levels, exemplified by the formation and institution of the UAW-Delphi jointly developed Quality Network process. The Quality Network process is Delphi Corporation’s only Total Quality Management System utilized at UAW-represented locations.
Further, the parties recommitted themselves to the ongoing implementation of the Quality Network. This jointly developed quality improvement process emphasizes customer satisfaction and enthusiasm, continuous quality improvement, and elimination of waste in die design, engineering and manufacturing of products and services provided.
During the past several years, the Corporation in cooperation with UAW leadership, together with the men and women of Delphi Corporation, have worked together within a spirit of teamwork to improve product and service quality. This spirit of cooperation has resulted in substantial improvement in the quality of the Corporation’s products and services.
The parties recognize that the design, engineering and manufacturing of the highest quality, customer-valued products and services is essential to secure the Corporation’s position in the global market and assure
426
job security. The Corporation stated that high-quality products and services have to be the result of a total quality improvement process if Delphi Corporation is to “Be Recognized By Our Customers as Their Best Supplier!”,
Accordingly, Delphi Corporation's process for total quality management is the Quality Network-the one process for total customer satisfaction and enthusiasm utilized at UAW-represented locations. Although Management has the ultimate responsibility for the Quality Network, it is recognized that UAW leaders and members are valuable partners in the development of the process, the action strategies, and its implementation plans. ,
This relationship is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality, both tm the national and local levels, exemplified by the institution of quality councils at appropriate levels throughout UAW-Delphi.
It is recognized that the point where product design, technology, process and materials come together and must work in harmony is at the worker/supervisor level in the organization. High-quality products and services result from a well-managed process that motivates employees to work together within a spirit of teamwork to continuously improve customer satisfaction and enthusiasm. In this process, it is recognized that seeking opportunities for continuously improving product and service quality must be the foundation for customer satisfaction. It is acknowledged that it is ultimately Management's responsibility to establish and assure product and service quality requirements. Further, it is Management's responsibility to provide the processes for continuous quality improvement that support all employees based on the Beliefs and Values, as recorded in the Delphi Business System Policy Manual
427
referenced as “Quality Network*'(re vised 6/1/031. This manual outlines specific policies to be followed throughout Delphi Corporation and states in part:

428
It is recognized that performance of high-quality work is everyone's responsibility and, as a result, it is intended that the Quality Network Representatives and UAW leadership working together with local management will reinforce other ongoing quality improvement activities.
The parties also discussed the necessity for all Delphi employees to take individual responsibility for product and service quality. Management's business planning process will include the necessity for providing employees with the appropriate training, methods and systems, materials, and equipment in an appropriate environment based on the Quality Network Reliefs and Values to perform their work. It is then incumbent upon employees to exercise diligence and properly perform their work to produce the highest quality, customervalued products and services. .	.
It is only through personal commitment from every Delphi employee to provide the highest quality, customer-valued products and services that we will satisfy our customers and maintain Job security for all. Quality Council leadership at all levels within UAW-
• Delphi will review and apply the training and principles set forth in the Quality Network Environment Action Strategies to assure the necessary level of understanding to lead this effort.	'
The general guidelines for the parties to provide additional support to employees in this quality improvement process are as follows:
I, Quality Network Structure	'
The following represents the Quality Network Structure:
A« The UAW-Delphi Leadership Quality Council is co-chaired by the Delphi Corporation's Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President and the Vice President and Director of the UAW General Motors

In many cases, these activities resulted in UAW-represented GM employees being placed in a JOBS Bank under the terms of the 1990 GM-tMW National Agreement, The Union leadership felt they could not be party to asking their members to assist in "working themselves out of a job” by supporting these efforts. In anv joint effort. ;ob security and "people issues” had to be considered so that people wquM be redeployed to meaningful work. The issue was discussed at the January 13. 1992, .GM Quality. Council l.curicnily referred to as the UAW-GM Leadership Quality Council) meeting resulting in specific commitments to integrate synchronous efforts into the joint Quality Network Process and explore ways to employ people more effectively with meaningful work and help improve the business.
438
When funding for the JOBS Bank was exhausted and the program discontinued. Management recognized that employee support and involvement in plant quality and productivity improvement activities were essential. As a result on March 2. 1993. after the JOBS funding was exhausted and employees in the JOBS Bank were laid off, an “Employment Policy" was made effective which resulted in employees being, retained alwork and not laid off whertsuch employees were impacted bv jointly initiated product quality and operational effectiveness improvement efforts	'
During the 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed the above events and the Union provided examples of successful redeployment processes._______________These
redeployment processes, implemented at divisions and plants, resulted in peoplebejpg retained at work and redeployed to meaningful assignments after they had been made available as a result of quality and productivity improvements and other initiatives.
Following 1993 negotiations, the parties agreed to jointly develop guidelines for redeployment processes, similar to those reviewed by the panics, to assist plant and staff locations with planning for redeployment opportunities. Such guidelines were intended to assist the local panics with the development of plans that put first emphasis on redeployment of employees to meaningful assignments, which included regular productive assignments and “non-traditional" work, as well as efforts to competitively retain or insource new work.
Accordingly during these negotiations, the parties again restated their intent to not place employees in underutilized or unproductive assignments or only Contemplate cnlizatjop of the job security provisions of the National Agreement. Further, the parties agreed to reissue the document “Guidelines for Redeployment and
439
Meaningful Work” (QN-225D. Following the effective date of this agreement, a survey will be conducted by the Co-Directors of the UAW-Delphi Leadership Quality Council Support Staff of all Delphi-UAW facilities to determine-the extent of compliance with this provision of the agreement. The results of this survey will be communicated to the respective-Divisional Quality Council Co-chairs. Thereafter, the Divisional Quality Councils will work together to be certain all plants and staffs have a redeployment plan in place and have communicated such redeployment plan to affected UAW-represented employees.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The UAW and Delphi have worked together tor many years to understand and promote diversity in the workplace, a goal we absolutely agree on and are fully' committed to. The parties have long recognized that diversity is the collective mixture of our similarities and differences. Both organizations recognize that diversity includes race and gender, as well as broader dimensions such as family status, religion, sexual orientation, education, abilities, disabilities, military status, union, non-union, language and many others.
Diversity is a positive asset to an organization because only by leveraging our diversity will we be able to achieve the kind of relationship that we know is necessary if Delphi Corporation is to prosper and provide good jobs that allow employees, both union-represented and salaried, to be secure in today’s complicated world.	•
Our vision is to have a workplace that naturally enables the people of UAW-Delphi to fully contribute and achieve personal fulfillment. The UAW and Delphi continue to support and integrate the many voices of diversity, increasing our appreciation of cultural differences, beliefs, values, abilities, disabilities and sexual orientation. The UAW and Delphi work together at the national and local levels to develop and deliver diversity training. The principles that guide UAW-Delphi Diversity Initiatives include:
453
commitment™ diversity
—	creating a learning organization;
—	seeking diverse input and involvement;
—	leading the cultural change process; and
—	pursuing continuous improvement in diversity actions and programs.
The National Equal Application Committee works with local Plants to provide educational materials to the UAW'Delphi workforce regarding diversity and equal employment opportunities. They also identify community agencies involved in civil rights and diversity activities and work with community leaders to discuss and work towards solutions to mutual problems regarding discrimination. Action plans can be developed to include such activities,as;
—	utilizing plant communication methods to celebrate cultural diversity and share the UAW-Delphi joint commitment to diversity;
—	seeking input from identifiable diverse employee groups and individuals;
—	identifying opportunities to celebrate diversity with educational awareness events and exhibits;
—	communicating how diverse employee groups can participate in plant and community projects; and
— recognizing activities that are inclusive of diverse employee groups.
Very truly yours,

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The UAW and Delphi Corporation recognize the need for a focused career development process for active and dislocated employees as a key element in	,
competitiveness and employment security. The career development process must address both internal career needs of individual employees and critical skill needs of the company. A focused approach beginning early in each employee's career and continuing throughout their career could provide the employee with the skills and knowledge required by changing business conditions.
The parties have, therefore, agreed to continue to refine the pilot program containing the following principal elements:
1.	Voluntary individual employee assessments to determine interests, abilities and career development needs which may be met internally through a broader variety of on-the-job training, classroom technical training, training in basic computational skills and reading and writing, classroom training leading to a special certification, associate or baccalaureate degree.
2.	A career development process for hourly employees which may provide for broad job experience.
3.	Cooperation with community college, college, university and other educational and training l facilities in the community in the development of
456
CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
career focused classroom and cooperative training programs for active and dislocated Delphi workers.
4.	Exploration of the development of career focused classroom and cooperative work programs for
'	dislocated workers which would lead to comparable employment.
The parties agree that the evaluation of the initial pilot. location resulted in recommendations for several changes in the program. The recommended changes, deemed to be appropriate by the parties, will be made to the program. The revised program will then be offered at an additional location(s) and the parties will continue to evaluate its success. Thereafter, an implementation strategy will be developed and presented to the OAW-Delphi Joint Skill Development and Training Committee for their approval.
The above program will be supported by a combination of national, local and plant training funds and will be jointly administered by the Center for Human Resources and the bocal Joint Activities Committee(s).

Dear Mr. Shoemaker; '
During the course of these negotiations, Delphi and the International Union. UAW agreed that the letter of November 22.1976 regarding expeditious grievance . handling would again be published. During these negotiations, the Union cited various examples of situations where continuing liability cases were not processed in a timely manner. In this regard, the parties emphasized that full implementation of this document would result in the timely processing of continuing liability cases. Accordingly, the parties re-emphasize the following;
"During 1976 negotiations, the Corporation and the International Union again discussed at length problems encountered in the administration of the Grievance Procedure at some locations. The parties reaffirmed their mutual determination that the purpose of the Agreement as stated in Paragraph (5) is 'to provide orderly collective bargaining relations between the Corporation and the Union, to secure a prompt and fair disposition oi grievances, to eliminate interruptions of work and interference with the efficient operation of the Corporation's business.' In addition, the Union and the Corporation agreed that the delaying or holding of grievances at any step of the Grievance Procedure was contrary to the best interests of the employees and the parties.
"The parties reaffirmed their mutual desire and
458

intention to assure that grievances will not be allowed to accumulate at any step or steps in the Grievance Procedure In any plant.	-■
"The Corporation asserted that Paragraph (34) together.with the other relevant provisions oi the Grievance Procedure if closely administered make it impossible for committeepersons unilaterally to ' stall any grievance from consideration or decision at the next step of the Grievance Procedure and to delay the processing of grievances in the procedure. The Corporation stated further that the current language provides Management with the right after a lapse of a reasonable time to initiate answers to grievances in order to prevent them from being delayed at any step in the Grievance Procedure."

Dear Mr. Butler:
During these negotiations, the Union reemphasized their commitment to resolve grievances in an expeditious manner. To that end, the International Union, UAW, informed Delphi Corporation that Leonard Woodcock's letter of December 14,1967 regarding expeditious grievance handling was again being published as a position of the International Union, UAW.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed at length the need to locus our current joint program representatives on specific programs designed to assist our employees and the management in implementation of an improved working environment.
Over the years, we have agreed to a number of different joint program representatives appointed by the Vice President and Director of the GM Department. UAW, and. in some cases, by the local management and union leadership at the direction of the Co-Chairman, Executive Board - Joint Activities to carry out and administer certain negotiated agreement programs in the fallowing functions:
•	Health and Safety
•	Joint Activities
■	Accommodating DisAbled People in Transition (ADAPT)
*	Work/Family Program
■	Human Resource Development
•	Joint Training
*	Quality Network
Each plant in Delphi Corporation, depending on employee population, may have employees assigned to the above functions. Each time new programs have been negotiated, people were assigned to perform the
462
JOINT PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVES
tasks associated with each program to the extent that we now have several well-trained experts in those holds. The parties recognize that over the years priorities have shifted and, as a result, there is a need to carefully analyze the programs that currently require increased emphasis, such as, work/family, health and safety, etc. As a result, the parties have concluded that these well;trained resources can now be deployed or reassigned to programs requiring special attention.
It is recognized that each plant location has its own unique culture and needs; therefore, the local joint leadership group (Plant Manager, Personnel Director, Local Union President and Chairperson of the Shop Committee) will determine where their current full time representatives will be allocated to best serve the employees of the organization. It is recognized that at some locations additional representatives may be required to perform tasks associated with the newly determined local focus and at others less, in any event, the total number oi new and current full time joint program representatives shall not exceed the number provided for below:
Number of
Plant Population	Representatives
Up to 200	1
201 to 400	2
401 to 600	.	.3
601 to 1,000	4
1,001 to 5,008	Ratto of 1:250
5,001 and above	Ratto of 1:275
In the case of bargaining units between 1,001 to 5,000 and 5,001 and above, the number of representatives in a given bargaining unit will be determined by the number of represented employees (active, temporary layoff and Protected) divided by the appropriate ratio number. Where the fraction of the result is .5 and above, the number will be rounded up to the next highest whole number and where the fraction is less than .5, rounded down to the whole number.
Nothing in this agreement limits or is intended to
463
JOINT PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVES
interfere with any local mutually agreed upon projects or initiatives falling outside the scope at this document that may provide additional staff resources to meet the specific objectives of the local parties.
Each plant has submitted a plan for deployment of these resources in accordance with specific guidelines issued by the National parties. All such representatives will be appointed by the Vice President and Director ol the GM Department, (JAW. Such plan will include the names and assignments for each of the local representatives assigned to Joint Programs and will be forwarded to the National parties for approval prior to implementation. Likewise, as individual plant needs and priorities change, the local parties are afforded the flexibility to submit revised plans for National approval.
When plant population changes occur which would increase or decrease the number ol representatives, such population changes must be in effect for a period of six consecutive months before such adjustment is made in the number of representatives, in which case such adjustment will be made at the conclusion ot the six month period. In the event such population change results from the discontinuance or addition of a shift, the opening of a plant, or the cessation of a plant's operations, the adjustment in the number of representatives will be made within the first twenty working days fallowing the first day such population change occurs. Other situations involving a sudden significant change in the number of employees at a location may be discussed by the Corporation and the GM Department of the International Union.
When a reduction or increase in plant population calls for a change in the number of representatives, the local parties will be required to submit a revised deployment of resources plan for approval. All representatives in either case will also be appointed by the Vice President and Director of the GM Department, UAW.
It is understood that the Representatives re-deployed in
464
JOINT PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVES
these locally determined areas ol special locus and attention may require additional training. It is agreed that such training will be provided through the Center for Human Resources subject to the approval of the Executive Board - Joint Activities.
It is agreed that such representatives shall function in accordance with governing provisions ol the Delphi* UAW National Agreement germane to their area of focus.
During overtime hours, joint program representatives in the areas of Joint Activities, Accommodating Dis Ab led People in Transition (ADAPT), Human Resource Development, and Joint Training will be scheduled to perform joint program-related activities if they would otherwise have work available in their equalization group.	r
Longer range, the Joint Program Representatives are eligible for promotion to higher rate jobs on their shift in accordance with Paragraphs (BBXaXl) and (63XaX2) of this Agreement provided they are the most senior applicant and they are capable of doing the jab. Joint Activities will establish a joint process aimed at effectively consolidating, simplifying, integrating, focusing and achieving better utilization of joint programs at the plant level.
The spirit and intent ol this document is to provide increased focus on joint employee programs and to more fully utilize the experience and talents of the representatives assigned to joint programs. The parties are committed to working together in a spirit of cooperation to improve our relationship and the effectiveness of our joint programs. The result of such cooperation will improve the working environment in our plants lor all Delphi employees.
Any problems relating to the implementation of this document may be raised by either party and it is
465

understood that any necessary modifications may be made by mutual agreement between the Corporation and the International Union.	■ ■

Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
During current negotiations, the parties reaffirmed their intent to continue the interpretation regarding ■ Paragraph (76) expressed in the content of the Louis G. Seaton letter addressed to Personnel Directors dated February 13,1969 as follows;
As a result ot a series of discussions between the International Union, UAW, and the Corporation, it

This provision, of course, is not applicable tb any employee laid off due to fluctuations in manpower requirements.
The parties also agreed that this interpretation is not retroactive. Accordingly, cases currently in the procedure involving temporary employees should be processed on their merits without regard to the procedural requirements of Paragraph (76).

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course of the cunent negotiations, the parties reviewed the Grievance Procedure provisions oi the National Agreement for the purpose of identifying certain problems that have been encountered under those provisions in processing grievances to arbitration. Generally, it was recognized that the procedure, as currently constituted, has worked well. At the outset of the 1979 negotiations, the number of open cases on appeal to arbitration was at the lowest level in many years despite the fact there had been an increase in the number oi grievances filed. However, the Union stated that some instances have occurred wherein grievances protesting an employee's loss of seniority, discharge or a series of disciplinary layoffs leading to a discharge, have met with delay in the procedure following their consideration at the Third Step and their resolution at the Umpire Step.
In view of the above, the Corporation agreed to provide the Union with a monthly summary of appeal cases open on the Umpire's docket protesting the loss of seniority, the discharge of employees and also those protesting progressive disciplinary actions which involve an employee whose discharge is also under protest in an open appeal case. This information will enable both the International Union and Corporation Umpire Staffs to monitor the number of such cases an appeal to the Umpire at any given time and to take remedial action on any particular cases which may be subject to undue delay.
468

tn addition, the parties agreed to schedule regular meetings between the respective Umpire Staffs to establish future scheduling, to explore alternatives that could increase the frequency with which plant appeal cases are addressed and to review other problems of mutual concern.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed the Union's contention that, at same plant Locations, an excessive number oi Management representatives are present during some disciplinary interviews. The Union recognized that there are times when more than the customary number ot Management representatives may be required because oi their knowledge oi the matter under discussion.

As a result of these discussions, the Corporation advised the Union that, as a matter oi policy, Management personnel beyond those referred to above would not attend such interviews solely for the purpose of serving as potential witnesses to the interview itself. Additionally, should Management representatives in excess of the customary number be present in the interview, the district committeeperson may request, during that period of time, the presence of the zone committeeperson for that zone, or in the event that the

DELPHI CORPORATION
September 18' 2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jeff erson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current National negotiations, the parties ■ acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The ' parties also recognized that the maintenance of a ' ' stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the faregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties' view any attempt to reinstate a grievance property disposed of as contrary to the purpose lor which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles oi collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the General Motors Department of the International Union may inform the Corporation's Labor Relations Start in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the Grievance Procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is agreed, however, that the Corporation will not be liable for any claims tar damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either are ’ already barred under the provisions ol the National

REINSTATEMENT OF GRIEVANCES
Agreement at the time of the reinstatement of the grievance or that relate to the period between the time of the original disposition and the time of the reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims far damages against the Corporation in the Grievance Procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, State, or municipal agency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the Impartial Umpire or any other arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved and the Corporation and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights ar obligations of the parties under the terms of the National Agreement, except as specifically limited herein, and does not affect sections thereof that cancel f inancial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature oi any decisions by the Impartial Umpire or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this letter and the parties obligations io reinstate grievances as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.
It is agreed that none of the above provisions will be applicable to any case settled prior to December 13, 1976.	-

In that connection, we have adopted the following informal procedure for use in cases in which it is alleged that a settlement oi a work standards grievance, reached during negotiations in which a member of the GM Department of the UAW and a representative of the Divisional Labor Relations Staff and/or the Corporation Labor Relations Staff participated, has not been implemented in a timely manner, or that after Implementation the settlement has been violated:
1.	The complaint may be reviewed by the Chairperson oi the Shop Committee and Plant Personnel Director.

2.	If not resolved, the Chairperson may submit his statement of the case in writing to the Plant Personnel Director spelling out the details of the complaint.
3.	The Plant Personnel Director shall submit a written reply within one (1) working day of receipt of the written statement.
4.	It the matter is not resolved within three {3) working days after the Personnel Director's written reply, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may submit a written report of the disputed case to the General Motors Department of the UAW in which case the Plant Personnel Director, after notice by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee of such submission, will submit a written report to his Divisional Labor Relations Staff.
5.	If these parties are unable to resolve the dispute, it may then be reviewed by the General Motors Department of the UAWwith the Delphi Corporation Labor Relations Staff where it will be resolved.
This letter and this procedure are not intended to prejudice any contractual position either Delphi Corporation or the UAW may take in any case arising under the National Agreement.	'

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The relief time in automobile manufacturing plants on operations on which the employees' manual operations are continuous and which cannot be left unattended and for which the Corporation provides "tag" relief, and on certain other operations that the Corporation determines are likewise of such a nature as to give the employees no control over their work pace, shall be twenty-three (23) minutes before lunch and twenty-three (23) minutes after lunch on a regular eight (8) hour shift, making a total of forty-six (46) minutes. This will not affect relief allowance now in effect on certain specific operations due to environmental job conditions. The amount of such relief shall be modified accordingly for a shift other than a regular eight (8) hour shift. ’Die Plant Management may, by mutual agreement with the Local Union, allocate the relief before and after lunch to not more than two (2) periods before lunch and two (2) periods after lunch.
Sufficient labor will be provided to enable employees to obtain the above relief taking into consideration that the first hour at the start of ths shift and the first one-half hour after lunch are not ordinarily required for relief except in emergencies.
The parties have agreed to continue the following informal procedure to address complaints regarding this subject.
1.	The complaint may be raised by the Chairperson

During the current negotiations the UAW complained that procedures set forth in Paragraph (183)(d) are not being satisfactorily implemented by Management in many instances. -	,
This letter is intended to clarify the intent and purpose of this provision:
I.	The "advance discussion" except where time and circumstances prevent it, will take place "prior to letting the contract for the performance of maintenance and construction work." before any . decision has been made as to whether the work should be contracted out. The "advance discussion" will include information as to "why Management is contemplating contracting out the work." It is evident that except as noted above, since Management is only "contemplating contracting out the work" when the "advance discussion" takes place. Management should not -have made any decisions concerning whether ar not to contract out the work before such "advance discussion" is held.	.
2.	Management should advise the local Union of the "nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reason or reasons (equipment, manpower etc,}, why Management is contemplating contracting out the work,” This information is related to the letter dated December

Since any or all of these conditions may be entailed in the determination as to whether a particular contract should be let out or not, it is necessary that Management advise the local Union in the "advance discussion" concerning the item or items which are relevant to the decisionmaking.
3.	If in the "advance discussion" it is clear that Management is only '’contemplating contracting out the work" and if in addition all the pertinent information as noted above is supplied to the local Union, then local Union representatives will be given a better opportunity "to comment on Management's plans" and will also give an opportunity to Management "to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances."
4.	These advance discussions should include a Management representative of the Plant Engineering or Maintenance activities knowledgeable of the issues.
In addition the Union complained that in certain instances plant Management requested and contracted for maintenance service on leased equipment, and extended warranty arrangements or service contracts were being purchased which impacted the job security oi seniority employees in skilled trades classifications. Management stated that, while Paragraph (1831(b) covers the "fulfillment of normal warranty obligations by the vendor", warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided or the obtaining of service contracts are not covered by these provisions. Bather, such arrangements or service contracts covering work normally and historically performed by represented skilled trades employees are to be considered in the same manner as contracts for the

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations the parties discussed pre-apprentice training as one method of achieving our common goal oi bringing a greater number of members of minority groups and females into the apprentice ■ training program. It is evident that we share a serious concern about the establishment oi effective methods of achieving this desirable goal.
Accordingly, the Delphi-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee, upon determining that a plant's skilled trades workforce is under-represented by minority groups and females, will consider matters pertaining to pre-apprentice training as it relates to achieving the above objective as well as approve any such training program for which points can be awarded under the Delphi-UAW Apprentice Selection Procedure.

Dera Mr. Shoemaker:
Subject; Job Security - Apprentice Training and' Journeyman/woman Development
During these negotiations, the Union and the Company acknowledged that skilled trades personnel provide ’ vital support to operations, and that there is a direct relationship between the effectiveness of skilled trades personnel and the success and viability of the operations they serve. Establishing new levels of competence within the apprenticeable trades through training and retraining will permit the Union and the Corporation to pursue the critical objective of continuous improvement in quality, flexibility, operational effectiveness and, in turn, enhance job security.	'
Consistent with these discussions and in response to current skilled trades demographics, potential future 'retirements, and attrition, the Corporation has agreed to continue to place primary reliance on the Delphi-UAW Apprentice Program as the training source for future skilled tradesmen/women. Exceptions to this must be approved by the Delphi-UAW Skilled Trades
* and Apprentice Committee. Integral to this job security-related commitment would be actions to enhance the flexibility of both future apprentice graduates and current journeymen/women.
With regard to the expansion oi the Apprentice Program. Delphi intends to continue io indenture

apprentices Corporation-wide in the basic apprenticeable trades. These additional apprentices will be added during ths term o! the 2K0 Matronal -Agreement provided that qualified candidates can be found who meet all the selection criteria and	-
affirmative action goals can be met While the placement ot apprentices will depend on a variety of business condition factors such as attrition, technological changes, business sector performance, future product plans and product allocation, the general economy, and sales and market trends,'Delphi Corporation intends to pursue the objective to indenture (750) apprentices during the term of the 2003 Motional Agreement, and will make a good faith effort to increase the aggregate to (950). Bequests for apprentices, the rate of placement, and forecasted requirements will continue to be reviewed by the National Parties consistent with other understandings regarding skilled trades job security.
It is understood that in cases where the above goals cannot be met, or there is an immediate need for journeymen/women skills at a particular location, it may be necessary to hire Journeymen/women in place ot the apprentices agreed upon in this letter. In that case, the Corporation will inform the International Union of the number of Journeymen/women hired and the reasons. Also, in these discussions the parties reviewed the need to give priority consideration to the placement of laid off skilled tradesmen/women (Journeymen/women, E.LT.S. and Apprentices) as well as those currently assigned to Protected Status.
Furthermore, where changes in the type of operation, volume, product life cycle, ar other reasons, have caused an excess number of Journeymen/women in a particular Skilled Trade classification and placement in their trade classification is not possible, the parties will pursue, where feasible and practical, the retraining of Journeymen/women to qualify them in another apprenticeable Skilled Trade in either their home plant or another Delphi facility, consistent with established Employee Placement Procedures. Such retraining could be done within or outside the Delphi-UAW

Subject: Apprentice Work Assignments
To:	AU Personnel Directors
Plants Covered by the Delphi-UAW National Agreement
During the current negotiations, the Union raised the question oi apprentices being assigned to work alone. The parties agreed that good judgment and a rule of reason should be used when making these assignments.
As a result oi these discussions it was concluded that consistent with existing training methods and facilities in the plant, apprentices should not be assigned io perform work without a journeyman/woman being present unless the apprentice has been trained to do the job; has been instructed in the proper safety procedures; and is considered competent to perform the assignment. Experienced journeymen/women will generaUy be available to assist the apprentice in many of the normal floor assignments until that level of competence has been reached. This will not change or restrict any mutually satisfactory local practices.
Specifically, during 2003 Negotiations, the Union raised concerns regarding apprentices aligned to work alone on 'high risk" jobs, hi this regard- it is the Corporation's jptent to gssign wprk to apprentices consistent with ihe policy outlined above and, therefore, “high risk" lobs would not be an appropriate initial assignment to be performed alone. However- the definition of such "high rfsk fobs" is subject to the approval of the respective Plant Snfety Review Board.

Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker
This will confirm the understanding reached during the cunent negotiations that within a reasonable period after a laid off apprentice, Employee-In-Training or Employee-ln-Training-Seniority has been recalled to work at any Delphi Corporation Plant, such employee will be paid an incentive bonus in recognition of satisfactory completion of any related training courses, required pursuant to Paragraphs (14S1 and (180), in which the employee was enrolled at the time of layoff. In the event the employee is not recalled within a reasonable period of time, such employee may apply to the home plant for the related training bonus.
In addition, with prior Management approval and arrangements with the school, apprentices whom Management anticipates recalling to the apprentice classification prior to the expiration of the school term may be enrolled for one term and become eligible for an incentive bonus on the same basis.
This incentive bonus will amount to a figure to be arrived at by multiplying the number of class hours in each course times the employee's straight-time hourly rate less the amount, if any, paid to the employee for such related training prior to layoff.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations the parties discussed at length a problem encountered at some plant locations where emplayees-in-training and apprentices are in training to become journeymen/women in the same skilled trades classification and there is either a need for a reduction or increase in the number of such employees in a skilled trades classification.
The parties recognize the desirability of providing opportunities and training for employees through both the Delphi-UAW Standard Apprentice Program and the Employee-In-Training Program consistent with the needs of the business. To preserve the continuity oi the Apprentice Program, which has geneially been viewed as the long run source of skilled trades personnel in the apprenticeable classifications, the parlies have negotiated appropriate provisions in the National Agreement to avoid unnecessary interruptions of the program. The Employee-In-Training Program is equally necessary and has been continued by the parties to supplement the journeyman/worn an work force at times of increased work load and during shortages of skilled trades personnel. Importantly, the Employee-InTraining Program also provides opportunities for persons to upgrade their skills and provisions have been negotiated enabling employees-in-lraining to continue their training and achieve joumeyman/woman status.
496
LAYOFFS - APPRENTICES AND EMPLOYEES-IN-TRAINING
Employees-in-training may be reduced due to a reduction in force ot displaced by a journey man/woman in accordance with Paragraph ,(174} or by an employeein-training-seniority in accordance with Paragraph (175), Apprentices may be reduced due to a reduction in force or displaced by journeymen/women in accordance with Paragraph (140a). In addition. Paragraph (140b) provides that in the event of a drastic reduction in the level of work resulting in a heavy reduction in the skilled .trades work force, additional apprentices may be reduced pursuant to a mutually acceptable layoff and recall plan agreed upon by the local parties. Likewise, temporary layoff situations are governed by locally negotiated provisions pursuant to Paragraph (177).	,
Except for those situations covered by National Agreement provisions, the following procedure will apply to the reduction of employees-in-training and/or apprentices when neither journeymen/women nor employees-in-training-seniority are reduced from the classification;
•	Employees-in-training who have accumulated less than (2) years credited work experience in the classification in that plant will be reduced before any apprentice is reduced:
•	Employees-in-training who have accumulated (2) or more years of credited work experience in the
' classification in that plant will not be reduced before all apprentices who have not completed (4) periods of the shop training schedule have been reduced from that classification;
*	All employees-in-training in the classification will be reduced before any apprentice who has completed (4) periods of the shop training schedule is reduced.
The completion of (4) periods of the shop training schedule for apprentices and the credited work experience in the classification in that plant for employees-in-trainfng for purposes of this procedure shall be based on a calculation made as of the last

Ta:	All Personnel Directors
Plants Covered by the Delphi-UAW

During the current negotiations the Union complained about improper administration oi Paragraph (179} by local managements.	'
These complaints centered around the hiring ol skilled trades employees as journeymen/women without sufficient checking by local Management of the ’ documents presented by the applicants to assure they qualify Jar such status in accordance with the provisions af Paragraph (178). They also complained that in same instances Management shitted the blame ta the Union when such an employee had to be released because, upon further investigation, the information upon which Management relied to hire the individual did not meet the criteria of Paragraph {178),
In response to these complaints the Corporation stated it would inform local managements that when proof of jaurneyman/woman status is not clearly established, such documentation will be furnished to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the matter will be thoroughly investigated before an employee is hired. In this regard, it was observed that establishment of such proof of status is often expedited when the applicant is a laid off bona fide UAW joumeyman/woman. Additionally, the Corporation assured the Union that any explanation concerning the reasons a newly hired joumeyman/woman employee must be terminated because of failure to meet the requirements of Paragraph (178) is to be based on those factual reasons and not on the fact that the Local Union may have questioned the matter.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker;	■
During the course of the current negotiations, the parties agreed that the content oi the letter of October 8, 1987 regarding the anticipated termination at sick leaves would again be published as fallows:
During the 1979 negotiations, the parties discussed at length the Union's concern that certain employees on sick leaves oi absence were not made aware of the anticipated return to work date supplied to Management by the employee's personal physician.
As a result of those discussions the Corporation advised the International Union that as a matter of policy it would, effective January 1,1980 initiate a procedure whereby, in those instances where such information was submitted directly to Management by the employee's attending physician, an employee on a sick leave ol absence would be provided written notification oi the mast current anticipated return to work date designated by his attending physician. A copy of this notification will be provided the Chairperson of the Shop Committee.

Doc. No. 81 FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHOLDING
DELPHI CORPORATION
September 18. 2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214	•
Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
This will describe the methods to be used in regard to withholding of Federal income tax from employee's wages attributable to grievance awards, vacation pay and pay in lieu of vacation from employee's wages.
Grievance awards in excess of $500.00, but involving periods less than one calendar year, will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be calculated using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
Likewise, pay in lieu of vacation also will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be withheld using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
It should be noted that the tax withholding referenced above only covers the Federal withholding amount. An amount for FICA taxes and state or local income taxes, where applicable, will be in addition to the amount withheld for Federal income tax.
Grievance awards which are less than $500.00 will be aggregated with the regular payroll and the income tax withholding will be calculated on the total amount.
If a grievance award is made for a period of more than one calendar year, the income tax withholding will be calculated as if the payment were for a single annual period. Thus, in such situations, the annual percentage
520
FEDERAL INCOMETAX WITHOLDING
table will be used io calculate the income tax withholding lor such awards. This method would be the same as considering the award as having been paid equally over the preceding 52 weeks.
Far vacation payments made for time away from work, such payments will continue to be treated as a regular wage payment; i.e., income tax withholding will be calculated as if the vacation payment represented a regular weekly wage payment. ■ '
The above methods are dictated by Federal Income Tax Regulations. Therefore, any change or amendment io . such Regulations will, of necessity, have to be reviewed, for compliance with the above changes. ' . ’ ' : J
Formal procedures to effect these changes are being communicated to the Compensation' activity by separate letter, with instructions to make these changes as soon as practical.	■ '

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:	■	,	.. .
During the course of current negotiations, Delphi Corporation and the International Union, UAW reaffirmed the matter of Mr. Earl It Brambiett's letter of November 11,1970 regarding the problem of major plant arrangements and its possible impact on local agreements covering bargaining unit employees as follows:	-	.
During the course of the present negotiations. the International Union raised the problem of major ' plant rearrangement and its possible impact on local agreements covering bargaining unit employees.
The International Union specifically cited the alterations and rearrangements which took place at Saginaw Manufacturing, Saginaw, Michigan and Fisher Body Euclid Plant at Cleveland, Ohio. Al the Saginaw facility the total plant layout was rearranged, new machinery was added and the character of the plant was completely altered. The Fisher Body Plant at Cleveland experienced a drastic transition changing from an auto assembly plant to a trim manufacturing plant.
In each of the above cited examples, work assignments, seniority rights and wage rates, were drastically affected. In one case it required the local parties to negotiate a new wage agreement,
* seniority agreement shift preference and equalization of hours groups, as well as introduce a
522

new wage structure which in some instances obscured the former wage agreement.

Accordingly, the Corporation will discuss such situations with the International Union as far in advance as practicable.

OVERTIME POLICIES
Intor-Ocganizcrtian
DELPHI CORPORATION
Date:	September 18.2003 .
Subject: Overtime Policies *
To:	All Presidents •	■
Ail Personnel Directors -
As part at the current negotiations, Delphi informed the international Union, UAW that it is the Corporation's . intention to continue its previous policy regarding overtime practices. This policy will be applicable only to those employees who are not covered by the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Overtime.
There was considerable discussion in these negotiations about the claims of the International Union, UAW that too many employees who are required to work overtime over extended periods are not excused from overtime work assignments even though they have legitimate reasons to be excused.
The Corporation pointed out that overtime serves a number oi functions essential to the effective operation of Delphi Corporation tightly integrated and interdependent manufacturing system. In many instances overtime must be worked at one or more plants in order to permit other plants to meet their schedules. Emergency overtime to repair breakdowns in essential equipment is often necessary to prevent or minimize interruptions in plant operations and resultant short work weeks for many employees. Overtime is also necessary on bottleneck jobs and also during certain times of the year in order to meet product change deadlines and to satisfy fluctuations in customer demand tor Delphi Corporation products.
Both the International Union and the Corporation recognized that the nature oi the business requires overtime work assignments. In many instances, however, less than a full complement in a supervisor's group is needed to fill the jobs which are working overtime. When less than a full complement of
524
OVERTIME POLKXES
employees is needed it is usually practicable for the supervisor to excuse employees who do not wish to work and confine the overtime assignments to these employees who do wish to work.
In situations where there are sufficient employees available who wish to work overtime and who are capable of doing the overtime work assignments, employees who do not wish to work overtime are to be excused from doing so, insofar as practicable.
Employees who are required to work overtime should be given as much advance notice as is practicable so that they can make any personal arrangements that may be necessary.
An individual employee's personal problems in' connection with working overtime should be given careful consideration and such individual needs should be recognized. The individual employee's request to be excused from an overtime work assignment, when made a reasonable period of time in advance, should receive every possible consideration. When the request is granted the employee will be notified as far in advance as possible so that the employee can make personal plans accordingly. Thereafter, any cancellation or change in the arrangements to excuse the employee will only be made by mutual consent.
Except in situations of an emergency or crisis nature, an employee who is not assigned to a necessary continuous seven-day operation and who has worked thirteen consecutive calendar days will be excused from work on the next following Sunday provided the request for the day off has been made before the end of the employee's shift on the previous Friday.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed at length issues that have arisen regarding the application ot Local Wage Agreements in the Corporation’s manufacturing plants. The parties reviewed differences that currently exist in the Local Wage Agreements at such plants resulting from the different history of these plants, such as whether the plant was initially a BOP Division bargaining unit or separate Fisher Body and Chevrolet bargaining units that were subsequently merged into a single GM Assembly Division bargaining unit. These historical differences have resulted in some wage rate variations which the parties have attempted to address in previous negotiations. Likewise, plants engaged in various manufacturing operations have different Local Wage Agreement histories which resulted in classification structures that are not compatible with modern manufacturing methods and organisational structures.
In recognition that continuing improvements in the -employee's quality of work life, quality of the product, and operational efficiencies are necessary and desirable, the parties have explored various methods to improve the wage structure at the Corporation’s plants of the Car and Truck Groups and other operating Divisions.
The parties agreed that innovative wage agreements
532
INNOVATIVE WAGE STRUCTURE
could be instrumental in attaining these objectives and, accordingly, the National parties have agreed to work with and support any plant where there exists a mutual desire to explore such a concept.
Although not meant to restrict the full range of ideas and concepts which could be explored, the parties examined the concept af establishing three (3) non- . skilled rates in an assembly plant; sanitation/maintenance, production, and utility. It was understood that appropriate transter, seniority, shift preference, and other modifications are desirable and necessary to support such an innovative wage structure. This concept would be only one ol the options-available to a plant that desired to explore innovative wage structures. "Levels of Learning" or "Pay For Knowledge" systems would also be oplions to be considered.
If at any local plant there is a mutual desire on the part oi Management and Union to explore any such innovative wage agreement concepts, they are specifically encouraged and authorized to discuss and propose such modifications. The National parties will provide any necessary assistance to the local Union and the local Plant Management. Any final agreement shall continue to be subject to the approval of the National parties, who will review these proposals in line with the concepts outlined in this letter.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations. Delphi Corporation and the International Union, UAW, discussed the problem of "seniority slippage" under Paragraph (691 which inhibits bargaining unit employees from accepting assignments to till supervisory positions. It was recognized that in many instances it would be oi mutual benefit to the parties iar these employees to function in such positions.
Accordingly, this letter serves to confirm the agreement reached between the National Parties that:
1.	The transfer of any employee from a job classification in the bargaining unit to a supervisory position will result in the recall of a seniority employee from layoff status, if available, consistent with the provisions of the J.O.B.S. Program, and/or;
2.	The transfer of an employee from a supervisory position back to the bargaining unit does not result in the layoff of a seniority employee;
Paragraph (69) ol the National Agreement will be modified in the following manner:
(69) Any employee who has been transferred from a supervisory position to a job classification in the bargaining unit shall be credited with the seniority the employee had established prior to March 1.1977, all time worked in the bargaining unit subsequent to
534

March 1.1977, and all time worked in a supervisory position subsequent to the effective date of this	,

(a)	They previously worked cm a job classification in the bargaining unit./This shall also be applied to employees who were promoted prior to certification of the Union..	’
. : .i .	■ •
(b)	Their employment with the Corporation has remained unbroken.
Such employee may be placed on the job to which the employee's seniority would entitle the employee under the local seniority agreement, beginning with the last previous job the employee held in the bargaining writ; provided however, that if such last previously held jab is no longer in existence, the employee may be placed in accordance with Paragraph (590. In no event shall such employee be transferred to a bargaining unit job at a time when the employee has insufficient seniority to be so placed.
In order to assure accurate and timely administration of the conditions stated above in Paragraph (69) oi the 1999 Delphi-UAW National Agreement, the following procedures will be instituted:
1.	When any employee istransferred from the bargaining unit to a supervisory position, the Chairperson oi the Local Union's Shop Committee will be given a letter specifying the employee's name and the name of the seniority employee who is recalled from layoff status.
2.	When such supervisory employee, specified above, is returned to a job classification in the bargaining unit, the Chairperson of the Local Union's Shop Committee will be given a letter, notifying the Chairperson of such transfer back into the bargaining unit.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations the parties discussed the situation where an employee has applied for and been granted a vacation for a calendar week which contains a holiday as defined by Paragraph (203) of the Delphi-UAW National Agreement. The Union was concerned that if an employee was credited with a full week of vacation time off under this situation, the employee would not be able to receive the employee's full vacation time off as contemplated in the Vacation Entitlement Section.
The Corporation recognises the desirability of providing vacation time off up to the employee's eligibility for vacation entitlement as of the end of the current eligibility year. Accordingly, the Union was advised that in situations described above an employee would be eligible tor an additional day of absence for vacation purposes to be scheduled in accordance with local practice. This would not apply to holidays falling within the Christmas Holiday Period as defined in Paragraph (203).

Dear Mr, Shoemaker:
During the discussions that led to the 1990 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the parties held lengthy discussions regarding the Grievance Procedure and its proper implementation. Both parties acknowledged that the Grievance Procedure has worked well over the years in resolving problems when it was properly administered as outlined in the National Agreement.
The Union claimed that in some instances, the Grievance Procedure provisions have not been properly-applied relative to the intent of the National Agreement Specifically, the Union remarked that at some locations, grievances were allowed to accumulate at the various steps of the Grievance Procedure and/or were not answered in a timely manner at the lower steps ot the procedure. The Union further claimed that in some cases Management representatives were not available for or were unwilling to schedule regular grievance meetings. The Corporation stated their concern that at times, Union Representatives demanded answers to grievances before Management had an opportunity to investigate the charges contained in the grievance.
As a result of the foregoing, the parties reviewed the contents of Document No. 44 and Document No, 45 and reaffirmed their mutual desire and intention to assure that grievances will not be unduly delayed nor allowed to accumulate at any step in the Grievance Procedure in any plant. Furthermore, it was recognized that both parties have the responsibility to meet regularly on

grievances in accordance with the terms of the National Agreement and that such meetings should not be postponed or delayed unnecessarily In this regard, the parties agreed that complaints in this area will be handled under the provisions of Paragraph (Sa) of the National Agreement.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course oi the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern that some disciplinary interviews escalated into confrontation because tempers flared.
The Union suggested that in these situations a "Cooling Off" period would be beneficial to all concerned.
The Corporation and the International Union agreed that contemplated discipline should be discussed in a calm manner allowing for an objective evaluation of the facts. In those situations where emotions preclude this from happening, the parties agreed that as a matter oi practice and when possible such discussions should be postponed until such time that, in the opinion of Management, a constructive exchange of information could occur.
Notwithstanding the foregoing the parties recognised that certain actions such as assault, or other serious acts of misconduct would render the 'cooling off" period totally inappropriate.

“COOLING OFF" PERIOD
Additionally, it was mutually recognized that providing or not providing a "cooling off” period will be without prejudice to either party in the application of any terms of the National Agreement and will not be cited or relied upon by an employee, the Union, or Management as a baste for any claim.

SUBCONTRACTING communications
DELPHI CORPORATION
September 18.2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the recent negotiations, there were discussions concerning subcontracting which resulted from inadequate communication about such matters. As a result of these talks. Management reaffirmed the commitment which was made in the content of an A. S. Warren, Jr. letter to General Managers in 1887 that reads as follows:
During the current agreement we have experienced many labor relations problems in the plants in handling subcontracting matters. There were several five day letters and strikes and other major problems finally settled just short of the issuance of five day -letters by the UAW.
In many of these instances the root cause of the problem is lack of communication. Inadequate communication has occurred at the Divisional level with International Union representatives and at the local plant level as well. The Delpht-UAW National Agreement currently requires timely meetings in advance of the decision to subcontract work normally and historically performed by Delphi Corporation skilled trades employees. I am informed, however, that some meetings relative to major die construction and die tryout are not held at al! or not in advance of the subcontracting associated with the program.
In addition, plant level meetings with local union representatives relative to routine maintenance
552
SUBCONTRACTING COMMUNICATIONS
contracting are often held after the contract has been let and insufficient useful information is provided to the union for them to consider and make appropriate comments relative to Management's pions.
The Corporation intends to achieve world wide competitive status utilising not only the skills of our employees but also the suggestions and ideas of the people and the unions as io how work can best be accomplished at the lowest possible cost with the highest possible quality and on time.
This approach to managing the business should be utilised throughout the Corporation at all levels: production, skilled and technical. Obviously such discussions should be held in a timely manner with appropriate management and union personnel.
Accordingly, please assure that an appropriate representative of management in each personnel department is responsible for having adequate information about each subcontract for the performance of skilled trades work covered by the subcontracting provisions of the agreement. After determining that required discussions have been held this representative would approve the contract prior to its being let to an outside firm. This will require complete understanding and cooperation of our contractual requirements by the plant's engineering and purchasing personnel. '
The restructuring of the Corporation has resulted in different people and a variety of teams now having responsibility for advance model die construction. Please assure that all executives or others involved with product teams are made aware of our contractual requirements. A specific member of each team should be given the responsibility of informing the personnel director well in advance of the actual beginning oi die construction. The objective is to enable the personnel director to inform the union in advance of any impact on the bargaining unit in accordance with Document 59 in ths National Agreement.
There are numerous examples where complete,
553
SUBCONTRACTING COMMUNICATIONS
advance communications with the union and the skilled trades employees has resulted in important projects being completed on a competitive basis in terms of quality, cost and timeliness. The result has been a feeling of pride and accomplishment shared by the union, employees and the managers.
' A
Plant relationships can only be improved by open, frank communications in all areas, particularly in carrying out our subcontracting responsibilities. *-
The Strategy Board is in complete agreement that extraordinary attention must be given to our ' managerial responsibilities in this area. I have beeri ' assured by the international Union that we will have the hill assistance of the GM Department Staff in bringing about improved plant relationships when we have installed full, advance communications relative to business decisions involving subcontracting.
Furthermore, with regard to tool, die and represented engineering work, including prototype and pre-'	.
prototype work, several local Managements and Unions have implemented a process of advanced notification,.. review, and competitive analysis which has enabled . # the parties to consider and serve the interest of skilled tradespersons in job security, as well as Managements' needs for competitive and timely performance of this kind of work. Therefore, the Corporation and the International Union are in agreement that they will encourage other locations to implement this approach in order to avoid conflicts over the subcontracting of such work.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker

Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
The following is the text of Delphi Corporation written and published policy regarding sexual harassment.
"Delphi Corporation has had for many years a written and widely distributed policy on equal opportunity employment. Sexual harassment, as in the case of harassment based on age. race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability ar sexual orientation has long been regarded as a violation of this policy.
"AU employees are expected to deal fairly and honestly with one another to ensure a work environment free of intimidation and harassment. Abuse oi the dignity of anyone, through ethnic, racist or sexist slurs or through other derogatory or objectionable conduct, is offensive employee behavior. Sexual harassment also includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual fervors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
"Ail Delphi employees are entitled to a work environment in which wards and actions do not have even the appearance of disrespect Sexually-oriented jokes, cartoons, pictures, language, certain gestures and touching may be offensive to people and, therefore, may result in a hostile work environment. This type of conduct will not be tolerated in the workplace. Delphi Corporation facilities must be free of hostility resulting from sexually-oriented behavior. It is the responsibility of management and each employee to maintain an environment free of hostility.
555
DELPHI POLICY REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
‘‘As in the case oi other unfair employment practices, if you believe you have been subjected to sexual harassment, you may bring your concerns to the attention oi either your immediate supervisor, personnel director representative, or union representative, or you may utilize appropriate and. existing internal complaint procedures," '	‘
Delphi Corporation and the UAW are in agreement that complaints oi sexual harassment should be dealt with promptly and fairly under existing interna) procedures as provided under Paragraph (6a) of the National Agreement.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations the Union complained there has been inconsistent administration of the "normal warranty" provisions o£ Paragraph 183(b) oi the National Agreement. The Union indicated that plant managements insist on warranties beyond normal periods ot time and that our skilled employees are not assigned to the new equipment or machinery until lang after it has been in the plant. This does not provide the opportunity lor our own skilled trades to learn how to keep such equipment operating effectively.	■
The Corporation informed the Union that goad business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that the equipment purchased by the Corporation performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract.
The parties agreed that many locations through cooperative efforts such as assigning UAW-Delphi employees with vendors during installation and servicing, progressive training arrangements both onsite and offsite, etc. have resolved ail their problems attendant to this issue. The Corporation and the International Union encourage each local union and local management to pursue such reasonable working agreements.

During the course of national negotiations, the parties held extensive discussions on issues involving the TUition Assistance Program (TAP), One of the issues discussed concerned utilization of TAP benefits to . obtain educational credit for certain in-plant training. In this regard the parties agreed as follows:	'
In instances where employees, by virtue of their job assignment, are being provided with technical or professional training, the parties will jointly work with local recognized degree granting institutions to determine the possibility of obtaining credit for such training. Such credit would be applied toward recognized degree requirements only if the employee so desires. Additionally it is anticipated that costs for such credits will not normally equate to full credit hour charges at the institutions involved. Some examples of circumstances under which this understanding would be utilized are training programs associated with Health and Safety or Employee Assistance Program assignments and applicable Center for Human Resources developed Training Courses.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these National Negotiations, the parties discussed at length the necessity for the Corporation to become competitive in all aspects of the business. Among the issues discussed were the existing skilled trades classification structure, work rules, and past practices.	.
With regard to the skilled trades classification structure, the Union expressed concern over apprenticeable skilled trades classifications being consolidated. In this regard, the Corporation observed that it will not dictate consolidation of apprenticeable skilled trades classifications to its plants. The Corporation advised, however, that they intend to rely on the apprenticeable stalled trades classifications as the basis far our skilled classification structure moving forward. Competitive advantages of a review of Existing skilled trades classifications at any Delphi Corporation facility must be weighed and determined by the local parties in view of all attendant circumstances at that location, consistent with the intent otthe-Natianal Parties. Appropriate training plans necessary to accomplish any consolidations must be submitted in a timely manner for approval by the Delphi'UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee. Any exceptions to the above must be approved by the Delphi-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee.
With regard to work rules and past practice, the Corporation stated that many plants feel hampered in
579
WORK ASSIGNMENTS — SKILLED TRADES
their efforts to enhance competitiveness'in today’s environment by historically restrictive practices which originated at a time when competition was less threatening. Given recent improvements in the area of job security, the need for such stringent work rules and delineation of job responsibilities has been reduced.
Therefore, the National Parties concur that Local Management and Local Unions will be strongly encouraged to review existing work rules and practices, especially in the area oi Lines of Demarcation, to insure that only those necessary to protect the safety oi employees, the integrity of the skilled trades, and the efficiency of operation in today's competitive environment are carried forward. Incidental, overlapping, and other minor access type work is strongly encouraged and should be discussed and handled locally consistent with sound business judgment. To accomplish this task, the local parties will establish a lanes of Demarcation Committee, to meet on a regular basis, to address the issues outlined in this paragraph.	•
If either of the local parties feels that abuses of the spirit and intent of this document exist, it will request the issue be reviewed via plant entry by appropriate representatives of the GM Department of the International Union, UAW and the Delphi Labor Relations Staff.	’

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:	.
During the 1990 Negotiations, the Union expressed concerns relative to the assignment oi work at certain locations by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which the Union felt should have been assigned to the respective UAW bargaining unit, in this regard, the Corporation agreed to reissue the content of the B. P. Crane, Jr. letter dated February 20,1986 as fallows:
' The Corporation and Electronic Data Systems entered into a contractual agreement which defines the business relationship between the two entities. Under the terms bl this agreement, EDS has assumed world wide responsibility for the management, operation, provision and maintenance oi computer and information processing services, communication services and health care ■ administration activities tor Delphi. EDS remains and continues to be operated as an independent subsidiary of GM. Il is also the intent of the parties that the Delphi User Organization continues to be the customer of EDS.
As such, it is of particular importance to bear in mind that EDS, under the terms of this business agreement, remains separate and distinct. It becomes, in part, our responsibility to offer assistance in the.successful operation of this relationship. Specifically, this relates to our . acknowledging the fact that EDS is hot a party to our.. National and Local agreements with'the unions*
581
EDS WORK ASSIGNMENTS
representing Delphi Corporation employees. EDS does recognize the historical nature of Delphi job junctions and agrees that those job functions associated with manufacturing processes, which have been historically performed by Delphi hourly personnel, should continue to be performed by bargaining unit employees.
We can relate this io a case in point - the installation and maintenance of the new voice communication system. The role that EDS plays in this situation is the traditional role of the local telephone company. Structural preparation remains the responsibility of Delphi Corporation and is most often accomplished utilizing bargaining unit'employees. The other job functions associated with this voice communication system, in most cases, are not functions historically performed by our bargaining unit and are, therefore, the responsibility of EDS.
Also, our understanding concerning bargaining unit work does not limit the fulfillment of warranty obligations by vendors. Such warranty obligations ■ and/or other work performed by employees of an outside contractor, including EDS employees will be handled pursuant to the provisions ol the collective bargaining agreements pertaining to outside contracting, where applicable.
In summary, we have, had several meetings with ' EDS to discuss our mutual concerns. We have arrived at an understanding assuring the continuation of historical practices as they relate to Delphi Corporation job functions associated with manufacturing processes. We feel that this position is fair and will best accomplish our joint goals and recognizes the traditional role of bargaining unit employees.
As always, your comments and suggestions are appreciated. Please refer any questions to the Corporation's Labor Relations Staff.	"
During the 1993 Negotiations, the Union raised several instances wherein they fell that EDS misapplied the
582
EDS WORK ASSIGNMENTS
concepts outlined in the above letter, oftentimes when there was a change in local Account Managers, and specifically with regard to the applicable notification ‘ requirements outlined in the subcontracting provisions of the National Agreement. The Corporation observed that much of the work at issue is non-core in nature, but reiterated its intent to continue the concepts outlined in the B. P. Crane, Jr. letter.
Furthermore, necessary arrangements will be made to review these concepts and contractual commitments with all EDS Account Managers.
During the 1996 Negotiations, the parties discussed the ongoing relationship between the Corporation and EDS. The Corporation confirmed that EDS is no longer an independent subsidiary of CM.

During the current negotiations, the parties discussed and noted that in many instances the early indicators of an employee suffering from medical and personal problems such as those associated with substance abuse, for example, are manifested in disciplinary situations involving violations of the Shop Rules. In those initial stages it is generally the first line supervisor and the district committeeperson who are first exposed to the potential of such underlying causes behind employee behavioral problems.
Although the parties acknowledge Management’s responsibility io maintain discipline and to invoke disciplinary measures where violations of the Shop Rules occur, it is also recognized that local management and union representatives at all levels are necessarily charged with the responsibility to exercise their best efforts toward the objective of early identification of employees whose behavioral problems may be linked to medical and personal causes and to strongly encourage them to seek assistance. In many cases this could be accomplished through referral to the local Work/Family Program Committee.

Dear Mr, Shoemaker:
During the 1990 negotiations, the parties discussed both the Union's and Management's concerns about the scheduling ot overtime work in the Corporation. . ■
On the one hand Management recognized the	,
legitimacy of the Union's concern that production not be scheduled on a sustained basis on overtime rather than recalling laid off employees or hiring new employees. On the other hand, the Union recognized that die scheduling of overtime serves an essential purpose in * many situations in order to meet temporary or seasonal increases in sales, at new product start-up, and to make up for production lost due to factors beyond the parties' control, such as interruptions in the supply of parts. Also the parties recognize the need for overtime on vital tooling and maintenance projects which often must be accomplished quickly on tight time schedules in order to avoid interruptions or delays in production and layoffs of production employees.
As a result oi these discussions, the parties agreed to establish a procedure for regularly reviewing overtime work schedules. This review will be accomplished between representatives of Delphi Corporation and the international Union, UAW and will be designed to focus on those plants and facilities that establish a pattern of high overtime scheduling an a sustained basis. The review is intended to assure that overtime work is not scheduled at a plant on an ongoing basis in cases where there are practical and economical alternatives.
586
OVERTIME
The alternatives to overtime considered by the parties way include employment increases, innovative shift arrangements, or improvements or additions to the plant's equipment which could eliminate a bottleneck; or the parties may conclude that the reasons for the overtime are temporary or unavoidable and that there are no practical or economical alternatives.
The purpose al this review procedure is to assure a timely and thorough review ol overtime work schedules and provide for a balanced consideration of the interests of both parties.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations, the Union raised a concern regarding Management's active participation ' in the implementation oi the ADAPT Program (Accommodating DisAbled People in Transition -formerly lob Placement) at all UAW-Delphi locations. The parties agree this process was designed to enable employees with disabilities to be retained at work or returned to work from a sick leave or worker's compensation leave and be placed on jobs within their physical restrictions, while complying with applicable provisions oi the Local and National Agreements. The parties agree that documentation and confidept jalify are cornerstones for the successful implementation of the ADAPT Program at the jpeg] foye). Information contained in the ADAPT tile will be limited to the ADAPT-Team fUAW Document No. 46 and Management ADAPT Representatives), unless released by -naned authorization of the employee, or information is relevant to the Union's or Corporation's defense qgaipjt claims, charges, grievances, or litigation.	'
Furthermore, it is understood that although the ADAPT Program is a voluntary Program- each UAW represented employee with a restriction vyrittep by the plqpj medical department shall be sent to the local ADAPT RepraBeatgttxgajpxjm ADAETjnianiigw.

employee hers bean processed through the Program and deemed as "No lob Available Wither Restriction" (NTAWR) signed jointly by the local ADAPT Representatives.
The process will be administered at the plant level in accordance with existing National Guidelines.
The parties acknowledged that the proper . implementation al the ADAPT Program has successfully provided the mechanism for thousands of UAW-Delphi employees with restrictions or disabilities an opportunity to be either retained at work or return to work on meaningful jobs. It was agreed that emphasis must be placed on Step 3 (Conduct lob Search) of the 6 Step ADAPT process focusing on job modifications. Upon jindmos that reasonable accommodation cannot be made to the employee's norma] job (pursuant with the Local Seniority Agreement) or modification to that job-will cause an undue hardship to the Corporation. Jocqi Management will provide in writing o statement of unreasonable accommodation or a statement of undue hardship for th^emnloveesAD APT file, It was reaffirmed that members of the local ADAPT Committee keiisifiidig.£>LKeyJ^
Management and Union, are responsible for the successful implementation of the Program at their location. This is accomplished by taking an active role and by assigning and maintaining the necessary resources to administer the Program to meet the requirements of the Local and National Agreements. Therefore, it is theaesponsibilitv of the Ksy 4 ai each UAW-Delpht location to ensure thqt egcji plant establish, as a requirement of the ADAPT Program. a Disability Team consisting of the following:

In addition, other resources identified in the current

The parties agreed to develop and implement a computerized measurement system that will be inclusive of quarterly reoorts. cost analysis summaries. and field surveys. These reporting systems will provide the National Parties with the necessary information to ensure a common process is being used at all UAW-Delphi locations. The parties will also develop and implement g formal audit procedure. Details of the Audit Procedure will be clarified in thenewly developed implementation guide All UAW-Delphi facilities will be audited in conjunction with the Appendix.A. K. and/or L audits or other pre-existing audit processes. Facilities found to be deficient by the Center far Human Resources wi]l be notified in writing of deiiciencies and given a schedule date for compliance.
In addition, the parties agreed a further emphasis must be placed on making employees, both hourly and salary, aware of the ADAPT Program and the opportunities it provides for accommodating people with disabilities. This will be accomplished through annual-rollouts by the lopal ADAPT Team to the Key 4. the ADAPT Working Committee, and all employees with documentation as outlined in the ADAPT Training mqnual apd implementation guide. During the life oi this Agreement, a mailing of the ADAPT brochure will be sent to all UAW-represented employee's homes and provided to new employees during New Hire Orientation. To further ensure an employee's awareness of the Program. the_plant will also commit to providing awareness information through in-plant communications via videos, newsletters, etc.
The National Parties will monitor the Program and provide guidance and training. This will be accomplished by the development of a new training curriculum for local ADAPT Representatives qnd by recurrent (raining, at thg discretion of.the National Parties. In addition, the Disability Team will

Delphi Corporation will continue to specify that all new equipment be designed, built, and installed to limit employee perymql exposure levels to MRFs equal to or less than 0.5ma/m3 on a time weighted average. Also, the joint Partiss have developed a procedure to verify that this level has been attained at initial production start-up. and efloris have been made_to rpaintam this level alter production start-uo.

Ip th? went that personal exposure levels are cgnf gmed to bg gvpr l.Dma/m3 on g lime weighted average, Delphi Corporation will establish a priority to reduce these exposures. In dpipp so, the focus will be to utilise the most appropriate controls including such concepts as personal work enclosures.
In addition. Delphi Corporation reaffirms its strategy to control employee exposures to MRfs through th? pse of fundamental processing controls, engineering controls. exposure assessment, including annual plan! aerosol

'
In these negotiations, we have provided funding lor our joint programs which reflect this national policy of cooperative labor relations. We should continue to ensure that the projects, programs and events which are supported in whole ar in part with these joint funds do in fact keep us communicating on all levels, consistent with this objective.

JOINT ACTIVITIES FUNOS
- We agree these funds will continue to be used to help solve mutual problems which may not be collective bargaining problems. They will continue to be used to make Delphi Corporation and its employees more competitive in a global economy. In this regard, we jointly sponsor conferences, workshops, seminars and meetings to promote cooperative efforts on related subjects, and where appropriate, invite academic, professional, government, labor and industry representatives to attend and participate. In addition, we understand that while these hinds are intended for education, training and development of UAW bargaining unit employees, there are situations where it will be natural for some salaried employees to receive the same training or participate in the same program. Such expenses for non-bargaining unit employees may be funded with joint funds provided the parties agree.
Further, the jointly sponsored projects, programs and activities are designed to promote public awareness of Delphi Corporation products (including the quality and reliability of such products), Delphi Corporation workforce and its role in producing high quality products, and the relationship between Delphi and the collective bargaining representatives for Delphi Corporation employees.
We also recognize that as representatives of organizations such as the UAW and Delphi Corporation. which are viewed by most as key to the vibrancy of ■ many local economies and the national economy, we are expected to be responsible citizens and caring neighbors. Therefore, from time to time we have agreed to use these funds to assist the victims oi disaster or the less fortunate in the communilies where our employees live and work. We have also supported research projects or efforts by other training, educational or cultural institutions which will through education and exposure promote our goals of labor and management cooperation in the workplace.
We have pledged that these joint funds will continue to be used to enhance all our employees involvement in,
600
JOINT ACTIVITIES FUNDS
and appreciation for, decisions that affect their lives. We look io the UAW's continued cooperation in that regard in identifying and developing with us meaningful projects which will assist their members, and cur employees, in reaching that objective.
The parties further agree that new programs arid activities designed to enhance the welfare and job security of UAW-represented employees may be funded by the National Joint Skill Development and Raining Committee, when authorized by the Executive Board ■ Joint Activities under the provisions of the ■' Memorandum of Understanding Joint Activities contained in the Agreement between Delphi Corporation and the UAW.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker
Subject: Compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act at 1993
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) ol 1993. The Corporation assured the Union that it will comply with the provisions of the FMLA. '
As part oi its compliance, the Corporation has established a category of unpaid leave called "FMLA Leave." In some instances, FMLA Leaves will be concurrent with leaves of absence covered by the National Agreement. Accordingly, in those cases where the employee is eligible for leave under the National Agreement and the leave also qualifies under the FMLA, the Corporation intends to comply with the requirements of the FMLA as well as the separate provisions of the National Agreement regarding covered leaves of absence.
Pursuant to the Corporation's present plan for compliance with the FMLA, the Corporation’s rights under the Act will be modified to;
•	Provide that an employee on FMLA Leave will continue to accumulate seniority in the same manner as an employee on a Personal Leave of Absence;	■
603
COMPLIANCE WITH FMLA
•	Permit but not require employees to substitute vacation and/or excused absence allowance for unpaid FMLA Leave;
•	Provide that employees who are married to each other will be each entitled to a maximum cd 12 weeks of qualifying leave under the Act;
*	Provide that, when a third opinion is necessary under the medical certification and dispute resolution sections of the FMLA, the neutral provider will be selected jointly by the -Corporation and the Union, with the consent of the employee, from a list, provided by the appropriate local or state professional medical association, of board-certified specialists in the field of medicine in which the point of controversy exists: '
•	Continue Corporation-paid Group Life,	■
Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Disability Insurance during all FMLA Leaves that are not also Medical Leaves as if such leaves were Personal Leaves of Absence.
In addition, the Corporation's plan for compliance would:
•	Nat automatically designate and apply absence time that is compensated under the Sickness and Accident Insurance provisions of the Life, Disability and Health Care Benefits Program against an eligible employee's FMLA entitlement;
•	Use a calendar year as the 12-raonth period of the leave entitlement {for example: in 2000, an employee would be eligible for 12 weeks leave from January 1, through December 31.2000);
•	Hequire repayment of the cost of health care coverage provided during the leave from employees who fail to return from FMLA Leave to the extent permitted by law.
604
COMPLIANCE WITH FMLA
The Corporation may make changes in its compliance plans la reflect changes in regulations and/or subsequent court decisions and the gaining of additional administrative experience but without reducing leaves provided by the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Problems related to the implementation of this letter may be discussed by representatives of the UAW-GM Department, and the Corporation's Labor Relations Staff.

Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr, Shoemaker: .
The parties to this agreement recognise the critical impact outsourcing proposals have on the parties' relationship at both the National and Local level. In this regard, when potential outsourcing is under consideration, the Local Parties should have sufficient time to evaluate the proposal to insure that they have the opportunity to develop a plan to retain the work. During the discussions leading to the current Agreement, the sourcing process was modified to provide a more meaningful role for the Union in sourcing decisions through involvement in the request for quotation process. Under this process, which provides for earlier involvement, the Union will generally have as much time to evaluate methods to retain the work as the 150 day notification process provided under the 1993 National Agreement. In those instances where it is anticipated that less than 150 days will be required to complete the sourcing process, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee will be so advised.
However, in such instances where the Union believes that insufficient time has been provided for input into a

Subject: Supplier Corporate Citizenship
During these negotiations, the UAW stated its interest in having the Corporation continue to recognize the importance of using suppliers which are good corporate citizens and which can be relied upon lor quality products and reliable delivery. The UAW further pointed out that the Corporation's selection ot arid relationship with suppliers have a significant bearing on its relationship with the Union. In this regard, the Union stressed repeatedly the importance of the Corporation's use of high quality, reliable suppliers which maintain good, fair and equitable relations with their employees, and which satisfy the Corporation's need for a continuous, reliable and cost-effective supply of quality parts and materials.	. .
Delphi Corporation fully understands the Union's concerns in these matters, because quality products, uninterrupted delivery and good corporate citizenship -by the Corporation and its suppliers - contribute significantly to the Corporation's success in the marketplace, and all of these factors have a direct-bearing on the job and income security of UAW members.

Delphi Corporation agrees that its relationship with the Union is of paramount importance to the Corporation's long-term success. The Corporation has told its suppliers and the business community in the past ci the positive aspects of its relationship with the UAW and will continue to do so in the future. Delphi (Corporation. therefore, has no interest in embarking on a purchasing strategy that would detract from that relationship.
Correspondingly, the Union has, from time to time, expressed to the Corporation its concern about certain aspects oi the Corporation’s relationship with particular suppliers in the area of quality, continuity of supply, and overall performance as a supplier including the maintenance of good relations by the supplier with its employees. The Union recognizes that the Corporation has expressed its views and made suggestions to its suppliers as a result of the Union's concerns, all within the bounds of applicable legal principles.
The parties recognize that instances in which these matters arise are inherently dependent upon the particular facts that are present in each situation and plan to continue to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis as they have in the past, and in ‘ compliance with applicable laws.
In particular, the Corporation will continue to urge its suppliers to treat their employees in a good, fair and equitable manner to provide them wages and benefits competitive within their industry, to provide a safe workplace and to avoid conduct which violates national or state labor and employment laws. In addition, the Corporation will, in a manner which is in compliance with applicable laws, notify suppliers of the importance the Corporation places an harmonious relationships between suppliers, their employees and any union that may represent them.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker
Subject: Product Development and Transformation
During these negotiations the parties discussed various issues related to product development and product transformation. The Corporation and the Union recognize that future jobs depend on, among other things, continuing investments in product development. Shifting markets, changing consumer tastes, new governmental regulations, international harmonization of such requirements, and a host of other factors have a direct impact on product development and manufacturing. The products manufactured and services delivered must meet evolving customer preferences and demands at a competitive price.
The Corporation fully understands the Union's concerns relative to investment in new products and services, and that such investments, while absolutely necessary, may not alone guarantee good future jobs. New products require additional skills, spur changes in labor demand, and entail new sourcing decisions. The parties acknowledge that involving the Union at the earliest stages of the product development cycle is key to attaining job security while meeting the global challenges of improved quality, speed to market, product innovation, and lowering total costs. To that end, the Corporation has been, and continues to be, fully committed to working with the Union to seek and identify appropriate jointly developed technical training programs that will match new skill

requirements with evolving technologies, products and services, along with the implementation oi new programs to cushion unavoidable dislocative effects of rapid product transformation and development. The Corporation recognises that working together will help preserve and grow goad paying jobs for all current and future UAW-represented employees at Delphi Corporation.
In preceding National Agreements and during these negotiations, the parties have recognized the importance of the Union's role and involvement in the product development cycle and product transformation through provisions, such as Appendix L-Sourcing which provide a mechanism for early UAW involvement in the Corporation’s plans to proceed with a new or redesigned product.-To that end, it is understood and reaffirmed that early during the product development cycle, matters such as sourcing patterns, possible changes in component sourcing patterns, possible insourcing opportunities, and technology which may impact the represented workforce will be reviewed with the International Union in accordance with the provisions of Appendix L-Sourcing. Semi-annually, a £Qn^.deaiiglj.evlej«;wiUbeheld coaceming fatwre product.programs which will identify new , current or redesi.gnedJuture productsand technologies^Thess semi-annual meetings will be attended by the Chief TechnolQgy.Ofticer-OtUglphiCorporgtion.gndtheVice Prgsident.apd Director of the General Matars Department of the UAW. Such early and up-front involvement will allow the Union to continue to be provided with current and anticipated major product developments/producl transformations that are having, are expected to have, or could potentially have an effect on employment levels, such as projected changes in the major components far motor vehicles, in materials, manufacturing methods and design.
Further, the Union's early involvement during the product development process allows far discussions relative to issues with respect to components, ■ . materials, and manufacturing methods. In each case, the Corporation will indicate the extent to which

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ANO TRANSFORMATION
changes in specifications will be handled through the revamping of existing UAW-Delphi operations, by means of technoIogyresiding in other divisions of the Corporation or by outside sourcing arrangements.
Finally, it is recognised that Appendix L-Sourcing provides an avenue for discussions as early as practicable in the product development cycle relative to projected production volume of new materials, components, and products, and the potential impact, if any, on UAW-represented jobs.

Dear Mx. Shoemaker
During these negotiations, the parties had lengthy discussions regarding the implementation ol Paragraph (78a) of the National Agreement. The Union asserted that Management was repeatedly suspending employees without providing them with the opportunity to answer the charges that gave rise io the situation for which discipline was being considered. Management responded that the intent of Paragraph (76a) was to provide for this opportunity except in those cases where the employee being interviewed was either • unavailable or incapable (physically or emotionally} to effectively respond to the charges.
The parties also recognize that more than one interview pursuant to Paragraph (76a) may be appropriate where additional facts or information have been discovered.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current National negotiations, the issue of temporary employees was discussed at length between the Parties. The Union raised its concerns regarding abuses at many locations in connection with the use of temporary employees.
This letter confirms our discussions related to employees hired as temporary. In the event that a plant hires temporary employees without National Parties approval in accordance with Appendix A, Section VII, or in the event that a plant retains temporary employees past the approved period, such employees will become seniority employees. Temporary employees who become seniority employees under this provision will be given credit for time worked as a temporary.

STATEMENT ON TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS
During negotiations the International Union has claimed that certain work which is performed at some plant locations where the UAW is the certified bargaining representative of certain employees has been improperly assigned to non-represented employees of Delphi Corporation.
The Corporation is mindful of the Union’s concern regarding the scope and work content of job classifications of employees in the UAW bargaining unit and how such may be affected by advancing technology. Accordingly, the Delphi-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee will meet periodically to discuss matters concerning new or advanced technology that cannot be resolved locally and are referred to it by local unions or local managements as well as claims of erosion of the bargaining unit.
Since the first National Agreement of June 24, 1940, many necessary changes in methods and processes have had an impact upon the scope and work content of job classifications of both represented and non-represented employees.
Advancing technology has created, and will continue to create, new and more complex problems bearing upon the work content of job classifications of employees represented by the Union.
It is not the Corporation’s policy to assign to nonrepresented employees work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at a particular plant location. The Corporation recognizes that mere novelty or the sophistication of new technology alone is not grounds for withdrawing work from represented employees. Similarly, the Corporation does not believe that the
674
perimeters of the bargaining unit at a particular plant location should be expanded simply by the introduction of new technology. *
It is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of performing a work function including the introduction of computers, energy management systems, modem, art to part, too! cutting paths and fiber optics, CAM, CMM, CAE, 3D Visualization or other new or advanced technology will not serve to shift the work-function from represented to non-represented employees. Therefore,
1.	Where a work function at a plant location preceded the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was assigned at the time of certification, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
2.	Where a work function was introduced at a plant location following the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was originally assigned, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
The Corporation and the International Union are in agreement that the assignment of represented or nonrepresented employees depends upon the work function involved and not necessarily upon the work tasks required to accomplish such work function.
Notice and Discussion
•The Corporation agrees to advanced written notification to local unions at locations planning the introduction of new or advanced technology so as to permit meaningful discussion of its impact, if any, upon skilled or non-skilled employees.
675
The Chairperson of the Shop Committee, the Personnel Director.: and/or their designated representatives will pomppsq a flaaLNew Teotinalogy Committee. The Local Management will describe for the Plant New Technology Committee the extent to which such technological changes may affect the work performed by represented employees at the plant location involved. The Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the International Union will be provided a written description of the technology involved, the equipment being introduced, its intended use and the anticipated installation date(s). During the discussions the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may include as members of the Plant New Technology CQtpipjt(ep. other Local Union representatives such as the Health and Safety Representative, a representative from the Local Joint Skill Development and Training Committee, a member of the Local Apprentice Committee, or other employees, as necessary, in order to review the various matters of concent relative to rite introduction of the new technology involved. Accordingly, the parties agreed upon the following examples of situations where notification should be given:
AfThe first introduction of a technology as compared to previously existing plant technology.
B)	Introduction of a new, more advanced generation of existing technology having a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
C)	Introduction of a new application of existing technology which has a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
The parties also highlighted that the National Agreement provides for notification to take place as far in advance of implementation of the technological change as is practicable. This is not only to enable the Plant New Technology Committee to discuss the impact
676
such introduction of technology has on the bargaining unit, but also to discuss timely implementation of employee training to prepare them to perform their appropriate functions.
Training
The Union has also voiced concern about the possibility that new, technologically impacted bargaining unit work will not be awarded to represented employees because they are insufficiently trained to perform it. In view of the parties' interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology, as part of the advanced discussion, the parties shall seek to identify appropriate specialized training programs, to be made available as far in advance of the technology's introduction to the plant as practicable, so that employees will be capable of performing new or changed work normally performed by represented personnel.
Dispute Resolution	,
The following paragraphs set forth a means of resolving disputes concerning particular problems occasioned by advancing technology.	'
Where the initial introduction of new or advanced technology at a plant location occasions a question of whether: •
1)	certain new work should be assigned to represented employees.
2)	affects the job responsibilities of represented employees, or
3)	otherwise impacts the scope of the bargaining unit.
The Plant New Technology Committee will attempt to
677
resolve the matter without resorting to the Grievance Procedure. Local Management will cooperate in the Plant New Technology Committee’s investigation and evaluation of impact issues raised due to the introduction of new or advanced technology. Comments by the Shop Committee will be carefully evaluated by the Local Management in accordance with the Corporation's policy relative to the assignment of work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at the plant location. If the issue remains unresolved, either party mav request involvement of the Delphi-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee,. Any remaining unresolved issues may be introduced into the second step of the Grievance Procedure as provided in Paragraph (31) of the National Agreement.
Settlements made by the local parties concerning the assignment of work functions as between represented and non-represented employees in relation to the new or advanced technology discussed will be forwarded to the International Union and the Corporation and will be reviewed by the Delphi-UAW Skilled Trades & Apprentice Committee within thirty (30) days of receipt of the settlement. In the event either the Corporation or the International Union does not approve the settlement following the review by the National Committee, the subject matter in dispute will be referred to the Management-Shop Committee Step of the Grievance Procedure and processed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Grievance Procedure.
