FOREWORD
This document is the text of the 2002-2005 News Media Guild Agreement with The Associated Press. It is a living document negotiated by the union and the company to set the terms and conditions of employment of the AP’s employees who have a continuing relationship. It is like a constitution governing rights and obligations and regulating procedures. It is the ultimate authority in AP’s relationship with the approximately 1,700 employees represented by this union.
The contract details rights of the company and the employees—including holidays, vacations, overtime, sick leave, wages, advancement opportunities, health care benefits and pensions. AP’s responsibilities to the Guild-covered employees arc minimal. Nothing precludes AP from paying higher w ages or providing better benefits or conditions of employment than the minimum specified. However, no employee is permitted to work for less than these minimum standards.
Any benefits that the company provides its Guild-covered employees are required under this contract. The benefits and rights are the result of many years of dedicated service by countless AP Guild members—many of whom contributed time and money, in addition to their regular dues, to guarantee the benefits to employees in the Guild’s jurisdiction.

YOUR RIGHTS TO UNION REPRESENTATION
The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed a worker’s right to union representation anytime that worker reasonably believes a discussion he/she may be having with a supervisor could lead to disciplinary action.
BUT YOU MUST EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT AND ASK FOR REPRESENTATION. “I respectfully request union representation” is all you need tell the supervisor or other management representative.
YOUR REQUEST CAN COME ANYTIME DURING THE MEETING -including the point where a “friendly chat” turns to questions on youi job performance. It also may come before the start of the meeting if the intent of the meeting is announced or appears clear.
Following your request, the employer representative should permit you to summon a shop steward or other union representative.
IF YOUR REQUEST IS DENIED, YOU MAY END THE MEETING -OR NOT ATTEND.
Don’t try to be your own lawyer. Demand the rights guaranteed by your Guild contract and the National Labor Relations Act.

On the written demand of either party there shall be submitted to arbitration (the procedure for which is set forth below) all disputes arising out of the application of this Agreement, provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall obligate the Employer to arbitrate any issue arising out of the Employer’s sole responsibility to determine the size and composition of its staff, assignment or reassignment, promotion or demotion of personnel, including correspondents, within the Employer’s office or offices in the same city or town as long as the employee’s salary and classification arc not changed; provided further, however, this does not preclude arbitration of disputes which may arise under Article 8 insofar as that article relates to “no imposition of any unreasonable amount or type of work on any employee,” or under Article 6, Section 3.
2.	No grievance or dispute may be submitted to arbitration more than 45 days after the written notice of denial on the national grievance level (as described in Article 4, Section 4), In no case, however (rules of the American Arbitration Association notwithstanding), shall an arbitrator be appointed to rule on the issue of arbitrability of any matter arising out of the application of this Agreement if the demand for arbitration is filed after the above time limit is expired. This time limit may be extended by mutual consent.
7

5.	All arbitration demands shall be filed with and administered by the New York City office of the American Arbitration Association. The Association shall provide the parties with a panel of qualified arbitrators from that location and office. After discussion, the parties shall determine the most appropriate and efficient location for the hearing. In the absence of agreement, the hearing shall be conducted in the city that serves as the control bureau for the location where the grievance arose. Any subsequent days of hearing shall be conducted on an alternating basis between the location preferred by the Guild and the location preferred by the Employer.
Article 6	- JOB SECURITY
1.	There shall be no dismissals except for just and sufficient cause. The Guild and die employee shall be notified in writing at least four weeks in advance of any dismissal, with the reason for the dismissal stated in such notice, except in cases of proven financial dishonesty, gross insubordination, gross neglect of duty, or gross misconduct in the performance of his/her duties, or where discharge is self-provoked for purposes of collecting dismissal indemnity. In the latter specified instances oral notice will be supplied to the Guild by the Employer. The Employer may pay four weeks’ salary in lieu of notice to the individual.
2.	There shall be no dismissals by reason of putting this Agreement into effect. There shall be no reduction in salaries (including bases and rates for computing commissions) except as may be qualified by Articles 25
8
(Military Service) and 10 (Advancement Opportunities) or by return to their regular assignments of employees who have been temporarily transferred to higher classification work. At the employee’s request, and by agreement of the Employer, an employee may be transferred to an assignment of lesser responsibility or compensation.
3.	There shall be no discharge of or other discrimination against any employee because of his/her membership or activity in the Guild. There shall be no interference or attempt to interfere with the activities of the Guild. There shall be no discrimination as to age, sex, sexual orientation, race, creed, color, national origin, disability or status as a Vietnam Era veteran to the extent prescribed by law.
4.	An employee may be employed for a trial period not to exceed nine months and may be discontinued at any time during such trial period with three weeks’ notice or three weeks’ pay in lieu of notice. The Employer has the sole right to make this determination, and further, the provisions of Article 5 (Arbitration) shall not apply to an employee discontinued during his/her trial period. Within 10 days after the employee has completed three months, five months and eight months of employment, the employee shall receive a written evaluation from his/her supervisor. If the second evaluation is not provided by 10 days after the five-month anniversary, the trial period shall be ended. Nothing shall prohibit the Employer from lifting the trial period at any time. Former employees rehired shall undergo a trial period not to exceed three months. Military service shall not count in the computation of the trial period.
5.	The Employer shall give regular employees displaced by the transfer of a particular function of a bureau or department the option of accepting a transfer with the function to another bureau or department or accepting dismissal indemnity in lieu of a transfer. In case of the cessation of functions of a bureau or department, the Employer shall offer transfers to the regular employees affected or, if unable to do so, shall reduce the force. Should the employee decline a transfer or be released by reduction of force he/she shall receive dismissal indemnity as provided for in Article 7, Section 5. Acceptance of dismissal indemnity by an employee under either of the conditions set forth above shall be entered on the records as a resignation.
6.	In the case of a reduction in staff, the Employer will follow established practice of giving due weigh! to the seniority of the employees in
9
the same classification in the bureau or department in selecting the employee to be discharged. Specifically, where the senior employee is qualified for the work available, the employee with the least seniority in the affected classification will be selected,
7.	Employees dismissed under Sections 5 and 6 of this article shall have their names placed for eighteen (18) months on a preferential list for reemployment in the particular bureau or department concerned and shall be re-employed if a vacancy occurs during that period. Seniority shall prevail on re-employment where employees are qualified for the available work,
8,	The Employer will give the Guild not less than six months’ notice prior to the installation of new equipment or machinery generally referred to as automation, provided that such installation would result in a reduction of tiie staff. The Employer will continue its policy of accomplishing any such reduction in staff by attrition, if possible. All employees displaced may elect termination with dismissal indemnity as specified under Article 7, Section 5. Employees with not less than five years’ continuous service may apply for existing vacancies in other related classifications within the jurisdiction of the Guild. If such employee is not qualified in the opinion of the Employer for the position sought, the Employer will give a minimum of three and no more than six months’ paid training for the new related classification at a rate of pay not less than the beginning scale for the new classification, or at the pay in the employee’s old classification, whichever may be higher. In the case of employees who do not elect any of the above options, the Employer agrees to pay school fees or tuition not exceeding $4,000 per employee for training for other work in a school or institution duly accredited under the Veterans Re-adjustment Benefits Act of 1966 or at another institution acceptable to the Employer. Under this option the employee would receive dismissal indemnity and terminate Associated Press employment,
9.	The Employer shall furnish employees a copy of any commendation, criticism, rating or formal comment regarding their overall performance simultaneously with its being placed in the employee’s personnel file. The employee shall be entitled to file a response, which the Employer shall place in his/her personnel file. Upon request, each employee shall receive an assessment of his/her qualifications for advancement. Each employee in every classification covered by this Agreement shall receive a personnel evaluation once annually within ten (10) business days of his/her anniversary date of hire, followed by a conference with the employee’s
10
chief of bureau or department head. The employee shall be given a copy of the written annual appraisal to be placed in his/her personnel file, and shall have the right to have a written response entered with it.
10.	Editorial assistants, photo assistants and graphics assistants shall not be hired to replace newspersons, photo editors, photographers or artists.
Article 7	- DISMISSAL INDEMNITY/SEVERANCE
1.	Except as noted in this article, dismissal indemnity shall be paid to any employee who has completed the trial period and who is discharged, in addition to four weeks’ notice of discharge, provided the employee executes a separation agreement and general release of all claims against the Employer except timely tiled grievances under this Agreement.
2.	Except as noted herein, dismissal indemnity shall be paid in a lump sum at the rate of two weeks’ of pay for the first six months of service, plus one week’s pay for each subsequent full six months of continuous service up to a maximum of 72 weeks’ pay for 426 months or more of continuous service. Employees who are terminated for poor performance will be paid dismissal indemnity in a lump sum at the rate of one (1) week’s pay for each full 12 months of continuous service up to a maximum of 36 weeks’ pay for 426 months or more of continuous service with the Employer.
3.	Indemnity shall be based on the highest regular weekly salary received by the employee during his/her last continuous employment with the Employer.
4.	Dismissal indemnity need not be paid to any employee discharged for proven financial dishonesty, gross insubordination, gross neglect of duty, or gross misconduct in the performance of his/her duties, where discharge is self-provoked for purposes of collecting dismissal indemnity or where the employee does not execute a separation agreement and general release of all claims against the Employer except timely filed grievances under this Agreement.
5.	Employees who are terminated due to staff reductions at a new or merged business within 24 months of an entity’s acquisition by the Employer will be paid dismissal indemnity in a lump sum at the rate of one week’s pay for each full 12 months of continuous service with the Employer up to a maximum of two (2) weeks pay. Except for those
11
employees who are terminated within 24 months of an entity's acquisition by the Employer, anyone covered by this Agreement shall receive a severance payment equal to the dismissal indemnity schedule contained in Section 2 of this article if they are affected by a staff reduction. In addition, they shall receive payments based on the following schedule: two weeks’ pay for employees with less than five years of service; four weeks’ pay for those with five or more but less than 10 years of service; six weeks' pay for those of 10 years or more but less than 15 years of service; and eight weeks’ pay for those of 15 years or more of service. In the case of an employee who worked for another entity at the time it was acquired by the Employer, service time and severance/dismissal pay eligibility shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the buy/sell agreement. But in no case shall the Employer pay any severance under this schedule unless the employee actually is separated from the Employer’s service and the employee executes a separation agreement and general release of aii claims against the Employer except timely filed grievances under this Agreement.
6.	In the event of death before retirement, the Employer shall pay to a designated beneficiary, or the employee’s estate if no beneficiary has been designated, an amount equal to the dismissal indemnity to which the employee would have been entitled on termination by the Employer at time of death, provided, however, that no such payment shall exceed $7,500. The Employer may, however, deduct from the aforesaid amount the proceeds of any group life or casualty insurance to which the employee was entitled by reason of employment with the Employer.
Article 8	- NORMAL WORK
1.	The Employer shall determine the size and composition of its staff and shall maintain an adequate working force at all times so that there is no imposition of any unreasonable amount or type of work on any employee. The Employer will take cognizance that additional duties imposed on employees will limit their ability to perform the amount of work previously done.
2,	Should the Employer create a new job category or new job duty within the Guild’s jurisdiction, the Employer shall notify the Guild and the parties shall negotiate a new minimum compensation. If agreement on minimum compensation cannot be reached, the controversy shall be sub
12
mitted to final and binding arbitration under the procedure set forth in Article 4 (Grievance Procedure) and Article 5 (Arbitration). A change in the method of operation shall not be considered a new job duty unless such change materially alters the job function.
Article 9	- TRANSFERS
1.	The policy of the Employer is to meet the needs of the service and, wherever possible, to provide wider opportunities for employees. Employees desiring transfer opportunities should make known their wishes in writing to their chiefs of bureau or department heads, with a copy sent to the Director of Human Resources in New York, to get them on record for consideration when conditions permit. Transfers to other bureau cities shall be made only by mutual consent of the Employer and the employee, and no employee shall be penalized for refusing to accept a transfer, except as specified in Article 6 (Job Security).
2.	The Employer shall pay the transportation expenses of the employee, the employee’s spouse, dependent children, and other dependents living in the employee’s household at the time the transfer is offered, the transfer of the employee’s household goods and effects, the total not to exceed an amount estimated by the employee and approved by the Employer in advance. The Employer also shall pay living expenses of the employee and aforesaid dependents until the employee finds adequate housing. Settling shall be done as expeditiously as possible, but in no case shall the Employer be required to pay living expenses for more than four weeks. Consideration shall be given by the Employer to those cases in which the need for living expenses exceeds four weeks.
3.

Re: Editorial Health Plan Agreements
Dear Tony:
This will confirm our agreement regarding the managed care health program for Editorial employees:
The health insurance program will have the following characteristics:
63
1.	The point of service (POS) arrangement will allow each covered individual to select a primary care physician who will serve as a gatekeeper to provide family medical care.
(a)	Participants will be able to select their doctor from a list of POS network participants board-certified physicians who meet a rigid set of qualifications for membership in a network.
(b)	There will be no annual deductibles for people using the POS managed care network, and participants do not need to file claim forms for medical expense reimbursements.
(c)	All medical services provided by the POS will be fully paid after the following participant copayments at the time service is provided:
(1)	Hospital Admissions: SI00 copayment.
(2)	Emergency Room: $50 copayment (includes the cost of the attending physicians and diagnostic services such as x-ray readings).
(3)	Doctor’s office visits: $20 copayment per visit. There can be circumstances, such as pregnancy and other long-term care, where a (one-time) $20 copayment may be applied by the POS plan.
(4)	The POS plan includes wellness care, such as annual physicals and on-going baby care, on the same $20 fiat fee basis. Additional enhancements include immunizations, vaccines, flu shots, and other tests or procedures that are medically appropriate for people at various stages of life.
2.	Staffers who live in areas served by the POS plan selected by the AP may elect at any time to go to a doctor or hospital not in the network, but will be subject to the following charges:
•	Expenses will be reimbursed after annual deductibles of $300 per person, and $600 per family are applied to all “out-of-network” services.
•	All expenses over and above the deductible—hospital, emergency room and doctor visits—will be on a shared basis with the employee paying 30% and the company, 70%.
•	The maximum annual “out-of-network” cost will be $1,850 per person, or $3,700 per family.
•	Wellness care mentioned for network participants will not be covered “out-of-network.”
'	Claim forms will need to be filed with the carrier to obtain reimbursement for medical care obtained “out-of-network.”
64
3.	AP employees working or residing in areas not served by the POS network selected will be eligible to continue coverage under the AP’s present indemnity plan until the POS service area is expanded to include them. These employees and their covered dependents will not be subject to annual deductibles because of doctor office visits. Present benefit levels under the indemnity plan will be continued, but reimbursements will be subject to the following schedule;
•	Annual deductibles for hospitalizations will be $ 150 for individuals, and $300 for families.
•	Maximum out-of-pocket costs per covered individual will be $800 a year or $2,400 per family.
•	Wellness care such as annual physicals and on-going baby care, immunizations, vaccines, flu shots, and other tests or procedures that are medically appropriate for people at various stages of life will be covered subject to the 20% regular coinsurance requirement.
4.	In areas served by the POS network, AP health plans under managed care will provide non-duplicating coordination of benefits for employees or dependents who may be covered by other health plans. This means no one can receive from the AP’s plan more than the co-insurance maximum of 70% reimbursement.
Regular coordination of benefits (duplicating) will continue to apply to areas where the POS network is not available.
The “birthday rule” will continue to apply to all AP medical plans. Under the “birthday rule,” dependent children receive primary insurance coverage from the policy of the parent with the birth date that falls first in the year.
5.	The prescription card schedule of payments provides incentives for using generic drugs where possible. Effective July 1, 2003, the new plan will fill orders for generic drugs for $7 per order, preferred name brands for $16 and non-preferred name brands for $22.
6.	The AP will continue the “managed care” network for delivery of mental health and substance abuse treatment. Under the plan, a staffer needing treatment for a mental health or substance abuse problem would call an 800 number. A mental health professional would talk to the staffer about the problem and refer him/her to a psychiatrist, psychologist or other provider in the staffer’s community,
A staffer who makes use of a professional recommended by the network will receive “in-network” benefits, which are 100 percent for in
65
patient care. For out-patient care, treatment is paid at 100 percent after a $20 copayment.
There are no separate deductibles for mental health/ substance abuse treatment.
A staffer could choose to be treated by a non-network provider but would be subject to the charges described in Section 2 above. If this letter accurately sets forth our agreements on this subject, please countersign below and return a signed copy of the letter to me,
7.	Effective January 1, 2003, the plan began coverage of prescribed contraceptives, subject to the applicable schedule for prescription co-payment amounts,
8.	Effective June 1,2003, the plan began coverage of an employee’s same sex domestic partner at the rates established for employee and spouse. It is understood and agreed that such coverage is available only to same sex domestic partners who are precluded by statute from marriage in the jurisdiction of personal residency and, akin to the Plan’s requirement for proof of marriage, is further contingent upon the employee's submission of written evidence that a domicile has been established jointly with a same sex partner who shares the domicile’s obligations for expenses and maintenance.
Regarding disputes that may arise concerning health insurance coverage for employees covered by the AP-NMG contract, the following applies:
• The present POS agreement with the insurance carrier includes a specific grievance and appeals system to handle employee problems and/or concerns regarding medical claims. Nothing herein is intended to supplant or alter those procedures.
•	The employer will actively participate as necessary in the appeals process to make certain that a fair and complete review is conducted by the carrier on any employee grievances and that the employee’s interests and rights are protected under terms of the plan.
•	The employer agrees to closely monitor the disposition of all such disputes on an ongoing basis. It is agreed that an annual dispute review meeting, with the carrier and the union present, shall be held. The purpose of this meeting shall be to discuss the operation of the plan and to uncover trends that may need to be addressed. In addition, the disposition of employee grievances and resolutions will be reviewed.
•	In those cases where the internal grievance process of the carrier has been exhausted, and the individual remains unsatisfied, he or she
66
may bring the dispute to the company and the union for review and consideration at this meeting. However, nothing herein entitles the employee to pursue medical and benefits disputes through the arbitration procedure of the collective bargaining agreement
If this letter accurately sets forth our agreements on this subject, please countersign below and return a signed copy of the letter to me.

Pension “Pop-Up” Side Letter

Mr. Tony Winton, President
News Media Guild, TNG-CWA Local 31222
1501 Broadway, Suite 708
New York, NY 10036
Dear Tony:
Effective with the start of the next plan year, January 1, 2004, The Associated Press will add a pop-up option to the pension benefit election options in the Revised Retirement Plan for Employees of The Associated Press represented by the News Media Guild.
This is a “joint-and-survivor” option that the employee may elect to receive a reduced benefit in exchange for a benefit to be paid to their spouse should the employee predecease him/her. The pop-up option allows an employee to elect a reduced joint and survivor benefit with a special provision; that should the spouse predecease the retiree, die pension “pops-up” to a higher level of benefit that has been actuarially determined.
Sincerely
Jessica L. Bruce

Dear Tony:
This letter will serve to clarify certain understandings regarding the company's use of electronic employee access systems. The Employer uses these access control systems for lawful business purposes and to assist in the safety and security of the AP’s business systems and premises.
This confirms what we have told the Guild that electronic card entry, electronic keypad entry, and computer sign-on, sign-off records are not used and -will not be used as “time clocks” for the purpose of logging, tracking, or recording hours worked by an employee.

Per Diem Employees Side Letter
June 2, 2003
Kevin Keane
President
Wire Service Guild, Local 31222
1501 Broadway, 7th Floor
New York, N.Y. 10036
Dear Kevin:
This confirms our understanding on the use of per diem employees in Associated Press operations, in order to create some continuity of service benefits for individuals who otherwise would be discontinued after brief periods of employment.
We have agreed that a per diem employee works irregularly, sporadically and on an as-needed basis. Specifically, such an employee would work, on average, fewer than 780 hours in a calendar year which is less than 40 percent of the regular, full-time schedule of 1,950 hours in a calendar year. It is envisioned that these individuals perform tasks such as additional photo services when a home sports team is in town or when bureau photo requirements exceed staffing levels or when peak operating periods, such as elections, require additional office assistance.
Generally the company would expect such employees to work fewer than 15 hours per week in a calendar year, except when involved in a special news event, an athletic season or another seasonal period or periodic event during the course of a year.
Employees who work 780 hours or more in a calendar year, but less than full time in a calendar year, shall become regular part-time employees and be subject to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement article governing regular part-time employment, effective on the first day worked in the calendar year that immediately follows the calendar year in which he/she met or exceeded 780 hours of work.
Since the need for these employees cannot be adequately anticipated and scheduled in advance, per diem and seasonal employees shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 19 (Hours and Overtime), except they shall
74
be paid one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight (8) hours in a day or forty (40) hours in a week.
AP acknowledges that its use of per diem and seasonal employees will not reduce the overall work force of part-time employees working fifteen (15) or more regularly scheduled hours per week or of full-time employees covered by this letter of agreement.
Further, the trial period for per diem and seasonal employees shall have a duration of 1,450 aggregate hours worked for the Employer since his/her date of hire, regardless of the number of months and/or years since such an employee began working for the AP. As agreed, per diem and seasonal employees who work fewer than 780 hours annually shall not be eligible for coverage under articles covering Dismissal Indemnity/Severance, Hours and Overtime, Work Schedules, Holidays, Vacations, Leaves of Absence, Military Service, Sick Leave, Hospital-Medical-Dental, Life Insurance, Pensions or Miscellaneous (Sections 3 and 4) of the Agreement. The Union and the Company agree that during the term of the present Agreement, the Company may employ per diem employees in accordance with the terms explained above. The parties agree that the use of per diem employees is on an experimental basis, is without precedental value and does not prejudice either party’s rights in any future matters or negotiations. The parties further agree to meet and discuss any concerns related to the use of per diem employees on an annual basis on a mutually acceptable date and time and on a more frequent basis to resolve specific grievances or concerns. Moreover, the Union retains the right to revoke its agreement on this matter for reasonable cause demonstrated on and after July 1, 2001. Finally, it is expressly understood and agreed that the Company’s use of per diem employees does not abridge the Agreement’s provisions regarding temporary and part time employees, nor will it adversely affect part-time and temporary employees or practices related to those employees.

Mr. Karl Jendretzky, President
CWA 1314
-and-
Mr, Kevin Keane
Administrator
News Media Guild
Dear Karl and Kevin:
This letter confirms certain understandings regarding the AP’s policy on Business Systems/Use of Computers, Networks and Internet Access (“Business Systems” hereinafter.)
The AP confirms that the policy does not change its continuing practice regarding monitoring of any employee’s use of a private and personal computer for non-business purposes. Specifically, AP will not use its Business Systems to access or monitor an employee’s private computer but reserves the right to monitor electronic traffic and/or communication to and from AP’s Business Systems, in accordance with the Business Systems Policy.
By you respective signatures below, you acknowledge and accept the con* tents of this letter and the Business Systems Policy on behalf of your respective labor organizations.
Specifically, the News Media Guild agrees to withdraw its prior objections to the policy and CWA 1314 agrees to withdraw with prejudice its Unfair Labor Practice charge, NLRB Case A9-CA-39211.
Thank you for your continuing cooperation.
Sincerely,
James M. Donna

Mr. Tony Winton
President
News Media Guild
1501 Broadway Suite 708

Re: Photo Editing and News Integrity
Dear Tony:
This letter is provided to the News Media Guild concurrently with The Associated Press News Integrity Policy.
As stated in the policy and during numerous discussions with the Guild, the content of a photograph may never be altered or manipulated in any way. AP pictures must always tell the truth. The AP permits the use of the subtle, standard photo printing methods of dodging, burning, toning and cropping , provided the use of these methods does not conceal, obscure, remove or otherwise alter the content, or any portion of the content, of the image.
In any instance when an employee has questions about the use of such methods or the AP’s requirements and limitations on photo editing, he/she should contact a senior photo editor prior to the submission/transmission of any image.
Sincerely,
Jessica L. Bruce
Deputy Director of Human Resources.

Should this occur, the AP and the Guild shall meet and attempt to negotiate a new fee structure for such work, and any dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Article 8 (Normal Work) of the collective bargaining agreement,

Jessica L. Bruce
Deputy Director of Human Resources
Associated Press
50 Rockefeller Plaza
New York, N.Y. 10020
Dear Jessica:
This confirms our understanding on steps The Associated Press will take with Guild-covered sales staff on a routine basis in an effort to broaden the sale of AP photos.
AP and staff will meet to discuss ideas for product/market growth so the company can consider them for its business plan. The forum will be used to keep staff informed on the status of growth ideas being reviewed or under implementation already. AP will meet with the staff on a quarterly basis and will schedule the first such meeting before the end of the first quarter this year.
The Guild agrees if a clearly marked unauthorized member or third-party restricted image is sold by a WWP salesperson, AP shall not be required to pay commission and does not abridge any other right AP has under the collective bargaining agreement.
Sincerely,
Adolphe Bernotas
NMG Negotiating Committee Chairperson
