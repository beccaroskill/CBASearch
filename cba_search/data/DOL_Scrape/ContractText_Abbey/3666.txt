To these ends this Agreement is made.

Should existing classifications be reclassified without the addition of significant new or different duties, the Union shall continue to be recognized for those classifications. Should new classifications in the City classified service be created, the City shall recognize the Union for those classifications, if such classifications perform a substantial portion of work presently performed by classifications listed in this Agreement. However, if another bargaining representative requests recognition for such a new classification, recognition procedures set forth in Chapter 41.56 RCW shall apply.
Section 2.2 - Leave for Business Manaqer/Representative The Director of Public Utilities or City Manager will approve granting of leave of absence without pay for the period covered by this Agreement without loss of Civil Service status and/or without loss of continued accrual of seniority, and aggregate City service or tenure status for all purposes, to no more than two (2) employees of the City who are members of the Union, and whom the Union may desire to have act as its Business Manager/Representative to be locally engaged in the business of the Union.
Section 2.3 The City will inform new bargaining unit employees of the Union’s exclusive representation status.

The City will rely on information provided by the Union regarding the authorization and revocation of deductions, and the Union will provide such information to an email address provided by the City. Upon receiving notice of the employee’s authorization from the Union, the City will deduct from the employee's pay membership dues and remit the same to the Union no later than the second payroll cycle following receipt of the authorization. The amounts deducted shall be remitted monthly by the City to the Union on behalf of the employees identified by the Union as authorizing deduction(s).

This step shall not preclude contacts at lower levels, if this may expedite the resolution process.
The appropriate manager shall, within ten (10) working days render a decision in writing to the employee and Union.

Section 10.3 The time limitations in this Article may be adjusted by mutual agreement, in writing between the Union and the Department/Division. Failure by the non-grieving party to comply with any of the time limitations as provided in this Article shall constitute a right of the grieving party to proceed to the next step without waiting.
Failure of the grieving party to comply with the forgoing time limitations shall constitute resolution of the grievance.

6.2.1	Eligibility. Permanent, project, appointive, and temporary pending exam employees and their dependents are eligible for coverage beginning on the first day of the calendar month following the date of hire, unless the date of hire is also the first working day of the calendar month, in which case benefits eligibility begins on the date of hire.

If a temporary employee fails to timely enroll or waive coverage, the employee will be determined to have waived coverage, until such time as they enroll pursuant to a qualifying life event or an open enrollment period.
6.2.3	City Payment of Claims/Premiums. Except as provided below, the City will pay the claims or premiums (according to the plan selected by the employee) associated with the medical insurance selected by the employee and eligible dependents from the City’s Health Care Trust.

Employees will be eligible for benefits based on assigned work schedule. The work schedule shall be determined monthly, for pay periods in the upcoming month. Such schedules will be rounded up to the nearest four (4) hour increment. Part-time employees working thirty (30) or more hours per week will make contributions equal to those of full time employees.

6.9	On-the-job injury shall be as provided in Section 1.12.090 of the Tacoma Municipal Code. That section provides in part:
6.9.1	In the case of a disability covered by State Industrial Insurance or Worker Compensation, the first three (3) calendar days shall be paid at the regular normal pay and charged to earned leave, in the event the time loss is less than fifteen (15) calendar days.
6.9.2	For one-hundred-twenty (120) working days, the City will pay a supplement payment such that State payment plus City supplement equals eighty-five percent (85%) of regular normal pay.
6.9.3	Pursuant to Ordinance 27753, adopted November 18, 2008, after the payment and use of the one hundred twenty (120) working days, the employee may request to use accumulated sick leave and/or planned time off (PTO) balances to supplement the time loss pay such that the combination of

DocuSign Envelope ID: E9275110-622C-4DBE-852B-4088E2769438
the supplement and the time loss pay equals eighty-five percent (85%) of the employee’s normal wage (the employee’s rate at the time of injury plus any longevity pay to which the employee is eligible). If the employee elects to use paid sick leave and/or PTO the election will continue until such balances are exhausted or until the employee returns to work. Hours deductions from the employee’s PTO or sick leave balances shall be determined by dividing the supplement by the employee’s regular hourly wage. Example: Assume a supplement amount of $596 dollars is necessary to bring the total to 85%. If the employee’s regular wage is assumed to be $23.84, the deduction from sick leave and/or PTO would be $596/$23.84=25 hours.
6.9.4	Any employee who becomes disabled prior to completing thirty (30) working days' employment with the City, shall receive the compensation disability allowance for a maximum of thirty (30) working days.
6.9.5	The above does not apply to Police and Fire commissioned hired prior to October 1, 1977, however, such employees shall have on-the-job injury claims charged against their sick leave accruals in the same manner as other employees of the City.
6.9.6	For the purposes of this Section, regular normal pay shall be that rate of the classification in which they were working in on the date of injury.
6.10	Group Life Insurance shall be as provided in Section 1.12.096 of the Tacoma Municipal Code. The City will pay one hundred percent (100%) of the cost of premiums for those employees electing to participate. The amount of insurance an employee may purchase is based on their annual salary rounded to the next highest $1,000 ofcoverage.
6.11	Longevity pay may be provided to employees of member unions pursuant to the terms of Ordinance 20938, which reads in part as follows:
6.11.1	Regular, probationary, and appointive employees who through union agreement have elected the option of longevity pay shall receive additional compensation based on a percentage of their base rate of pay received for the class in which they are currently being paid. No application of rate may be used in computing longevity pay.
6.11.2	Eligible employees shall receive longevity pay in accordance with the following schedule:
From 5 through 9 years aggregate service From 10 through 14 years aggregate service From 15 through 19 years aggregate service 20 years or more aggregate service
1% per month 2% per month 3% per month 4% per month
6.11.3	Eligibility for longevity pay shall be determined by the length of aggregate City service and will be paid to an employee at the first of the calendar year in which any of the above stipulated periods of aggregate service will be completed.
