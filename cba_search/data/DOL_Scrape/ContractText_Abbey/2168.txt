The parties acknowledge that when a single pharmacist is on duty, it would be impracticable and unrealistic, and a failure to meet the Employer’s obligations to those who need the immediate services of the pharmacy, to close the pharmacy during break periods required by NY law. Accordingly, the parties waive those requirements and agree that when a pharmacist is the only one on duty, he/she will remain in the pharmacy and available to serve its customers for the entire shift.
The parties also recognize the obligation to provide such pharmacists with adequate meal and rest opportunities. Accordingly, each store manager will cooperate with such pharmacists so that they will have an opportunity to eat meals in the pharmacy. Reasonable efforts will be made not to interrupt the pharmacist during such breaks by taking them during traditionally slow periods, by assigning employees who are permitted to work under the pharmacist’s direction and/or other means. These steps will permit the pharmacist to remain on duty and available throughout the shift while being assured of adequate opportunities for meal and rest periods.
