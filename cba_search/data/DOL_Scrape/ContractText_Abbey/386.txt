The incentive contribution to the pension plan shall be made for each compensable straight time hour for which other pension contributions are made, commencing September 1, 1998, and will be as follows:

Section 42	Sign-ups for Runs.
42.1	Sign-ups for runs shall be held quarterly and completed not less than ten (10) days prior to the date on which each quarterly schedule goes into effect.
42.2	Quarterly schedules shall become effective as follows: the first Sunday in March, the first Sunday following the closing of public schools in June, the Sunday before the opening day of public schools in September, and the first Sunday in December.
30
42.3	When schedules are changed for regular quarterly sign-ups, they shall be posted in the schedule room along with a corrected departmental seniority list of all operators five (5) days (including Sundays and holidays) before each sign-up. Such schedules and seniority list shall be made available to the Union.
42.4	Should there be a general revision of schedules on any line, a new sign-up will be held for that line provided, however, that should more than five (5) runs be eliminated from that line, a general sign-up will be held. When line sign-ups occur, a run which is made up of work on two (2) or more lines will be considered as a run on the line on which the longest period of time is worked. After any two (2) such line sign ups have been held in any one scheduled quarter, an additional general schedule revision on any line will require a general sign-up for the balance of that quarter.
42.5	When line sign-ups occur or when there is a general sign-up between regular quarterly sign-ups, the schedules will be posted in the schedule room four (4) days (excluding Sundays) along with a corrected departmental seniority list of all operators before each sign-up.
42.6	The Company agrees that eighty-five percent (85%) of the scheduled runs in the Transportation Department will be completed within thirteen (13) consecutive hours, but not including reporting time or travel time.

42.7	An unattached extra which consists of seven (7) or more hours of work and which goes out more than two (2) times in any calendar week will be considered as a regular run for the balance of the sign-up and will pay eight (8) hours if and when it goes out.
42.8	Any operator who is not present at a sign-up and who has not notified the Company by memorandum of the desired runs shall be signed up on a run by a representative of the Union provided, however, that the Union shall notify the Company in writing who its representative will be at least three (3) days prior to any sign-up. In the event that neither the operator nor a representative of the Union is present at the sign-up and the Company has not been notified by memorandum of the run for which the operator desires to sign, the Company official in charge of the sign-up will sign the operator on the run most similar to the operator's previous run or, in the opinion of the official, a better run.
31
42.9	An operator who does not wish to sign up for a regular run at any general or line sign-up may elect to be placed on the extra list without loss of seniority for sign ups, even though the operator may pass up a run which becomes vacant.
Section 43	Extra Work.
43.1	The assignment to operators of extra runs will be handled as follows:
43.1.1	Operators may volunteer for extras by 12:00 noon on the day previous to that on which they desire an extra. If they so desire, they may also volunteer for the entire week in advance or for any part thereof. Should more operators volunteer than are needed to fill the extras available, seniority shall prevail in selecting the volunteers.
43.1.2	However, an operator with seniority who has filled one extra will not take out another the same week while there are volunteers waiting who have not yet taken out their first extra.
43.1.3	In case of an abnormal amount of extras necessary for special or chartered service, the Company will post a request for additional volunteers for this service as soon as information is available.
43.1.4	If a sufficient number of operators have not volunteered by 12:00 noon on the day previous to the one on which service is required, the remaining extras will be assigned to operators on a rotating basis. Exceptions will be made to procedure by the proper official on the basis of physical qualifications, emergencies, or if working extras entail an excessive number of hours. The assignment of extras, both voluntary and Company assigned, will be posted by 2:00 p.m. on the day previous to the work.
43.1.5	Anyone having an extra assigned by the Company who can obtain a satisfactory substitute will be permitted to do so. The substitute maintains the former position on the rotation list and the operator obtaining the substitute will be placed on the rotation list in the same manner as if the operator had worked.
43.1.6	Operators who oversleep when assigned by the Company to work extra hours or who fail to take out extra work assigned will be carried over at the head of the rotation list for work the following day.
43.2	It is understood that as long as sufficient volunteers are obtained there will be no necessity for assigning extra work and the rotation
32
list will remain inactive. Extra work wi'l be assigned only when there is not a sufficient number of volunteers.
Section 44	Extra List Operators' Guarantee.
44.1	For the purpose of this section., a stand-by report is defined as reporting to the dispatcher at any one of the reports listed on the daily work sheet for the purpose of standing by for possible work assignment and shall specifically not include other reports required by the Company such as reports at the conclusion of an assignment, reports for extras, reports for charters, reports for previously assigned work schedules, etc.
44.2	Extra list operators shall not be required to stand by more than twenty- five (25) reports per month of such duration as specified by the Company provided, however, that an extra list operator shall not be required to standby more than one (1) report per day and this standby report shall be of no more than four (4) hours' duration from Monday through Friday and no more than five (5) hours' duration on Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays. An extra list operator who stands by the full number of reports designated by the Company shall be guaranteed Fifteen Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00) per month.
44.3	In the event an extra list operator on report does not catch out, the operator shall be paid minimum wage on weekdays for the period the operator stands report. If the operator does catch out, the operator shall receive the amount which the run calls for as the total compensation for the time the operator stood on report plus the time spent in operating the run. If the compensation spread over the time of the run plus the time the operator stood the report is less than minimum wage, the Company will pay such amount as is necessary to bring the total compensation up to the minimum wage.
44.4	In no event shall the report time stood by an extra-list operator be considered in determining time worked by that operator for purposes of computing overtime or spread-time compensation under this Agreement.
44.5	It is understood that the Company will reduce the amount due under this guarantee in proportion to the number of reports which an extra list operator, through no fault of the Company, fails to stand by in relation to the number of reports designated by the Company. Upon request, the Company shall within seven (7) calendar days make known to the Union the number of reports which an extra list operator, through no fault of the Company, fails to stand by in relation to the number of reports designated by the Company.
33
44.6	Work performed by an extra list operator on the operator's regularly scheduled day off shall not be counted toward the guarantee. When the work performed by an extra list operator other than on a full scheduled regular run (stand-by time specifically excluded) is in excess of a spread of twelve (12) hours in any one day, the Company will pay ONE and one-half (1-1/2) for that portion of. the. work which is in excess of a spread of twelve (12) hours.
Section 45	After Hours Extra Guarantee. An operator required by the Company to report after working hours for extra work shall be guaranteed a minimum of one (1) hour's work.
Section 46	Regular Run Guarantee.
46.1	An operator signed on a regular run shall be guaranteed at least the amount of pay the regular run calls for should the regular run be canceled and the operator be placed on another run.
46.2	Should an operator's run be increased after a sign-up, the Company will pay ONE and one-half (1-1/2) for such increase as long as such increase is in effect. However, where a run has some guarantee time, the operator will be paid ONE and one-half (1-1/2) only for that portion of the increase in excess of eight (8) hours.
46.3	In the event the length of the run is reduced, whether temporarily or otherwise after a sign-up, the operator will be paid for the length of the run if such run is taken out for which the operator originally signed; and the operator may, pursuant to the present practice, be required to stand by for the time the operator would have been working.
46.4	Operators reporting for regular scheduled runs which are assigned to them and which do not go out because of inclement weather shall be paid a minimum of four (4) hours and shall be required to stand by.
Section 47	Report and Travel Time. Operators making a report and who are required to report to the dispatchers will be paid the allowance
shown in Column "A" for the purpose of reporting and traveling to the location of their vehicle. Operators who are required to travel from one relief point to another and who are required to report to the dispatcher after the completion of their run will be paid the allowance in Column "B."
