B.	Sick Leave
Any full-time employee who is unable to perform his/her duty in the school because of illness or because of illness or death of father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, child, or other close relative such as grandfather, grandmother, grandson, granddaughter, uncle, aunt, or anyone of like relationship by marriage or a member of his own household and consequently has to be absent from his work shall be granted leave of absence for sickness by the Employer. The following provisions shall govern sick leave:
1.	An employee employed on a full-time basis shall be entitled to four days of sick leave as of the first day of employment of each contract year and shall thereafter earn one day of sick leave for each month of employment, which shall be credited to the employee at the end of that month and which shall not be used prior to the time it is earned and credited to the employee; provided, that the employee shall be entitled to earn no more than one day of sick leave times the number of months of employment during the year of employment; provided, that such leave shall be taken only when necessary because of sickness as herein prescribed. If the employee terminates his or her employment and has not accrued the 4 sick days available to him or her, the school board may withhold the average daily amount for the sick days utilized but unearned by the employee. Such sick leave shall be cumulative from year to year; provided, that there shall be no limit on the number of days of sick leave an employee may accrue.
48
2.	In accordance with Duval County School Board policies, a teacher may authorize his or her spouse, child, parent, or sibling who is also an employee of the Duval County Public Schools to use sick leave that has accrued to the authorizing teacher, provided that the recipient may not use the donated sick leave until all of his or her sick leave has been depleted, excluding sick leave from a sick leave pool, if the recipient participates in a sick leave pool.

Should the employee be unable to submit the doctor's statement as required above, he shall be paid for any sick leave to which he is entitled when the doctor's statement is submitted to the Payroll Office.
5.	a. Principals are encouraged to monitor the use of sick leave to ensure that all teachers act in a manner consistent with the requirements of their positions.

SUPPLEMENT REGULATIONS
The following explanations and regulations are to be included in the Supplement Table:
1.	An annual recommendation by the Superintendent and approval by School Board is necessary for assignment of additional or special duties to teachers which supplement is paid. The assignments listed are to be recommended annually by the principal to the Superintendent.
2.	Coaches and assistant coaches may receive compensation for an unlimited number of supplements as long as the activities for which they receive supplements shall not have overlapping seasons. Overlapping seasons shall mean the schedules of competition overlap.
3.	Head coaches and assistant coaches who also are assigned full JV coaching responsibilities shall receive an additional $600.
4.	Coaches may not receive an additional remuneration from revenues of athletic contests or other school activities except when employed as a referee, umpire, or an official by agencies other than the school unit in which they are employed. This policy does not preclude the incidental employment of a coach, other than an athletic director, in game management activities for which he or she does not receive a supplement.
5.	Any coach who draws two or more athletic supplements, or a total of $2,573 must coach and be available for assignment by the athletic director to coaching or intramural program duties during the period of time covered by his assignment. Where after school supervisory duties must be provided in a school, the assignments will be rotated and made in a fair, equitable, and reasonable manner.
6	Athletic personnel are to be assigned a regular teaching load by the principal of the school. If the combination Athletic Director/Head Coach elects to have his regular teaching load reduced by one period daily, then the Athletic Director supplement will be reduced by $550.
7.	The intramural supplement and assignment may be divided into thirds, and any one coach may receive this supplement for one-third, two-thirds, or the entire school year.
8.	Whenever schedules authorize practice or other activities prior to the start of the school year for teachers, worker's compensation coverage shall be applicable to those employees supervising the activities.
9.	When a season is not completed, the coach will be paid on a pro-rated basis, based on the portion of the season completed.
10.	Teachers shall not be required to organize and/or attend any contest, and/or exhibit, etc., of student work outside of school hours. Where teachers volunteer for such work, and with prior approval of the principal or appropriate district supervisor, expenses incurred (mileage, supplies, etc.) in organizing, participating, or attending any contest, and/or exhibit, shall be reimbursed.
11.	The School Patrol Supplement shall be limited to two (2) persons and shall not be subdivided

A memorandum of understanding, dated the 26th day of August 1998, to which both parties agreed, intended to memorialize the agreement of the parties implementing the Suspension of Employees Without Pay clause of the 1997-98 Amendment to the Agreement with the DTU for Teachers, Article V, Section D.-7. The procedures outlined in the attachment were implemented on August 3, 1998. It is understood by the parties that paragraphs A, B, C, and D apply to teachers under the Duval Teacher Tenure Act and paragraph E applies to all others.
Pursuant to Article V, D.-7.of the Master Contract as amended for 1997-98, a committee composed of the Assistant General Counsel, General Director, Human Resources, a Regional Superintendent, General Counsel for the DTU, and two representatives for the DTU recommends the following procedure to implement, “Employees may be suspended without pay” and “...reduce the number of employees assigned to the disciplinary center.”
A.	An employee tenured pursuant to the Duval County Teacher Tenure Act, Laws of Florida, Chapter 21197 (1941) as amended, (“Act”) may be suspended without pay by the Superintendent of Schools upon action taken by the Duval County School Board (“Board”) when:
1.	That employee has been convicted of any felony while an employee of the Board; (The term “convicted” shall have the same meaning as it does in Section 5.2 of the Act); and/or
2.	That employee has been indicted by a grand jury duly constituted under the laws of the State of Florida or the United States of America for any felony, and/or
3.	That employee has been formally charged by a proper prosecuting attorney with any felony; and/or
4.	The Board or its Administration has caused a Petition, Complaint, or similarly denominated action for dismissal of a tenured employee under the Act to be prepared, filed with the Division of Administrative Hearings and served on the employee in a manner prescribed by the Statutes and the Florida Administrative Code.
B.	Any suspension without pay pursuant to A. 1, 2, or 3 above shall automatically terminate on the 30th calendar day following the imposition of said suspension unless the employee is incarcerated, or the board or its Administration implements A. 4 above.
C.	If the charge(s) of A. 2, 3, or 4 are not sustained by a court of competent jurisdiction or a hearing officer / Administrative Law Judge, the employee shall be immediately reinstated and the employee’s back salary shall be paid from the date of suspension until the date of reinstatement.
94
D.	Should the Board ratify, confirm, continue or otherwise support the decision of the Superintendent of Schools, any and all continued suspension(s) without pay shall be subject to and controlled by the terms of paragraphs B and C above.
E.	Any employee not tenured under the Act may be suspended without pay pursuant to the procedure and conditions in Florida Statutes.
F.	Reduction in numbers of employees assigned to the disciplinary center.
The committee recommends that both parties consciously seek to reach agreement for the imposition of discipline in those cases where suspension or termination is not appropriate. The committee recommends that the parties utilize the concept of progressive discipline. The committee believes that many “disciplinary” employees could be expeditiously returned to the classroom if the parties would consider, propose, promote, and agree to the imposition of discipline as a resolution of the interests of the Duval County School Board. It must be considered that this procedure would not affect the responsibilities of the Duval County School Board to report cases to Professional Practices Services, Department of Education, State of Florida, and would not affect any action which may be taken by the agency.

1.	The principal, or designee shall follow the Code of Student Conduct on all disciplinary matters.
2.	Only those disciplinary problems which disrupt a teacher's instruction, when the teacher requests the student's permanent removal from class, shall be referred to the Placement Review Committee, if the request is not resolved by the principal.

3.	When the teacher's recommendation is made in writing, the principal will inform the teacher in writing of the results of the investigation and the action taken.
4.	When a student who has been charged or convicted of violent crimes, or who has a history of violent behavior, is scheduled into a teacher's class, and the principal is aware of such charge or conviction, that teacher shall be confidentially informed of the student's past records and discipline pursuant to the provisions of F.S. 39.037.
Florida Statutes provide for the right of the teacher to refuse to accept a student back to class who has been removed for disruptive behavior which adversely affects the teacher's ability to communicate effectively with students. Sections C through H relate to these situations.

b.	The student has been documented by the teacher for repeated interference with the teacher's ability to communicate effectively with students, or the ability of the students to learn.
The following documentation should support the teacher's decision under 1 b. above:
•	a teacher-student conference;
•	a parent conference or evidence of a valid attempt to reach a parent, including both phone calls and a letter, delivered by hand or mail, to the home; and
•	at least three (3) previously written referrals to school-site administration for behavior which interferes with instruction during the current school year.
2.	A written referral or explanation to site administration must be provided by the teacher upon the removal of the student from class.

b.	two (2) teacher alternates elected by members of the teacher bargaining unit.
c.	one (1) staff member appointed by the principal;
d.	one (1) staff alternate appointed by the principal.
If a school chooses to have a larger committee, the ratio of committee members must be 2:1 elected teachers to staff members appointed by the principal.

2.	The Placement Review Committee shall only have authority to decide whether or not to return the student to the referring teacher's classroom. Should the Placement Review Committee decide that the student should not be returned to the referring teacher's classroom, the final determination of the student's placement shall be the responsibility of the principal. The Placement Review Committee shall not have authority to place the student in an alternative school or program, another school or to impose any other additional disciplinary sanctions upon the student. The Placement Review Committee shall return the student to the referring teacher's classroom if that placement is the best and only available option for the student.
E.	Time Frames and Parent Notification
1.	A teacher who requests a permanent exclusion of a student from class must notify the principal by the beginning of the next school day.
2.	If the request is not resolved between the principal and the referring teacher, a time limit of five (5) days from the removal of the student from class is set for the Placement Review Committee to render a decision on the placement of the student.
3.	Every effort must be made by the school administration to notify the parent immediately upon the removal of a student from class.
F.	Provisions for Exceptional Students: The Placement Review Committee shall refer to a staffing committee all exclusion requests for students from exceptional education classes. The Placement Review Committee decision must concur with the staffing committee recommendations.
G.	Professional Development Activities to Improve Classroom Management Skills: Any teacher who refers 25% of his/her class for exclusion is required to complete professional development activities to improve classroom management skills. This percentage pertains to individual students referred for disruptive behavior which interferes with instruction as outlined in subsection A of this section of the Agreement.
H.	Records: Each school should keep appropriate records in order to be able to address questions in the following general areas:
1.	Number and percentage of referrals in which the students were sent back to class with the consent of teachers;
2.	Number and percentage of referrals in which the students were sent back to class without the consent of teachers;
3.	Number and percentage of referrals that were sent to the Placement Review Committee because of teacher refusal to readmit;
