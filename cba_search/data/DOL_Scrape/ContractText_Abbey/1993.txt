ARTICLE V SENIORITY
Section 1.	New Employees
A. Seniority will be credited to an employee only after six (6) months of continuous employment but shall include this first six (6) months’ period. During this six (6)-month period, the employee shall be considered probationary and the Company shall have the sole and exclusive right to discharge such employee and Article III of the Agreement shall not apply.
Section 2.	Promotions - Transfers - Demotions
A.	The Company will give preference to the employee with seniority when fitness and ability among employees are substantially equal in considering them for the purpose of promotion, transfer or demotion.
B.	For such purposes, employees in an established line of progression (such as operating jobs within a power plant, jobs within a coal gang, and line workers systemwide) will be considered before those not in that line of progression.
C.	When non-supervisory employees covered by this Agreement are placed in supervisory jobs, their seniority, for this purpose, will be determined by the following:
27
Article V — Sec. 2
(1)	Temporary
(a)	Non-supervisory employees who are promoted to supervisory positions when there is a temporary increase in work load; when additional temporary supervisory manpower is essential; or when other comparable situations arise have a right to return to their former job classification at their former work location for a period of six (6) months following their promotion; however, the employee will not accrue 1600 or job seniority for time spent as a supervisor and they will not pay Union dues or remain on the call-out roster. In this situation, 1600 or job seniority will not be a criteria for selection. In order to maintain rights in their former Union job, they must be returned to non-supervisory status within six (6) months of the temporary promotion. If they return after the six (6)-month period, they will be placed in an entry level position and for 1600 or job seniority purposes will only be considered to be ahead of other employees with less than six (6) months of Company Service. It is further understood that the utilization of this provision is not intended to provide temporary supervisors on a continual basis to circumvent the creation of permanent supervisors.
(b)	Non-supervisory employees temporarily promoted to supervisory positions as replacements for supervisors who are off duty will be selected basically by job seniority at the work location provided fitness and ability are substantially equal. In this situation the employee will continue to accrue job Seniority, pay Union
28
Article V — Sec. 2
dues, and remain on the call-out roster. Pay treatment will be in accordance with Article VI, Section 4, Paragraph A of this Agreement.
(2)	Permanent
(a)	Non-supervisory employees who are promoted to supervisory positions have a right to return to their former job classification at their former work location for a period of twelve (12) months following their promotion. However, the employee will not accrue 1600 or job seniority for the time spent as a supervisor and they will not pay Union dues or remain on the call-out roster. In order to maintain rights in their former Union job, they must be returned to non-supervisory status within twelve (12) months of the promotion. If they return after the twelve (12)-month period, they will be placed in an entry level position and for 1600 seniority purposes will only be considered to be ahead of other employees with less than six (6) months of Company Service.
(b)	When former non-supervisory employees have held a supervisory position for twelve (12) months or longer and are returned to non-supervisory jobs, for disability reasons only, they will be placed in such a manner as to be able to perform meaningful work without adversely affecting the job seniority or overtime of employees in that line of progression. These cases will be referred to the Disability Committee for resolution.
D. (1) A transfer in this Paragraph D is defined as a change from one job to another in the same job classification and progression line.
29
Article V — Sec. 2
(2)	Employees cannot transfer to a job in the same progression line or change jobs to other progression lines during the first six (6) months of employment. Employees will be considered for promotions in their line of progression during the first six (6) months of employment based on their ability and job seniority. For posted job vacancies, employees with less than six (6) months’ Company Service may submit job bidding forms. However, only employees who have attained six (6) months’ Company Service must be given consideration for the posted job.
(3)	Transfer requests shall be made in writing by the employee before a vacancy exists and employees shall forward a copy to the Local Union Business Office. For seniority purposes, employees requesting a transfer will be considered on the basis of their job seniority in comparison to the job seniority of employees in the next lower job classification in the progression line. Transferred employees will retain their job seniority date for promotional purposes only.
(4)	Employees with more than six (6) months Company Service voluntarily requesting a transfer within the same job classification and same progression line are restricted to one (1) transfer every five (5) years for each job classification. This applies to all job classifications and all progression lines. No transfer requests will be allowed across progression lines.
An employee who was displaced and obtains a job at a different facility within their progression line will have no lime limits for honoring transfer letters as long as they are
30

33
Article V — Sec, 2
J.	If an employee, selected to fill a job vacancy, is delayed in reporting to such job because the Company is unable to release him, he will be credited with seniority from the start of the first pay period after the notification of his selection. If the new job represents a promotion for theem-ployee, the employee will receive the appropriate pay credit two (2) pay periods following the start of seniority credit, and will be considered on probation for a period of six (6) months from the day the employee reports to the new job.

K.	Voluntary and involuntary job changes shall be handled as follows:
(1)	When employees voluntarily or involuntarily demote in the same line of progression during the six (6) months' probationary period, they will demote to their former job classification at their former work location. They will receive job seniority in the lower classification for all time spent in the higher classification. Employees voluntarily or involuntarily returning from a job in another line of progression during the six (6) months' probationary period will return to the job classification at the work location where they last satisfactorily completed their probationary period. Employees voluntarily returning will receive no seniority credit in the job they return to for the time spent in the other progression line. However, seniority credit will be resumed starting with the first pay period after receipt of their written request to return. Employees involuntarily returning will receive seniority credit in the job they return to for the time spent in the other progression line.
34
Article V — Sec, 2
(2)	When employees involuntarily demote in their progression line after the six (6) months’ probationary period for reasons other than displacements, they will return to the next lower job classification they are capable of performing satisfactorily, which may result in subsequent promotions for other employees in the line of progression, unless a vacancy exists in the lower classification. Employees will receive job seniority credit in the lower job classification for the time spent in the higher classification.
(3)	When it is necessary to involuntarily return employees to jobs outside their progression line after the six (6) months’ probationary period, consideration will be given to the employee’s previous Company Service and experience. New seniority date for progression line and/or department service shall be established effective the date of the employee’s return. If such employees are returned to the job they previously held because a non-supervisory employee promoted to a supervisory position and subsequently returns within twelve (12) months of that promotion, the returned employee will receive seniority credit in the job they return to for the time spent in the other progression line.
(4)	To demote voluntarily after the six (6) months’ probationary period, employees may request to be placed in a vacancy in a lower job classification in the progression line they satisfactorily held, unless the lower job was not in the progression line when the employee promoted to the higher job. In this instance, the employee can demote to a position they did not hold. If a vacancy is not available
35
Article V — Sec. 2
and it is possible to demote the employee to a job classification he satisfactorily held in the progression line through subsequent promotions in the progression line, with the approval of the Company and Local Union Office, such a move may be initiated. For job seniority purposes, the employee will receive no seniority credit in the lower classification for time spent in the higher classification. However, if the employee subsequently promotes to the higher classification, he will be credited with the time previously held in the higher classification.
(5)	When a vacancy occurs within a progression line and employee requests for demotion and/or transfer are on record prior to the vacancy, they will be considered along with promotional candidates. Employees shall forward a copy of the demotion or transfer request to the Local Union Business Office. For seniority purposes, the consideration order will be determined by comparing their job seniority in their respective job classifications. The employee with the greatest job seniority date will receive first consideration.
L.	Posting Jobs
When a vacancy exists and a replacement is not available from the method of filling vacancies prescribed in Section 2 of this Article V, the Local Union Chief Steward and the responsible Management representatives shall arrange to post, for seven (7) calendar days, a notice of the vacancy to the extent deemed necessary and receive bids for the job.

ARTICLE VIII GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1. Sick Pay
A.	Sick pay allowances will be determined by multiplying an individual’s number of full years of Company Service completed, up to a maximum of thirty (30), times eighty (80) hours, and subtracting from this total the number of hours allowed with pay for sickness or injury in the preceding seven (7) calendar years and the current year to date. The net hours derived from this calculation, up to a maximum of 2400, represent the number of hours that may be allowed to the employee for time off due to a non-occupational illness or injury. The day an employee becomes ill is the date from which the sick pay entitlement for that period of disability is
57
Article VIII — Sec. 1 determined. Therefore, when a disabled employee crosses an anniversary date of Company Service or the date when the seven-year history under the Plan is updated, any additional entitlement is not available for the period of disability already in progress. However, the additional entitlement is available for future absences upon the employee's return to work.	. ,
B.	To be eligible for sick pay, an employee must have completed a period of employment of six (6) months and have properly reported the cause of the absence in accordance with established procedures. New employees who complete their six (6)-month probationary period will be eligible to borrow forty (40) hours of sick pay from the eighty (80) hours that they will be entitled to after one year of employment.
C.	All cases of illness or injury must be bona fide. If there is a question regarding the nature of the illness or injury, medical certification may be required. False claim for sick pay shall subject employees to disciplinary action.

Employees returning to work from the sixth occurrence of illness, and each subsequent illness within the year, without proper certification, shall have the period of absence charged to "Time Off Without Pay - No Permission."
(1)	Employees scheduled to work either Saturday or . Sunday, who are ill on one or both of these days, and properly report off, shall have up to a maximum of forty-eight (48) hours to obtain medical certification for the sixth occurrence of illness and thereafter.
E.	Employees will be notified when they have depleted approximately 80% of their sick pay and employees who
58

have utilized their full sick pay allowance will be considered for further sick pay on the earlier of the next anniversary of their Company Service date or on January 1 st following the adjustment of their seven (7) year history.
E The Company will pay the difference between the employee’s full pay and the amount paid by Workers’ Compensation for employees absent from work due to occupational disease or injury. The amount of time available for such allowances will be calculated in the same manner as basic sick pay under Paragraph A above. When such allowances are exhausted, employees will receive Workers Compensation and/or Long Term Disability payments in accordance'.with the eligibility requirements of those programs.
(1)	To be eligible for such payments, employees absent from work due to occupational injury must properly notify the Company of an accident before the end of the W-day during which it occurs, or at the beginning of the next W-day if the injury occurs during non-scheduled hours in the absence of a supervisor. Occupational disease must be reported as soon as possible but no later than fortyeight (48) hours after the onset of the disease to be eligible for the payments provided in this Paragraph.
G.	Employees who exhaust their full allowances for illness or injury under Paragraphs A and F above, and who are not on leave of absence, will be retained on Company records on a no-pay status for purposes of continuing eligibility for employee benefit plans for a period of time that, combined with the exhausted allowances, does not exceed 26 continuous weeks of absence from work.

Section 10.	Disabled Employees
A.	If an employee becomes permanently partially disabled and is unable to perform the essential functions of their regular job after reasonable accommodations have been made, or when a change in jobs is indicated by local physicians or specialists, the case shall be referred to a joint committee of Union and Company representatives known as the Disability Committee. The Committee shall study all factors and giving due emphasis to the length of service, pay and regular job, shall place the employee as advantageously as possible into a vacant position in which the employee is able to perform the essential functions satisfactorily. The disabled employee being reassigned by action of the Disability Committee will be given preference over any other employees, with less 1600 Seniority, for any vacancy they are capable of filling. The Joint Disability Committee will have access to Sections 1,2,4, or 8 of Article X to
74
Article VIII —Sec. 10
provide additional opportunities to permanently place this employee. The rate of pay shall be the same as that paid other employees in that position except as provided in Paragraphs B and C of this Section 10.
If there is a conflict in medical opinions, the employee shall be examined by an impartial physician or specialist selected by the Joint Committee and paid for by the Company. Employees will be provided meaningful work within their limitations and consistent with their current rate of pay until placement by the Committee.
If the Committee is unable to resolve a particular issue brought to it within 90 calendar days after the Committee receives all information pertaining to the case, the employee will be temporarily placed in the title of “Utility Person” until such time as the Committee places the employee in an available job consistent with the employee’s capabilities. Placement in the “Utility Person" classification will be on an incumbent only basis. Duties assigned to such individuals will vary depending upon their capabilities. The rate of pay shall be the same as that paid other employees for comparable assignments except as provided in Paragraphs B and C of this Section 10.
Employees in the "Utility Person” classification will be provided on-the-job training as the circumstances justify to improve their future job prospects.
Any unilateral placement by the Company without concurrence of the Committee may be submitted to arbitration in accordance with Article III of the Labor Agreement.
After having been placed in another job by the Disability Committee, employees with twenty (20) or more years of service will not be subject to further demotion, because of such disability, as long as they remain at work. However, when circumstances warrant, they may be reassigned other duties.
75
Article VIII —Sec. 10-11
B.	Employees placed in alternative positions as a result of disability shall receive the rate of pay and all pay increases applicable to the job classification to which they are assigned. However, if such assigned job has a lower rate of pay than their regular job, they shall not receive a rate of pay less than the following percent of their regular rate of pay in their former job at the time of placement if they have a period of employment of:
Less than 20 years - 75%
20 or more years -	100%
Should they recover from the disability, they may be employed in their former job with accumulated seniority and other privileges if they are physically and mentally qualified to perform the duties required.
C.	An employee assigned to a job having a lower rate of pay than their regular job under this Section 10 shall have their rate of pay reduced in accordance with the provisions of Article VI, Section 5 K (1).
Section 11.	Extended Illness or Temporary Disability
A.	An employee who is absent due to illness or temporary disability will accrue job seniority, 1600 Seniority, and Company Service during the entire period of time the employee is absent. Refer to Exhibit L for job seniority adjustments while on Long Term Disability.
An employee with ten (10) or more years of Company Service will be eligible for any promotional opportunities that occur within his progression line during the entire period of absence. An employee with less than ten (10) years of Company Service will only be eligible for a promotional opportunity that occurs within his progression line during the period of time resulting from the sum of his full sick pay entitlement plus vacation and Personal Time Off (Mini-Vacation) entitlements.
76
Article Vlll — Sec. 11
When a promotional opportunity occurs, the Company will contact the employee who is off duty to determine if he is interested in the vacancy. If the employee elects to promote and is accepted, the vacancy will be filled on a temporary basis and will be held for the employee. The employee's former job will then be filled on a permanent basis.
If additional promotional opportunities occur, the employee must again be contacted. Only one (1) job will be held for an employee; i.e., if he accepts a second promotion, the first one he accepted will be filled by another employee on a permanent basis.
When a promotion is held for an employee, the appropriate pay credit and six (6) months' probationary period will begin at the time the employee actually reports to the new job. The employee will be credited with job seniority from the start of the first pay period after notification of selection.
B.	All temporary transfers or substitutions made as a result of extended illness or temporary disability will be handled in accordance with Article VI, Section 4.
C.	Step increases or apprenticeship program increases and anniversary dates for employees who have been off duty for one pay period or more for reasons of illness or temporary disability or step increases for employees on modified duty who are not performing the primary duties of their job description will be postponed for a corresponding period. Additionally, general wage increases for employees off duty for one pay period or more for such reasons will be deferred until the employee returns to full duty unless the employee is on modified duty as the result of an on-the-job accident in which case the employee will receive the general wage increase applicable to the job the employee is performing.

(a)	Reemployment rights will only apply to the layoff provision.
(b)	Employees will be handled in the process below in order of their Local 1600 Seniority. '
(c)	If a vacancy is available in the same classification at the same location, the employee will be placed in the vacancy and no further action is required.
Section 2.	Box 2
Canvass the displaced employee’s progression line at the same location for volunteers to retire/sever to create an appropriate vacancy. An appropriate vacancy is a job at the same classification which the displaced employee must accept, or a lower or higher job in the progression line that the displaced employee is willing to accept. Employees who volunteer to retire to create an appropriate vacancy will receive the supplemental retirement benefits, as listed above, if they are at least 55 years of age.

87
Article X —Sec. 2-4
D.	Any vacancies created through this process will be filled by a progression line promotion. Employees will have 24 hours to accept or decline the promotion.
E If a vacancy occurs at a higher level, fill through a progression line canvass. If a displaced employee declines the promotion and no one in the progression line wants the job, then move to Box 6 without red tag.
If someone in the lower job takes the promotion and the displaced employee is willing to roll back, he will take the lower job rate of pay through pay tapering.
F.	If more than one employee at a work location volunteers for retirement or severance, the most senior employee (1600 Seniority) who would create an appropriate vacancy for the displaced employee may retire or sever.
Section 3.	Box 3
If the displaced employee has not been placed in Box 2, the displaced employee will bump the most junior employee (1600 Seniority) in the same classification at their current work location.
A. A bumped employee will be handled as follows: (1) All employees on the property as of May 18, 1998 will have full access to this placement process when they reach 10 years. Until that time, the employee will have LIFO*.
(2)	All employees hired after May 18, 1998 will have LIFO* until they reach 15 years, at which time they will have full access to the placement process.
Section 4.	Box 4
If Box 3 is not available, and if the displaced employee chooses a preferred location, canvass other preferred work
88
Article X — Sec. 4-7
locations in the same progression line for volunteers in the same rate or classification to retire or sever. The resulting vacancy must be at a location in a classification designated by the displaced employee. If a vacancy is created, the displaced employee will be placed in that vacancy and the process ends.
OR
Section 5.	Box 5
If Box 4 is not available or no location is selected, the displaced employee may bump the most junior employee (1600 Seniority) at the next closest work location where the same classification exists, in the same progression line.
OR
Section 6.	Box 6
At the same location, the displaced employee may rollback to next lower job in their progression line and bump the most junior employee (1600 Seniority) in that classification at 100% red-tag. However, those employees who decline a promotion in Section 2 Paragraph E will be pay tapered to the rate of pay for the job. If this option is available, but the employee declines and chooses to go to Box 8, the employee loses red-tag rate of pay. If this option is not available, go to Box 7 with 100% red-tag.
Section 7.	Box 7
At the next closest work location where lower jobs exist in the progression line, the displaced employee may rollback to the next lower job in their progression line that the displaced employee’s 1600 Seniority will allow and bump the most junior employee (1600 Seniority) in that classification at 100% red-tag. However, those employees who decline a promotion in Section 2 Paragraph E will be pay tapered to the rate of pay for the job. If this option is not
89
Article X — Sec. 7-8
available or not selected, the employee moves to Box 8 with a 100% red-tag rate of pay.
Section 8.	Box 8
Canvass all employees for volunteers to retire or sever. From this list, the displaced employee can select up to 5 progression lines designating job classifications and locations they are willing to accept. If a vacancy is created, the displaced employee will be placed in that vacancy and the process ends.
A.	Step 1 - In determining eligibility compare the displaced employee’s 1600 Seniority to the 1600 Seniority of the employee in the progression line who would be eligible to promote to the vacancy created by the volunteer. If the displaced employee has the 1600 Seniority and qualifications, they take the vacancy and allow the volunteer to leave.
B.	Step 2 - If the displaced employee does not have the 1600 Seniority and qualifications to fill the job of the volunteer, and has designated the next lower job as one of their preferences, fill the vacancy through a progression line promotion and then compare the 1600 Seniority of the displaced employee to the 1600 Seniority of the employee in the progression line who would be eligible to promote to the resulting vacancy. If the displaced employee has the 1600 Seniority and qualifications, they take the vacancy and allow the volunteer to leave.
C.	Step 3 - If necessary, continue this process until the displaced employee fits somewhere in the progression line where there is a volunteer holding a job designated by the employee.
90
Article X — Sec. 8-10
If the displaced employee cannot fit into any designated job in the progression line, then there is no appropriate vacancy created and therefore the volunteer cannot leave.
(1)	If Box 6 is available and the employee elects to go to Box 9, there will be no red-tag rate of pay.
(2)	If Boxes 6, 7, or 8 are unavailable or no selection is made in Box 7 or no progression line selected in Box 8, the employee can select from Box 9 at 100% red-tag.
OR
Section 9.	Box 9
If the employee is not handled in Box 8, he then moves to Box 9 selecting a bumpable level job (B-04 and below) by 1600 Seniority or moves to Box 10.
A.	If Box 6 is available and the employee elects to go to Box 10, the employee will assume the rate of the selected job through the pay tapering process.
B.	If Box 7 is unavailable or no location was selected, or if Box 8 was unavailable or no progression line selected or no job was selected in Box 9, the employee moves to Box 10 with 100% red-tag rate of pay.
OR
Section 10.	Box 10
Bump LIFO* employee based on 1600 Seniority and qualifications. The Union will handle employees in Box 10 within 30 days of the date the last displaced employee reaches Box 10. Employees displaced after the 30-day clock starts, if eligible, can go through Boxes 1 to 9 and wait until the current employees in Box 10 are handled. Both parties agree to cooperate in the administration of this process. All employees’ pay and expenses will be paid in accordance
91
Article X —Sec, 10-11
with the labor agreement. Employees not handled in Box 10, and who are eligible for a company offer as defined below, will move to Box 11.
Section 11.	Box 11
Except as provided in this section, no regular, full-time employee hired prior to May 18, 1998 who has attained ten (10) or more years of 1600 Seniority, or hired after May 18, 1998 who has attained fifteen (15) or more years of 1600 Seniority, shall be laid off because of a reduction, elimination or reassignment of work, unless the employee has exercised all of his rights under the placement process. In the event of such a reduction, elimination or reassignment of work, the employee will have access to the placement process stated above with pay protection signified by the term “red-tag". If the employee utilizes the placement process without securing a job, the company will select for the affected employee a job, which may then be available anywhere within the bargaining unit. If the employee selects this offer, their pay will be red-tagged unless previously lost in the placement process. In making such selection, the Company will consider the qualifications of the employee, his residence, his potential for training and contribution to company efforts now and in the future and his 1600 Seniority and that of other employees affected. Moving expenses will be paid by the company in accordance with Article VIII, Section 13. Company offers under this paragraph shall not be subject to Article III of the labor agreement.
*LIFO Eligibility Definition:
Employees hired prior to May 18,1998 with less than 10 years of 1600 Seniority.
Employees hired after May 18, 1998 with less than 15 years of 1600 Seniority.
92
Article X — Sec. 12-13
Section 12.	Notes
A.	If the employee is bumped in Boxes 3 to 9, go to Section'3 Paragraph A for processing.
B.	If the employee is bumped in Box 10 (LIFO employee), the employee can bump only those with less 1600 Seniority than he has.
C.	A displaced or bumped employee can elect enhanced severance/layoff/retirement at any step of the process.
D.	Any vacancy not created by this process will be filled in the following sequence: 1) recall of displaced employee, 2) progression line promotion/ demotion (includes transfers), and 3) post. If a displaced employee is the successful bidder and still has their red-tag, they will be awarded the bid job at their 100% red-tag rate of pay or at the rate of the job if it is higher. If the employee voluntarily leaves this bid job during the probationary period, the employee then becomes displaced and loses the red-tag rate of pay. If the employee involuntarily leaves the bid job, they will keep their 100% red-tag rate of pay.
E Employees who reject the.Company offer in Box 11 or are unable to select a position in Box 10 will retain their Article II rights.
Section 13.	Associated Issues
A.	Recall Rights - employees who are displaced will retain recall rights to their former progression line from which they were displaced for a period of 4 years as provided below. The demotion criteria are no longer applicable for recall.
93
Article X — Sec. 13
Employees may be considered for vacancies declared by the Company in either higher, equal or lower job classifications in their former progression line, based on the following order of consideration:
(1)	Same Job Classification - Employees who held the vacant job classifications prior to their placement in another progression line. Employees will be considered based on their Local 1600 Seniority ranking. Employees recalled to their former job will have their previous job seniority date restored.
(2)	Higher or Lower Job Classification - Fill through normal progression line promotion/demotion rules. Fill subsequent vacancies through #1 above.
Employees with return rights may request to be placed in their former progression line in a vacancy in a higher or lower job classification than the one from which they had been displaced if the vacancy is not filled through normal progression line rules. Employees will be considered based on their Local 1600 Seniority. Recall rights will be satisfied if the employee returns to a higher or lower job in the progression line.
These opportunities remain in effect for a period of four years from the date the employee accrues job classification seniority in another progression line, regardless of the number of opportunities extended. However, an employee who refuses recall back to their former job at their former work location will lose their recall rights.
94
Article X — Sec. 13
Returning employees who accept a lower level job in their former progression line will receive job classification seniority credit for the time previously spent in that job classification and will retain their red-tagged rate of pay, if applicable.
(3)	In the event the vacancy is not filled pursuant to Paragraphs 1 and 2 above, it will then be posted. If it cannot be filled through the posting process it will be filled through the reemployment provisions.
B.	Reemployment - employees, who have been laid off, shall have reemployment rights for 2 years. An employee who refuses a reemployment offer to their former job at their former location will be considered to be resigned.
C.	Red-tag - The term Red-tag shall mean the employee’s regular rate of pay shall not be reduced from that which he received in his former job and he will receive all applicable pay increases or portions thereof when the maximum rate of the job he is performing equals or exceeds such pay. Employees who are red-tagged and subsequently bid to a new progression line will retain their red-tagged rate if any of the jobs in that progression line are equal to or higher than their current position. Such employees who return to their former job during their probationary period will retain their red-tagged ■ rate of pay. If a red-tagged employee bids to a progression line/job with no equal or higher job, they will lose their red-tag and will assume the rate of the new job. Such employees who return to their former job during their probationary period will lose their red-tagged rate of pay. Comparisons will be at
95
Article X — Sec. 13
the top step of the jobs to determine whether it is an equal or higher level job.
D.	Bumping Criteria - see Exhibit A for the job titles and qualifications required in order for employees to bump into these positions.
E.	Probationary Period - does not apply to jobs accepted through this placement process (including progression line promotions associated with this placement process).

Material and Transportation
For Transmission & Distribution, Mechanical & Electrical, Transportation and Material work assignments within a region, if additional personnel are needed at a particular work location for normal work, the Company will retain the right to make the sole determination where personnel are needed, what classifications of personnel are needed and what work location or work locations will supply the personnel. The most junior employees, by job clas-sification/specialty, on the work location roster at
109
Article XII —Sec. 2
the supplying work location will be temporarily assigned to fulfill this need.
For normal intra-regional work assignments, the junior employee in a job classification/specialty will be assigned within twenty (20) miles from his regular headquarters. For subsequent intra-regional assignments outside twenty (20) miles requiring the same classification/specialty of employee from the same work location, the junior employee will be reassigned to the location outside twenty (20) miles. This reassignment will not apply to any intra-regional assignments within twenty (20) miles nor to assignments outside the region. No roster can be both a sender and receiver of employees of like job classification/ specialty for intra-regional assignments. (The intent of this paragraph is to assign the most junior employee by job classification/specialty first to intra-regional work assignments).
For normal work assignments outside a region, the most junior employee by job classification/ specialty in the region will be assigned. No region can be both a sender and receiver of employees of like job classification/specialty for inter-regional assignments.
When it is necessary to dispatch Local 1600 personnel on emergency inter-regional assistance and foreign utility assistance during scheduled or nonscheduled working hours, or intra-regional assistance during non-scheduled working hours, the Company will retain the right to make the sole determination where personnel are needed, and what classifications of personnel are needed and what work location or work locations will supply the per
110
Article XII —Sec. 2
sonnel. Employees will then be selected by job classification/specialty in conjunction with their position on the call-out roster at the time they are to be dispatched. However, for intra-regional emergency assistance started during working or extended hours, crews may be dispatched intact if it is deemed expedient.
Contractors may be assigned to a region to perform unscheduled critical work for no more than five (5) days while employees assigned to those rosters are shipped out.
Field Services - Generation
Field Services - Generation employees will have work rights on their plant rosters according to job classification seniority. Shipment of employees outside of their plant roster will be according to job classification seniority. No plant roster or quadrant can be both a sender and receiver of employees of like rates/skills. However, for assignment in or out of Susquehanna SES, management will select employees based on NRC requirements, such as, security clearance, radiation exposure, literacy requirements. The parties recognize the special requirements needed to work at Susquehanna SES; therefore, due to an inability to gain access to SSES, if may be necessary to send employees to an alternate roster. Contractors may be assigned to a plant or quadrant to perform unscheduled, critical work for no more than five (5) days while employees assigned to those rosters/quadrants are shipped out.
The parties recognize that situations may occur where it is necessary to take immediate action to
111
Article XII — Sec. 2
restore or maintain operating capacity of a generating station. In these situations, employees may be required to remain at a work assignment outside their roster/quadrant while other employees are brought in with like skills. Under these circumstances, the employees will remain outside their roster/quadrant for a period normally not to exceed seven (7) days and shall not exceed fourteen (14) calendar days. Those employees who remain outside their roster/quadrant during this period will be eligible for travel time and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including mileage, meals, and lodging where applicable for any days of the assignment in excess of seven calendar days.
General
Employees will be temporarily assigned to other work locations in PPL’s service territory as necessary.

Transmission line, distribution line, and telecommunications specialty designations will be retained until employees are qualified to perform the duties in the new jobs.
The number of specialties will be designated for each region and quadrant. Employees can apply for these designations and selections will be based on seniority and demonstrated ability. Employees desiring to designate a specialty will be given the opportunity based on the need within a classification at the region or quadrant. Employees will communicate their interest in a specialty by letter to management with a copy to the Local Union stating their classification and the specialty desired. Upon an anticipated need for the specialty within a classification, management will train the employee based on seniority in the classification of those who have submitted a request.
Employees who desire to discontinue their specialty status will submit a letter to management with a copy to the Local Union stating their intent to discontinue the specialty and reasons for the request. Requests for certified medical reasons will be granted. Other requests to discontinue a specialty
113

will be granted based on securing a trained replacement.
Field Services - Regional Electrician
Specialties
The following applies to specialties within the Regional electrical progression line. Acquiring these specialties will not affect the current job ranking seniority.
All employees in the Field Services - Regional Electrical Progression Line will be trained and qualified within their job classification to perform work on underground systems (URD). URD work will not be considered a specialty.
All employees presently in the Regional Electrical Progression Line, who previously held any of the former Electric Repairman titles will be considered as qualified to perform any work in that discipline with a Substation specialty.
All employees presently in the Regional Electrical Progression Line, who previously held any of the former Underground Repairman titles will be considered as qualified to perform any work in that discipline with a Network specialty.
Employees promoting or entering the Regional Electrical Progression Line at the Electrician classification or above shall indicate a preference within their respective probationary time frames.
For initial staffing, the Company will identify the number of Substation and Network specialties
114
Article XII — Sec. 2
needed at each roster location. The Company will select additional employees for the specialties based on the employees' preferred choice(s) by seniority. In the event the number of employees has not met the number of needed specialties at a roster location, the most junior employee in that job classification at that ros-ter location will be required to accept the needed specialty.
In the event the Company needs to increase the number of specialties at a roster location, the Company will offer the specialty to those employees who did not have their preferred choice for that specialty satisfied at that roster location by seniority. If the need is not met, the Company will canvass the employees at that roster location for new choices prior to requiring the junior employee to accept the specialty.
An employee may have multiple specialties. These situations may be approved after all employees in the job classification at that roster location have had their first choice preference for a specialty satisfied.
The Company agrees to maintain on a regional basis, for the duration of the labor agreement, a ratio of one (1) Leader to five (5) employees in the Regional-Electrical Progression Line, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

Section 3.	Staffing
A.	Temporary Furlough
In the event the workload declines to a level where there is a need to reduce the workforce, management will identify the excess ‘employees by job classification and roster location. The necessary reductions will be made in the following manner:
1.	Voluntary Furloughs: Employees at the identified roster location may volunteer for temporary furlough and they will be released on the basis of their job classification seniority, with senior employee given first choice. Second preference to volunteer will be given to employees in the same progression line at other roster locations and they will be released on the basis of their job classification seniority, with senior employee given first choice. Such temporary furloughs will be for specific time durations and volunteers will return no later than the specified ending date. There is no limit on voluntary furloughs.
118
Article XII —Sec. 3
2.	Rollbacks: If there are not enough volunteers, employees hired after May 18,1998, may either bump the most junior employee hired after May 18,1998, in their job classification and progression line or rollback to lower positions within their progression line based on their Local 1600 Seniority. If they do not bump another employee, they will be assigned to an available Utility Worker position closest to their home based on Local 1600 Seniority. In all cases, the employee will assume the rate of pay for the classification selected. Such employees will be subject to furlough or temporary assignments . to other classifications for up to twelve (12) pay periods per rolling year until they attain fifteen (15) years of Local 1600 Seniority.
3.	Employees on furlough will continue to accrue Company Service, Local 1600 Seniority, and • receive full benefits, excluding coverage for any injury while working for another employer.
4.	If employees are on furlough or rolled-back in this process, contractors cannot be utilized in such employees’ quadrant, region, or roster location to perform unscheduled, critical work the Company employees would have normally performed for more than five (5) days during any furlough period. If contractors are used and employees are not offered the opportunity to return, such employees will be paid at the rate of pay for their regular classification for all days that contractors work in their quadrant, region, or roster location.
B.	Utility Worker Pool
The parties agree to establish a pool of temporary employees, Utility Worker, to replace contractors performing Building Custodian, Handyman-Power Production, Handy-
119
Article XII — Sec. 3 man-Distribution, Groundman, and Laborer functions. This pool will also provide opportunities for employees covered under Article XII when their workload declines and it is necessary to temporarily reduce the work force. This provision will replace the use of Specific Temporaries in Article XII.
New employees will be hired to work as Utility Workers. Their Local 1600 Seniority will be the date of hire regardless of the number of layoffs and such employees are eligible to bid on posted jobs while actively employed. In the event a period of layoff exceeds thirteen (13) pay periods a new Local 1600 Seniority date will be established. They are not eligible for benefits and travel expenses nor guaranteed forty (40) hours per week. Utility Workers will receive the same employee benefits and entitlements as defined in Article V, Section 4, Paragraph A as Specific Temporary employees. If an employee is bumped by an Article XII employee, they can bump other Utility Workers with less Local 1600 Seniority.
The intent of this concept is to replace the contractors doing this work with Local 1600 employees. However, to meet temporary peaks for flaggers at a particular location, contractors may occasionally do this work.
When regular Article XII employees are assigned to this pool, they will be given the Utility Worker position closest to their home by Local 1600 Seniority and will continue to receive benefits and travel expenses in accordance with the Labor Agreement.
Utility Workers on layoff will have reemployment opportunities before a new employee is hired into the Utility Worker Pool.

1.	Modified duty resulting from an occupational disease or injury will be provided if the employee is able to perform satisfactorily.
2.	Modified duty resulting from a non-occupational disease or injury may be provided if the employee is able to perform satisfactorily.
Employees who are on modified duty as the result of an occupational disease or injury will have preference for any available work and for assignments closer to their permanent residence.

ARTICLE XIII CUSTOMER CARE CENTER
Section 1.	General
A.	The parties recognize that transition to a non-regu7 lated energy market will require the Company to develop new facilities, work groups, job descriptions, rates of pay, benefits and appropriate work practices.
B.	Currently, the Company is contracting out (outsourcing) the telemarketing functions while they explore and analyze the possibility to internally develop an infrastructure to support these functions.
123
Article XIII — Sec. 1*2
C.	Experience with this effort will be evaluated through July 1999. If it is determined that such work will continue to be required, steps will be taken to transition the work back to Local 1600, commencing no later than July 31, 1999. When this occurs, the new telemarketing job description, rate of pay, benefits, and other work practices will become effective.
Section 2.	Operating Rules and Understandings
A.	Overtime will be paid for time worked over eight (8) hours per W-day (Monday through Saturday) and hours worked on ST-days.
B.	Call-out and prearranged rosters will be established by Local 1600 and the Company. In the event agreement is not reached, Exhibit H will be utilized.
C.	The ratio of Customer Agents to Lead Customer Agents will be normally ten (10) and up to fifteen (15) to one (1). If beyond fifteen (15), another Lead will be established.
D.	Customer Care Center jobs will be considered bumpable level jobs per the Labor Agreement. Any employee who bumps into the Customer Care Center must be qualified and have successfully passed the appropriate job qualification test. Pay tapering will apply to employees electing these jobs.
E.	Customer Care Center employees having four (4) years of uninterrupted Local 1600 service within the Care Center progression line will be able to utilize the placement process per Article X. Time spent out of the line for the following reasons will not be considered a break in service, but will not be credited to the four (4) year period:
(1)	Bidding on posted positions and returning within six (6) month probationary period
(2)	Military leave of absence
124
Article XIII — Sec. 2
(3)	Personal leave of absence
(4)	Child care leave of absence
(5)	Medical leave of absence
(6)	Union leave of absence
This language will not restrict the employees’ option to bump within the Care Center before meeting the four (4) year eligibility requirement. Any employee entering the Care Center with Article X rights will retain those rights.
F.	If reductions occur within the Customer Care Center, employees wifi have the option to bump within the Customer Care Center by Local 1600 Seniority. The most junior bumped employee will be laid off unless there are contractors working whose work they can perform or they can bump a junior part-time employee working in the Customer Care Center. If the person affected was hired prior to May 18, 1998, they can exercise their displacement rights in accordance with Article X.
G.	All Customer Agents, Lead Customer Agents and Telemarketing Clerks will be subject to silent call monitoring, remote call monitoring and side by side call monitoring in accordance with the law.
H.	In the event the senior Customer Agent is assigned to substitute for a Lead Customer Agent for any reason, the substitute will be paid the appropriate CC-03 rate of pay if the substitution extends beyond one (1) day within the work week.
I.	While it is not the intent to fully staff the Customer Care Center with part-time employees, part-time employees will be utilized to efficiently address the work load and Company recruiting needs. Part-time employees will not be scheduled to work less than two (2) hours a day or more than twenty (20) hours a week. In the case of job sharing,
125
Article XIII — Sec. 2
Article XIV —Sec. 1
part-time workers will not exceed 25% of the total full-time staffing level by job classification.
J.	Employees will be offered the opportunity to bid and test for the positions of Customer Agent-Billing and Customer Agent-Calls semi-annually (every 6 months) in June and December. When a position vacancy occurs (determined by the approval date of the personnel requisition), it will first be offered to employees who have submitted a request for a lateral transfer. If no candidates accept or exist, the position will then be offered to the bidders who have successfully passed all of the required tests, and the telemarketing clerks, according to IBEW Local 1600 seniority. Employees who have submitted their bids but have not completed all of the required tests will have to wait until the next available vacancy after all of the required tests are completed.
K.	The parties agree to jointly develop all appropriate job qualification tests.
L.	All provisions of the Labor Agreement will apply unless modified by the above rules.

RULES:
1.	Employees must actually work a minimum of three (3) nonscheduled overtime hours.

5.	The rest period table is not applied to vacation days, holidays, paid personal time off and ST-days.
164
165
EXHIBIT B REST PERIOD TABLE ALL SCHEDULES
All overtime hours worked during the 12-hour period prior to starting time may be accumulated.
EXHIBIT C TWO MEN ON A CALL-OUT
tn an effort to insure proper understanding as to the number of employees to be called out, the following guidelines are set forth and are established on a sunset to sunrise basis.
A.	CALL-OUTS WHERE TWO EMPLOYEES WILL BE DISPATCHED FOR DISTRIBUTION LINE TROUBLE (Second man will be called from the applicable roster.)
1.	Fires of major proportions or where information indicated it is probable that a second man is needed to assist.

Good judgment must also be used in responding to emergency situations which may require that the first man available proceed promptly while the second man, if required, will follow in a second vehicle.
This item is concerned with call-outs only and should in no way restrict or change the present practices involving the work of employees in the Troubleman-FS or any other classifications.
167
EXHIBIT D NON-SUPERVISORY MOVING PLAN

LIVING, COMMUTING AND MOVING EXPENSES
A.	The following examples are situations where expenses will be paid in the manner so described:
1.	Promotions in a progression line to a different work location.
a.	Job has residence requirement, or
b.	Job has no residence requirement and it is mutually agreed that it is in the best interest of both the employee and the Company to have the employee live in the general area of his Job Headquarters. Company's decision will be made by the Labor Relations Department to get uniformity.

a.	Job has residence requirement, or
168
b.	Job has no residence requirement and it is mutually agreed that it is in the best interest of both the employee and the Company to have the employee live in the general area of his Job Headquarters. Company’s decision will be made by the Labor Relations Department to get uniformity.
Living, commuting and moving expenses will be paid.
3.	Promoting in a progression line or filling a posted job at the same work location.
a.	Job has residence requirement, or
b.	Job has no residence requirement and it is mutually agreed that it is in the best interest of both the employee and the Company to have the employee live in the general area of his Job Headquarters. Company’s decision will be made by the Labor Relations Department to get uniformity.

169
been reimbursed for moving expenses in the last two (2) years.
4.	Employee’s job and work location is moved from one (1) location to another location in the same general community.
5.	Moves of employees from one (1) Job Headquarters to another unless requested by the Company on a long-term basis.
REAL ESTATE EXPENSES
For all except A-2 and A-3 above, if the employee owns and resides in a home that must be sold to make a move to a new work location, the Company will pay the appropriate real estate commission fee if a realtor was utilized in selling the home. All other costs are the responsibility of the employee.
DEFINITION OF A MOVING PERIOD
Employees may elect to meet the residence requirement any time during the probationary period but no later than 90 calendar days after completing their probationary period unless an extension is granted. The 90 calendar day period for receiving Irving or commuting expenses will commence at the option of the employee but no later than the completion of the probationary period. During this 90 calendar day period, employees have a dally choice of either “staying over" or “commuting.”
CESSATION OF LIVING/COMMUTING EXPENSES
if employees are in the process of collecting Iiving/commuting expenses and during this period elect not to relocate to take the position, expenses shall terminate immediately.
If employees, in the process of collecting living/commuting expenses, are declared unacceptable to meet the requirements of the job, they will continue to receive expenses until they can be returned. However, expenses shall not exceed the prescribed time as allowed in the Moving Expense Plan.
EXTENSION OF MOVING PERIOD
This Plan allows as much as a 90 calendar day extension beyond the original normal 90 calendar day period in cases where
170
the employee is (1) experiencing difficulty in disposing of an existing residence, (2) obtaining quarters at the new location or (3) is obligated to delay his move because of family circumstances.
Where an employee is being held up on his move because of not being able to sell his home, the extension will only be granted if he can prove his “asking price” has been realistic. • If the employee requests, the Company will have independent local appraisals made at its expense.
If an employee has not moved his personal possessions within the moving period for which he is allowed living expenses, he will have his mover’s bills paid at such time when he actually moves, provided the move is made within one (1) year from the date he reports to his new job.
Likewise, if he has not sold his home during the period for which he is allowed living expenses, and subsequently sells his home within a year from the date he reports to his new job, the real estate commission fee, if applicable, will be paid by the Company.
In' considering if an extension is warranted, it must be ascertained to the satisfaction of the employee’s supervisor that real efforts are being made to effect the move and that there is a consequent real need for the extension. The principle of extension is never to grant more days than needed. There may be several extensions, but the total of such extension is not to exceed 90 calendar days, which, with the original 90 calendar day period, would result in a final limit of 180 calendar days.
BASIS FOR HANDLING MOVING EXPENSES
The following “ground rules" will be applied:
1.	Staying Over - Motel expenses and meals will be paid on a reasonable out-of-pocket basis. Weekly Round-Trip Home -Mileage allowance covering one (1) round-trip per week at the rate specified in the Labor Agreement.
2.	Commuting Daily - Mileage allowance as specified in the Labor Agreement.
3.	Familiarization Allowance - If an employee elects not to move and decides to commute on a continuing basis, his transportation will be paid for a period of two (2) weeks to enable him
171
to familiarize himself with his new work location,
4.	Selection of Mover - The employee must contact the Traffic Section of the Procurement Department, Allentown, to arrange for a reputable freight carrier to transport the personal household items of the employee and his/her family. The bill should be made out to PPL and it will be paid directly to the mover.
5.	Realtor Fee - Since the realtor fee is payable at the time of settlement, the employee may elect to pay this fee at this time and be reimbursed for these expenses, or may request that a check from the Company be prepared, payable to the realtor, for the appropriate fee.
6.	Appraisals - To assure that the employee is getting the true value for his home, and at the same time assuring that the employee’s asking price is realistic, a competent and impartial appraisal should be obtained no later than two (2) weeks after the effective date the employee reports to his new work location. If the employee is agreeable, the Company will have independent appraisals made at its expense.
7.	Tax Rulings - Under present law, regulations and interpretations, the Company is required to withhold Federal and State Income Taxes from certain items reimbursed under this policy. These items are subject to withholding at the time of payment and must be reported as part of the total wages shown on the annual W-2 form furnished to the employee. To help offset the additional Social Security Tax, Federal and State Income Taxes as a result of relocation, the Company will provide tax offset provisions (gross-up) for taxable items covered under this exhibit.
8.	Employee’s Responsibility - The employee who is eligible for reimbursement for expenses under this policy should carry out his plans and arrangements to move in a manner which will keep his related expenses to a reasonable minimum and at the same level as if he were incurring all such expenses for his own personal account.

4.	Refer to Article Vlll, Section 6 (F).
EXHIBIT F TEMPORARY CHANGE IN WORKING HOURS-SUBSTITUTION
To understand this provision, each situation must be addressed individually. This Exhibit separates Substitution from Temporary Change in Schedule.
1.	SUBSTITUTION FOR EMPLOYEE WHO IS OFF DUTY
a.	When notification of a schedule change occurs after the beginning of the work week in which the substitution is to occur, only the working hours of the substituting employee will be changed, not the ST-days.
b.	When notification of a schedule change occurs before the beginning of the work week in which the substitution is to occur, or the substitution continues beyond the end of a work week, the work schedule of the substituting employee will , become that of the relieved employee.
. In 1 (a) in accordance with Article IV, Section 4, Paragraph A (2), since the notification of the substitution occurred after the start of the work week in which the substitution is to occur, the substituting employee would receive 1 ‘/2X for the first change of working hours on the first W-day and the employee’s ST-days for that week would not be changed.
In 1(b) since notification of the substitution occurred before the start of the work week in which the substitution is to occur, the substituting employee would assume the schedule of the relieved employee.
Therefore, in 1(b) if the employee is notified before quitting time of his last W-day of the preceding work week, premium pay for the change is not applicable. However, if he is notified after quitting time of his last W-day of the preceding week but before the start of the work week, premium pay for the first change is applicable and he would assume the shift of the relieved employee.
When this occurs, (both 1 (a) and 1 (b)) - since it becomes in fact a substitution, the employee is relieved of his original shift assignment, therefore, meal allowances or rest periods which could be associated with the employee’s original shift.are not applicable. For substitution purposes, the meal allowance is applicable when:
174
1.	An employee is called out for substitution purposes on his ST-day or
2.	An employee is called out to substitute for split shift operation in which case the employee would retain the responsibility for his originally scheduled shift.
Utility classifications and operators or employees on extra duty assignments were specifically established to provide substitution for time off requests such as vacation, sickness and personal time off. Since these requests can be for less than a full week’s duration, it is possible for a utility employee to provide substitution for more than one employee in any one work week. In order to provide this multiple substitution, it is not practical to assign the utility employee the ST-days of one of the employees for whom the substitution is being provided. In such cases the ST-days are assigned as necessary to allow the maximum substitution. In many instances, due to time off requests, these employees' schedules cannot be determined until the week preceding the work week and, therefore, schedules are posted forty-eight (48) hours prior to the work week in accordance with Article IV, Section 3D. Subsequent changes for substitution after the forty-eight (48)-hour notice are governed by 1 (a) on page 1 of this Exhibit.
It must be remembered that substitution may have to occur with a minimum of notification, however, this in practically all cases is beyond the control of the Company.
2.	TEMPORARY CHANGE OF SCHEDULE
Temporary change of schedules (Article IV, Section 3, Paragraphs A (2) and (3)) occur as a result of the necessity to complete work on equipment that must be taken out of service and the work must be done outside normal working hours. This could include scheduled overhaul of equipment or unforeseen breakdown of equipment. In addition, in accordance with Paragraph (3) it may occur as a result of scheduling an employee to attend Company training schools or programs.
Excluding Paragraph (3), when this occurs, only the working hours of the employee’s W-days will be changed, not the ST-days. An exception here is equipment outages that have a direct effect on the operating capacity of power generating stations as specified in
175
the Labor Agreement where employee’s ST-days may be changed.
Article IV, Section 4, Paragraph (3) provides pay at IV2X for the first eight (8) hours working on a temporarily changed schedule. Should this occur on the employee’s ST-day, since the employee is already receiving premium pay, he would not be entitled to premium pay on the first W-day. In addition, if an employee has already been credited for a normal work shift for the day (i.e., worked or rest period) and is informed and incurs the initial change of shift as supplemental overtime on the same day, since he is already receiving premium overtime pay it would not in effect carry over to the next W-day. If the employee has already supplied one meal for the day in question, the Company will assume the additional meal entitlements. If the employee has not supplied a meal, he is responsible for the first meal as spelled out in Article VIII, Section 5, Paragraph A. In any case, if eligible, the employee is entitled to shift differential for the change of shift and work rules applying to shift workers become applicable.
On prearranged equipment outages and attendance at schools or training programs, since schedules are known in advance, the employee is usually notified well in advance of the change. On prearranged equipment outages, regardless of length of notification, the employee receives premium pay for the first eight (8)-hour change and is relieved of all responsibilities of his originally scheduled shift. In the case of attendance at schools or training programs, if the employee is notified forty-eight (48) hours before the beginning of the work week, overtime for a temporary change in work schedule will not apply. However, if notified less than forty-eight (48) hours before the beginning of the work week, the overtime will apply.
Unscheduled equipment outages or breakdowns are unpredictable and advance notification many times is impossible. In any event, once the employee is notified that his normal shift is changed, he is relieved of all responsibilities for his original shift. Premium pay will apply to the first eight (8)-hour change and allowances such as meal allowances and rest period for his original shift are not applicable.
176
EXHIBIT G CHILD CARE, PERSONAL, AND MEDICAL LEAVE OF ABSENCE
A.	CHILD CARE
1.	All employees, who have worked twelve (12) months and at least 1,250 hours in the previous twelve (12)-month period will be eligible for an unpaid child care leave of absence under the following conditions:
a.	Adoptive and natural parents will be eligible for a leave of absence up to a maximum of 52 weeks.
b.	Employees accepting a child for foster care will be eligible for a leave of absence up to a maximum of 12 weeks.
c.	The child care leave must be taken within 12 months of the birth of the child or placement of the child in the employee's custody.
d.	In the case of the natural mother, the leave of absence commences with the birth of the child for calculation of the duration of the leave.
e.	Employees will request and the Company will approve all requests for child care leave of absence.
f.	A written request to take a child care leave including the duration of the leave shall be submitted to the employee’s supervisor:.
(1)	In the case of the natural mother, who intends to take a leave of absence immediately upon the doctor’s certification that she is able to return to work, notification will be submitted as soon as possible but no later than the date that the doctor certifies that she is able to .return to work.
. (2) In all other cases, notification will be submitted at least 30 days before the date the leave is to begin or as soon as practicable where the need for leave is not foreseeable.
g.	Employees may request to take an intermittent leave or a reduced leave schedule to reduce their usual number of hours per day or days per week worked. This leave shall
177
not exceed twelve (12) weeks and the Company has the sole and exclusive right to grant or deny the request. The Company may temporarily assign an employee who is on intermittent/reduced schedule leave to an available alternative position, without loss of pay for time worked, if the employee is qualified for the position and it better accommodates the recurring periods of leave than the employee’s permanent position.
h.	When the child care leave of absence is granted, the employee's supervisor shall make arrangements to fill the employee’s job with a temporary or permanent replacement depending on the intended leave. The vacancy will be handled in accordance with the existing rules applicable to temporary or permanent replacements.
i.	Employee requests to return to work in advance of their scheduled date will be approved at the discretion of the Company.
j.	The employee’s current health benefits (Hospital, Medical and Surgical Insurance, Major Medical and Dental Assistance), at no cost to the employee, will be continued during the leave but shall not exceed twelve (12) weeks. However, HMO subscribers or employees paying spousal premiums are required to make contributions at the same level as before the leave began. Health care coverages at the level the employee had at the time of leave may be extended beyond the twelve (12) weeks if the employee pays the Company’s cost for the duration of the unpaid leave.
(1)	Female employees, who are on extended illness due to pregnancy and childbirth, will have this time included in the twelve (12) week maximum for Company-paid health care coverage.
(2)	If employees are married to each other and request a child care leave, their total combined entitlement for Company-paid health care coverage cannot exceed twelve (12) weeks.
178
(3)	The twelve (12) week entitlement of Company-paid health care coverage is renewed at the end of each pay period year and is not cumulative nor does any unused portion get carried over from year to year.
2.	Rights Upon Reinstatement
a.	Employees who are granted a child care leave of absence up to twenty-six (26) weeks, upon return to the Company will be reinstated to the same job, work location and rate of pay that they held prior to the child care leave of absence.
b.	Employees who are granted a child care leave of absence from twenty-six (26) weeks up to fifty-two (52) weeks, upon return to the Company, will be reinstated to a job at their former work location when an opening is available. If no opening is available at that work location, the employee will be considered for the first available job opening. Upon reinstatement, the employee will receive the rate of pay applicable to that job. However, the employee will have a commitment to the first job vacancy in the employee's former job classification at his/her work location. Employees will lose this commitment if they voluntarily change jobs before the commitment is fulfilled. Employees who refuse a vacancy offered by the Company at the termination of the child care leave of absence will be considered to have resigned.
c.

Example 1:	An employee whose normal vacation entitlement is fifteen (15) days takes a child care leave commencing September 1, 1991 retaining three (3) days of vacation. The leave terminates March 1, 1992. When the employee returned he/she will have worked 8/12 of 1991 and will work 10/12 of 1992. Therefore, in 1992 the employee would receive 8/12 of his/her vacation entitlement or ten (10) working days (rounded to the closest whole day) plus the three (3) retained vacation days. These vacation days may be scheduled alter April 1,1992. In 1993, the employee would receive 10/12 of his/her vacation entitlement which is thirteen (13) days.
Example 2:	An employee whose total vacation entitlement is 96 hours is granted a paternal intermittent child care leave without pay encompassing twelve (12) full weeks (3 months) in 1994.

185
EXHIBIT H
CUMULATIVE OVERTIME PROCEDURES
1.	Whenever necessary, the Company will maintain rosters ol certain employees likely to be called and will select from these rosters such employees as are needed on a cumulative overtime basis by job classification.
2.	Overtime will be assigned with an attempt to equalize the opportunity for overtime by job classification at a work location.
3.	Separate rosters will be maintained for call-out and prearranged overtime. Equalization of overtime for call-out and prearranged work will be separate.
4.	In areas of the Company where calls involving overtime are not the responsibility of the Customer Service Representative Shift, the appropriate supervisor initiating the calls shall be responsible for administering the provisions of this Exhibit.
5.	Total call-out overtime hours contiguous to an employee’s regular shift (before or after) which exceed two (2) hours will be charged to the cumulative overtime call-out roster. The supervisor will inform the Customer Service Representative Shift as soon as possible after the overtime work is completed so the cumulative call-out roster can be adjusted accordingly.
6.	Employees will be charged for time worked or time offered. Time offered includes situations such as, employee is not available for work; there is no answer; telephone line is busy; employee isn't home; employee reports sick after having worked his regular shift. In these cases, time offered will be chargeable for any call-outs up to the employee’s normal starting time the next day.
7.	The amount of time charged to a person is determined by the number of hours worked by the employee who responds to the call or works the prearranged job.
8.	For vacation and sickness purposes, it will be the employee’s responsibility to inform the supervisor and the party responsible for initiating the call (in most cases the Customer Ser
186
vice Representative Shift) when the employee should be taken off and put back on the roster. If the employee fails to do so, he will be considered as available for overtime work and charged accordingly. In cases where an employee is unavailable to notify the Customer Service Representative Shift (i.e. hospitalized, etc.), the supervisor will inform the Customer Service Representative Shift of the employee's unavailability on behalf of the employee and will so inform the employee. However, when the employee is again available, it will be the employee’s responsibility to initiate the appropriate notification.
9.	Employees entering a progression line or promoting into a higher classification will be assigned the amount of overtime equal to the average overtime of the employees in that classification.
10.	Normally, the person called/assigned first is the person with the least amount of overtime, providing continuity of work is not adversely impacted by a work unit change, or unless the ■ skills necessary are not available; or in cases of extreme emergency. In these situations, it is necessary to inform the bypassed employee of such action giving reasons for the bypass. Bypassed employees and employees who are inadvertently missed will have the opportunity to equalize the overtime by remaining low person on the cumulative overtime list. While the Company cannot assure complete equalization of overtime, periodic review between the appropriate Steward and the responsible supervisor should provide assurance that the effort is being made to the extent possible.
11.	The call-out roster will be updated on a daily basis and the prearranged roster will be updated per prearranged job. The Customer Service Representative Shift will provide current reports to the field locations.
12.	It is understood by the parties that the clerical responsibilities for the call-out roster maintenance will have no effect on the Customer Service Representative Shift’s rate of pay.

EXHIBIT I JOB CHANGE REQUESTS FOR ENTRY LEVEL OFFICE JOBS CONCEPT POSITIONS
In accordance with Article V, Section 2, Paragraph M of the Labor Agreement, the jobs of Steno/Clerk-Entry, Customer Service Clerk, Operator-Printing Services, Assistant Operator-Office Services, Mail Clerk, Enrollment/Billlng Clerk, and Clerk-Cash Receipts will be filled by newly hired employees. However, employees may request a job change to one of these positions. If such requests are submitted prior to the vacancy, employees shall be considered on the following basis before hiring from the street, provided they meet the minimum entry requirements for the position.
1.	Requests from employees in the same progression line in the same division* if qualified and performing satisfactorily in existing position.
2.	Requests from employees in other OJC progression lines in the same division* if qualified and performing satisfactorily in existing position.
3.	Requests from employees in OJC progression lines from other divisions* if qualified and performing satisfactorily in existing position.

RESIDENCE REQUIREMENTS
As an electric utility providing an essential service to a public which is rapidly becoming even more dependent upon our service, we recognize our responsibility to provide such service with the highest possible degree of continuity.
Although much can be and has been done to meet this responsibility by the installation of modern facilities, in the final analysis it can only be fully accomplished by having sufficient numbers of key personnel available to report for duty rapidly when emergency conditions arise.
STATEMENT OF POLICY
All jobs designated in Article IV, Section 7 of the Labor Agreement have residence requirements and as such will be governed by the following statements:
1.	The residence requirement in accordance with Article IV, Section 7, Paragraphs A and B stipulates employees must live within thirty {30) miles' driving distance between home and their Job Headquarters. Distance is defined as the mileage driven on the most commonly used roads.
2.	All new employees and all employees in jobs that are not designated as having a residence requirement, who wish to be considered for jobs which are designated as having residence requirement, must agree to move to a location within the prescribed requirements to the Job Headquarters or forfeit the right to be considered.
3.	Employees who are incumbents in a line of progression and are assigned to a Job Headquarters as of the date of this Agreement and whose jobs will now have a residence requirement will not be asked to move to retain their present job and will be considered for any future promotions in that line of progression at that particular Job Headquarters. However, should these employees desire to be considered for promotions or transfers in other lines of progression or other work locations within their present line of progression, they will then be expected to meet the residence requirement of that job. For example, a Journeyman Lineman is assigned to
189
a Job Headquarters "A” and his home is beyond the prescribed travel limitations. He need not move to retain his present job and he will be considered for any future promotion at Job Headquarters “A". However, should a promotion become available to him at any other work location, he must then agree to meet the residence requirements of that job. In addition to the above, if employees decide to relocate their residence while in their incumbent position, they will be required to comply with the residence requirement. Incumbent employees with residency waivers will continue under those waivers.
4.	Any employee who has agreed to move as a condition for placement in a job who subsequently refuses to honor his commitment shall be demoted or transferred to a job not having a residence requirement.
5.	Employees who are handled under the placement process will not be required to move to accept a job with residence requirements. However, such employees will be subject to the uniform residence requirement outlined above if they subsequently bid into jobs shown as having such a requirement.
6.	In addition, if the Company establishes a new Job Headquarters either through consolidation of facilities or by building new headquarters, employees whose jobs have residence requirements will not be subject to the new requirements as long as they continue to work at the new headquarters.
7.	It will be the joint responsibility of the employee and his supervisor to see that the provisions of the uniform residence requirements are maintained. However, disputes regarding the interpretation of the residence requirement will be resolved by the Local Chief Steward and the supervisor involved.
8.	It will not be mandatory that employees be required to move during the probationary period of their new job. They will, however, be required to conform to the provision of this policy within 90 days after the probationary period ends, unless an extension is granted by mutual agreement due to extenuating circumstances.
9.	The Non-Supervisory Moving Plan (Exhibit D) will apply.

SECURITY SCREENING ACCESS AUTHORIZATION PROGRAM
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires Nuclear Power Plant Licensees to have personnel security programs that are in conformance with 10 CFR 73.56 Personnel Access Authorization Requirements for Nuclear Power Plants. In compliance with this, the Company has developed an Access Authorization Program for employees who will work at Susquehanna SES or who will be involved with Susquehanna SES in any way. The program involves a screening process consisting of a background check and psychological evaluation which has been described in full to the Union. Any changes to this program will be discussed with Local Union 1600 before they are effective and the Union will receive copies of the Fitness For Duty Manual (FFD) and the Site Access Program Manual (SAPM) and be kept informed of any proposed changes. Therefore, the Company and Union agree upon the following with regard to non-supervisory employees:
L Confidentiality of all information obtained during the security screening process will be protected as described in the "Site Access Program Manual." Neither the employee’s supervisor nor the employee’s Union representatives will have access to this information unless the employee gives express written authorization to the Site Access Services Supervisor to release the information to the individual or individuals stated in the authorization.
II.	Access authorization processing will be accomplished in accordance with the “Site Access Program Manual.” The Local Union will be notified when a determination is made with regard to the denial of access for one of their members.
III.	As part of every job posting for positions at Susquehanna SES or for positions that are involved with the Plant, there is a statement in bold print at the top of the posting notifying candidates that they will be subject to security screening and will be required to obtain unescorted access authorization in
191
order to remain at Susquehanna. During employment interviews, the individuals are advised that they may be subjected to a background check and psychological evaluation for the purpose of determining eligibility for unescorted access authorization, and are asked to sign written authorization to this effect. If an individual refuses to sign such an authorization, he/she will not be considered for employment with the Company.
IV.	In accordance with Article II, Section 3 of this Agreement employees hired prior to September 27, 1976 are subject to the following security screening guidelines:
A.	Employees who agree to access authorization screening and are granted unescorted access as described in the Site Access Program Manual will be able to remain in their present position at Susquehanna SES; or will be eligible for work at Susquehanna on a temporary basis or permanent basis. This also applies to employees who will be involved with Susquehanna, but are not necessarily required to work at the Nuclear Plant.
B.	For all employees who agree to access authorization screening but are denied unescorted access (denials) or employees who refuse to give authorization for screening (refusals), and employees whose unescorted access has been revoked (revocation) the following will apply:
(1)	A committee of representatives of Union and Management will be established to handle denials and refusals. The name of the committee will be the Susquehanna SES Access Authorization Committee. The make up of the Committee shall consist of two members designated by the Union and two members designated by Management. A fifth and impartial member will be selected and utilized by both parties as necessary.
(2)	In the case of denials:
(a)	For an employee presently working in a position at Susquehanna, or involved with the Plant, the Committee will determine where the employee
192
should be placed. This will be dependent upon such factors including but not limited to job vacancies, employee’s present and former position and the employee’s work record. Anything uncovered in the access authorization screening process will not be made known to the Committee handling the employee involved. The decision made by the Committee will be final and binding and not subject to Article III of the Labor Agreement.
(b)	For present employees who may be needed for work at Susquehanna on a temporary basis, although these individuals will not be able to be sent to Susquehanna they will be used for assignments at other locations.
(3)	In the case of refusals:
(a)	The employee will be required to provide the Company with a written statement that he/she has refused to participate in the access authorization screening process. A copy of this statement will be sent to the Local Union Office.
(b)	The employee will be advised that upon his/her refusal, the employee has a right to have the Committee review his/her refusal.
(i)	If the employee asks for a review, the Committee will review the facts and make a finding as to the validity of the employee’s refusal and the action to be taken. If the Committee reaches agreement, this determination will be final and binding and not subject to Article III of the Labor Agreement. If the Committee cannot reach agreement, it will submit the case to a mutually agreed upon arbitrator, the fifth member of the Committee as specified above. The arbitrator's decision will be final and binding and will not be subject to Article III of the Labor Agreement.
193
(ii)	If the employee decides not to go before the Committee, the Company will weigh the facts and then unilaterally take a position with regard to the person's employment status. This determination will be subject to Article III of the Labor Agreement.
(4)	In the case of revocation:
(a) In addition to the appeal process in the Access Processing Manual and the Labor Agreement, any matters pertaining to revocation and subsequent placement of an employee will be resolved by the President-Financial Secretary of the Local and the Vice President-Human Resources.
V. In accordance with Article II, Section 3 of this Agreement employees hired after September 27, 1976 will be required to participate in the access authorization screening process. They will be subject to the conditions in IV B (2) (a) and (b) of this Exhibit. The Company shall maintain the sole and exclusive right to determine the employment status of employees refusing io enter the Program and Article III of this Labor Agreement shall not apply.

They shall receive job seniority and Company service credit for the duration of their LTD absence. If a vacancy is not available when they are certified to return, they shall bump the junior employee in their former job classification at their former work location, provided the job classification vacancy created by the employee who left on LTD status was filled. In cases where the job classification vacancy is not filled and the employee returns from the LTD status, placement will be handled per paragraph H of this Exhibit L.
2.	Employees either notifying the Company or returning to the Company after six (6) months, but less that two (2) years from the effective date of their LTD status shall return to their former job classification and former

When they return to their former job classification at their former work location, their job seniority date will be adjusted for the period of their absence. However, Company service shall be credited for the duration of the leave. If a job vacancy in their former job classification at their former work location is not available, employees shall be returned to an available job vacancy within the scope of their experience and skills with a commitment to their former job classification and work location. They shall receive the rate of pay commensurate with paragraph H of this Exhibit L.

EXHIBIT N JOB EVALUATION PROCESS
This Exhibit embodies the understanding of the parties relative to the evaluation process for Bargaining Unit job descriptions. This process will determine salary grades for newly created or revised job descriptions that are submitted to the Job Evaluation Committee with a request for evaluation.
Job Evaluation Committee
The Job Evaluation Committee consists of six primary members, three members appointed by IBEW Local 1600 President and Financial Secretary and three members appointed by the Director-Labor Relations. The committee will have a pool of a minimum of six (6) secondary members who are appointed as identified above for substitution purposes. If a primary member is unable to attend a committee meeting, it is their responsibility to secure substitutes. A minimum of four committee members (two bargaining unit and two management) must be present to determine a final evaluation of a job description. All members, including secondary members, of the Job Evaluation Committee must complete team building training.
Job Evaluation Process
A request to evaluate a newly created job description is initiated by department management. Following submission of a REQUEST FOR JOB EVALUATION/REEVALUATION FORM, Labor Relations will assist the department in uniformly formatting a JOB DESCRIPTION PART I FORM. The Company will review the new job description with Local 1600 prior to forwarding it to the Job Evaluation Committee.
Upon receipt of a request for evaluation, the Job Evaluation Committee will select individuals with knowledge of the job being evaluated for interviews. The committee will compile all information received and evaluate the position. Decisions of the committee will be made by consensus. (If the team cannot reach agreement on the appropriate level for a particular factor, the team has the flexibility to assign a value between two levels to gain consensus). The
205
JOB DESCRIPTION PART II FORM will become part of the job description after it is completed by the Job Evaluation Committee. Their determination of the proper rate of pay will be furnished to Labor Relations and Local 1600. This determination shall not be subject to Article III of the Labor Agreement.
A request to reevaluate an existing job description may be initiated by an incumbent employee or appropriate supervisor completing a REQUEST FOR JOB EVALUATION/REEVALUATION FORM. Information provided must indicate significant changes to the job description that warrant a reevaluation. If departmental management does not approve the request, Bargaining Unit employees may appeal the decision to the office of Local 1600. If the request is approved by department management, the revised job description will be forwarded to Labor Relations for uniform formatting and discussion with Local 1600. The decision to forward a revised job description to the Job Evaluation Committee shall be jointly made by Labor Relations and Local 1600. Disagreements regarding whether to submit a reevaluated existing job description to the Job Evaluation Committee shall be resolved through the grievance procedure.
Upon receipt of a request for reevaluation, the Job Evaluation Committee will select a representative number of incumbents and supervisors, including the initiator, to complete an evaluation questionnaire. The committee will also select individuals for interviews with knowledge of the job being evaluated. The committee will compile all information received from the questionnaire and interviewees and evaluate the position. Decisions of the committee will be made by consensus. (If the team cannot reach agreement on the appropriate level for a particular factor, the team has the flexibility to assign a value between two levels to gain consensus). The JOB DESCRIPTION PART II FORM will become part of the job description after it is completed by the Job Evaluation Committee. Their determination of the proper rate of pay will be furnished to Labor Relations and Local 1600. This determination shall not be subject to Article III of the Labor Agreement.
206
Miscellaneous.
The filling of newly created positions and the pay treatment of employees who fill them will be in accordance with the Labor Agreement.
Pay treatment for all incumbent employees in an existing job that is reevaluated to a higher salary table by the Job Evaluation Committee will be to the salary step on the new table which corresponds to the step attained on the lower table. Their next step date will remain the same. Such increases will be effective at the beginning of the first pay period following the receipt of the request to reevaluate the existing job description by Labor Relations and Local 1600. In the event an existing job is reevaluated to a lower salary table by the committee, the pay of incumbent employees shall be red-tagged effective at the beginning of the first pay period following the Job Evaluation Committee’s determination.
