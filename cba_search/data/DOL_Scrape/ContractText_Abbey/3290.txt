Duties which require such certification are those where interpreting services involve officials from law enforcement and/or Child Protective Services. The unit member’s immediate supervisor must authorize the performance of such duties. The differential will be paid in increments of one (1) hour for each full or partial hour worked requiring RID certification. Such differential will amount to placement on the next higher salary grade which is approximately ten percent (10%) above the unit member's regular salary.
Section 8:	INITIAL PLACEMENT ON THE SALARY SCHEDULE
A.	Position Class. A unit member will be placed in the job class appropriate to the assigned position.

In such instances, the Deputy Administrative Officer, Human Resource Services Division, or designee, will provide written notification to the Union. When such a merit increment has been granted, a new anniversary or annual increment due date will be established if such placement is at a step less than the maximum for the job class.
Section 10:	HOURLY AND DAILY PAY CALCULATIONS
Hourly pay rates for regular classified unit members on monthly salaries and for temporary unit members assigned to job classes on the regular classified salary schedule are determined by dividing the monthly rates by 173.33. (This divisor is an industry-wide norm which represents the average number of working hours in the work month.) Daily pay rates are determined by multiplying the hourly rates by the number of regular hours assigned per workday.
Section 11:	PART-MONTH PAY CALCULATIONS AND DEDUCTIONS FOR MONTHLY PAID POSITIONS
A.	A newly hired unit member will have the initial monthly rate adjusted to the number of days of service rendered multiplied by the daily rate. A terminating unit member will have the terminal monthly rate adjusted to the number of days of service rendered multiplied by the daily rate. Pay so determined for that month will not exceed the unit member's regular monthly rate.
B.	A unit member who is promoted or demoted other than on the first workday of the month will have the pay for that month prorated on the basis of the number of days worked in the month in each job class. In this instance only, the daily rate will be determined by dividing the monthly salary by the number of potential workdays in the month including mandated and declared holidays.
20
ARTICLE 7. WAGES
Section 11 (continued)
C.	Salary reductions for all unpaid time in accordance with negotiated contracts and district policy and procedure will involve a reduction in pay at the unit member's daily rate for each day of absence. Total reductions so determined will not exceed the unit member's regular monthly rate. No pay will be drawn when such days missed involve a full calendar month regardless of the number of workdays in that month. Salary reductions for fifty percent (50%) sick leave will be at one-half (1/2) of the unit member's daily rate.
D.	An unit member changing mid-year from a conventional work year schedule to a yearround schedule (or vice versa) will have the conventional assignment pay calculation (based on the mid-month promotion rule above) and the year-round pay calculation (based on a daily rate) completed so as to result in equal monthly payments for the remainder of the school year.
The initial pay in the new assignment will be a balancing payment. Year-round classified unit member monthly rates are determined in the following manner: 1) The number of days of service in the traditional work year for the job class is multiplied by the daily rate, determined in accordance with the daily pay calculation method (monthly rate/173.33) X 8, to determine an annual salary. 2) Inasmuch as the year-round assignment has the same number of paid days, the annual salary so determined is divided by twelve (12) to establish the year-round monthly rate.
Section 12:	COMPENSATION FOR WORKSHOP PARTICIPATION
The California or federal minimum wage rate (whichever is higher) applies to regular monthly classified unit members of the San Diego Unified School District who participate in workshops at the request of the District. This rate will be paid only for workshop participation outside the unit member's normal workdays and/or hours. Such qualifying workshop participation will be paid at the straight or overtime workshop participation rate in accordance with the rules and regulations as set forth in this Article.
Unit members who are required to attend workshops at the request of the District will be paid at their regular straight or overtime rate of pay in accordance with the rules and regulations as set forth in this Article.
Section 13:	UNIT MEMBERS TRANSFERRING BETWEEN SALARY SCHEDULES

Section 14:	PROMOTION
A.	Promotion From Another Classified Salary Schedule: A unit member who is promoted from a position on another classified unit members' salary schedule to a position on the Paraeducator Salary Schedule with a higher maximum salary will first have his/her salary determined in the appropriate grade of the other classified salary schedule in accordance with existing regulations and then will be paid at the rate in the appropriate salary grade on either salary schedule which would provide an approximate five percent (5%) increase (exclusive of special pay additives) but not more than seven and one-half percent (7.5%) increase. In no case shall the salary step placement exceed the maximum for the appropriate salary grade. If a service increment is due the unit member at the time of promotion, it will be credited and applied in the determination of the new salary step.
B.	Promotion Within Paraeducator Salary Schedule. A unit member who is promoted from one job class on the Paraeducator Salary Schedule to a higher job class will be placed on the step of the higher salary grade which is at least one full salary grade or approximately five percent (5%) (or, if there is no such step, seven and one-half [7.5%]) in amount above the unit member's salary exclusive of special pay additives at the time of promotion. If a service increment is due the unit member at the time of promotion, it will be credited and applied in the determination of the new salary step.
C.	Next Service Increment. If a service increment is not immediately due at the time of promotion to a higher job class, it will be granted in the higher job class on the same date it would have been granted in the lower job class. If a service increment is not due at the time of promotion to a higher job class because the unit member has already reached the maximum step on the salary grade of the lower job class, a new service increment due date will be effective on the anniversary date (first day of the month in the month promoted for unit members promoted between the first [1st] and fifteenth [15th] of the month; first [1st] day of the month following the month promoted for unit members promoted on or after the sixteenth [16th] of the month), and additional service increments due will be granted beginning one (1) year thereafter until the maximum salary for the job class is reached.
D.	A unit member who voluntarily accepts a demotion and who is promoted to the former higher job class within thirty-six (36) months will be placed on the step of the appropriate salary grade that was held prior to such demotion.
E.	Temporary Out-Of Class Assignments. A unit member temporarily assigned to perform higher level duties not reasonably consistent with those prescribed for the regular job class for more than four (4) workdays within a fifteen (15) calendar-day period will receive an upward salary adjustment. The salary adjustment will be effective for the entire period of such temporary assignment. The amount of the adjustment will be the same as would be provided by the regular promotional rules as determined by Director, Classified Personnel.

Section 15:	PLACEMENT IN LOWER JOB CLASS
A.	Demotions Due to Unit member Request or Disciplinary Reasons. When a permanent unit member is placed in a position in a lower job class in the same type of work at the unit member's own request or if a permanent unit member is demoted in accordance with The Employment Regulations for the Classified Service of the San Diego Unified School, the salary step placement on the salary grade for the lower job class will be that which is approximately five percent (5%) (or, if there is no such step, seven and one-half percent [7.5%]) in amount below the unit member's salary in the higher class. Unit members who reach the maximum step in the higher class or on a step in the higher class which is more than seven and one-half (7.5%) above the maximum step of the lower job class will be placed on the maximum step of the lower class. The increment due date will remain unchanged until the maximum salary for the lower job class has been achieved. If the reassignment is to a position in a lower job class with a different type of work the step placement on the salary grade for the lower job class will be at the same dollar rate. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade, the unit member will be placed on the step that will result in the smallest reduction in pay from the current dollar rate.
B.	Demotions Due to Classification Review or in Lieu of Layoff. When a permanent unit member is reassigned to a position in a lower job class resulting from classification review of the position, or demoted in lieu of layoff, or for some other reasons in the district's best interest, the unit member will be placed on the step at the same dollar rate, exclusive of any special pay additive, if such rate appears in the lower salary grade. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade because the demotion is from a half grade to a whole grade, or vice versa, the unit member's salary will be changed to the step which provides the smallest reduction in pay from the current dollar rate. The increment due date will remain unchanged until the maximum for the lower job class has been achieved. If the rate does not appear in the lower salary grade because the maximum rate is less than the unit member's current pay rate, the unit member's salary, exclusive of any special pay additive, will be maintained as it was prior to demotion for a period not to exceed eighteen (18) months unless the maximum for the lower job class is changed to exceed the previously achieved salary. At the end of the eighteen (18) month period, the salary will be changed to the maximum for the lower job class. A permanent unit member so protected and who is assigned on a temporary basis, for up to ninety (90) calendar days, to a position in the job class from which he/she was demoted in lieu of layoff will be placed on the same salary step of the range for his/her job class as that held at the time of demotion. When such temporarily reassigned unit member is again moved to the lower job class, he/she will receive the same dollar rate as was originally protected and the original eighteen (18) month period will be extended for each month or major fraction thereof during which the unit member was temporarily promoted.
C Reemployment Rights for Unit Members reassigned to a position in a lower job class resulting from classification review of the position will be determined in the same manner as in Article 18, Layoff and Reemployment, Sections 8 and 9.

Section 15 (continued)
D.	When a probationary unit member is reassigned to a position in a lower job class for any reason, the step placement on the salary grade for the lower job class will be determined in the same manner as in Section 15.A.
E.	When a probationary unit member is permanent in a job class on a lower salary grade in the same occupational field and is reassigned to a position in a job class lower than the highest held permanent position in that occupational field due to demotion in lieu of layoff the salary protection rights in the highest held permanent position in that occupational field shall be determined in accordance with the provisions in Section 15.B.
Section 16:	CLASSIFICATION STUDY
A unit member may request a classification study of his/her position by completing a Position Classification Review Form, obtaining all necessary signatures, and forwarding the request to the Human Resource Services Division in accordance with the timelines specified in District procedure 7540.

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
Judge: Judith McConnell Department 51
This settlement agreement (the Agreement) is made and entered into by and between the
San Diego Unified School District (the District) in order to avoid the expense and risk of further litigation
The District confirms that, effective with the spring term of the 1997-98 school year, it will discontinue the designation of employees as Certificated Classroom Teacher Assistants (CCTA’s) and will require all existing CCTA’s to work within and meet the qualifications for Classroom College Student Workers (CSW’s). This does not restrict the District’s right to employ workers outside its classified service, provided they fall within a statutory exemption from the classification requirement. Each party acknowledges that the execution of the Agreement does not constitute admission of, or concession to, any argument, premise or position of the other party.

TERMS
Reassignment of Seniority Dates
1.	Each party shall appoint an equal number of representatives to a joint committee (the Committee) to implement this agreement. CSEA committee members shall be given reasonable paid released time for the work of the Committee.
2.	The Committee shall identify all paraeducator classified workers currently employed by, on a leave of absence from, or on a reemployment list of the District who were employed by the District outside the classified service for any period of time on or after their hire dates.
3.	The Committee shall identify the reason(s) each such classified worker was excluded from the classified service for any portion of their employment.
4.	The Committee shall verify from District records whether each exclusion from the classified service falls within a statutory exemption from the classification requirement.
5.	In every case where District records are inadequate to support a statutory exemption, the classification seniority date shall be changed to include the period of employment within the classified service.
6.	Once all changes to and additions of classification seniority dates have been made, all workers whose names appear on the revised seniority lists shall be notified and provided a

7.	The seniority lists as determined by the Committee following the appeals shall be presumed to be correct
Restoration of Positions and Hours
8.	No work regularly performed within the Unit shall be performed outside the unit except by
CSW’s or substitutes who fall within the definitions listed in this agreement. The District
must maintain and permit CSEA to inspect copies of registration forms and transcripts to prove the number of course units enrolled in and for which credit was received by each CSW each fall and spring semester or equivalent.
9.	All hiring and changes of hours of paraeducators, CSW’s or substitutes and all layoffs, bumps and transfers of paraeducators shall be controlled by the District's central office, subject to negotiations with CSEA, where applicable, and approval by the Board of Education. No such personnel change shall be approved without identifying the classification and position.
10.	Upon request, the District shall furnish CSEA with listings of all paraeducators and CSW’s employed by the District showing each worker's classification and position equivalent, if any, and work location. Position numbers will also be furnished when they become available.
11.	If a Unit position is reduced or eliminated and the work must continue to be performed, or the work is reinstated, it shall be assigned only to workers in the Unit. In no event shall this work be performed by volunteers, so-called hourly workers, CSW’s or workers in other units, nor shall any paraeducator be offered hourly employment in order to avoid being laid off, reduced in hours or displaced. Laid off paraeducators will not be replaced with CSW’s, and existing Unit positions that become vacant will not be filled with CSW’s.
If the District eliminates a Unit position in the future, it shall maintain a record of the

position showing its work location.
12.	Two percentages shall be used to assist in monitoring compliance with paragraph 11. “The Unit percentage” is 55% or the District-wide number of full-time-equivalent (FTE) paraeducator-filled positions as of the end of the 1997-98 school year divided by the total of FTE paraeducator-filled positions and FTE CS W-filled positions as of the end of the 1997-98 school year, whichever is higher. A FTE paraeducator-filled position is 8 hours per day. A FTE CS W-filled position is 6 hours per day. “The benefited percentage” is 55% or the District-wide number of paraeducators who are incumbents of positions assigned 4 hours or more per day as of the end of the 1997-98 school year divided by the total number of paraeducators as of the end of the 1997-98 school year, whichever is higher.
13.	Upon request, the District shall famish CSEA with all information relevant to whether the District has met the provisions of paragraph 11, above. For monitoring purposes, the Unit percentage and the benefited percentage, although calculated from District-wide figures, shall be applied to each work location. If in the future either percentage, when calculated from FTE positions or paraeducators at a particular work location, falls below the levels specified in paragraph 13, the parties shall meet upon the request of CSEA to determine the reasons for one or both of the percentages being below the specified levels. The District shall have the burden of demonstrating that, notwithstanding the lower percentage(s), it is in compliance with paragraph 11, above.
14.	Classified workers in the Unit who have a classification seniority date changed pursuant to paragraph 5 shall be paid for all wages, benefits and other emoluments of employment lost after December 19,1995 as a result of their improper exclusion from the District's classified service.
15.	The parties agree to meet promptly and attempt to resolve any disputes arising under the Agreement. Nothing will prevent the parties from agreeing upon methods of resolving such disputes short of going to court.

SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
CALIFORNIA SCHOOL EMPLOYEES
ASSOCIATION, CHAPTER NO. 759

119
GUIDELINES FOR THE REASSIGNMENT OF SENIORITY DATES WITHIN THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE (Paraeducator Unit)
GOAL OF RESEARCH: Account for all time served as an hourly employee. Within the rules established below, determine whether the service was consistent with Education Code classified service exemptions and, if not, determine how the service should be applied to seniority within each classification and to district seniority.
GENERAL RULES
The work histories of all Paraeducator Unit employees will be studied. Included in the review are current supervisors and confidential employees with prior service in the Paraeducator Unit.
2.	Many employees have current hire dates that are the same as their seniority dates. Do not exclude these employees as errors have frequently been found in the current hire dates. For work performed from 1974 until the present, the current hire date can be verified (within the month) by examining microfiche payroll records.
3.	Do not exclude employees on leaves of absence or reemployment lists.
4.	The terms and definitions of the SDUSD/CSEA Agreement settling San Diego Superior Court Case No. 00707784 prevail over conflicting language in these guidelines.
DATES TO BE REASSIGNED
1.	Classification seniority date
120
2.	District seniority date
SOURCES OF INFORMATION
1.	Departmental files
To the extent that a particular department maintains employee files that contain relevant information, such as copies of assignment authorizations or personnel action forms, these files may be helpful in researching seniority dates. Much of the information contained in such files is available elsewhere but is not so easily accessible.
2.	Human Resources Services Division file
A limited amount of information is contained in files in HRSD. These files are useful for documenting separations, original hire dates and original classifications. Beyond that, they have little value.
3.	Microfiche pay records
Payroll information on microfiche does not extend back beyond 1974. The microfiched pay histories will tell if the employee was in paid status and under what group (classified hourly, classified monthly, certificated hourly, food services monthly, food services hourly). Note: The term "classified hourly" is an oxymoron used by Payroll. One is either classified or hourly, not both. The microfiche records are helpful in reviewing separations, current hire dates, continuity of service, and to determine prior service in another classification. Microfiche records will rarely tell you where the employee was working while hourly. Generally, all hourly work was reported as location 000 or 998.
4	Employee History (microfiche)
Microfiched employee histories provide a comprehensive record of classified assignments of current empldyees (excludes hourly service). These records are useful in documenting original classification, promotions, demotions, temporary out of class, and layoffs. In addition, the
121
records show restricted status assignments that have been converted to regular status. The information contained in these records should be verified, where possible, by other documentation (i.e. personnel action forms, assignment authorizations) as errors in status codes and dates have occasionally been found.
5.	Mainframe
The on-line personnel system contains information that is limited to assignments since July 1, 1988, including hourly assignments.
6.	Information supplied by the employee
When all other sources of information have been exhausted and employee history is still not complete, it will be necessary to ask the employee to provide additional information (i.e. pay stubs, personnel action forms). If the employee cannot provide documentation but does have a recollection of their former work, the information gained may be useful in researching other records (i.e. timesheets from archives).
APPLICABLE BUT NOT EXHAUSTIVE EDUCATION CODE EXEMPTIONS FROM THE CLASSIFIED SERVICE
Students
"Student worker" is defined as a person employed part time by the District who is a full time college student. Full time student status is generally recognized by college institutions to be enrollment in not less than 12 course units each semester or equivalent. For the definition of "College Student Worker" (CSW) or "Certificated Classroom Teacher Assistant" (CCTA), see page 2 of the Agreement settling San Diego Superior Case No. 00707784.
Substitutes
"Substitute" is defined as a person employed by the District for not more than 194 working days, including holidays, sick leave, vacation and other leaves of absence, and who is employed either:
122
a.	to replace a classified worker who is temporarily absent from duty, or
b.	to fill a vacancy in a classified position which the District is engaged in a procedure to hire a permanent worker to fill the vacancy, provided the District does not fill the vacancy with one or more substitutes for more than 60 days.
Short-Term Workers
"Short-term worker" has been defined by the San Diego Superior Court as a District employee who is employed and paid for less than 75% of the school year (195 working days, including paid leaves) and who is employed to perform specific services that are not extended or needed on a continuing basis, regardless of his or her trade.
PARTICULAR SITUATIONS
Service in Multiple Job Classes as Hourlies
To determine proper seniority for employees who were misclassified as hourlies in more than one job class, standards will be used to identify which out-of-class assignments will be treated as:
a.	promotions to a higher job class
b.	legitimate temporary out-of-class work, or c. voluntary demotions to a lower job class
First test:	Was the employee working daily in the
second classification? If work was not regular and continuing, the assignment was considered a legitimate use of temporary out-of-class.
Second test: If the work was regular and continuing, and in a higher job class, and if the employee did not return to their former classification, the second job class is considered a promotion. (If they returned to their former classification, the
123
assignment is legitimate TOC.) If the work was regular and continuing, and in a lower job class the assignment in the second job class is considered a voluntary demotion so long as the employee was not concurrently and regularly employed in a higher class.
Temporary Out-of-Class Assignments
Education Code 45110 requires districts, as prescribed in that section, to adjust the compensation for classified employees working out-of class. The Education Code does not stipulate the reasons for such employment or the amount of time an employee may be maintained out-of-class. Employees may have been employed out-of-class. No change should be made to any time served in class as a result of TOC appointments, so long as the employee has received full credit for TOC time in his or her classification.
Restricted Status
The Education Code provides that employees who were hired under Restricted Status for the CETA program or with ESEA funds and subsequently hired as probationary employees would have their original date of hire recognized for seniority purposes. (Education Code 45105 and 45105.1)
Where restricted status appointments were used improperly, the time served shall be revised to regular classified status.
Separations
When an employee resigns or is terminated by the district, they lose their seniority.
Since hourly and probationary employees were ineligible for leaves of absence, it is necessary to review separations in light of an employee’s change of status. For example, if the employee was forced to resign due to health reasons as an hourly, he/she would have been eligible for a leave of absence as a monthly. (See Leave of Absence section below.)
Microfiche pay records can be used to verify separations determined not to be leaves of absence. In some cases, the
124
employee may be separated from one job class or location but continue to work in another. The microfiche pay records should document that employment was continuous.
Leaves of Absence
There are several types of LOA’s. Long-term leaves for illness or injury are not considered a break in service (Education Code 45192, 45195) . For other types of leaves (i.e. professional study), the guidelines are found in the collective negotiations agreements (the collective negotiations agreements limit continued seniority accrual while on leave to health and pregnancy).
For LOA’s where seniority does not continue to accrue, the lost days of service are totaled and "subtracted" from the employee’s revised classification seniority dates. Calendars for each of these adjustments should be kept so that the adjusted date can easily be reviewed in the future.
Transfer Between Classified and Certificated Job Classes
If an employee of a school district employed in a position in the classified service is assigned to a position in the same district requiring certification qualifications, the employee shall retain all sick leave, vacation, and other rights and benefits accumulated by the employee at the time he or she is assigned to a position requiring certification qualifications. All seniority and permanency rights shall be secured to the employee during the period of time he or she occupies a position in the certificated service. The employee's return to the classified service at any time shall be treated as if there had not been an interruption in his or her classified service. (Education Code 44064)
Voluntary Demotion
When an employee accepts a voluntary demotion, he/she continues to accrue district seniority. If the employee is later reemployed in the higher classification, the time served in the lower class does not count towards seniority in the higher class.
Demotion in Lieu of Lay-Off
125
If an employee accepts a demotion in lieu of lay-off, he/she retains but does not continue to accrue classification seniority in the previous (higher) classification.
Reclassifications
Where seniority involves work that was subsequently reclassified, the new classification is assigned as of the effective date stipulated by Wage and Compensation at the time the study was done, unless the parties agree on a different date, consistent with the Education Code.
FOLLOW-UP PROCESS FOR REVIEW BY EMPLOYEE
After research is completed for the classified employees in a department/site, the following actions shall be jointly undertaken by the District and CSEA:
1.	Send each employee (including those whose dates will not change) a summary of their employment history with the recommended revisions. A period of ten (10) days will be allowed for review by the employee. After reviewing the recommendations, if the employee agrees with the conclusions, the employee will be asked to sign a form indicating their agreement. Upon their signature, a change in their seniority dates will be authorized. If they do not agree with the information provided, their response needs to include the dates and classifications with which they disagree as well as their assessment of the correct dates and classifications. If the employee fails to return their form within the ten (10) days allowed, the revision will automatically be accepted.
2.	A follow-up process will review all contested employment histories.
