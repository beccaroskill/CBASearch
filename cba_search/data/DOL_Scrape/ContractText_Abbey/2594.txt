WITNESSETH:
WHEREAS, the parties have, by negotiations and collective bargaining, reached complete agreement on wages, hours of work, working conditions and other related, negotiable subjects to be incorporated into a new Labor Agreement which shall supersede all previous verbal or written agreements in conflict with or modified by this Agreement applicable to the employees in the bargaining unit defined herein which may have existed between the Employer and the Union or between the predecessor of the Employer, if any, and the predecessor of the Union, if any.
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the execution of this Agreement and the full and faithful performance of the covenants, representations and warranties contained herein, it is mutually agreed as follows:

The Employer and the Union agree that all employees working in classifications listed in Exhibit 1 are properly within the bargaining unit. Any classification established by the Employer not listed in Exhibit 1, where all of the employees' duties are covered by this Agreement, shall be a part of this Agreement at a wage rate comparable to related job classifications.
1.0	2. Open and Excluded Classifications.
Non-bargaining unit employees shall perform no bargaining unit work except such occasional work as is reasonably connected with or incidental to the proper and orderly conduct of the hotel operations they are supervising.

At its sole option, the Employer may notify the Union who shall assist the Employer in obtaining applicants who meet the qualifications required by the Employer. When applicable, the Union's selection of applicants for referral shall be on a nondiscriminatory basis, and shall not be based upon or in any way affected by membership in the Union or the Union's bylaws, rules, regulations, constitutional provisions or any other aspects or obligations of Union membership, policies, or requirements, or upon an applicant's race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, disability, perceived disability, or history of a disability.
The Employer shall be the sole judge of an applicant's suitability, competence and qualifications to perform the work of any job to be filled. The Employer may accept or reject any applicant for employment in accordance with applicable laws.
When the Employer considers applicants for employment who have not been referred to the Employer by the Union's dispatch office, the Employer shall, in order to maintain a consistent and orderly process, advise such applicants that in order to obtain employment they must be dispatched by the Union's dispatch office in accordance with the regular procedures of that office. The Employer may designate to the Union's dispatch office by name the Employees that shall be dispatched for available positions. The Union will process these applicants within four (4) hours during which the Union's referral service is open for business. If there are any problems with processing of applicants, the parties will review such problems and make such changes as necessary. At the Employer's option, during periods of substantial hiring by the Employer, the Employer shall make available on its premises a suitable room for the private use of the Union, which shall for the period designated by the Employer operate its dispatch function with respect to this Employer from such room, and may also use such room for the provision of information about the Union, the Collective Bargaining Agreement, and benefit program assistance. The Employer shall provide the Union on a timely basis with copies of the names, social security numbers, and job titles of all Employees hired by the Employer.

The above provisions relating to controlled substances will not apply to medicine lawfully prescribed for the employee using the substance by a licensed physician and used in accordance with the prescription. Upon the discharge or suspension of any employee for reasons other than dishonesty, the reason therefore shall be given to the employee in writing, and a legible copy thereof shall be mailed or given to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours after the discharge or suspension. When an employee is discharged or suspended for willful misconduct, the notice shall contain the specific conduct or offense deemed by the Employer to constitute willfill misconduct. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in making the discharge or suspension, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or by the Employer's own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request. The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for discharge or suspension of the Employee.

The Union shall furnish the Employer with copies of its inquiry to guests and of the guests' responses to any Union inquiry within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt. Copies
...
HILTON GRAND VACATIONS - ELARA
of videotapes shall also be provided upon request, provided the Employer has the copying capability and if the Union pays the reasonable costs for furnishing the copy.
6.02. Warning Notices.
Warning notices issued to employees must specify the events or actions for which the warning is issued. Warning notices shall be issued to employees as soon as possible after the Employer is aware of the event or action for which the warning notice is issued and has a reasonable period of time to investigate the matter; but in any event, except for the second shift when the immediate manager is not on property, warning notices shall be issued to employees only at the end of a shift. The employee shall be required to sign all warning notices for the purpose of acknowledging receipt. A legible copy of any written warning notice issued to employees shall be mailed or given to the Union within seventy-two (72) hours after its issuance by the Employer. Upon request by the Union, legible copies of all documents relied upon by the Employer in issuing the warning notice, including copies of any written complaints or reports concerning the employee, either by a customer, an outside agency, or by the Employer's own employees, and copies of any relevant cash register tapes, shall be furnished to the Union within three (3) working days after such request. The names and addresses of customers who make written complaints against an employee shall be furnished to the Union on request if such are relied on by the Employer as a basis for the warning notice. An employee may not be issued a warning notice solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. Warning notices, written customer complaints and reports of outside agencies or of the Employer's own security force concerning conduct of an employee shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.03. Time of Discharge.
Except as provided in Section 7.02, no employee shall be discharged on his/her day off or while on vacation or leave of absence.
6.04. Disciplinary Suspension.
No employee shall be suspended or laid off or have his/her shift, station or days off changed for discriminatory reasons, or for disciplinary purposes unless a prior written warning has been given the employee except where the suspension is for one of the enumerated causes for discharge. Any suspension, including a suspension pending investigation, is disciplinary and may be grieved under Article 21 unless it is (a) for the purpose of active investigation of the employee’s conduct based on reasonable suspicion of conduct warranting termination or suspension without prior warning as defined in Section 6.01(a), and (b) for less than two weeks (or, if longer, while the Employer waits for the results of drug or alcohol testing or the employee is subject to ongoing criminal-law proceedings for an alleged violent or sex crime). An employee may not be given a disciplinary suspension solely on the basis of verbal complaints by customers. Suspensions shall become null and void one (1) year after the date of issuance and may not thereafter be used as a basis for or in support of any subsequent discharge or disciplinary action.
6.05. Mitigation of Damages.
Any employee covered by this Agreement who is discharged by the Employer and who disputes his/her discharge was for just cause shall have an affirmative duty to mitigate any potential damages which might result to the Employer in the event the discharge involved is subject to Article 18 Grievance and Arbitration and an arbitrator overrule^ the discharge.

ARTICLE 7:	REPORTING PAY
7.01. Reasons for Payment.
When the Employer or its representative orders an employee to report for work, or fails to notify an employee not to report for work as previously scheduled, for any reason, and said employee is not allowed to work, the Employer shall pay the employee at the employee's regular rate of pay for the hours actually worked or four (4) hours, whichever is greater.

If any holidays specified in Section 12.01 occur during an employee's vacation, the employee shall receive an additional day's pay for each such holiday. Vacation pay shall be paid only at the time of vacation. At an employee's request, pro rata vacation pay shall be paid at the time of the layoff, provided the employee is entitled to at least five (5) days' vacation pay.

Where FMLA governs instead of this Article, or where leave is available both under FMLA and under this Article all of the requirements for a leave under FMLA must be met by the employee. Where this Article governs, only the requirements set forth in this Article, and not those in FMLA, must be met by the employee.

The Employer shall assign the employee to work the shift and hours consistent with the needs of the business and availability of light duty work, and without regard to restrictions upon a weekly guarantee. In any event, employees assigned light duty work shall be paid at least the temporary total disability rate required by Nevada Law.

In the event a bargaining unit employee is assigned and accepts light duty work within the bargaining unit, all applicable provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, subject to the modifications and restrictions set forth herein, shall apply to such employee, including accrual of seniority, and grievance and arbitration. In addition, the employee shall comply with all Company, House, and Departmental rules to the extent required under Section 20.02.
In the event a bargaining unit employee is assigned and accepts out-of-bargaining unit light duty work, the Employer shall make contributions on behalf of the employee pursuant to Article 22 of this Agreement. In the event of a termination, the employee shall be entitled to all rights in accordance with Articles 6 and 17 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement except in the event of an arbitration, the arbitrator's power shall be limited to restoring the employee to their pre-injury bargaining unit position.

(b)	Classification seniority is an employee's length of continuous service in years, months and days from the employee's most recent date of hire into or transfer into his/her present classification on a full-time basis.
(c)	In the administration of this Agreement each of the classifications listed in Exhibit 1 is a separate and distinct classification.
17.03. Layoffs and Recalls.
(a)	In the event of layoffs due to a reduction in force, probationary employees within the affected classification(s) will be the first to be laid off. Employees will be laid off from and recalled
if
- 24 -
HILTON GRAND VACATIONS - ELARA
to their regular job classifications in accordance with their house seniority, provided they have the qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work available in their regular job classification. It is the responsibility of the employee to advise the Employer of a change in either address or telephone number. In accordance with their seniority, employees in layoff status will be offered, but not required to perform (subject to subparagraph [c]), all extra work in their classifications except for banquets or parties, before extra employees are hired, before steady extra employees are offered such work, and, to the extent practical, before regular employees are assigned to work their sixth (6th) day, but shall not be covered by the provisions of Section 9.03.
(b)	In the event of a layoff because of circumstances affecting only a portion of the establishment such as a room closing, the affected employees may be laid off without regard to house seniority, provided the layoff is scheduled to be fourteen (14) days or less, or, in the case of housekeeping department employees, the layoff is scheduled to be seven (7) days or less.
(c)	Employees to be laid off in accordance with Section 17.03(a) may be laid off without regard
to their respective house seniority as each completes his/her current workweek. At the time of layoff the employee shall state availability or nonavailability for extra work; where the employee indicates availability, the employee shall not be called for extra work after he/she refuses two (2) out of seven (7) offers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an employee may declare unavailability for extra work for a definite period while on layoff.
(d)	Schedule Realignment Post Layoff.
When a layoff occurs and positions are to be eliminated, the senior employees whose shifts are to be eliminated shall displace the junior employees on that shift. Then the junior employees on that shift shall replace the junior employees overall. This shall be done by house seniority.
Following the layoff affecting full-time classification, department will create a new departmental master schedule. The order of schedule alignment will be in the following order: 1) those full-time shifts that match the new schedule will not be altered or affected; 2) those full-time shifts that do not match the new schedule will be altered by up to two hours from the employee’s current shift either way to match the new schedule based on classification seniority; 3) those full-time shifts that do not match the new schedule will be altered by changing days off (remain consecutive days off) to match the new schedule based on classification seniority; 4) the remaining positions that cannot be altered to match the new master schedule using the process outlined above shall be required to bid. The department will post any vacant new master schedule shifts for bid using classification seniority. An employee that fails to bid a posted full-time shift will be assigned any remaining shift by management.
(e)	Recall Procedures.
Employees shall be recalled to their regular job classifications in accordance with the following procedures:
(1)	If a position is restored less than ninety (90) days of when it was eliminated, and if the person who held it is still actively at work, the person is returned to the position, or if the person who held it is on layoff, the most senior person on layoff is recalled to it, except that if multiple people on layoff are to be recalled at about the same time to several positions that have been restored or created, and the person who formerly held the position
-25-
HILTON GRAND VACATIONS - ELARA
is one of those to be recalled, then the person is returned to his/her former position regardless of the relative seniority among those to be recalled.
(2)	If a position is restored ninety (90) days or more after it was eliminated, or a new position is created, it is put up for bid. This is true even if the person who formerly held the position is still actively at work. All regular employees may bid, but laid off employees may not bid. If there are no bidders, the most senior person on layoff is recalled to the position and cannot refuse it.
(3)	Employees who obtain a position by bidding shall not be eligible for another transfer under this subsection or under Section 20.04(b) for six (6) months. Those who are transferred to a position without bidding remain eligible for transfer under those provisions.
17.04. Promotions and Preference for Shifts.
(a)	When the Employer promotes an employee to another classification, the Employer will consider the employee's seniority, qualifications to perform satisfactorily the work in other classifications, and prior performance, provided that a Food Server, before being promoted to Captain, must have passed the Captain's examination conducted under the auspices of a committee, at least one (1) member of which who shall be qualified and experienced in the craft, shall be designated by the Employer, and provided further, any employee before being promoted to the classification of Bartender must have passed the craft examination for the Bartenders conducted by the Union. Where qualifications to perform the work in the other classifications are relatively equal among employees, the senior employee shall be the one promoted. For purposes of this paragraph, a "promotion" shall be deemed to be a transfer to another classification in which the transferred employee has an opportunity for increased compensation or for subsequent job progression as a result of the transfer. Permanent vacancies to be filled by promotion under this paragraph shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours near the employees' time clock or other location to which employees have regular access. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period. An employee promoted under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work of the job to which promoted shall be transferred back to his/her former job, shift and station within thirty (30) shifts worked after the date of the promotion.
All promotional opportunities within the bargaining unit shall be posted. The Employer will give preferential consideration to qualified bargaining unit employees for these openings. The Employer and the Union agree that the goal is to maximize the availability of promotions for qualified employees. The Employer's promotion decisions will not be arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. Employees who successfully complete the Southern Nevada Joint Management Culinary & Bartender Training Fund training program or the Employer's in-house training program for a classification covered by this Agreement shall be considered qualified for that classification for purposes of this Section.
(b)	When there is a permanent vacancy, or a temporary vacancy of at least ninety (90) days, on a particular shift or station, employees in the same job classification on other shifts or stations who desire to transfer to the vacancy will be transferred on the basis of their classification seniority, provided that the senior employee desiring transfer is qualified to perform satisfactorily the work on the shift and/ur station applied for and that a qualified employee is available to replace the
-26-
HILTON GRAND VACATIONS - ELARA
employee desiring to transfer. An employee transferred under this Section shall assume the weekly schedule of days of work and days off, and the daily shift scheduled, applicable to the vacant position to which he/she transfers, and the employee shall not be eligible for another transfer under this Section for six (6) months. An employee transferred under this Section who cannot perform satisfactorily the work on the shift or station to which transferred shall be transferred back to his/her former shift and/or station within thirty (30) shifts worked from the date of transfer. The resulting vacancy or vacancies created by a transfer under this Section shall be filled by the next senior qualified employee(s) from another shift and/or station who desires to work on the shift or station where the vacancy exists. Permanent vacancies under this paragraph shall be posted for seventy-two (72) hours in the department where the vacancy exists. The Employer may fill the vacancy temporarily during the posting period.
17.05. Break in Continuous Service and Seniority.
An employee's continuous service, seniority and status as an employee will be broken when:
(a)	The employee quits.
(b)	The employee is discharged for just cause.
(c)	The employee is absent exceeding the period of an authorized leave of absence.
(d)	The employee is absent, due to injury or illness sustained during tire course of
employment, exceeding the period for which statutory, temporary, total disability payments are payable under tire EICON, provided that the employee shall have one (1) week after his/her release in which to return to work. However, the time required for an appeal through the appeals officer level shall not, in and of itself, constitute a break in the employee's seniority.
(e)	The employee is absent because of layoff exceeding six (6) months if the employee had less than six (6) months of active employment when the layoff began, or absent because of layoff exceeding twelve (12) months if he had six (6) or more months of active employment when the layoff began. However, this provision shall not apply to layoffs because of construction lasting less than eighteen (18) months.
(f)	The employee is absent exceeding six (6) months because of illness or injury not compensable under the Employer's Insurance Company of Nevada.
17.06. Notification.
An employee who is to be recalled to work by the Employer under Section 17.03 shall be notified to return to work by the Employer advising the employee by telephone, certified mail return receipt requested, or other available means of communication of the date and time the employee is to report, and by confirming such communication by certified mail return receipt requested to the employee's current address of record on file with the Employer. A copy of the confirmation letter shall be sent to the Union. Reasonable advance notice must be given an employee being recalled. If such employee fails to report to work within forty-eight (48) hours after the time specified for the employee to report, the employee's seniority and continuous service shall be terminated, and the Employer shall be free to hire a replacement in accordance with Article 2 of this Agreement.

All grievances shall be adjusted exclusively in the following manners:
(a)	Step One:
1.	The employee shall, within five (5) calendar days of the incident or circumstance giving rise to the dispute, take the matter up with his/her immediate supervisor. The employee has the full right and involvement of the Shop Steward in this step.

2.	The Supervisor involved in the Step 1 meeting shall respond within five (5) calendar days of the Step 1 meeting. While this step is encouraged, it is not required.
3.	The Parties agree to jointly provide required Step One training to management personnel and shop stewards. Refresher training will be scheduled at eighteen (18) month intervals for new management and shop stewards.
(b)	Grievances.
No grievance shall be entertained or processed unless it is received in writing by either party within fifteen (15) workdays after occurrence of the event giving rise to the grievance or after the aggrieved party hereto acquires knowledge of the occurrence of such event, whichever is later. The written grievance shall set forth the provision(s) of this Agreement alleged to have been violated, and every effort will be made to set forth all of the known facts allegedly constituting the violation. At the time it submits a grievance to the Employer, the Union shall furnish the Employer with copies of any written statements, reports or documents relied on by the Union or the grievant to support the grievance (but not including the employee's written grievance submitted to the Union). Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed that the Union shall have the right to grieve live warning notices at the time of subsequent discharge or suspension unless the case involves witnesses. At the time the warning notice is issued, the Employer shall indicate on the notices whether witnesses are involved.
(b) As used in this Article, the term "workdays" means the days Monday through Friday, inclusive, but excluding any holiday set forth in Section 12.01.

-28-
HILTON GRAND VACATIONS - ELARA
the grievance. The Board of Adjustment shall be comprised of not more than three (3) representatives of the Employer and three (3) representatives of the Union. For the purpose of attempting to resolve grievances prior to arbitration, the parties, at any meeting prior to the Board of Adjustment hearing and at that hearing, shall make full disclosure to each other or all facts and evidence then known to them which bear on the grievance.
2.	ARBITRATION PROCEDURE:
ARBITRATION. A grievance regarding the discharge of an employee(s) not resolved by the Board of Adjustment may be referred to arbitration by written notice from the party who filed the grievance within fifteen (15) calendar days of the Board of Adjustment.
Mediation: When a demand for arbitration of a discharge grievance has been made, such dispute shall be submitted to mediation prior to the arbitration hearing. At the same time the demand for arbitration is made, the party demanding arbitration shall also contact the local office of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service ("FMCS") requesting the assignment of a Mediator. The parties will schedule the mediation conference within thirty (30) calendar days, subject to the availability of the Mediator. Scheduling and conducting the mediation conference shall not delay the selection of the arbitrator or scheduling of the arbitration hearing; provided however, the arbitration hearing shall be scheduled for a date which permits the mediation conference to be completed sufficiently in advance of the arbitration hearing date to permit cancellation of the arbitration hearing without incurring a cancellation fee in the event the mediation is successful in resolving the grievance.
The mediation shall be attended by the grievant and by representatives of the Employer and the Union with authority to settle the matter. The Mediator will have the authority to propose ways of resolving the grievance and to render an advisory opinion on the merits of the grievance if no resolution is reached, but the Mediator does not have the authority to compel a resolution of the grievance. The Mediator's fees and expenses, if any, shall be borne equally by the parties. Each party shall be responsible for its own expenses incurred in presenting its case before the Mediator. In the event a grievance that has been mediated is subsequently arbitrated, no person serving as the Mediator may serve as Arbitrator. Nothing said or done by the Mediator may be referred to an arbitration. Any settlement discussions or proposals made by either party shall not be referred to at the arbitration hearing.
Formal Arbitration: Representatives of the Employer and the Union may agree to select an arbitrator, but if they are unable to do so, the arbitrator shall be chosen from a panel received from the FMCS of arbitrators, who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrator, and who reside in California or Nevada. No arbitrator shall be chosen to serve in two (2) consecutive arbitrations for the same hotel unless by mutual consent of the parties. The arbitrator shall be notified in writing of his/her selection, and shall have no authority, jurisdiction or power to amend, modify, nullify or add to the provisions of this Agreement. No evidence shall be introduced as to the withdrawal, during negotiations, of a proposal to change the Agreement. The award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Employer, the Union, and the employee(s) involved. Except in discharge cases, the expenses and fees of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the Employer and the Union. In discharge cases, the expenses and fees of the arbitrator, and of the court reporter, if any, shall be paid by the party losing the arbitration.

19.04. Arbitration Awards.
In the event the Employer fails to comply with an arbitration award and does not either seek judicial review of the award within the period of time required by law to obtain such review or comply with the award within such time period, the Union shall have the right to strike. In the event of a monetary award by an arbitrator, the appropriate sum of money shall be placed in an escrow bank account, paying interest at not less than the rate provided by Nevada law on judgments obtained under Nevada law.
