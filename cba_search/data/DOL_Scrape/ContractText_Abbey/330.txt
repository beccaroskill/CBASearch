Dear Mr. Hebert:
This is to confirm the understanding and agreement between the Company and the Union concerning the interpretation and application of Article 8, Section 9 as they pertain to the reallocation of employees in the presence or absence of a layoff.
The parties agree that seniority shall be the governing factor for the purpose of selecting for a preferred shift. For the purpose of surveys, a preferred shift is the first shift or the third shift; there is no obligation on the part of the Company to survey an employee tor preference for the second shift, however, any employee desiring placement on the second shift may make this fact known to the Company and such a request will not be unreasonably denied.
In addition, and for surplus to heed situations only, it is agreed that whenever an employee is required to change his/her shift, either in the department where he/she resides or in the department to where he/she will be transferred, he/she shall be entitled to displace a less senior employee in his/her code who resides on a shift preferred by the displaced employee. Prior to forcing a Jess senior employee to move, the Company shall first survey more senior employees in the affected codes tor placement preference and such surveys shall be honored.
127
(a)	Whenever the Company determines that in a department a surplus exists on a given shift and it intends to reallocate within the department, then:
(1)	The Company shall determine the number of employees surplus and the shift or shifts to which it intends to transfer those positions. Employees who are declared surplus shall be the least senior employees on the shift in the job code.
(2)	if any of the openings in (1) above are intended for the first or third shift, the Company will survey by seniority on the off shifts for preference to fill such openings.
(3)	Once preferred shift openings are filled, the Company will then move the remaining surplus employees to the shift where the need remains and such employees may opt to displace other less senior employees under the shift bumping provision outlined above.
(b)	in the event that it becomes necessary to adjust employees between departments within the plant, then:
(1)	The Company shall determine the departments and job codes where such surplus and need situations exist. Employees declared surplus shall be the least senior in the job code, without regard to shift.
(2)	Survey for shift preference in the "need" department as outlined in (a) (2) above,
(3j Transfer surplus employees to where the need now exists, again with shift bumping an option for employees who meet the requirements for this option.
(4) In the event that there is more than one (i) 'need* department, the determination of which department an employee is transferred to will be left to the discretion of the Company.
Sincerely.

This is to confirm the understanding and agreement between the Company and the Union concerning the necessity of providing job-based training to bargaining unit employees.
The Company and Union both recognize that a trained workforce is the most Important ingredient to any business and that our future depends on being able to deliver technical skills to our current and future workforce
The Company will continue its commitment to develop a highly trained workforce. Job-based training will be assigned to bargaining unit employees consistent with business needs and the individual needs of the employees in support of those business needs.
The parties agree to the concept of a ’pilot program’ to assess the opportunity to establish a job-based training program. The purpose of this program will be to work cooperatively to determine job-based training needs in a particular business unit.
On or before September 1, 2004 the parties agree to form a committee consisting of three representatives from Management and three representatives from the Union. The charter tor this committee will be:
146
« Identify a process for determining critical baseline skills needed in accordance with business requirements;
•	Assess current baseline skill levels;
•	Determine appropriate training programs; and
•	Establish an action plan to implement specific job-based training.
Paid time spent by Union members on this committee will be based on the mutual recommendation of the Company and Union committee leaders.
On or after September 1, 2005, the Director, Human Resources or his/her designee, and a designated Manager, Human Resources will meet with the Directing Business Representative, I.A.M. District 26 or his/her designee and the President, I.A.M. Local 743 to evaluate the program and determine appropriate next steps.
The Company intends to assign training on the basis of seniority, except where it is not practicable to do so, for example where (1) an employee, with the approval of management, opts out, (2) an employee is out due to illness, (3) physical or other restrictions that prevent an employee from engaging in the training, or (4) production requirements.
In Business Units not involved in the initial pilot program, the Company will continue its commitment to provide an average of 15 hours job-based training per employee annually.
No Grievance over any issue arising under this Letter of Agreement shall be subject to mandatory arbitration, except a Union Grievance alleging a consistent pattern of training being assigned out of seniority.

Facilities and Machine Tool Services Subcontracting
Mr. Mark A. Hebert ,
President
Hartford Aircraft Lodge No. 743,1.A.M.A.W.
P. O. Box 3218
Windsor Locks, CT 06096
Dear Mr. Hebert:
This is to confirm the understanding and agreement between the Company and the Union concerning subcontracting of Facilities and Machine Tool Services work.
Both the Company and the Union acknowledge a substantial portion of the work has been and will continue to be performed by subcontractors.
The Company intends, insofar as competitive forces permit, that the present number of trades employees in Facilities and Machine Toot Services for the work on the premises not be reduced through subcontracting. This expression of intent is no promise or guarantee to maintain any number of jobs in the workforce nor a restriction in any sense of the Company's right and need to subcontract. Rather it is intended to convey the Company's good faith desire to prefer its own employees in these trades to those of subcontractors insofar as that desire is compatible with good business judgment.
The parties have agreed to continue with a committee to review the current Facilities and Machine Tool Services contractors and the duties they perform for the Company. The Company will discuss with the Union whether it is compatible with good business judgment to have any of that work performed by current bargaining unit employees and/or those Manufacturing Support employees on layoff with recall rights. Any decision with regard to subcontracting remains within the sole discretion of the Company.
174
Further, representatives of the Human Resources Department and the Facilities Manager will meet at the request of the Union President, but no more frequently than twice a year with the Union president, vice president, and the shop committee to discuss subcontracting as it pertains to Facilities and Machine Tool Services. The Union and its representatives win protect the confidentiality of any Company sensitive and proprietary information that might be disclosed in such briefings. The scope of the issues to be discussed will be solely within the discretion of management.
Sincerely,
Kevin L. Director,

Windsor Locks, CT 06096
Dear Mr. Hebert:
This is to confirm the understanding and agreement between the Company and bie Union concerning ‘Red Flag’ pay rates.
Employee pay rates were red flagged when employees were classified on a lower grade job because their job code was placed into a new JET job at a lower grade. ('Red Flag" means their pay is treated as if they remained at their labor grade level before their reclassification.) It is further agreed such employees will be entitled to receive any general wage increases (as though the employee remained in the higher labor grade) and cost-of-living adjustments as defined in this Agreement. Such employees pay will be treated as red flagged for the life of this Agreement or until the employee reaches an equivalent grade and rate of pay. The red flag status will be discontinued if the employee is readjusted to another position in accordance with Article 8 of this Agreement or voluntarily requests another i position.

Nevertheless, the Company agrees during the life of this Agreement that it will continue to employ bargaining unit members at its facilities in Windsor Locks. This guarantee does not applyin the event of economic conditions beyond the control of the company or acts of God (figs, floods, etc.).
It is the mutual interest of both parties for the Company to be more competitive in the global marketplace, thereby providing enhanced job security for bargaining unit employees. During die prior Agreement, the Company and Union attended a training session on the Union's program known as “High Performance Work Organization Partnerships' or HPWO.

1	discussions will be consideration of work that is currently being
performed by vendors and could potentially be brought in-house. In addition, the parties agree to discuss technological changes that can help the Company be more competitive in the marketplace, which enhances job security. This Committee will cooperate to minimize any adverse effects these Changes may have on employees.
C.	tn addition to A and B above, the Committee will’study, mid, where appropriate, recommend various cooperative approaches to enhance the Company's competitiveness and productivity, and thus job security. These approaches could include appropriate principles of HPWO as well as current Company efforts.
D.	The Committee shall have access to information concerning t manufacturing costs, productivity, scheduling, business and staffing ■ plans affecting the bargaining unit and such other information as mutually deemed relevant by the parties. Any such information must be kept confidential by Union members at the Committee. The availability of this information to the Union shall be withdrawn in the event the Company has reasonable cause to determine a breach of confidentiality occurred.

Voluntary Early Retirement (VER) Medical Coverage
Mr. Mark A. Hebert
President
Hartford Aircraft Lodge No. 743, IA.MA.W.
P.O. Box 3218
Windsor Locks, CT 06096
Dear Mr. Hebert:
This is to confirm the understanding and agreement between the Company and the Union concerning Voluntary Eady Retirement (VER) medical coverage for employees who terminate their employment after the effective date of this Agreement and are eligible to retire under the terms of the retirement plan referred to In Article 21 of the Agreement (hereafter referred to as “retirees’).
It is agreed that VER medical coverage will be offered to all new (future) retirees as follows:
1.	Eligibility for VER medical coverage will remain the same as stated In the ‘Medical Benefits. Summary Plan Description" referenced under Article 22.
2.	The Hourly retiree VER medical coverage available will be identical to the salary retiree VER medical coverage and will be subject to the same medical plan changes which affect the salary retirees.
3.	The cost (premium) of the hourly retiree VER medical coverage will be calculated on an annual basis and will be based on the melded (average) utilization experience of all domestic hourly retirees, covered spouses and covered dependents participating in this VER medical coverage.
186

4.	For those retirees who terminate their employment prior to December 31, 2006, the Company will offset (subsidize) a fixed portion of the cost of VER medical coverage, for those retirees who elect to participate,. based on years of continuous service at retirement per the following schedule:
	Company Contribution Toward VER Medical
Years of Continuous Service At Retirement	Retiree or Dependent Retiree+1 or Family Only
After 10	$1,250	$2,500
For Each Year 11 through 20	Add $100 Per Year	Add $200 Per Year
For Each Year 21 through 30	Add’$150 Per Year	Add $300 Per Year
5.	The retiree, if they elect VER medical coverage, will pay an amount equal to the annual premium from Paragraph 3 above, minus the fixed Company contribution calculated using the schedule in Paragraph 4 above for this coverage. For example, if the melded annual premium for hourly retiree VER medical coverage is $6,000 for a retiree only and that retiree has 25 years of continuous service at retirement the retiree’s cost is calculated as follows:
Melded Annual Premium -Minus Company Contribution	$6,000 43.000	$1,250+(10 X $100H5 * $150) $3,000 Retiree's Annual Cost
6.	There will be no company subsidy for VER medical coverage for any employee who terminates his or her employment on or after December 31, 2006. An employee who terminates after December 31, 2006, will have access io the VER medical coverage and wSI pay the foil cost at the group rate.
7.	Eligibility for group life insurance for retired employees, pursuant to the terms of the Group Life and Disability Insurance Plan of United Technologies Corporation, will continue for
iai
employees who terminate their employment prior to December 31,2006. Group life insurance for retired employees will no! be available to any employee whose employment terminates on or after December 31,2006.
