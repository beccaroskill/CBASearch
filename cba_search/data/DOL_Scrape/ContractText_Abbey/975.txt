Work may be laid out by the employer's designated supervisor or journeyman based on their evaluation of the apprentice's skills and ability to perform the job tasks. Apprentices shall be permitted to perform job tasks in order to develop job skills and trade competencies. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice.

14
SECTION 3.12.	WORK COVERED - SUBLETTING - The Local Union is a part of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and any violation or annulment by an individual Employer of the approved Agreement of this or any other Local Union of the IBEW, other than violations of subsection (a) of this Section, will be sufficient cause for the cancellation of his Agreement by the Local Union, after a finding has been made by the International President of the Union that such violation or annulment has occurred.
The subletting, signing, or transfer by an individual Employer of any work in connection with electrical work to any person, firm, or corporation not recognizing the IBEW or one of its Local Unions as the collective bargaining representative of his employees on any electrical work in the jurisdiction of this or any other Local Union to be performed at the site of the construction, alteration, painting, or repair of a building, structure, or other work, will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.
All charges of violations of the preceding paragraph of this Section shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement covering the procedure for the handling of grievances and the final binding resolution of disputes.

SECTION 3.13.	OTHER LABOR DISPUTES -This Agreement does not deny the right of an individual Employee to render assistance to other Labor Organizations by withdrawal from a job when necessary but no withdrawal shall take place until the Employer involved is first given reasonable advance notice.
SECTION 3.14.	PICKET LINES -
(a)	It shall not be a violation of this Agreement, and it shall not be cause for discharge or any other disciplinary action by the Employer against any Employee, for an Employee to refuse to cross a lawfully established primary picket line, whether at the premises of another Employer or the Employee's own Employer.
(b)	Any Employee exercising such right shall carefully put away all tools, materials, equipment, or any other property of the Employer in a safe manner.

16
SECTION 3.15.	NON-RESIDENT EMPLOYERS - An employer signatory to a collective bargaining agreement or to a letter of assent to an agreement with another IBEW Local union, who signs an assent to this agreement, may bring up to four (4) bargaining unit employees employed in that Local Union's jurisdiction into this Local's jurisdiction and up to two (2) bargaining unit employees per job from that Local's jurisdiction to this Local's jurisdiction for specialty or service and maintenance work. All charges of violations of this Section shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement for the handling of grievances with the exception that any decision of a local labor-management committee that may be contrary to the intent of the parties to the National Agreement on Employee Portability, upon recommendation of either or both the appropriate IBEW International Vice-President or NECA Regional Executive Director, is subject to review, modification, or recission by the Council on Industrial Relations.
SECTION 3.16.	EQUALIZATION OF OVERTIME DISTRIBUTION - The Employer shall see that all overtime is equally and impartially allotted to all Employees represented by the Union on the job or in the shop. In no case shall Employees not working on the job during regular hours be placed on overtime while any of the regular crew is not working, except to equalize overtime in the shop.

When employees who are part of the regular crew turn down overtime, these provisions do not apply.
SECTION 3.17.	PAYROLL INSPECTION - The Employer shall show the payroll of the Employees in his employ to the Business Manager of the Union, or his representative, if requested to do so. The Business Manager’s representative must be designated in writing.

ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION INFORMATION
The following information has been taken from the
SUPPLEMENT TO THE AMERICAN RED CROSS FIRST AID TEXTBOOK
ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION
If victim is not breathing, begin some form of artificial respiration at once. Wipe out quickly any foreign matter visible in the mouth, using your fingers or a cloth wrapped around your fingers.
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH (MOUTH-TO-NOSE) METHOD
Tilt victim's head back. (Fig 1). Pull or ush the jaw into a jutting-out position. Fig. 2).
94
If victim is a small child, place your mouth tightly over his mouth and nose and blow gently into his lungs about 20 times a minute. If victim is an adult (see Fig 3). cover the mouth with your mouth, pinch ms nostrils shut, and blow vigorously about 12 times a minute.
If unable to get air into lungs of victim, and if head and jaw positions are correct, suspect foreign matter in throat To remove it, suspend a small child momentarily by the ankles of place child in position
95
shown in Fig. 4, and slap sharply between the shoulder blades.
If the victim is adult, place in position shown in Fig. 5, and use the same procedure.
96
CLEARING AIR PASSAGEWAY
Relaxed jaw -Tongue blocks air passage (trachea)
Head tilted - Jaw held in thrust position relieves blockage by elevating tongue
97
EXTERNAL CARDIAC MASSAGE
1	.Only after mouth-to-mouth breathing has been started should a check be made to see if external cardiac massage is necessary. Determine whether the heart has stopped beating by checking the victim's pulse in the carotid of the neck -the large artery on either side.
See Figure A.
2	.If there is no pulse, start the external cardiac massage procedure by placing the heel of one hand over the lower third (the "sternum") of the breastbone (see "X" on Figure B) and the other hand on top of the first, as shown in Figure C.
3	.To start, the cardiac massage, compress the breastbone toward the backbone by exerting downward pressure on your hands with the weight of your upper body, as in Figure C, while mouth-to-mouth breathing is continued by a second person. The breastbone should move 1-1/2 to 2 inches in adults. Pressure is then released quickly. This cycle is repeated 60 to 80 times per minute on children. [Children's chests are not as strong as adults'.] The massage on children up to 10 years old can usually be done with one hand.
98
CARDIOPULMONARY (Heart-Lung) RESUSCITATION
Fig. A
Showing (A) the pulse-checking point in the neck, (B) the hand-pressure point in the chest, and (C), preparing to start simultaneous heart-lung resuscitation
99
PRESSURE POINTS FOR CONTROLLING ARTERIAL BLEEDING
Use pressure point nearest the wound, between heart and wound
Front of ear (opening m skull) Hollow spot in jaw bone Between neck muscle & windpipe Behind collar bone close to neck Armpit
Hands breadth down from armpit (inside)
Just above elbow (under muscle) Just above wrist (pulse point) Groin where leg and pelvis join Each finger joint
Hands breadth down from crotch Behind leg just above knee joint Behind ankle (under heavy muscle)
Each toe joint
POINTS - The same on both sides of body
Tourniquet is to be used only in extreme bleeding or as a last resort
