ARTICLE 14

Section 39. The premium rate for work performed on Sunday as such shall be time and one-quarter (1 1/4x) the employee’s regular straight-time rate of pay (exclusive of Clean-up personnel). The Sunday premium, for hours worked up to eight (8), shall in no instance be offset against any weekly overtime which may be due under subparagraph b of Section 37 because of the fact that the employee worked over forty (40) hours in the particular workweek. The Sunday premium shall not be averaged into the employee's straight-time rate for the purpose of determining the rate upon which daily or weekly overtime is based in any workweek under Section 37 hereof. Employees hired on or after March 6, 2005 shall not be eligible for Sunday Premium.
Section 40,	An employee whose straight-time scheduled shift begins on Saturday and continues beyond midnight on Saturday shall receive Sunday Premium Pay for those hours worked on Saturday, and such shifts in their entirety shall be the first shift of the new workweek.
Section 41.	In those situations where an employee’s straight-time scheduled shift begins at or after 8:00 p.m. on Saturday and continues beyond midnight on Saturday, the Employer shall not reschedule or reduce the hours of such employee for the sole purpose of avoiding the payment of such Sunday premium, though it is
13
recognized that changes in the schedule may be necessitated by changes in business operations.
Section 42.	Clean-up Personnel Sunday Premium. Clean-up Personnel shall receive a premium of fifty cents (500) per hour for all work performed on Sunday.
Section 43.	Sunday scheduling shall be on a voluntary basis. Should the Employer be unable to obtain enough volunteer workers, employees in reverse order of seniority within the job assignment will be required to work.
ARTICLE 15
TRAVEL BETWEEN STORES
Section 44.	When an employee is transferred from one store to another store during her workday, reasonable time spent in traveling between said stores shall be considered as time worked.

Holiday pay for part-time employees who have completed their probationary period, and who otherwise qualify, shall be based on the number of hours worked in the calendar week two (2) weeks prior to the week in which the holiday occurs, divided by five (5). Provided the employee actually performs work in the calendar week two (2) weeks prior to the Holiday week, (unless on vacation or receiving sick pay for time not worked during such week or during the first thirty (30) days of an absence for which an employee is receiving Workmen’s Compensation) the employee shall not receive less than three (3) hours holiday pay.

All regular full-time employees, and all part-time employees, who were hired on or before March 5, 2005 and who have worked eight hundred thirty two (832) or more hours in their anniversary year, covered by this agreement, shall receive one (1) week's paid vacation after one (1) year's service, two (2) weeks' paid vacation after two (2) years' service, three (3) weeks' paid vacation after five (5) years' continuous service, four (4) weeks' paid vacation after twelve (12) years' continuous service and five (5) weeks' paid vacation after twenty (20) years continuous service.

Such vacation shall be paid at straight-time rates. The number of hours for which such employees shall be paid for a vacation week shall be the average number of weekly hours worked during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the employee's anniversary date of employment, not to exceed 40 hours pay for each week of vacation. Hours paid for vacations, holidays and sick leave shall be considered as hours worked for the purpose of computing vacation amounts. No pro-rata vacation will be paid at termination.
Section 57.	Vacation by Hours. There would be no change in the way an employee earns vacations. The only change would be in the way an employee is allowed to take vacation.
In the past, employees have been required to take vacation one (1) week at a time. With the new program, they could request vacation pay by hours from one-tenth (1/,o) of an hour up to the total number of hours they have earned. This gives employees flexibility in taking their vacation pay whenever they want.
The intent of the program is to allow the employee to take and be paid for smaller portions of their earned vacation than forty (40) hours at one time.
Section 58,	Vacation Pay In Advance. An employee who has earned vacation on the basis of having completed an anniversary year shall receive her vacation pay during the work week immediately preceding the employee's vacation, provided the employee has requested such in writing at least two (2) weeks in advance of her vacation.

Section 60.	All employees will be allowed to be paid for earned vacation pay without being required to schedule vacation time off. There will be no limit on the amount of earned vacation pay that can be taken in this manner. Vacations must be taken or paid for during each anniversary year.
Section 61.	Vacation Upon Lav Off or Termination. When an employee is laid off, or discharged, or leaves her place of employment, and at said time she is entitled to a vacation, she shall receive her vacation wages at the time of the layoff or discharge, or at the time she leaves her place of employment. Provided, however, that if such employee be discharged for proven dishonesty, she shall not be entitled to any vacation or vacation pay, whether the same has accumulated or not.
Section 62.	In the event a regular full-time employee covered by this agreement who has been employed two (2) years or longer voluntarily quits or is discharged for reasons other than proven dishonesty, such employee shall be paid pro rata vacation pay earned up to the time the employment relationship is severed.
SCHEDULING OF VACATIONS
Section 63.	The Employer retains the right to determine the number of employees who may be on vacation at any given time.

Any additional vacation weeks that become available after the posting of such roster shall be posted within the store and shall be offered by seniority within classification and store. Once the additional vacation week(s) has/have been approved it will not be changed unless mutually agreeable between the employee and the Employer.

Section 87.	Assignment to Full-time Status. When a full-time vacancy occurs and the Employer determines that such vacancy shall be filled by a full-time employee, or a four (4) week at forty (40) hour opening is created, the job vacancy for lesser classified jobs than Head Clerks shall be filled by the assignment of the most senior qualified employee of the classification who has signed the current full-time request list as provided in this Agreement. Should the Employer be unable to fill such vacancy from the list, then such vacancy shall be posted within the affected store for seventy-two (72) hours and the Employer shall offer the full-time assignment to the senior qualified employee of the store in the classification who signed the posting, before hiring off-the-street.
Notwithstanding the above, the Employer may transfer a full-time employee from another store within the bargaining unit to fill a vacancy in lieu of advancing an employee to full-time status under this Article.
Section 88.	Full-time Request List. Employees with three (3) or more years of service may sign the full-time request list during the first fifteen (15) days of January and the first fifteen (15) days of July to be considered for advancement to full-time effective with the first workweek in February and August respectively.

2.	An employee desirous of promotion or multiple promotions shall make this wish known by submitting a signed written request, form to her current store manager. Such requests may be submitted at any time and there shall be no minimum time period between requests until the highest classification available has been attained.

Any employee who wishes to withdraw such written request may do so in writing to the store manager at any time before the time when promotion is assigned. In the absence of the store manager, said form must be signed by the person in charge of the store. In the absence of the union steward, said form must be signed by a member in good standing. The intent is to insure that the forms are not delayed by the absence of either party’s representative.

It is understood that the employee must be employed for one continuous year in the bargaining unit prior to the demotion or step down or the employee shall be placed in the position of Meat Clean-Up.

AVAILABLE HOURS
Sections 95. Scheduling and Assignment of Hours. Not later than seven (7) days prior to the start of any workweek, the Employer shall post a list of shifts, including start times, for each job assignment within the classification and store, based on the available hours as determined by the Employer. Employees lesser classified than Head Clerk shall be allowed to select their preferred schedule from the posted list of shifts for which they are qualified to perform the work, in seniority order within their job assignment. Full-time employees shall select first, followed by part-time employees. No employee shall be allowed to select a schedule that will result in overtime or other penalty provision, unless expressly authorized by the Employer. The employee's selection shall be recorded on a master schedule. Employees shall not select a portion of a shift. Prior to the start of the selection process, the Employer will identify approved vacation requests on the schedule.
The Employer may allow an employee in one job assignment to select shifts in another job assignment. The Employer reserves the right to assign employees to any ordering shifts and to training shifts. Nothing herein shall be interpreted to restrict the Employer's right to modify an employee's preferred shift selections prior to posting the schedule at 9: 00 a.m. Friday.
Employees must immediately make their shift selections at the time directed by the Employer. If an employee fails to promptly select, the Employer, or the steward if available, shall select on behalf of the employee based on the employee’s previous weekly schedule. In this event, the employee waives all rights to grieve the Employer’s scheduling selection.
Unless the result of a reduction in hours, no full-time employee shall select less than forty (40) hours. Unless otherwise approved, no part-time employee shall select less than twenty (20) hours per week.
The Employer may require junior employees to select a specific number of shifts to facilitate the selection of all shifts from the list. In the event an employee is left with less than minimum hours, but has not been zeroed out, the Employer may pull shifts in reverse seniority order from senior employees to reach minimum hours for such employee, or the Employer may zero out such employee and assign any remaining hours in reverse seniority order to senior employees.
26
The Employer retains the right to determine the number of positions in each job assignment Upon mutual agreement between the Employer and the employee, a more senior qualified employee may change job assignments within her classification in order to maximize hours. The least senior employee in the job assignment affected will be moved to the job assignment vacated by the senior employee.
When needed to increase the opportunity to maximize hours, an employee may request in writing to be trained in any job assignment within her job classification for which the Employer feels the employee is not currently qualified. After the request is made, the Employer may train within a reasonable time consistent with the business needs of the Employer, unless the employee is incapable of performing the job for which she requests training.
ARTICLE 32
ADDITIONAL HOURS
Section 96. Additional Hours. The Employer shall post a weekly additional hours' request list for each classification. Employees interested in working additional hours must sign the list for their classification and designate the days they will be available to work additional hours by midnight of the Saturday prior to the start of the applicable workweek. When hours not on the posted schedule become needed, or hours on the posted schedule become available (and the Employer elects to fill some or all of these hours) the Employer shall attempt to contact, in seniority order, by classification, qualified employees who signed the list for the day in question and assign them the hours. (If the Employer determines at the time the need arises, that less than four (4) hours should be needed, only the following options need be exhausted: first, employees currently at work who signed the list for the day in question will be assigned the work; and second, employees who signed the list for the day in question and who may be brought in early because the need is contiguous to their scheduled shift will be assigned the work. Nothing herein should be interpreted to require assigning work to employees not scheduled for the day in question or to employees not available to work the additional hours at the time the need arises.) If the hours cannot be assigned to the employees requesting them, as provided hereunder, the Employer may assign the hours at its discretion. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the scheduling of additional hours for any employee which will result in a split shift or overtime or prevent the Employer from assigning overtime pursuant to Section 97.
ARTICLE 33
UNSCHEDULED OVERTIME
Section 97. Unscheduled Overtime Hours. Daily overtime not previously scheduled shall be offered in seniority order within the job assignment, the classification
27
and the store, to the employees present when the need for overtime arises. Nothing herein shall be construed to require the scheduling of overtime when another employee's scheduled hours can be extended or part-time employees may be called in without overtime penalty. Hours unclaimed under this procedure may be assigned in reverse order of seniority among those employees within the job assignment within the classification within the store present when the need for overtime arises.
Overtime assignments of four (4) hours or more may be filled by calling in employees, in seniority order, within the classification and the job assignment on their non-scheduled day without violating this Section.
ARTICLE 34
REDUCTION IN HOURS
Section 98.	Part-Time Employees. If a part-time employee is zeroed out as a result of the selection of shifts, such employee shall be given layoff rights pursuant to this Agreement. However, if the average of all part-time employees within the classification within the job assignment is twenty-four (24) or more hours (including hours paid for vacation, sick, funeral, unworked holiday and jury duty pay) the Employer may elect to pull hours, in reverse seniority order, from senior employees to maintain the bottom twenty percent (20%) (or three (3) employees whichever is greater) of employees within the classification within the job assignment at minimum weekly hours. An employee electing to displace pursuant to the layoff procedures shall assume the selected schedule of the employee he is bumping until he is able to select for the next workweek.
Section 99.	Full-Time Employees. The Employer shall not write a schedule of shifts that would result in a full-time employee being unable to select a forty (40) hour schedule (thirty-two (32) hours in a holiday week) unless the average scheduled hours (including hour scheduled and paid for vacation, unworked holiday, jury, sick and funeral pay) of all part-time employees within the classification within the job assignment is twenty-four (24) hours or less for the involved workweek. A full-time employee unable to select a forty (40) hour schedule, shall in their second consecutive week of such reduced hours, be allowed to exercise her seniority to claim the schedule of the least senior full-time employee in the classification within the bargaining unit who is working a forty (40) hour schedule. The employee may exercise her seniority to bump any time between the second (2nd) and eleventh (11th) week of reduction. The employee whose schedule is claimed under this procedure shall immediately be assigned the schedule of the claiming employee, or be allowed to step-down to part-time status and displace the least senior part-time employee in her store.
No employee assigned as full-time on August 3, 1996, shall have her hours reduced to less than forty (40) hours as the result of this provision, unless all part-time employees in the classification have had their scheduled hours reduced to twenty-four
28
(24)	hours or less. Such full-time employee shall have her hours reduced to twenty-four (24) or less before any other full-time employee protected under this paragraph is reduced.
Section 100.	Full-Time Employees - Competitive Openings. During the first sixty (60) days following a competitive opening, the Employer may elect, in lieu of reducing hours as provided above, to layoff full-time employees to maintain the same proportion of full-time employees to part-time employees the store averaged in the month prior to the competitive opening. In the event of a layoff, the displaced employee shall be given the following options:
1.	Displace the least senior full-time employee in the bargaining unit, or
2.	Step-down to part-time and displace the least senior part-time employee within the classification and store.
Employees displaced by the full-time reduction under this procedure shall be given their layoff options pursuant to the layoff language of this Agreement.
It is understood that the provisions of this section shall apply only to the classifications impacted by a competitive opening.
ARTICLE 35
LAYOFFS
Section 101.	Layoffs. For lesser classified jobs than Head Clerk, when a reduction in the workforce is necessary, the following procedure shall be used.
The least senior employee within the affected job assignment within the classification within the store shall be notified of the layoff and shall be given the options of: (1) displacing the least senior employee in the same classification within the same store; (1a) if there is no less senior employee in the same classification within the same store, displacing the least senior employee in the same classification within the bargaining unit; (2) displacing the least senior employee in a lower classification within the same store; or (3) accepting the layoff. Such employee shall receive the rate of pay for any lower classification to which she moves.
For purposes of this provision a full-time employee may only exercise the above options as to other full-time employees and a part-time employee may only exercise the above options as to other part-time employees.
Section 102.	Employees Accepting Layoff or a Lower Classification. Laid off employees, and employees who accept a job in a lower classification in lieu of layoff, shall be recalled as needed, in order of seniority, to jobs they are qualified to perform. However, at the time of layoff or accepting a job in a lower classification, an employee
29
may inform the Employer in writing of her desire not to be recalled to nightcrew jobs, in which case the notification shall be honored. The Employer shall not hire a new employee or promote an existing employee into a position for which a laid off employee or employee who accepts a job in a lower classification is qualified and available to perform the work.
Section 103.	Employee Accepting Layoff. An employee accepting a layoff rather than accepting a job in a lower classification may inform the Employer in writing at the time of the layoff of her desire to be recalled to a lower classification, and such notification shall be honored when a vacancy occurs. The notice shall specify the lower classification to which the employee desires recall. It is understood that any employee on layoff from the classification where the vacancy occurs shall have preferential rights to such vacancy.
ARTICLE 36
TRANSFER FROM STORE TO STORE
Section 104. Transfer from Store to Store. Transfer from store to store shall not be made or denied for capricious, arbitrary or discriminatory reasons.

ARTICLE 37
NEW STORE OPENING
Section 105.	In the event of the opening of a new store within the bargaining unit (not a replacement of an existing store) the following procedure shall apply:
1.	At least four (4) weeks prior to the opening of a new store, the Employer will post a sheet in each location for interested employees to sign if desirous of a transfer to the new location. The sheet shall remain posted for at least ten (10) days.
2.	Job openings either at the new store or created by transferring employees at their former store shall first be filled by employees on layoff in the classification of the vacancy before any new employees are hired or current employees are promoted.
3.	Employees who have signed the new store transfer request sheet shall be given consideration based on their qualifications and the requirements of the store. It is understood that the Employer may move employees from its own competitive stores which may be impacted by the new store opening before consideration of other employee desires.
30
4.	In the event the Employer opens new stores within the jurisdiction of a bargaining unit as set forth in Article 1, not less than sixty percent (60%) of the initial staffing of the new store shall be made by employees covered by this bargaining unit language, if available.

3.	No changes are permitted that would violate any contractual agreement between the Fund and any third party vendor.
4.

Funding Policy. Long-Term Funding Policy.
1.	The trustees shall, no later than April 1, 2005, adopt the following Long Term Funding Policy. Such Long Term Funding Policy shall be applicable for plan year 2005 and subsequent plan years. Effective with the January 2005 contribution payment, the employers will increase the hourly contribution by fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour from one dollar and sixteen cents ($1.16) to one dollar and thirty-one cents ($1.31) for employees hired before ratification.
This fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour increase in contribution is a "supplemental" contribution dedicated solely to improving the funding of the pension plan, will not be used to increase benefits and will be discontinued at the times set forth in paragraph 2.
43
2.	This supplemental contribution shall continue to be made until the earlier of such time the Plan reaches a financial state whereby either: (i) the funding ratio of the Plan (actuarial value of assets over actuarial liability) is at least 100%; or any contribution of the employers would not be deductible for federal income tax purposes in the year in which it is required to be made. However, unless changes are needed to support contribution deductibility, no changes shall be made when the Plan has withdrawal liability. Effective January 1, 2010 (December hours) the supplemental contribution provided above in subsections 1 and 2 shall no longer apply and shall be replaced by any supplemental contribution that may be provided in the Pension Protection Act section of this agreement.
3.	If as of any valuation date commencing with the 01/01/06 valuation, a funding deficiency is projected to occur in less than five (5) years, the Trustees will reduce benefits such that a projected funding deficiency will not occur within any of the eight (8) years following the valuation date. The parties agree to apply for section 412(e) relief if available before the benefit reductions are enacted. It is understood that application for section 412(e) requires the parties to reduce benefits as a condition of the application. Such section 412(e) application, if approved, must cure the funding deficiency as prescribed above.
If the section 412(e) application is not approved, or not acted on, within 18 months of the valuation date (for example 01/01/06 valuation), then the Trustees will immediately enact benefit reductions to cure the funding deficiency as prescribed above.
4.	In no event will benefit reductions be delayed to or beyond a time that would expose the employers to liability beyond the supplemental contribution including but not limited to liability for the payment of excise taxes or additional contributions. Any deadlocked issue over the enactment of benefit reductions and/or the application of this policy shall be submitted to expedited arbitration ahead of any other matter pending arbitration. Such expedited arbitration shall occur within sixty (60) days of the request for arbitration and the arbitrator shall render his decision within sixty (60) days following the close of the hearing in the matter.
5.	The parties authorize and direct the Trustees of the Plan to develop Maintenance of Equity Policy for employers that do not adopt this agreement upon renewal of the collective bargaining agreement (or for new agreements).
6.	If the Plan experiences a minimum funding deficiency, any excise tax that is levied against the employers will be allocated amongst such employers in a way that first makes all employers not contributing the full amount of the supplemental contribution responsible for fully paying any accumulated missed supplemental contributions with interest. Thereafter,
44
the balance of any excise tax remaining will be allocated to all employers in proportion to their non-supplemental contribution rate. Finally, for any employer not adopting this agreement, future benefits will be based on the assumption that fifteen cents ($0.15) of the current rate being contributed is deemed to be supplemental.
7.	The parties recognize there is a possibility of merger of the Denver Area Meatcutters Pension Fund with the Rocky Mountain UFCW Union and Employers Pension Plan and give full authority to effectuate such merger to the Board of Trustees of the two pension plans without further approval of the parties of this Agreement.

obligated to make pension contributions in addition to the base contribution rate specified in the Employer Contributions Section. The amount of any such supplemental contribution shall be determined as follows:
i.	Alternate Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule attached hereto as Appendix C, the Employer shall pay the contribution rate required in the Alternate Schedule (modified only as provided herein) of one dollar and fifty one cents ($1.51) per hour effective January 1, 2010 (on December hours) which includes the rate of eighty nine cents ($0.89) per hour described in the Employer Contribution section above and a supplemental contribution of sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour. In the event the New Hire Benefit goes into effect as provided herein, then effective with hours worked after the adoption of such Benefit, the Employer shall pay a total contribution rate of one dollar and sixty one cents ($1.61) per hour, which reflects the sum of the contribution rate required in the Employer Contribution section, the supplemental contribution rate of this section and the new hire benefit contribution rate provided herein.
ii.	Default Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan do not adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule, but instead adopt a legally valid “Default Schedule” within the meaning of the PPA, the Employer shall pay the contribution rate required under
46
the Default Schedule effective January 1, 2010 (on December hours); provided that in no event shall such contribution rate be payable prior to the effective date of all of the benefit adjustments required under the Default Schedule. For example, if the Default Schedule benefit adjustments do not become effective until the start of the Rehabilitation Period under the PPA, the Employer shall not be required to pay the Default Schedule contribution rates until that time.
If any required Default Schedule contribution rate exceeds the rate provided for under subsection (i) above, then each annual increase in the top pay rate provided for in this contract shall be permanently reduced by fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour, and ten cents ($0.10) per hour in the case of Courtesy Clerks, effective with the next scheduled pay rate increase following the implementation of the Default Schedule contribution rate. The permanent reductions provided for herein shall continue year after year. It is understood that each annual top rate increase will be reduced until either sufficient reductions have occurred so as to equal the amount of the increase to the supplemental contribution rate of subsection (i) caused by the implementation of the default schedule or until the date on which the employer implements contribution rates which are reduced to, or below, the contribution rates under subsection (i) above and in accordance with subsection (vii) below, whichever occurs first, but in no event shall any such wage reductions made be restored.
iii.	Long-Term Funding Policy Contribution Rates: In the event the Alternate Schedule in subsection (i) above and the Default Schedule in subsection (ii) above are not applicable during the term of this agreement, but the Long-Term Funding Policy is implemented, the Employer shall not be obligated to pay a supplemental contribution under any other provision of this Agreement, but shall continue to pay the base contribution specified in the Employer Contribution Section plus a supplemental contribution under this subsection (iii) that shall not exceed sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour. This supplemental contribution shall be a contribution amount which has the same proportionate value relative to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy as the value of the supplemental contribution of sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour under subsection (i) has to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Alternate Schedule. This approach shall be accomplished by utilizing the following formula: a) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy, divided by b) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternative Schedule, multiplied by c) the supplemental contribution of sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour under subsection (i). These calculations shall be made by the employer consultants, and shall be final and binding on all parties.
47
For example: If $5M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy and if $10M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternative Schedule and sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour is the supplemental contribution under subsection (i), then the supplemental contribution under this subsection (Hi) is sixty-two cents ($0.62) times $5M divided by $10M, or thirty one cents ($0.31) per hour.
iv.	It is understood and agreed that the Employer may reduce the amount of any of the above supplemental contributions due the Trust (but not below zero) by the amount of any surcharge, deficiency or excise tax required to be paid by the Employer any time after entering Critical Status. The supplemental contribution provided for herein shall be dedicated solely to improving the funding of the Plan, and shall not be used to increase or improve benefits, and will be reduced or discontinued upon determination by the Plan’s Trustees, based on projections provided by the Plan’s actuaries, that such supplemental contribution are no longer needed to support the level of benefits provided for under the Plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection (vii) below.
v.	As a result of the Plan's having been certified as being in critical status for the Plan Year beginning January 1, 2009, the Trustees are authorized to adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule attached as Appendix C hereto (if they believe it is appropriate to do so). If the Alternate Schedule is adopted by the Trustees, it is hereby deemed approved by the bargaining parties and automatically incorporated into this Agreement.
vi.	In no event shall any contribution increases be required during the term of this Agreement as a result of any annual updates or other changes to the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule or, if applicable, to any Default Schedule.
vii. In the event the Trustees determine, based on projections provided by the actuaries for the Plan, that, at any time during the term of this Agreement, an Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule with lesser contribution rates and/or benefit reductions would be sufficient to reasonably enable the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, the Trustees may amend the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule in a manner that, to the extent possible, would restore reduced benefits and would reduce the Employer’s supplemental contribution in an equal manner and amount, based on actuarial equivalence, provided that such modifications to the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule would still allow the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, taking into account to the extent legally permitted any relief available under IRC Section 431(d). In the event the Trustees amend the
48
Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule as provided in this subsection (vii), then the parties agree to adjust the supplemental contribution rates provided above to reflect the lower rates in the amended Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the effective date of any benefit cuts specified in the Alternate Schedule or the Default Schedule, the Trustees determine that (a) such benefit cuts are no longer required to avoid critical status or to have a valid Rehabilitation Plan, and (b) the supplemental contribution could be reduced or eliminated, then the Employer supplemental contribution shall be reduced or eliminated accordingly, and the Employer shall be further entitled to recoup the value of any supplemental contribution paid prior to the effective date of the benefit reductions set forth in the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. This provision shall apply regardless of the reason for the Trustees’ determination, including a change in the law (e.q., a further extension of the Plan's green status) and/or improved investment returns. The value of the contributions shall be recouped via a suspension of contributions in an amount equal to the amount of the supplemental contribution paid.
viii. The Board of Trustees is authorized to take all reasonable measures to cooperate and assist in achieving the objectives set forth in this Section.

Rehabilitation Period____________________
January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2022.
Plan to Emerge from the Red Zone and Annual Benchmarks to Assess Progress Toward Emergence
The Plan’s actuaries certify that the Contribution and Benefit Adjustments shown above are sufficient for the Plan to emerge from the Red Zone at the end of the Rehabilitation Period based on the funded status of the Plan as of January 1, 2009 before the addition of any New Hire benefits. In the event that the New Hire benefits are implemented, the Plan’s actuaries certify that with the additional contributions specifically designated to fund the New Hire benefits, the plan is still reasonably expected to emerge from Critical Status after such benefit increases, as shown in the annual benchmarks including the New Hire benefits. These schedules will be updated as needed throughout the Rehabilitation Period. Progress toward emergence from the Red Zone will be measured by the Plan’s Funding Standard Account Credit (Deficiency) Balance being greater than (less than) the amounts in the following projections. These projections have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 including:
•	Contribution rates in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement effective for hours worked in December 2009 payable in January 2010.
•	An assumption of the same number of contributable hours as reported for the actuarial valuation as of 1/1/2008. The reasonableness of this assumption has been verified by the Trustees.
•	No market related investment gains or losses from 9/30/2009 forward and no other actuarial gains or losses from 1/1/2009 forward.

Grand Junction, Fruita and Clifton (Deli Only) Meat Bargaining Units:
APPENDIX “A”
The minimum hourly rates of pay for the indicated classifications shall be as set forth below on the dates indicated. The Employer may hire any employee at any rate in the progression schedule at its sole discretion.
Rate Determination
Employees hired before March 6, 2005 who remain in their classification after commencement of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the “hired and assigned in the bargaining unit prior to March 6, 2005” wage schedule while they remain in that classification.
Demotions, Step Downs and layoffs: An employee who is demoted, steps down, or who is laid off in accordance with this Agreement, shall be placed back into the same wage schedule in which the employee was working immediately prior to their assignment into management or promotion into the classification from which they are being demoted, stepping down or laid off. In determining the proper progression level for an employee demoted, stepping down, or laid off from a classification with a higher “thereafter” hourly rate to a classification with a lower “thereafter" hourly rate, such affected employee shall be placed in the appropriate progression level in the rate schedule referenced in this paragraph based on their experience in the newly assigned classification, regardless of whether such assigned rate results in a reduction in hourly rate. In determining prior experience hereunder, the Employer will give recognition to the verified number of hours of actual work experience in the same classification which said employee may have performed for the Employer and the verified number of hours of actual work experience on a comparable job which said employee may have performed within the previous five (5) years for any other employer in a similar retail grocery operation.
Rate Determination - Promotions, new hires and new entrants into the bargaining unit: Employees hired into, or assigned to, or promoted to a different classification, the bargaining unit on or after March 5, 2005 shall be assigned to the "EMPLOYEES HIRED INTO THE BARGAINING UNIT OR ASSIGNED OR PROMOTED ON OR AFTER MARCH 6, 2005” wage scale. Employees who are promoted to a different classification after March 5, 2005 shall not receive a reduction in their hourly rate of pay if when promoted to such classification they are being paid an hourly rate of pay greater than the minimum, unless they are above the “thereafter” hourly rate in which case they will immediately be paid the “thereafter” hourly rate. When such employee is paid less than the “thereafter" hourly rate, prior to receiving an increase in their hourly rate of pay, they must work one thousand forty (1,040) hours at their current rate before promotion to the hourly rate in the new classification that would give them an increase in their hourly rate of pay.

WEINGARTEN RULES
Under the Supreme Court's Weingarten decision, when an investigatory interview occurs, you should ask if it is for disciplinary' action. If so, the following rules apply:
Rule I: The employee must make a clear request for union representation before or during the interview. The employee cannot be punished for making this request.
Rule II: After the employee makes the request, the Employer must choose from among three options. The Employer must either:
A.	Grant the request and delay questioning until the union representative arrives and has a chance to consult privately with the employee, or
B.	Deny the request and end the interview immediately, or X
C.	Give the employee a choice of:
(1)	having the interview without representation or
(2)	ending the interview.
Rule III: If the Employer denies the request for union representation, and continues to ask questions, it commits an unfair labor practice and the employee has a right to refuse to answer. The Employer may not discipline the employee for such a refusal.
DO NOT GO SUSPENDED!!!
REMEMBER, IF YOU LEAVE THE INDUSTRY FOR ANY REASON (termination, layoff, leave of absence, etc.) apply for your withdrawal card. This must be done within 30 days from the last day worked. This protects your union status in the event you should ever return to the industry. Failure to get a withdrawal card will result in SUSPENSION from the Union and a reinstatement-fee will be charged. If you leave the industry IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO GET A WITHDRAWAL CARD!
The withdrawal card will be issued at no cost, the only requirement being that your initiation fee be fully paid and your dues must be paid for the month in which you request the withdrawal card. The withdrawal card is good indefinitely and allows you-to become a member of any local union affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union without payment of any additional fee(s). Withdrawal card must be deposited with the union office within 30 days after returning to work or it becomes null and void and the reinstatement fee must be paid. All persons returning to work with a withdrawal card must fill out a new application and authorization.
WITHDRAWAL CARD REQUEST FORM
When your employment terminates, or if you are laid off, or on a leave of absence over 30 days, you should request a Withdrawal Card.
