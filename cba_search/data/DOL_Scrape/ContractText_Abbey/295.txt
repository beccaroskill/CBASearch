ANNUAL BUSINESS PLAN REVIEWS - STAMPING BUSINESS UNIT
September 15, 2003
Mr. Gerald D. Bantom
Vice President and Director UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Annual Business Plan Reviews - Stamping Business Unit
During 2003 bargaining, the parties spent considerable time discussing the future of the Stamping Business Unit (SBU). The goal of the SBU is to become the	.
supplier of choice, and as such, has focused the stamping plants on die tryout, die maintenance, and quality improvements. Additionally, improved communication and teamwork must occur at all levels of the Business
Unit. To support these goals, senior management from	!
the SBU will meet annually with the leadership of the
UAW National Ford Department to review the SBU Scorecard metrics, long term stamping plans and their anticipated effect on stamping plants. Further, on a	i
quarterly basis, senior management of the SBU will
meet with representatives of the National Ford De-	'
partment to discuss the status of the stamping busi-
ness and other related issues.
During the term of the 2003 Agreement, the SBU is	1
planning to invest up to $18 million, business conditions permitting. The Company will consider prudent investments in stamping plants to support press re-	<
pair and refurbishment, die tryout, die maintenance and repair, and other related activities to achieve safety, quality, delivery, cost, and morale objectives.
The parties agreed that when such prudent invest-	"
ments are being contemplated the parties will meet to identify and implement changes to improve the overall competitiveness of the die tryout process, and to	;
enhance indirect and direct employee cooperation at	I
those locations. Planned investments and the corre-	’

Subject: Carryover Vehicle Meeting
During the course of 1987 negotiations, the Union voiced concern regarding application of the letter re Work Allocations in Assembly Plants, particularly as it relates to the identification of “carryover" or “face-lift" vehicles.
In an effort to provide consistent application of the letter at all assembly facilities, Body arid Assembly Management will meet with the National Ford Department sixty (60) days prior to Job #1 of each model year to review the question of whether or not a vehicle is a "carryover" or “face-lift” vehicle with limited year-to-year change.

DIE CONSTRUCTION PLANS
•	September 15, 2003
Mr. Gerald D. Bantom
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom;
Subject: Die Construction Plans
During the course of these negotiations, there was considerable discussion regarding the competitiveness of the Dearborn Tool and Die plant. It is not the intent of the Company to exit die construction at the Dearborn Tool and Die Plant. The parties recognize that improving the competitiveness of this business is a complex problem.
A joint steering committee was established consisting of representatives of the National Ford Department, Labor Affairs Staff and the Stamping Business Unit. The parties agreed to oversee the development of a comprehensive plan aimed at achieving a competitive standing among die builders. The plan includes identification of required process changes, new technology, material cost improvements, engineering improvements, and local work practice changes.
Quarterly reviews will be conducted with National Ford Department representatives and local Union leadership to discuss die construction sourcing forecasts, the status of current and planned programs, and any circumstances that may have an effect on that status.
Recognizing that improvements are required in all areas of the die construction business, the Company is committed to driving for improvements in all facets of the revitalization plan. Additionally, the Company will consider prudent investments in Dearborn Tool and Die Plant directed at tool construction equipment to support specific improvements to achieve die construction competitiveness as identified by the plan.
28
DIE CONSTRUCTION PLANS
|	The Company will maintain its present sourcing pat-
tern for die construction programs. Sourcing for future programs will be enabled by improvements in the die construction process at Dearborn Tool and Die. The joint Steering Committee will share its blueprint for the revitalization of the die construction business immediately upon ratification of the 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The local parties must develop a Dearborn Tool and Die implementation plan within thirty (30) days of. said ratification consistent with the revitalization blueprint. .	.

• September 15,2003	'
Mr. Gerald D. Bantom
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214	. ,
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Die Trades in Protected Status - Stand Alone Stamping Plants
During 2003 negotiations, the parties discussed the practice of placing die trades in Protected status in certain Stamping Business Unit (SBU) plants. The Company acknowledges its responsibility with respect	1
to the job security provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement related to placing such tradesper-sons in Protected status.
During the term of the 2003 Agreement, plant manage, ment will review the application of the job security agreement with appropriate representatives ■ of the local Union before placing a tradesperson in such Protected status, lb help ensure greater utilization of the die trades, the Company intends to implement a Last Hit Program in its SBU stamping plants. The objective of the Program is to lower hit-to-hit times by 20% year-over-year following the first year of implementation. Specifically, the die trades will be relied upon to save the last part(s) following each production run and retain it with the die. Such part(s) will be evaluated for dimensional integrity, surface discrepancies, and other quality-related issues using a team approach with full cooperation between die technical support, quality personnel, and the trades. The team will be empowered to evaluate and implement appropriate die repairs to optimize quality and achieve positive improvements.
Results of the Last Hit Program will be reviewed at the Annual Business Plan Review by members of the SBU management and the National Ford Department based
30

on input from the plant teams. Modifications to the Last Hit Program may be made by the local parties as the Program matures, with an emphasis on continuous improvement and sharing of best-practices across the plants.
In addition, business conditions permitting, the SBU will make efforts to source die-related work to select SBU plants where die trades are in protected status and such work can be competitively performed without additional investment.

the Union will withhold initiating a grievance protesting the employee's workload until the procedure has been ex-■	hausted. ,
PROCEDURE:
1.	The review procedure will be used as a result of:
a.	Complaints from employees to supervisors, either directly or through their Local Union representa-tive(s), that the completion of an operation is con. tinuaily difficult, or
b.	At the request of supervision where an employee is continually not completing the operation.
|	2. Upon notification by either the plant labor relations

f.	Check for a mix problem.
g.	Determine whether the best method and sequence is being utilized.
h.	Determine whether the operation is being performed in accordance with the production standard as established.
33

manner and at a reasonable pace, resulting in a quality product.
The parties agreed that floor supervision will use scheduling data and advanced planning techniques, such as the High Option Content Report (HOCR) and the national mix blend, to respond to adverse mix conditions. In addition, each facility shall locally establish a containment plan, as provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, to address any adverse mix or overcycle conditions and the process will be communicated to impacted employees.
The parties further agree to establish a joint training program that will be funded from the Education, Development, and Training Program funds for the purpose of providing appropriate local company and union personnel techniques to effectively address mix/cycle situations. The parties agree to meet after the conclusion of negotiations to jointly develop subject matter content and an implementation plan.

Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Production Standards Grievances after the Four-Month Period
During the recent negotiations, the Union expressed concern about production standards grievances resolved outside of the four-month period specified in the Work Allocation Letter of October 5, 1976. More specifically, the Union	<
was referring to the effect on an undisputed operation involved in the grievance settlement of a disputed operation.
This will confirm that if the resolution of a production standards dispute after the four-month period results in work being reassigned to another operation, the employee on such operation is not precluded from disputing the work reallocation through the Procedure for Review of Work Assignments or the Grievance Procedure.

Subject: Rescheduling of Employee Relief and Lunch Periods - Car and Truck Assembly Plants
During the current negotiations the union raised concerns regarding the frequency and extent to which operating management changes the established lunch and relief periods in car and truck assembly plants.
The parties reaffirm the provisions of Article IV, Section 4(a) concerning the scheduling of relief periods and Article X, Section 6 regarding the advancement or delay of employees’ lunch periods.
The Company assures the union that it is the intention of management to provide appropriate relief to all employees as provided in the agreement and not alter the lunch period or relief schedule except in instances where there is a legitimate need to do so, such as a breakdown that cannot be resolved quickly. To address issues concerning the advancement of relief and lunch periods, the Company agrees that for affected employees the regularly scheduled relief cycle after lunch will not commence until one-half hour after the end of the regularly established lunch period.

Subject: Relief Pattern Changes - AssemblyOperations	-
During these negotiations the Company and Union discussed the competitive pressure within the automotive industry and the necessity to respond to market fluctuations. The ability to align production -with customer demand is an essential competitive element. The parties agreed to create an avenue to address market fluctuations while minimizing operational churning between periods of heightened production requirements and reduced customer demand. Therefore, it was agreed that the Company, with concurrence from the National Ford Department, may exercise the option to transition between relief patterns (mass/tag) to address fluctuations in customer demand.
This letter does not impact the Company’s right to address short-term operating issues that require transition between relief patterns.

TOOL AND DIE CONSTRUCTION
October 4, 1979
Mr. Ken Bannon, Vice President
Director—National Ford Department
International Union, UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214	'
Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject; Tool and Die Construction
During the current negotiations the Union expressed its concern over the effect on employment opportunities for seniority journeymen in tool and die classifications (Appendix F) of Company decisions to utilize non-Company sources for new machining, fabrication, repair, tryout and related checking fixture construction work normally assigned to the die construction activity in the plants of the Metal Stamping Division, including the Dearborn Tool and Die Plant.
As explained by the Company in the discussion of this subject, and particularly with reference to the meetings in 1975 with Rouge Tool & Die Unit representatives regarding the delayed 1977 car and truck model die construction program, decisions concerning the effective utilization of in-house die capacity and outsourcing are the responsibility of the Metal Stamping Division Management.
It is the policy of the Company to retain new die machining, fabrication, repair, tryout and related checking fixture construction work within the die construction activity of plants in the Metal Stamping Division to the extent the Company’s program requirements can reasonably be met. Of course, the final decision must be made by the Company based upon its assessment of these requirements and the facts known to the Company at the time the decision is made.
The decision to retain such work in-house or to utilize non-Company sources is influenced by many considerations, including the magnitude of the new die construction program, the timing of each phase of the program, the availability of facilities, specialized equipment and necessary skills within the work force, the complicating effect of design modifications and bottleneck operations such as machining limitations and the unavailability, of presses to perform
41
TOOL AND DIE CONSTRUCTION
necessary tryout work, the efficiencies and economics involved, and the need to maintain a reliable supply base in view of the fluctuations and uncertainties of the die construction business. '
Many of the same considerations which influence the allocation of such work by division management also impact the accomplishment of the objectives established for local plant management as a part of the overall new die construction program. For example, the unavailability of machining capacity in the plant die construction activity may lead to the decision to utilize a non-Company source in order to assure that deadlines in the program are met.
A local management decision to utilize a non-Company source for such work should consider, in addition to all other relevant factors, any adverse employment impact on the plant’s tool and die work force, i.e., seniority journeymen in the affected classifications are laid off or would be laid off as a direct result of the decision.
In the event that such a decision is being contemplated, local management will, except where time and circumstances prevent it, have advance discussion with local union representatives concerning the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reasons why management is contemplating utilizing a non-Company source. At such time, Company representatives are expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on the Company’s plans and to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.
In making a final decision,, the Company will not act arbitrarily or capriciously in disregard of the legitimate interests of Ford employees.
In addition, where the Company considers that work practices or provisions of local agreement may be having an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to compete in this field effectively, management will discuss such matters on a timely basis with local union representatives and explore
42

Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Tool and Die Work
During our current negotiations, the Union's National Ford Negotiating Committee raised with the Company the problem of job opportunities for Ford seniority skilled tool and die employees. These opportunities are affected upon occasion by Company decisions to purchase, rather than manufacture, certain tools, dies, fixtures and similar equipment, despite the fact that the Company has the facilities to do such work.
As we pointed out to you, the Company cannot agree to any conditions on its right to make make-or-buy decisions. In making such decisions, it intends to continue to give appropriate consideration to the operating needs of the business, the efficiencies and economies involved, and other pertinent factors, including the consequences of such decisions to the employment opportunities of its skilled tool and die employees. The Company is genuinely interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for these employees, consistent with the needs of the enterprise.

In connection with this matter, we informed you of the Company’s continuing program to improve its die construction facilities in the Rouge Area. Approximately $2,000,000 has been expended on this program in the past two years, • and some quarter of a million additional dollars have been appropriated for further improvements.	.

VO ASSEMBLY & STAMPING OPERATIONS COST OBJECTIVES EFFORTS
materials savings, labor and overhead, fuel and utilities, bulk materials, launch improvements, and other areas that contribute to achieving the plant's overall annual cost objectives.
Company and Union recognition of work group involvement and the impact on cost objectives was demonstrated by the significant work of the VO Total Cost Pilot Committee, and local plant committees that embraced the opportunities of continuous improvement. The parties would like to acknowledge and recognize the work of these committees. Through the efforts of these groups a full range of cost elements that are essential to meeting the competitive challenges in the auto industry have been identified.
The efficient and effective utilization of our people is critical to the continuous improvement process. In this regard,. VO will continue to utilize work group contributions to support the elimination of waste and the establishment of a continuous improvement mindset. This process may at times include the identification of productivity enhancements that result in available labor, which will be addressed in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The parties acknowledge the importance of sharing annual cost objectives with the Union leadership to provide an understanding of business conditions and the opportunity for input. This communication will take place annually and will include the Vice President of Vehicle Operations and the appropriate National Ford Department leadership, designated by the UAW Vice President and Director of the National Ford Department.

WORK ALLOCATIONS IN ASSEMBLY PLANTS
October 5, 1976
Mr. Ken Bannon, Wee President	.
Director—National Ford Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Work Allocations in Assembly Plants
During the 1976 negotiations, the Union sought, as it has in the past, a Company commitment that work allocations in the car and truck assembly plants would be made early in the model run and would remain unchanged for the balance of the model run.	■
The Company has consistently emphasized the great number of factors that influence its ability to make unchangeable work allocations early in the model run in its vehicle assembly plants, among which are the overmanning that sometimes occurs early in the model in connection with launching, the normal difficulties which are associated with the production of new models, the engineering changes which occur throughout the model run, the frequent variations in body mix and option installation rates, the changes in processing and tooling which occur frequently and continually, and the continuing efforts which the Company makes to achieve a satisfactory level of manpower efficiency and work load balance.
Article IX, Section 2(b) of the Ford-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement explicitly recognizes these and other factors and objectives as the underpinning of the Improvement Factor increases provided for in the Agreement.
Nonetheless, we are not unmindful of the interest which employees in the vehicle assembly plants have in securing a reasonably certain level of work assignment at some point in time in the model run. As we have discussed, the factors described in the second paragraph above are particularly I	critical in those vehicle assembly plants in the model years in
which there is a new or major change car or truck line and somewhat less critical in the plants in which the so-calied “carryover” or "face-lift,' vehicles are assembled, vehicles
46
r
WORK ALLOCATIONS IN ASSEMBLY PLANTS
which undergo a relatively limited year-to-year change. Even in the latter cases, however, they are not unimportant.
With respect to the latter vehicle assembly plants, the Company will assure that by the end of four months after the t	line speed reaches scheduled production, suitable employee
work allocations will have been made and will remain unchanged for the balance of that year’s model run, excepting as a change in work allocation is occasioned by changes in line speed, mix, option installation rates, tooling, processing, engineering or design specifications, methods or layout, it is expressly understood that this arrangement will not constitute any kind of acknowledgment that the work load or work allocation as of the time it becomes unchanged will represent a full work load, nor does it carry any assurance or implication that the work allocation in the succeeding model year will remain unchanged, regardless of the degree of vehicle change.

Dear Mr. Yokich:	.
Subject: Work Allocations in Assembly Plants—Application of Changes
During 1987 negotiations, the parties discussed interpretation of certain provisions of the 1976 letter “Work Allocations in Assembly Plants”.
It is with respect to work reallocations after the four-month period referenced in the letter which are occasioned by changes in tooling, processing, engineering or design specifications, methods or layout that the question of proper application arose, particularly when they may result in manpower reductions.
The parties have agreed that in such cases there must be some regard for the magnitude and significance of the changes to avoid rendering meaningless the assurance given to employees contemplated in the letter. The change should be such that there is a real and identifiable effect on the operation(s) impacted! Relatively minor changes after the four months are not to be used to justify major work reallocations.
Prior to implementation of changes in this nature the appropriate union representative will be advised of the planned change.

Dear Mr. Lofton:	.	.	.
Subject: Work Allocation — Problem Resolution Process,
During the recent negotiations, the Union alleged that certain local assembly plant managements were not adhering to the provisions of the September 17, 1987 Letter of Understanding entitled, “Work Allocations in Assembly Plants— Application of Changes.” Specifically, the Union claimed that management at certain plants continue to make insignificant changes after the four-month period which resulted in additional major work reallocations. The Company reaffirmed its commitment that the changes made during this period must have a real and identifiable effect on the operationfsj impacted. It also is the intent of the Company to continue to abide by the assurances given in the October 5, 1976 Letter, “Work Allocations in-Assembly Plants.”	'
In those instances foliowing' the four-month period, the Company'agrees to provide ample advance notification to the Unit Chairperson 'and/or local Production Standards Representative of work allocation changes. It is intended that concurrent with this notification, the Unit Chairperson and/or local Production Standards Representative will be informed of the nature and the reason for the changes. The parties recognize that there are certain temporary conditions including safety, ergonomic or quality concerns that may occur that would make advance notification impractical. The Company also assured the Union that its concerns in this regard will be fully communicated to all Plant Managers in the car and truck assembly plants, and that the principles contained in the September 17, 1987 Letter of Understanding will be reaffirmed to appropriate members of assembly plant management. This will be accomplished within a 90-day period following the ratification of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement.
52
WORK ALLOCATION — PROBLEM RESOLUTION PROCESS
To ensure this issue is dealt with effectively, at all levels, the local parties are directed to exhaust all means at their disposal to resolve any work allocation disputes arising from the September 17, 1987 letter, including discussion with senior plant management. Either party may, in writing, refer the dispute to the National Ford Department and the appropriate Program/Regionai Manager at Body and Assembly Operations for resolution.
It is the intent of the parties that these discussions and procedures would provide an avenue for resolution of such
work allocation issues without need to utilize the formal
grievance procedure. However, utilization of this resolution process does not preclude the use of the grievance procedure. ' • .

•	Both parties reaffirm their mutual intent to avoid backlogs and delays in the lower stages of the grievance procedure and to seek correction for those situations where the lower stages of the procedure do not appear to be functioning effectively.
•	Both parties have the responsibility to meet regularly on grievances in accordance with the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and that such meetings should not unnecessarily be postponed or delayed.	■
•	The relevant provisions of the grievance procedure, if closely administered, prevent the Company or Union representatives from delaying timely processing of grievances in the procedure.
National Parties' Review and Action
•	To improve the administration of the grievance procedure at all Company locations, appropriate personnel from either the National Ford Department or Labor Affairs of the Company may contact the other

party in situations where problems have developed in '	the administration of this procedure at specific Com-
pany locations.
•	Upon receipt of such request, representatives of the National Ford Department and Labor Affairs will meet r	to discuss the problems enumerated in an attempt to
j	formulate corrective action.
•	The parties must be sensitive to any trouble spots I	with a view to preventing problems before they arise,
i	In this regard, the parties will consult with appropri-
t	ate plant level Company and Union representatives
k	quarterly to determine the status of grievances pend-
।	ing in the lower stages of the procedure.
r	• Representatives from the National Ford Department
,	and Labor Affairs will meet at least quarterly or more
r	often if necessary to review and assess the parties’
administration of the grievance procedure at the ’	plant level. Such reviews are intended to identify
those locations that are beginning to experience ,	difficulty in the administration of the grievance pro>	cedure so that corrective action may be implemented
on a timely basis.
'	• Corrective action will be designed on a case by case
basis depending on the particular circumstances that '	exist at a location.
,	• The parties’ recommendations for corrective action
,	may be made binding on the local parties if the ■	problem is persistent.
Training in Administration of the Grievance Procedure
•	The parties also discussed training of representatives i	responsible for administering the grievance proce-
dure. Both parties recognize the benefits that can be 1	achieved in the administration of the Grievance Pro-
cedure when Company and Union representatives are knowledgeable concerning their roles and responsi-,	. bilities.
•	In this regard, the parties agree the UAW-Ford Collective Bargaining Agreement Training Program, .	■■ which is the subject of a separate Letter of Under’	standing, will include a module that addresses the
proper administration of the grievance procedure and

Dear Mr. Gettelfmger:
Subject: Clearing Disciplinary Records
This letter will serve to consolidate and confirm the following understandings reached by the parties with regard to effacement and clearing the charges from an employee’s disciplinary record.
With regard to the administration of discipline under Article IV, Section 3 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, this is to advise you that procedures have been instituted by the Company to assure that prior infractions which occurred more than 18 months previously are effaced from the employee's active disciplinary record in use for the purpose of determining current disciplinary measures.
In addition, the following instructions—“Clearing Disciplinary Records”—have been issued to all Company locations.
• An employee’s disciplinary record should be entered on some form of card file system or on the face of the labor relations jackets in which the copies .of the Forms 4600 are kept.
64
J
clearing disciplinary records
•	When a record is to be cleared the entry should be obliterated.
•	When a penalty is merely reduced and a charge stands, the lesser penalty should be inserted in place of the original one. The record should reflect the lesser penalty only.
•	A notation should be made on the Form 4600 of the rescinded or changed disciplinary action stating that the disciplinary action was removed or changed in accordance with an identified grievance or Umpire • case number.
•	All personnel in labor relations offices who use, transcribe, or post labor relations records should be made aware that rescinded entries must not be considered in any future disciplinary action, promotion case, etc.
•	Similar care should be taken to insure that disciplinary action more than 18 months old at the time of the ■ charge is not considered.
•	The rules above do not call for a review of all records on file. However, the above rules should be observed for future transactions and any time past records are used. Compliance with these rules will effectively clear an employee’s record of any charge of which the employee is or has been found innocent.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger
Subject: Computerizing the Grievance Procedure
During 1999 negotiations, the parties discussed the feasibility of computerizing certain portions of the Grievance Procedure.
This will confirm the parties have agreed to initiate a joint study of the issues associated with computerizing portions of the grievance procedure by the 2nd quarter of 2000. Should the parties conclude that computerizing portions of the grievance procedure is desirable, pilot programs will be conducted at selected locations. Unit committeepersons would be given access through computers presently accessible to committeepersons in in-plant union offices.
All cost associated with this study and any pilot programs the parties jointly agree upon (including such items as hardware, software, installation, maintenance, user training, program/security administration and development or modification of information systems) will be paid from the Education, Development and Training Program Funds upon approval of the Joint Governing Body.

Effective immediately, when an investigatory interview is conducted by Company representatives which may result in evidence to be used to discipline the employee, the following procedure is to be followed:
•	The Company employee conducting the investigatory interview will advise the employee of the right r	to Union representation.
•	Should the employee not desire Union representation, the employee will sign a waiver to that effect.
►	A standard Waiver of Union Representation Form has been
developed (attached). It is recommended that the Waiver of Union Representation form be used when a disciplinary inves-

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Disciplinary Practices - Appearance of Double Standard
During the 1999 negotiations, the Union expressed concern regarding plant disciplinary practices that have different application to hourly and salaried employees. The Union indicated this was an area that could unintentionally give rise to the appearance of a “double standard” of treatment. The Company is committed to fairness in the administration of discipline. Accordingly, in a continuing effort to establish and maintain a work environment characterized by mutual respect and trust, the Company informed the Union that a concern regarding this matter may be raised with local management for discussion.

8000 East Jefferson Avenue

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Oral Steps of Grievance Procedure—Supervisors/ Superintendents’ Participation
During 1993 Negotiations, the Union asserted that Supervisors and Superintendents, on occasion, fail to meet and discuss with the District Committeeperson on a timely basis those grievances processed into the oral steps of the First Stage of the Grievance Procedure.
The parties share a common interest in encouraging effective operation of the Grievance Procedure, with special emphasis on early resolution of grievances. Accordingly, the parties fully support the value and importance of full and timely discussion to resolve misunderstandings and to enhance relationships inherent in the oral discussion steps. The parties, therefore, recognize the obligations of: (1) Supervisors and Superintendents to give their best efforts at timely and thoughtful consideration of grievances discussed within the scope of their ability and authority, and to make appropriate adjustments when grievances are meritorious; and (2) District Committeepersons to give timely and thoughtful consideration to the issues and to withdraw grievances that are hot meritorious.
Difficulties with First Stage grievance administration should be addressed by the Unit Chairperson and local Employee Relations Manager. Upon request of either party, the matter may be referred to the National Ford Department and

k	Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Reinstitution of Grievances
The Company and the Union have long recognized that the mutually satisfactory resolution of employee complaints in the grievance procedure, by authorized Company and Union officials, results in a final and binding determination for both parties as well as the employee involved. The parties’ recognition of this principle has contributed stability and certainty to the grievance procedure. Accordingly, the Company views any attempt to reinstitute such claims by either party as being antithetical to the purposes for which the grievance procedure was established.
73
REINSTITUTION OF GRIEVANCES
However, subject to the provisions of Article VII, Section 19 of the parties’ Agreement, in those instances where the UAW’s International Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee have reviewed a grievance disposition and found that such disposition was improperly concluded by the Union body or representative involved, the National Ford Department may so inform the Labor Relations Staff of the Company and request in writing that such grievance be reinstituted in the parties' grievance procedure at the same level at which it was originally settled. After receipt of such written request, the grievance will be so reinstituted by the Company.
It is understood by the parties, however, that the Company will not be liable for any back pay claims from the time of original disposition to the time of reinstitution of the grievance, and it is further agreed that the reinstitution of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon agreement by the Union and the employee (s) that neither will pursue such back pay claim against the Company.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any other way either party’s rights or obligations pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement or the final and binding nature of any other grievance resolutions. It is also understood by the parties that this letter of understanding and the Company’s obligation to reinstitute grievances consistent with the conditions set forth above and upon written request from the Union, can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days’ notice in writing, to that effect.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Company Heat Stress Program
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the prevention of employee heat stress.
The Ford Motor Company will continue to emphasize its annual heat stress program. In addition, the Company will increase its efforts to assure compliance with this program by:
*	Assigning local responsibility for implementation of the program to the Plant Safety Engineer and the UAW-Ford Unit Health and Safety Representative.
•	Requiring that the Plant Safety Process Review Board evaluate and support the implementation of the Com-
' pany Heat Stress Program in early spring before local weather conditions generate potential heat stress conditions.	.
•	Requiring Operations/Divisions and the UAW-Ford National Joint Committee on Health and Safety (NJCHS) to monitor progress of the annual heat stress program.
The Plant Safety Engineer, the Unit Health and Safety Representative and other appropriate personnel will survey their plant to identify potential employee heat exposure issues in a timely manner before local hot weather is expected and measure the heat stress potential. From this survey, an action list will be developed to be promptly addressed.
Further, locations identified as potential heat stress areas will be reevaluated during hot weather after controls have been applied.
To assist in employee awareness and education efforts the NJCHS will develop new education materials, including a pocket employee heat stress guide, heat stress safety talks,

Subject: Full Utilization of Protected Employees
During the 1993 negotiations regarding the Job Security Program (JSP)—GEN, the parties discussed utilization of Protected employees at some length. The Company and the UAW have agreed that productive utilization of Protected employees is critical to the viability of our operations, and to the continued success of our Job Security Program. ■ It was agreed that local Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committees must make every effort to ensure that Protected employees are fully utilized on meaningful assignments. The parties have recognized that both underutilized employees and unproductive assignments are contrary to the spirit of the Agreement.
For purposes of the Job Security Agreement, “non-traditional” work could encompass any assignment (s) within the facility (except regular productive work, including the direct production, assembly or fabrication of vehicles or components) which can efficiently and safely be performed by the individuals involved.

During these negotiations the parties agreed that Ford employees leased to Visteon will be subject to the provisions of the UAW-Ford Collective Bargaining Agreement as it relates to Appendices M, N and O and related Letters of Understanding.
Ford employees (leased to Visteon) that are laid off from a Visteon location and those in GEN Protected Status will be administered according to the Letter of Understanding entitled Procedure for Placement of Protected Status Covered Events Employees.
Ford employees working in Ford Motor Company plants will not be surveyed for openings at Visteon locations. Ford employees working in Visteon locations can transfer to another Visteon location only if there are no available Ford Motor Company openings. Prior to hiring new employees at Ford locations, Ford employees leased to Visteon may volunteer for placement opportunities. Ford Motor Company has no obligation to replace attrition at Visteon locations.
The parties recognize that there may be occasions when Ford Motor Company and Visteon have available opportunities simultaneously. In this case, Ford Motor Company openings will be filled prior to the Visteon openings. Ford employees that are laid off from a Visteon location, or in Protected Status from a Visteon location, will be able to transfer to another Visteon location if there are no available opportunities at Ford Motor Company.

The parties recently discussed the 48 week volume layoff limiter contained in Appendix M of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and two issues that have arisen in regard to that
*	provision:
•	The desire of some UAW/Ford employees to be laid off instead of being placed in Protected Status during plant ►	down weeks or temporary shutdown of certain plant
operations.
•	The desirability of having a mechanism to help manage »	situations where the parties agree, it is impractical to
find meaningful assignments for Protected Status employees.
k	The parties have agreed that, for the duration of the 2003
Agreement, the Local Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee (Local committee) may, upon approval by the National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee, offer an option by which affected employees may elect layoff in lieu of Protected Status. (The option would by limited to those employees for whom meaningful Protected Status assignments are not available, as determined by the Local committee.) When this option is extended to an employee, it may be accepted or declined for each layoff on an employee-by-employee basis. Because such layoffs will be voluntary, they would not be considered contrary to the individual protection afforded by Appendix M of the Agreement. Any layoff resulting from an eligible employee’s election will be deemed a “qualifying

In making this commitment, it is understood that conditions may arise that are beyond the control of the Company, e.g., an Act of God, and could make compliance with this commitment impossible. Should such conditions occur, the Company will review both the conditions and their impact on a particular location with the Union and consistent with our past practice, the Company will attempt to redeploy employees to other locations and, if necessary, utilize the “special programs” identified in Appendix M of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

During these negotiations the parties discussed the concern that application of Appendix M, Job Security Program - GEN could result in employees remaining in Protected Status at one plant while another plant in the same zone (as defined in Appendix N, Attachment A) was hiring. It was acknowledged that, should such a situation occur, it would be inconsistent with the parties' commitment to enhancing job security in a work environment that promotes operational effectiveness and competitiveness, and could deny Protected Status employees an opportunity to return to regular jobs.
To address that situation, the parties have agreed to placement flexibility for employees in Protected Status Covered Event, excluding those identified in Protected Status as a result of net outsourcing as defined in the Attachment. Unless there is a compelling reason not to do so, such employees may be placed in-zone on a mandatory basis.

It was acknowledged that, should such a situation occur, it would be inconsistent with the parties’ commitment to enhancing job security in a work environment that promotes operational effectiveness and competitiveness, and could deny Protected Status employees an opportunity to return to regular jobs.	■>	,	,	,
To address that situation,' the parties have agreed to placement flexibility for employees in Protected Status Covered Event, excluding those identified in Protected Status as a result of net outsourcing as defined in the Attachment; Unless there is a compelling reason not to do so, such employees may be placed in-zone on a mandatory basis. The process to place such employees will be as' follows (in accordance with Appendix N of the Collective Bargaining Agreement):
•	Laid-off employees will, continue to be placed inzone on a mahidatory basis;
•	In-zone Protected Status Covered Event employees from all locations where there are employees in GEN Protected Status and where in-zone opportunities exist will be advised of available in-zone opportunities via posting for voluntary transfer. Prior to in-zone placement, the Local Hourly Personnel Offices will post a notice for in-zone oppop

I,	and training, interpersonal skills training and Employee
Involvement and “Best-In-Class" Quality training. It is under-f	stood that the cost of these joint programs, wages of the
'	trainees, travel expenses and other training expenses may
’	be chargeable against the Local Training Funds. While the
funds are intended for the training of UAW bargaining unit employees, there may be situations where it will be natural k	for some salaried employees to receive the same training.
Such training expenses of non-bargaining unit employees may be funded by Local Training Funds provided such handling is mutually agreeable with local unions and local management.	*
In addition, Local Training Funds will be used for joint endeavors in support of programs, projects and activities
’	newly specified in this Agreement, or as subsequently
agreed by the Joint Governing Body, as eligible for such funding. Job skills development and training expenses related to the Job Security Program will be provided by Local Training Funds.
In these negotiations, the parties reaffirmed their commit-»	ment to the Technical Skills Program. Local unions and
I	management are encouraged to utilize Local Training Funds
j	for education and training projects consistent with the
141
LOCAL TRAINING FUNDS
UAW-Ford Technical Skills Program provisions of Appendix T to the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Requests for authorization to expend Local Training Funds must be jointly approved by the local parties. In situations where mutual agreement regarding funding approval cannot be reached locally, either party may appeal the issue to the Joint Governing Body.
When the local parties authorize funds for Employee Involvement or “Best-In-Class" Quality endeavors, they are to assure that these endeavors are consistent with National Joint Committee on Employee Involvement and/or Quality Improvement Implementation Committee guidelines. When the parties authorize funds for permissible Job Security	]
Program activities, they are to assure that such activities are	j
consistent with National Job Security and Operational Effec-	1
tiveness Program Committee guidelines.
The parties agreed it would be inappropriate to use Local Training Funds to train employees required to service newly introduced technology. However, use of Local Training	,
Funds to provide subsequent general training of other	]
employees on this equipment to broaden their skills is	(
appropriate, when agreed by the local parties. Further, it was agreed, Local Training Funds should not be used for training	.
of employees to implement a newly negotiated change in classifications, but use of Local Training Funds to freshen or	1
update generally the skills of employees is appropriate. Local
Training Funds may be used to pay wages of employees	'
assigned to short-term local education and training related	,
projects. Local Training Funds may not be used to establish special assignments or administrative positions unrelated to	.
local education and training projects as specified in updated and revised guidelines.	‘
In addition, certain expenditures require prior approval by	,
the Joint Governing Body or its designees. These expenditures include: the purchase, construction or lease of any real property (land and buildings)—no matter what its value; the purchase or lease of items or services over $10,000; the	J
purchase of promotional items in excess of $5 per person; and the payment of wages to an individual employee for assignment(s) in support of local education and training	,

related projects that exceed 20 days in the-aggregate within .	the calendar year.

The provisions for Local Training Funds do not limit in any way the right of either party to provide educational and '	training programs on the same, similar, or other subjects as

MUTUAL GROWTH FORUM
r	•
October 9, 1999
Mr. Ron Gettelfinger
t	Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue	'
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Mutual Growth Forum
The UAW-Ford relationship is dramatically different today than it was when the Union and the Company signed their first Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Both parties recognize that the need for change continues— that prosperity, secure employment, and the mutual inter
143
MUTUAL GROWTH FORUM
ests of all depend upon our ability to meet the competitive challenge of today’s market through growth, development, and adaptation. Perhaps most of all, the parties realize they must explore new methods of resolving their honest differences in orderly, rational ways.
Both parties also recognize that positive change is possible only when progressive, cooperative attitudes exist at all levels of our two organizations. Where we find such attitudes are lacking, the Company and the Union must work vigorously to instill them.
During these negotiations, the parties continued their commitment to the Mutual Growth Forum principles and concepts. The Mutual Growth Forum constitutes a joint process for labor-management consultation, communication, and mutual problem solving. It complements other joint endeavors, as well as the collective bargaining process itself.
This Forum does not replace collective bargaining, nor does it interfere in any way with the parties' Grievance Procedure. Rather, it provides a framework designed to promote better management-union relations through better communications, systematic fact finding, and advance discussion of certain business developments that are of material interest and significance to the Union, UAW-represented Ford employees, and the Company.
The parties regard the Mutual Growth Forum as a major progressive step. It promotes understanding, improves relationships, and prevents disputes by providing for ongoing, constructive, and cooperative problem solving. Both the Company and the Union have pledged to bring good faith diligence to the process and to be responsive to issues and concerns raised by the other party.
It is understood that the make-up, organization, and procedures of the Mutual Growth Forum are not subject to the Grievance Procedure of the parties' Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The parties recognize that information to be made available frequently is of a sensitive nature and may have important competitive implications. Accordingly, they agree that information and data shared at these meetings will be accorded appropriate confidential treatment and will not be disclosed
144
MUTUAL GROWTH FORUM
to outside firms, agencies, or persons without the consent of .	the party providing it.
The lists of matters that can be dealt with in Mutual Growth I	Forum meetings are illustrative, and topics, including those
listed, are always subject to the mutual agreement of the parties.
[	Local Mutual Growth Forum
L	At the local level, the make-up and organization of the forum
I	is entirely at the discretion of the local parties. It is
suggested, however, that forum meetings be held at least .	quarterly, but meetings may be held more often if mutually
r	agreed by the parties.	'
The local forum may deal with a variety of matters having special interest to the employees, the Local Union, and the t	Management of the plant. Among these might be:
•	Finding ways to improve two-way communications at the location.
•	Discussing the plant's general operations, and certain business developments, within the scope of available knowledge and the plant's responsibility.
•	Determining principal matters of concern to the employees, the Union, and Management.
•	Discussing the quality of the plant’s products and other general indicators of performance as well as UAW Quality Representative issues of concern.
•	Discussing the plant’s health and safety activities.
•	Discussing and clarifying general plant administrative matters (e.g., inter-departmental relationships and internal communications procedures) and improving approaches and attitudes.
•	Addressing other matters the local parties agree are appropriate for discussion.
If the local forum is interested in studying or implementing innovative pilot projects or experiments in human resources development, it will make its interests known to the national forum. As noted later, that body has special authorities that may be useful in this regard.
Periodically, the local forum will review financial and business information to keep the local parties and the employees
145
MUTUAL GROWTH FORUM
informed about the performance and outlook of the Company as a whole.
In this regard, the parties agree to investigate new and innovative ways to deliver this information. Costs related to these activities, and other developments in support of national initiatives as may be approved by the Joint Governing Body, may be funded through the Education, Development and Training Program.
Agendas for meetings of the local foriim will be established jointly. Each party will provide reasonable advance notice of the subjects it wishes discussed. Local forums may issue reports to the national forum if they wish, and local forums, or either party, may request assistance from the national forum if they feel the local forum or its activity is not being conducted within the spirit and intent of this letter.
Division Mutual Growth Forums
To further improve communication and information sharing at all levels of both the Company and Union organizations, the parties have agreed to encourage division Mutual Growth Forums. These forums should meet to discuss and review division-wide matters and should operate in ways similar to the local forums and national forum. Members of this forum include key division operating Management and appropriate UAW National Ford Department representatives. Representatives of Human Resources and UAW regional personnel also may be invited to attend.
National Mutual Growth Forum
At the national level, the Mutual Growth Forum has an equal number of Union and Company representatives designated by the Company’s Vice Chairman Chief of Staff and by the Vice President and Director of the UAW National Ford Department. Meetings are chaired by co-chairpersons—one Company and one Union.
The national forum deals principally with matters of mutual interest of a broad, corporate-wide nature. Its charter includes such items as:
•	Monitoring and improving the Company’s overall labor relations climate.
•	Discussing the Company’s general operations and certain business developments.
146
MUTUAL GROWTH FORUM
’	• Examining government relations matters (including
,	auto industry regulations) of mutual interest.
• Jointly studying human resources needs, trends, developments, concepts, etc. in industry and elsewhere.
,	• Implementing pilot projects and experiments recom-
mended by local forums and monitoring innovative human resources management and development ap-
'	proaches.
'	« Collecting, organizing, and disseminating informa,	tion and other data required by the national forum to
perform its mission.
•	• Commissioning studies (both internally and by out-
siders) to identify and explore issues of mutual concern. (Where such studies by outsiders may be mutually desirable, the national forum will recommend joint programs funding be provided.)
■	• Visiting both Company and non-Company facilities to
review and discuss information on issues and con-
’	cepts important to the forum's mission.
>	• Maintaining liaison with local forums and assisting
and encouraging them as appropriate.
"	As appropriate, the national forum will establish standing or
j	ad hoc subcommittees or working groups to explore or
।	resolve selected issues. Where there are appropriate issues of
L	mutual interest and concern, the national forum, upon the
(	approval of the Company’s Vice Chairman Chief of Staff and
the Vice President and Director of the UAW National Ford Department, may request periodic meetings between mem'	bers of the Union leadership designated by the Vice President
,	and Director of the National Ford Department and Company
;	operating Management,
'	In addition, periodic meetings will continue to be scheduled
between members of the UAW National Ford Department and the senior operating management of Ford Motor Com-

1	provide greater information sharing and discussion with
j	members of Management involved in important Company

proved in advance by the parties. Such meetings will be arranged by the Company Vice Chairman Chief of Staff. The
f	147
MUTUAL GROWTH FORUM
Vice President and Director of the National Ford Department, assistants, and members of the operations committee will be regular meeting members. -
Periodically, the national forum may direct the preparation of a presentation on the state of the UAW-Ford relationship. As approved by the Company’s Vice Chairman Chief of Staff, and the Vice President and Director of the UAW National Ford Department, this presentation may be made to members of the Company’s senior Management and/or Union leadership bodies. In addition, as arranged by the Company’s Vice Chairman Chief of Staff, the Vice President and Director of the UAW National Ford Department may address the Company’s Board of Directors on relevant matters semiannually.

NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION PROGRAM
September 16, 1996
Mr. Ernest Lofton
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue	'
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: New Employee Orientation Program
The parties have long recognized the importance of providing orientation programs for new employees. Many of these programs resulted from the diligent efforts of plant employee groups and have addressed such topics as quality, teamwork, safety, and joint programs in addition to those items new employees must know to perform their jobs.
148
t	NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION PROGRAM
|	The parties agreed to supplement these local programs by
I	providing a national New Employee Orientation Program
through the auspices of the National Education, Development and Training Center. The Program was developed and successfully launched by a joint study team of UAW and Ford f	representatives and technical consultants. The focus of the
program is on national materials that explain the respective roles of Ford and the UAW, the state of the auto industry, the changing composition and diversity of the work force, the '	negotiated joint programs, and how employees, Manage-
ment, and the Union work together to foster employee well-being and Company business success which benefits r	both employees and communities.
The national program ensures uniformity of message and treatment. Throughout the development of the orientation program, the National Center obtained broad-based feed-•	back from operations/division, plant, and Union representa-
tives to ensure the program met the needs of its customers. The program is available to requesting locations, including appropriate support on how to deliver it most effectively. The national program is packaged in self-contained modules to provide local parties the flexibility to incorporate each segment into their ongoing local orientation programs as they deem appropriate. Locations should make the program available to new employees within a reasonable period of time. The national program content will be kept up-to-date and the program will be evaluated periodically to ensure it is meeting its goals. Training will be provided as needed to Company and Union representatives from each location responsible for administering the program.
The national New Employee Orientation Program is funded through the UAW-Ford Education, Development and Training Program. Ongoing costs incurred at each location may be funded through Local Training Funds. Local parties may request funding for ongoing program costs from the Education, Development and Training Program, as necessary.
The New Employee Orientation Program shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure nor in any way limit communications by the Company with its employees or by the Union with its members.
149
NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION PROGRAM
In addition to developing national orientation materials, the UAW-Ford National Education, Development and Training Center will provide consulting and review assistance to requesting locations who wish to assess their local orientation programs. To assist in this process, the National Center has developed a model local orientation program, and guidelines for measuring the effectiveness of local programs.

Dear Mr. Lofton:

Involvement and “Best-In-Class” Quality	'
During these negotiations, the Union and the Company	1
reaffirmed the relationship between UAW-Ford Employee	1
Involvement and the “Best-In-Class” Quality Program.	‘
The parties recognized that there is a broad area where the	,
programs have common goals. Both are aimed at continuous improvement in quality and in workplace relations among ■ J employees, Management, and the Union. Both provide in-	।
creased opportunities for employee participation in work-	1
place decisions that affect them. There also are other areas	j
of mutual interest such as group problem solving, participa-	1
tion in local joint steering committees, developing and	J

implementing training programs, and efforts to improve communications.
The long-term success of the Company, and the job satisfac-'	tion and job security that can result from “best-in-class”
quality frequently require an integrated relationship be-‘	tween UAW-Ford Employee Involvement and the “Best-In-
b	Class” Quality Program, as well as coordination with the
‘	other joint programs, especially on a local level. Achieving
'	total quality excellence in every aspect of our manufactur-
ing, assembly and parts distribution operations is possible '	only when all workers are involved fully in the effort.
.	The Union and the Company are committed to providing a
work environment which allows each worker to contribute
i	fully to the quality of Ford products and services. In this
regard, it frequently will serve our broad interests if the
*	personnel assigned to the UAW-Ford Employee Involvement
,	and “Best-In-Class” Quality Program efforts are used on
complementary special projects. This would include assist>	ing in local training and other initiatives that benefit the
'	workplace. When relevant, and as approved by the Joint
1	Governing Body, combined national conferences and train,	ing would be held. Similarly, these activities may be con-
ducted on a divisional or operations basis as determined by f	the parties.

RETURN TO WORK FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE-RELATED MEDICAL LEAVE — ILLEGAL DRUGS AND UNAUTHORIZED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
I"	September 16, 1996
Mr. Ernest Lofton
,	Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department	,
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Return to Work from Substance Abuse-Related
Medical Leave — Illegal Drugs and Unauthorized ' Prescription Drugs
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed their firm commitment to helping employees who are affected by substance abuse problems. In particular, the parties reviewed circumstances pertaining to an employee t	returning to work from substance abuse-related medical
leave of absence who is still using illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs.
The parties agreed that permitting such an employee to return to the workplace jeopardizes the employee’s safety and the safety of fellow employees. It also hampers the
155
RETURN TO WORK FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE-RELATED MEDICAL LEAVE — ILLEGAL DRUGS AND UNAUTHORIZED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
ability of the Company and the Union to meet today’s challenges, including the ability to achieve continuous improvement in quality, safety, customer satisfaction, and operating effectiveness.
To address this problem, the parties agreed;
•	Drug testing will be included as part of physical examinations for each employee returning to work from a first* substance abuse-related medical leave for treatment of illegal drug or .unauthorized prescription drug use or dependency. For purposes of this letter, only medical leaves occurring after the effective date of the 1996 Agreement, September 30, 1996, will be considered.
•	Drug testing will be conducted in accordance with established Company practice, and the reason for conducting the test and the test results will be strictly ’ confidential and will be made known only to the employee, the Central Diagnostic and Referral Agency, and Human Resources personnel having a business reason to know. '
•	An individual who tests positive for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs will not return to work from such a medical leave except under conditions set forth below;
— To facilitate recovery, the employee will be referred to the Central Diagnostic and Referral Agency for assessment and/or follow-up. ■
— Upon meeting the objectives of the prescribed course of treatment, if any, and presentation to the Company of acceptable written evidence of having completed assessment, and a negative drug test, the employee, if otherwise eligible, may return to work.
— The employee will be subject to drug testing for the following twenty-four (24) months. (Such testing will be conducted no more frequently than six times in any twelve-month period.)
*	Employees will be required to complete Central Diagnostic and Referral Agency assessment and pass a drug test administered by the Company Medical Services before returning to work from a first medical leave for treatment of illegal drug and/or unauthorized prescription drug use or dependency.
156
RETURN TO WORK FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE-RELATED MEDICAL LEAVE — ILLEGAL DRUGS AND UNAUTHORIZED
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
— The decision as to when an employee must have such a drug test will be made by Medical Services/ Human Resources, and will not be a supervisory determination.	.
— If the employee subsequently tests positive for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs, (including positive return from medical leave tests, positive 24-month tests, and positive DOT required drug tests but excluding positive “for cause" drug tests), the employee will not be allowed to continue work and will be placed on medical leave.
— Criteria for returning to work following this subsequent medical leave will be as described above.
• The Letter of Understanding, Employee Support Services Program, reads in part: “Employees with alcoholism, drug dependency, emotional or personal problems will be able to seek help voluntarily without having to be concerned that their employment status will be affected because they have sought help for such problems.” This provision notwithstanding:
— Any employee who has three positive drug tests within any three-year period, including positive return from medical leave tests, positive 24-month tests, and positive DOT required tests, but excluding positive “for cause” drug tests, may return to work after the third positive test only if, in addition to meeting the criteria specified above, that employee agrees to a twelve-month waiver.
— This waiver will require the following:
(1)	Drug testing during the period of the waiver,
(2)	Termination upon a positive drug test result, including positive return from medical leave tests, positive 24-month tests, positive DOT tests, and positive “for cause” tests.
(3)	No access to the Grievance Procedure to protest the reasonableness of any penalty, including discharge, as the result of a positive test for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs during the twelve-month period.
157
RETURN TO WORK FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE-RELATED MEDICAL LEAVE — ILLEGAL DRUGS AND UNAUTHORIZED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
(4)	Other terms and conditions of the waiver may be determined locally by the Company and the Union.
•	During the 24-month testing period and/or the period of the 12-month waiver, all time off work due to layoff, medical leave or personal leave will extend the length of the 24-month testing period and/or the period of the 12-month waiver by an identical number of work days.
•	An employee attempting to return to work from a medical leave for illegal drug or unauthorized prescription drug use or dependency who incurs four consecutive positive drug test results will be terminated as a “Quit - Failure to Meet Conditions of Employment -Substance Abuse.”
•	Any employee who refuses assessment, treatment, or testing in accordance with the provisions of this Letter of Understanding will be treated as though the employee had tested positive.
Employees affected by the above provisions would continue to be subject to the same standards of performance and conduct expected of any other employee.

These efforts have been undertaken by the parties to reinforce and improve the welfare and long-term job security of employees represented by the UAW, and concurrently improve Ford’s competitiveness in a global economy. Through jointly sponsored programs, Ford and the UAW have established technological and process-oriented approaches to the education and utilization of human resources to meet ever-growing competitive challenges, and thereby strengthen the job security of UAW-represented employees.
The Company and the Union will continue to undertake joint efforts in the following areas to contribute to the well-being of the Company and its employees: advanced manufacturing	'
technology development; National Programs Center programs; quality; job security and sourcing; employee support services; mutual growth; health and safety; employee in-	,
volvement; and the Ford workforce and its role in providing
high quality products. The endeavors of Company and Union	1
representatives assigned to these efforts result in an array of programs that enhance the technical and process skills of	'
the workforce. The Company and the Union recognize that a	,
highly educated and skilled workforce is a critical factor in improving competitiveness, and therefore, in tempering the	,
cyclical unemployment traditionally experienced in the au-
tomotive industry.	'
The parties have thoroughly examined the objectives and	।
approaches of the efforts described above, and agree that	'
use of the jointly administered funds of the Education,	J
162
THE PARTIES' UNDERSTANDING OF JOINT EFFORTS
Development and Training Program (EDTP) to support these efforts is appropriate. EDTP funds shall be designated for the Program, the Center and its activities, or such other purposes for the benefit of employees as may be agreed upon by the Co-Presidents of the Joint Governing Body. We have also supported research projects or efforts by other training, educational or cultural institutions which will through education and exposure promote our goal of labor and management cooperation in the workplace.
The parties further agree that new programs and activities designed to enhance the welfare and job security of UAW-represented employees may be funded by the EDTP, when authorized by the Joint Governing Body, acting under the provisions of Appendix T to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (Memorandum of Understanding - National Programs Center; Education, Development and Training Program; and Technical Skills Program). Expenditures for such other purposes as may be agreed upon by the Co-Presidents of the Joint Governing Body may be authorized and approved by them or their designated representatives.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Training Facilities
For more than a decade, the UAW-Ford Joint Governing Body has supported development of plant training facilities. During this same period, technical training has become increasingly important. Beginning in 1986, with the first Grants for Plants program, the Joint Governing Body provided the local	■
parties with funding to develop onsite training facilities conducive to world-class learning. This support continued with the introduction of the UAW-Ford Technical Skills Program follow-	,
ing 1993 bargaining and again in 1996 and 1999 with the announcement of a new Grants for Plants program. Every major	■
facility in the Company has a training facility available onsite at their location.	'
During the course of these negotiations the Union expressed	,
concern regarding technical training facilities as well as the adequacy of other training facilities at some locations.	<
The parties agreed that if such concerns are not resolved at the local level, UAW-Ford National Programs Center repre-	'
sentatives will meet with appropriate representatives from	_
the location and the Operations Human Resources Business Operations to review local training facility concerns.	i

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Training Schedules
The parties agree that education and training of the UAW-represented work force is an essential element in achieving continuous improvement and is critical to the Company's competitiveness. The Union expressed concern during these negotiations that on occasion, at some locations, scheduled education, and training activities were postponed, suspended or canceled. Rationale for schedule revisions included insufficient numbers of replacement personnel, lack of or reassignment of funding for training and for other business related reasons.
During 2003 negotiations, the parties reaffirmed the understanding that when education and training activities are postponed, suspended or canceled repeatedly, the local

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger: .	.
Subject: UAW-Ford Family Service and Learning Center
During these negotiations the Company and the Union have agreed to significantly reaffirm their commitment to the* employees of Ford Motor Company by creating a new joint effort targeted at families of Ford employees. The parties agree that a strong family structure is important for family stability, growth and community well being.
As a result of this commitment, UAW-Ford Family Service and Learning Centers (FSLCs) will be established in close proximity to UAW represented Ford facilities to assist eligible Ford employees and retirees by providing access to a comprehensive variety of services and educational programs for active employees, retirees, their spouses and dependent children through three program components:
• Family Education Programs and Service (e.g., parenting education, health and wellness programs, vacation pro-	'
grams, before and after school programs, retirement and financial planning services and other family supportive programs and services as may be mutually agreeable)	,
will be available to active employees, retirees, their
spouses and dependent children.	1
• High quality early childhood education services (e.g.,	.
high quality child care - infant through kindergarten) will
be delivered through two key strategies: (1) dedicated	.
child care centers will be available at mutually agreed
upon FSLCs, where there is appropriate need and de-	•
mand; and (2) a network or preferred rate/preferred
placement providers. Because of the costs associated
with high quality child care and the anticipated demand,	,
these services only will be available for dependent
children of active employees.	I
168
UAW-FORD FAMILY SERVICE AND LEARNING CENTER
• Community Service Education and Outreach Programs ,	and Services (e.g., support activities to encourage com-
munity volunteerism, identify volunteer opportunities, and offer training to volunteers) will be available to active employees, retirees, their spouses and dependent ’	children.
i	The services and programs of the UAW-Ford Family Service
and Learning Center will evolve to reflect the needs of our t	work force.
The FSLCs will be managed as a distinct entity governed by the UAW and Ford. The management structure will consist l	of a Joint Board of an equal number of UAW and Ford
[	representatives at the national level. The Joint Board will
i	select and oversee a contracted professional management
[	group to operate the program nationally and locally. The
f	contracted national professional staff would be responsible
for planning, implementation, selection of local vendor/ service providers and certification of child care providers. The resources of the National Programs Center will be j	available to support this effort.
*	• Local joint committees and others, as appropriate, will
provide counsel to the local FSLC operator on local ’	programming requirements and opportunities.
>	• A vendor selected by the Joint Board will conduct a
comprehensive needs assessment to determine specific »	programs, activities and services to be offered within
'	each of the three major program components.
*	This initiative will service both hourly and salaried employ-
t	ees, retirees, their spouses and dependent children. Where
appropriate, linkages will be established with public pro-
1	grams and resources. As soon as practicable, the parties will

of funding and management for the new entity.	.
i	In addition, it is the parties intent that any programs,

UAW-FORD JOINT EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY COMMITTEES -NATIONAL AND LOCAL
September 15, 2003
Mr, Gerald D. Bantom
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom:	'
Subject: UAW-Ford Joint Equality and Diversity Committees - National and Local
Diversity in the workplace was an important and recurring topic throughout numerous discussions between the Company and the Union during the 2003 negotiations. Workplace diversity encompasses all of the many differences that define employees as unique and valuable individuals, including but not limited to culture, ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, age, abilities, disabilities, opinions, religion, beliefs, union affiliation, education, experience, military status, sexual orientation, marital status, and family status. Although the concept of diversity highlights our differences as individuals, the true value of workplace diversity is that such differences can create a whole that is more than the sum of its components - a group
170
.	UAW-FORD JOINT EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY COMMITTEES -
NATIONAL AND LOCAL
of individuals whose collective strengths are derived .	from understanding, appreciating, and capitalizing on
their particular personal attributes.
The parties share a vision of diversity in the workplace: an environment that promotes a culture, which encourages every individual to contribute fully to the success of their workplace while achieving maximum personal fulfillment. The contributions - actual as well ■	as potential - of all employees, regardless of differ-
ences, must be recognized, tapped, and appreciated. ’	Such a harmonious environment will foster positive
b	working relationships among all employees, thus al'	lowing UAW-Ford people to succeed to the best of
I	their abilities. Ultimately, this will result in a stronger
Ford Motor Company, in turn leading to greater job p	security. Hut fundamentally, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, diversity is a matter of respect for the other human beings with whom we spend a significant portion of our lives - our co workers. Union and Company leadership alike embrace this vision.
For many years the Company and Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and ’	effectuating policies against sexual harassment and
discrimination because of ethnicity, race, nationality, gender, age, disabilities, religion, union affiliation, p	sexual orientation, marital status, and family status.
To this end the parties have continued in their Agreement an "Equal Application of Agreement" provision that both ensures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Ford Motor Company and provides the Grievance Procedure for the resolution ,	of alleged violations of that principle.
’	In addition, the parties recognize the desirability of
increased communication and cooperative efforts for the following purposes:
.	• to encourage employees and grievance representa-
tives to use the contractual Grievance Procedure as the exclusive method for prompt resolution of all claims of denied equal application rights
* to determine the cause of such claims, arising or recurring	.
171
L
UAW-FORD JOINT EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY COMMITTEES -
NATIONAL AND LOCAL
•	to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights agencies
•	to increase understanding and seek solutions to mutual problems
•	to promote and encourage use of the Grievance Procedure in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously, which is frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, nonproductive to relieving employee problems,
•	to relieve tensions in the areas of equal application, diversity and sexual harassment
•	to exchange information, expertise and advise.
Accordingly, the parties agree to establish the UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee, and UAW-Ford Local Joint Equality and Diversity Committees.
The UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee will consist of eight (8) members, four (4)	J
representatives identified by the UAW National Ford
Department and four (4) representatives identified by	1
the Company, one of whom will be associated with the Corporate Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office and active in the Company’s equal employment opportunity programs. One Union member and one Company member will be identified	,
to serve as the joint Co-Chairs of the Committee. The UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Com-	■
mittee will meet monthly or as frequently as is mutii: ally deemed desirable or necessary and its functions	‘
shall be the following:	_
•	Review and discuss, (1) ways and means of encour-
aging employees and grievance representatives to	'
use the Grievance Procedure as the exclusive contractual method to resolve claims of denial of equal application rights and (2) general matters concern-	.
ing the subject of sexual harassment.
•	Conduct or arrange, as appropriate, for investiga-	'
tlons and/or studies into claims of denied equal application rights and discrimination problems and	'
tensions in an attempt to prevent such problems
172	'
,	UAW-FORD JOINT EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY COMMITTEES -

from arising or recurring.
■	• Maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state
agencies.
•	Maintain liaison with Corporate Personnel Rela-,	tions and Equal Employment Planning Office and
the UAW Civil Rights Department.
’	• Advise and counsel UAW-Ford Local Joint Equality
.	and Diversity Committees. .
I	• Develop and provide training for UAW-Ford Local
f	Joint Equality and Diversity Committee members.
•	Review, discuss and recommend ways and means to facilitate awareness of equal application, diversity and sexual harassment issues.
•	Design, develop and implement training programs fti	and other strategies to increase employee aware-
ness of and promote constructive dialogue regarding equality and diversity. These programs and strategies will address sexual harassment, diversity and equal application issues. It is envisioned that these programs and strategies will be comprehensive, including hourly and salaried employees as appropriate (e.g., supervisors, superintendents, human resources representatives, and plant management).
•	Oversight of delivery of equality and diversity strategies implemented at all UAW-represented Ford locations. ■	'	'
.	UAW-Ford joint funds will be a source of support for
I	these initiatives.
The UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee also will report periodically on its progress to the UAW National Ford Department and the Company’s U.S. Union Affairs Office.
At each plant or facility that the Collective Bargaining Agreement covers, a UAW-Ford Local Joint Equality and Diversity Committee will be established consisting of six (6) members, three (3) representatives of the Local Union and three (3) representatives of the Company. The three (3) representatives of the Local Union shall consist of the Local Union President, or
173
UAW-FORD JOINT EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY COMMITTEES -

designee, the Local Chairperson of the Unit Committee, and a Local Union member with diversity responsibilities or expertise. The three (3) representatives of the Company shall be the Plant Manager, or designee, and a Company official at the plant, active in the Company’s equal employment opportunity program and another member designated by the Company Plant Manager. Local Joint Equality and Diversity Committees will meet on a quarterly basis, or as'frequently as is mutually deemed desirable or necessary and its functions shall be the following:
•	Recommend to the UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee ways and means of promoting use of the Grievance Procedure as the exclusive contractual method for resolving claims of denial of equal application rights.
•	Monitor progress of implementation of equality and diversity strategies and report to the UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee.
•	Offer suggestions to the UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee on ways to facilitate awareness and greater understanding of equal application and diversity issues.
•	Suggest guidelines for Union and Company representatives, active in the Grievance Procedure in the proper and prompt handling of grievances alleging such claims and consider whether other means of handling allegations of sexual harassment should be used.
•	Recommend to the UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee, means for determining the cause of claims of denied equal application rights and discrimination problems and tensions in the plant.
•	Comply with all procedures as established by the UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee.
•	Submit minutes of meetings and all other related data to the UAW-Ford National Joint Equality and Diversity Committee.
174
UAW-FORD JOINT EQUALITY AND DIVERSITY COMMITTEES -
NATIONAL AND LOCAL
Members of the UAW-Ford Local Joint Equality and I	Diversity Committee will receive pay for time spent
attending scheduled meetings.
The UAW-Ford Local Joint Equality and Diversity Committee may meet with the Local Diversity Council to discuss diversity issues of mutual concern.
The parties continue to recognize their legal and I	moral responsibility for assuring that all Ford Motor
I	Company employees have equal employment opportu-
nities and freedom from discrimination as set forth in '	Article X, Section 9 of the Collective Bargaining
L	Agreement- Consequently, the function of the Local

i	action. However, the Union agrees that it will discour-
r	age its members from bypassing the Grievance Proce-

Dear Mr. Bantom:	•
Subject: UAW-Ford Scholarship Program for Dependent Children
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the importance of continuing education for school-aged dependent children of UAW-represented employees. In this regard, the Union and the Company agreed to continue the UAW-Ford Scholarship Program for Dependent Children based on the following parameters:
•	Eligibility: Dependent children of active, retired, or deceased UAW-represented employees who are pursuing post-secondary education or training at an institution accredited by a governmental or nationally recognized agency are eligible to apply for continuing education support. For purposes of this program, the definition of dependent children will be the same as defined in the UAW-Ford Legal Services Plan.
•	Amount of Support: An annual voucher of up to a maximum of $1,500 ($3,000 in the event of a work-related death) will be distributed directly to the recipient’s educational institution for tuition and/or compulsory fees.	■
•	Funding: Funding for this program, including adminis7 trative costs, will be provided through existing Education, Development and Training Program funds. Total annual funding and expenditures for this program will be determined by the JGB.
•	Administrative procedures: The operating guidelines and administrative procedures will continue to be approved by the JGB.
•	Payments under the UAW-Ford Scholarship Program for Dependent Children will be subject to applicable federal,

Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Advanced Manufacturing Engineering
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern regarding the future direction of Advanced Manufacturing Engineering, and its relationship to negotiations regarding job security for UAW-represented Ford employees. The Company is committed to the maintenance of a strong and stable manufacturing and assembly presence in the U. S. and the employment levels required to support that presence. The Company believes that Advanced Manufacturing Engineering, with the UAW as a full participant, is an essential ingredient in our mutual effort to assure Ford's presence as a major U. S. employer and vehicle producer. This letter confirms the understanding of the parties regarding: (1) the intent and objectives of the Advanced Manufacturing Engineering effort; (2) the process used by people in Advanced Manufacturing Engineering; and (3) the role of the UAW’s	■
National Ford Department in future Advanced Manufacturing Engineering efforts.
The role of Advanced Manufacturing Engineering is develop-	■
ment of superior methods to design and build Ford products, and to use Ford resources, facilities, and people in the best	'
manner possible in tliat effort. It is intended that Advanced	j
Manufacturing Engineering promote continuous improvement in every element of Ford’s business. The Company believes this effort holds great promise for helping meet the Company's two-pronged approach for continued success—being the	■
“best-in-class" quality producer of vehicles for every measure of customer satisfaction, and being fully competitive with	'
every major vehicle producer in the world. Success in Ad-	.
vanced Manufacturing Engineering will help assure long-term job security.	;
178
ADVANCED MANUFACTURING ENGINEERING
The Advanced Manufacturing Engineering activity includes ,	people representing the Company's major functions. They are
assigned to specific projects that focus attention on product, component, process, and manufacturing issues, and their efforts are intended to cut across traditional organization lines ►	to develop approaches that prevent problems rather than
detect problems. The Company is convinced that UAW participation on Advanced Manufacturing Engineering projects will contribute to its success—especially as Advanced Manufacturing Engineering develops long-term actions that affect Ford employees.
The UAW-Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Representatives have been appointed by the Vice President and Director of the National Ford Department. Their participation in specific Advanced Manufacturing Engineering assignments includes: review of Design for Assembly projects and f	product tear-downs, system reviews on present designs,
feasibility reviews on proposed projects, review of training designed for UAW-represented hourly employees, and Advanced Concept Vehicle evaluation for assembly and func,	tional feasibility.
From time to time, it may be appropriate to seek the participation of UAW-represented hourly employees on Advanced Manufacturing Engineering assignments. With Local Management’s agreement to participate, the specific project, role, length of assignment and selection criteria of these employees will be determined by Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Management in consultation with the UAW-Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Representatives. Within these criteria, the local parties will jointly select the participants.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:	'
Subject: New Business Development
To seek to enhance employment opportunities, the joint New Business Development Group will be continued for the term of the 1999 Ford-UAW National Agreement. The Group will consist of equal numbers of Company and Union representatives with multi-disciplinary backgrounds. Company representatives will be appointed by the Vice President, Human Resources and Union representatives will be appointed by the Vice President and Director, National Ford Department. Appointed representatives may be part time or full time.
It will be the responsibility of the New Business Development Group to promote sound and profitable business or integration opportunities having the potential to provide employment. The Group will make recommendations to the Company arid the Union for concept approval, and will request new business funding from the Company for business opportunities deemed to be consistent with maximizing employment growth objectives of the Program. The projects to be considered should utilize existing facilities where appropriate, and contribute to the welfare of Ford and its employees. In addition, it will be the responsibility of the Group to perform the following related functions.
•	Develop and implement an organizational structure in consultation with the Vice President, Human Resources and the Vice President and Director, National Ford Department.
•	Communicate to division and local Management and to regional and Local Union representatives the full scope of this new business concept.
•	Review and study the feasibility of proposals submitted in writing by the local partyfies) regarding entry into new business ventures.
180
NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
•	Initiate studies necessary for a complete examination of i	proposed new business ventures.
•	Examine each feature of the total business opportunity.
•	Report, in writing, to the local parties its findings and „	recommendations regarding a proposed new business
venture within an appropriate time frame.
■	• Develop means of encouraging the entire organization,
hourly and salaried, to participate in bringing new com-
'	petitive business into the Company and creating new
,	jobs.	'
As an indication of its continued commitment to employ>	ment enhancement through integration and business diver-
sification, the Company will make available up to $30 million of funding to provide for this Program during the term of the 1999 Agreement. However, should the New Business Devel-’	opment Group recommend new business funding in excess
,	of that amount, the Company agrees to review such requests
in accordance with the guidelines of this Letter of Under>	standing. These funds will be available for investment in new
■	business ventures including, as appropriate, the establish"	ment of separate corporate organizational structures.
„	Investment funds will be released on an “as required” basis.
Only those ventures receiving concept approval and initial
i	funding prior to the expiration of the 1999 Agreement will be
considered as firm commitments by the Company. Reporting
’	fund expenditures will be the responsibility of the New
Business Development Group.
Operating expenses attendant to the activities of persons ,	assigned by the Company and the Union to the New Business
Development Group will be provided from the Education, '	Development and Training Program Fund upon approval of
•	the Executive Director - Labor Affairs and the Vice President
1	and Director, UAW National Ford Department or their
designees.
Contingent upon the business climate and market proximity, >	we have agreed to pay particular attention to communities
affected by the loss of Ford-UAW employment opportunities. Accordingly, any newly created business venture developed ■	through the efforts of the New Business Development Group
will be expected to provide opportunities for employees, .	with preferential consideration given to UAW-represented
181
NEW BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
employees laid off from or working at Company facilities. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, the Company or other employer will recognize the UAW as the representative of the hourly employees working at businesses developed through the New Business Development Group for the purpose of collective bargaining. In this regard, the parties recognize the need to consider innovative approaches to labor relations, including the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements as an alternative to this Agreement, for each venture.
The New Business Development Group will report periodically to senior Ford Motor Company Management and the International Union UAW on their progress in identifying and developing viable opportunities for employment growth.
It is understood that the Company’s discussion with the Union will require the Union to keep information confidential until the Company consents to its release. It is also understood that matters arising hereunder are not subject to the Grievance Procedure.	j

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: New Technology-
In these negotiations, the parties discussed broadly-based concerns regarding new technology. Accordingly, this letter replaces the prior letter and serves to clarify and reaffirm the understandings reached regarding new technology.
Throughout the years, the parties have recognized that a continuing improvement in the standard of living of employees depends upon technological progress, better tools, methods, processes and equipment and a cooperative attitude on the part of all parties in such progress. Continued technological progress is also essential to the Company’s growth and to its ability to compete effectively. Technological progress can contribute to the Company's well-being and thereby to the economic well-being of employees.
Recognition
The Company understands the Union’s legitimate concern that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job content and responsibilities of bargaining unit employees at plant locations. In this regard, the parties have agreed to continue the National Committee on Technological Progress, comprised of an appropriate number of Union and Company representatives. Following conclusion of these negotiations, the parties will meet to establish meeting guidelines, including meeting agendas and revised committee composition to include a skilled trades rep' resentative from the National Ford Department. The
Committee will meet periodically to discuss new technology at the corporate level and its possible impact upon the scope of the bargaining unit. It was agreed that such periodic meetings could be held at the Company’s Advanced Manufacturing Technology Development facility. A review of

advanced manufacturing technologies under development at the facility will be provided to the Committee. These reviews would enable the parties to become more knowledgeable of new and/or emerging technologies which may have future application to the manufacturing environment. The Commit' tee may also discuss other matters concerning new or advanced technology that may be referred by local unions or by local managements as well as any claims of erosion of the bargaining unit, occasioned by the introduction of new technology.
■ The parties recognise that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of included employees, skilled and nonskilled, at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of performing a work function, including the introduction of computers or other new or advanced technology, will not serve to shift the work function normally and historically performed by included employees to excluded employees. This is to assure you it is not the Company’s policy to assign to excluded employees work normally assigned to included employees at a particular plant location. The Company fully respects the integrity of the contract unit and has no intention of altering its composition by assigning to excluded employees work that has been performed traditionally and exclusively by included employees. The parties will continue to abide by Umpire decisions, or letters of understanding, or other criteria that have been recognized by the parties in the past pertaining to such work assignments. Furthermore, it is understood computers will not be used to establish production standards or initiate or support disciplinary action.
Notice and Discussion
The Company agrees to continue to provide advanced written notification to Local Unions at locations planning the introduction of new or advanced technology so as to permit meaningful discussion of its impact, if any, upon skilled or nonskilled employees. Examples of situations where notifi- -cation should be given are:
A)	The first introduction of a technology as compared to previously existing plant technology.
184
NEW TECHNOLOGY
B)	Introduction of a new, more advanced generation of existing technology having a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit. ■
C)	Introduction of a new application of existing technology which has a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
Jt is understood that the provisions of this letter do not preclude the local parties from discussing new work that has never been performed by the bargaining unit.
The parties at each Company location wifi determine the persons to be responsible and involved in the discussions. Included among the information to be provided for discussion is a description of the technology involved, the equipment being introduced, its intended use, the anticipated installation date(s), and a description of the extent, if any, to which such technological changes may affect the work performed by included employees at the plant involved. To insure technical competence and continuous improvement are linked to long-term viability, the parties will develop and implement job practice changes to obtain full utilization of the new technology to increase operational efficiency and competitiveness.
Training
The Union once again voiced concern about the possibility that new, technologically impacted contract unit work will not be awarded to included employees because they are insufficiently trained to perform it. In view of the parties’ interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology, as part of the advanced discussion, the parties shall seek to identify and make available, in advance as practicable, appropriate specialized training programs so that employees will be capable of performing new or changed work normally performed by included personnel.
The UAW-Ford Technical Skills program will continue to provide the parties with the joint opportunity to improve the technical capabilities of Ford employees ensuring that the UAW-Ford work force is fully competent to function in the restructured, high-performing workplaces. The parties at plant, division, and national levels may identify training
185
NEW TECHNOLOGY
needs that would enhance employees’ capabilities to work with new technology, and where appropriate, may jointly request UAW-Ford National Education, Training and Development Program funding under the guidelines established by the Joint Governing Body.
Emphasis will continue to be placed on evaluating the effect of technological developments on apprenticeship curricula. The parties recognize the desirability that apprentices be trained for the work performed by joumeymen/women in the basic skilled trades classification where new or advancing technology has had an impact on the work content of certain skilled trades classifications. The Company will continue apprentice training on solid state, numerical, tape and/or computer controlled machines, where applicable.
The parties agree the National Joint Apprenticeship Committee shall examine recommendations of the National Committee on Technological Progress as well as those made by Local Unions for the purpose of updating and revising shop training as appropriate. Revised training, and appropriate training in “programming”, will be applicable to apprentices on recognized bargaining unit work if such work is normally and regularly performed by joumeymen/women (or work for which joumeymen/women are being trained by the Company to perform) in the basic skilled trades classification in the plant where the training schedule is being used.
The foregoing does not limit or in any way reduce the responsibility of the National Joint Apprenticeship Committee to make changes in the training course content of apprenticeship curricula, as necessary and appropriate, subject to and in accordance with provisions of the Apprenticeship Standards.
Education and training programs, approved and sponsored by the Joint Governing Body of the Education, Development and Training Program, supporting national and local initiatives such as technical readiness training and generic technical literacy applications may be used to support new technology introduction. The technical readiness program was developed to prepare employees for their introduction to new technology and the associated job opportunities it presents. It is particularly useful for employees who would like to become candidates for the Apprentice Program. This

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFORMATION
October 9, 1999
Mr, Ron Gettelfinger
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Product Development and Transformation
During these negotiations, the parties discussed various issues related to product development and product transformation. Both the Company and the Union recognize that future jobs depend on, among other things, continuing investments in product development. Shifting markets, changing consumer tastes, new governmental regulations, international harmonization of such requirements, and a host of other factors have a direct impact on vehicle development and manufacturing. The products manufactured and services delivered must meet evolving customer preferences and demands at a competitive price.
The Company fully understands the Union’s concerns relative to investment in new products and services, and that such investments, while absolutely necessary, may not alone guarantee good future jobs. New products require additional skills, spur changes in labor demand, and entail new sourcing decisions. The parties acknowledge that involving the Union at the early stages of Ford Product Development System (FPDSJ cycle is key to attaining job security while meeting the global challenges of improved quality, speed to market, product innovation, and lowering total costs. To that end, the Company has been, and continues to be, fully committed to working with the Union to seek and identify appropriate jointly developed technical training programs that will match new skill requirements with evolving technologies, products and services, along with the implementation of new programs to cushion unavoidable dislocative effects of rapid product transformation and development. The Company recognizes that working together will help preserve and grow gOod paying jobs for all current and future UAW-represented employees at Ford Motor Company.
188
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFORMATION
In preceding Agreements and during these negotiations, the ,	parties have recognized the importance of the Union’s role
i	and involvement in the FPDS cycle and product transforma-
।	tion through provisions, such as the Memorandum of Under-
।	standing - Sourcing (Appendix P), which provide a mecha-
r	nism for early Union involvement in the Company's plans to
,	proceed with a new or redesigned vehicle. To that end, it is
’	understood and reaffirmed that early during the FPDS cycle,
matters such as sourcing patterns, possible changes in ’	assembly, sub-assembly, stamping, powertrain and other
,	component sourcing patterns, possible insourcing opportu-
i	nities, and technology which may impact UAW-represented
L	hourly employees will be reviewed with the National Ford
l	Department in accordance with the provisions of the Memo-
I	randum of Understanding - Sourcing (Appendix P). Such
!	early and up front involvement will allow the Union to
I	continue to be provided with information about current and
anticipated major product developments/product transfor-.	mations that are having, are expected to have, or could
.	potentially have an effect on employment levels such as
projected changes in the major components for motor •	vehicles (e.g., shift to new propulsion technology and energy
storage devices), in materials (e.g., increased use of plastics ’	and/or aluminum in body panels, shift to aluminum cast’	ings), in assembly and design (e.g., for easier assembly/
manufacturing methods and for disassembly for recycling •	purposes).
Further, the Union’s early involvement during the FPDS ;	process allows for discussions relative to issues such as the
t	impact of a traditional gas-fueled internal combustion engine
■	vehicle, and, for example, the comparable electric, hybrid
k	electric, fuel cell, or dedicated and flexible alternative-liquid
>	fuel vehicle with respect to major components, materials,
and assembly methods. In each case, the Company will indicate the extent to which changes in specifications will be ,	handled through the revamping of existing UAW-	represented operations, by means of technology residing in
!	other divisions of the Company or by outside sourcing-
।	arrangements.
Finally, it is recognized that the Memorandum of Understanding - Sourcing (Appendix P) provides an avenue for ,	discussions as early as practicable in the FPDS cycle relative
189

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFORMATION
to projected production volume of new materials, components, and products, and the potential impact, if any, on UAW-represented hourly jobs.

ADVANCE NOTICE OF OUTSIDE CONTRACTING
AND EFFECTIVE CLEARING PROCEDURE
October 4, 1979
Mr. Ken Bannon, Vice President
Director—National Ford Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Advance Notice of Outside Contracting and Effective Clearing Procedure
During the recent negotiations the Union expressed concern over the form and content of the notice to the Union of the Company’s intention to let an outside contract for skilled maintenance and construction work as well as the procedure for conducting related discussions between the local parties. This letter will confirm the parties’ understanding that the Company will provide advance notice, in writing, subject to the same conditions and limitations set forth and referenced in the letter dated January 20, 1949*, to the local union of the Company’s plan to let a particular contract involving skilled maintenance and construction work. The written notice will describe the project’s general nature, scope (including estimated trades and manpower involved), the approximate dates within which the work is expected to be performed and why the services of an outside contractor are being contemplated. As provided in Article IV, Section 8, Company representatives are expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on the Company’s plans and to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.
Consistent with the foregoing conditions, the parties agreed that the following constitutes an effective outside contracting clearing procedure including related discussions:
1. Before letting a contract, the Plant Engineering Department will evaluate the ability of the local plant forces to handle a given project.
* Reproduced in full beginning on page 363 of the Agreement Booklet (Volume D.
192
ADVANCE NOTICE OF OUTSIDE CONTRACTING
AND EFFECTIVE CLEARING PROCEDURE
2.	In the event the Plant Engineering Department decides it is unable to perform the work in question, the local union will be so advised and if the Union so requests, a meeting will be arranged by the Plant Industrial Relations Manager for the purpose of having advance discussion with the union as to the reasons why plant forces cannot perform the work.
3.	In the event such advance discussion with the union results in the Company deciding it cannot perform any of the work or only part and the union concurs in this result, a memorandum concerning the results of the meeting will be prepared by the Company and a copy provided to the union. In addition to the written information outlined above, if part of the project is to be performed by Ford forces, that portion should be so identified in the memorandum.
It was also agreed that the parties would urge the adoption of the above procedure in all locations where a mutually acceptable outside contracting clearance procedure does not now exist.
In addition, it was agreed that in those locations either adopting the procedure outlined above or where a mutually acceptable procedure is in effect and where the local union alleges that the procedure is ■ not being followed by the Company, the matter may be brought to the attention of Labor Relations Staff and the National Ford Department.

Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Yokich:
Subject: Contracting of Work
During the current negotiations the UAW complained that procedures set forth in Article IV, Section 8 are not being satisfactorily implemented by management in many instances.
This letter is intended to clarify the intent and purpose of this provision:	>
1.	The “advance discussion” except where time and circumstances prevent it, will take place “prior to letting such a contract"— before any decision has been made	<
as to whether the work should be contracted out. The “advance discussion” will include information as to “why Management is contemplating contracting out the work." It is evident that except as noted above, since Management is only “contemplating contracting out the work” when the “advance discussion” takes place, Management should not have made any decisions concerning whether or not to contract out the work before such “advance discussion” is held.
2.	Management should advise the local union of the “nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reasons (equipment, manpower etc.), why management is contemplating contracting out the work." This information is related to the letter dated January 20, 1949, to the International Union .signed by Mr. John Bugas. That letter makes reference to “peculiar skills are involved, where specialized equipment not available to Ford is required or where for other reasons economies can be realized because specialized contractors can better perform the work in question.” Since any or all of these conditions may be entailed in the determination as to whether a particular contract should be
194

I
I	let out or not, it is necessary that Management advise the
।	local Union in the “advance discussion” concerning the
item or items which are relevant to the decision-making, f	3. If in the “advance discussion” it is clear that management
is only “contemplating contracting out the work” and if
I	in addition all the pertinent information as noted above
,	is supplied to the local Union, then local Union repre-
sentatives will be given a better opportunity “to com>	ment on the Company’s plans” and will also give an
opportunity to Management “to give appropriate weight '	to those comments in the light of all attendant circum-
j	stances."
,	In addition the Union complained that in certain instances
(	plant Management requested and contracted for mainte-
nance service on leased equipment, and extended warranty [	arrangements or service contracts were being purchased
which impacted the job security of seniority employees in '	skilled trades classifications. Management stated that, while
„	Article IV, Section 8 does not limit the “fulfillment of
warranty obligations by vendors", warranty arrangements ►	that extend beyond those customarily provided or the
obtaining of service contracts are not covered by these ’	provisions. Rather, such arrangements or service contracts
[	covering work normally and historically performed by rep-
resented skilled trades employees are to be considered in ,	the same manner as contracts for the performance of
maintenance work and such decisions are covered by the
t	provisions of Article IV, Section 8 of the Master Agreement.
The local plant Managements will be advised accordingly.

MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION WORK
January 20, 1949
Mr. Walter P. Reuther	■
President, International UAW-CIO ,	.
411 W, Milwaukee
Detroit 2, Michigan	'
Dear Mr. Reuther:
Subject: Maintenance and Construction Work	'
The purpose of this letter is to inform you concerning the present policy of the Ford Motor Company relating to maintenance and construction operations, as you requested	'
in the meeting between Company and Union representatives at the Rackham Memorial Building yesterday.
Effective Monday, January 17, the policy with regard to	;
maintenance and construction operations of the Ford Motor
Company were revised in accordance with the following principles:	,
(1)	The department formerly identified as N-700 was abol-
ished, all employees assigned thereto being transferred	‘
to the various maintenance units or to the newly created
Construction section herein described.	'
(2)	Each operating division or building (examples, the Steel	(
Division, the Motor Building) is now provided with its
own maintenance department. One maintenance depart-	■
ment is provided for Roads and Grounds, and for the miscellaneous buildings not large enough to individually	1
support a maintenance department. These maintenance	,
departments carry the responsibility of general mainte-	|
nance work within the confines of the operating divisions	i
or buildings. They will perform all work of a mainte-	*
nance, as distinguished from construction, nature.	*
(3)	The Construction Section, or department, was created to function within the limits of the greater Detroit area, including Mound Road, Highland Park, Lincoln, and	■
Rouge operations, as well as the other smaller plants in the area.
196
MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION WORK
This section will perform all construction work which it is feasible for the 'Company to do, consistent with equipment and manpower skills available, with the limitation that outside contractors may be called upon when the volume of work required exceeds the capacity of the b	Construction Section. Employees assigned to this Sec-
tion are those carrying sufficient service to assure a minimum of difficulty on the question of seniority rights.
(4)	Where deemed advisable, contracts will be let to outside contractors under certain conditions. Such outside assistance will be engaged where peculiar skills are involved, where specialized equipment not available at Ford is required or where for other reasons economies can be realized because specialized contractors can better perform the work in question. As indicated above, j	work may be contracted out on occasions when the
. volume of construction work precludes the possibility of its completion within time limits by the Ford construction department.	■
We believe the above to be a clear statement of the policy which Ford Motor Company intends to follow with regard to maintenance and construction operations. We ’	feel, and believe you will concur, that it is impossible to
enunciate this policy in more detail. Necessarily, some ■ questions may arise from time to time regarding work »	which is contracted to outside concerns. On such occa-
sions, we intend to continue the practice of informing Union representatives of our reasons for letting such contracts, as in the past. (*). It should be noted, however, that Management must reserve the right to make the final determination as to whether work shall be done by Ford, or outside contractors. In making this determination, however, we intend always to keep the interests of Ford personnel in mind. We anticipate that in the great majority of instances it will be to the advantage
I	* As provided in the Settlement Agreement between the Company and the
Union dated November 23, 1964, this is construed to mean that the Company agrees to give advance notice to the Union, where feasible, of the Company’s plans for letting a particular contract', however, the question of i	whether or not advance notice has been or should have been given shall
'	have no bearing on any grievance protesting Management’s action in letting

October 9, 1961
Mr. Ken Bannon, Director National Ford Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Maintenance Work
During our current negotiations, the Union has stated that Ford Motor Company employees in the skilled construction and maintenance trades are concerned over possible plans by Ford Motor Company to contract out routine running maintenance work in its plants.
Our experience, as well as that of others, has demonstrated forcefully that there is no commonly accepted line between maintenance and construction work, and that abstract definitions attempting to draw such lines are controversial and subject to wide differences in interpretation.
For more than ten years, Ford employees in these trades have been protected against unwarranted contracting out of skilled maintenance and construction work on Company premises. This protection stems from the letter addressed to Mr. Walter P. Reuther, UAW President, by Mr. John S. Bugas, then Vice President, Industrial Relations, Ford Motor Company, of January 20, 1949, and the contractual commitments
198
MAINTENANCE WORK
associated therewith introduced in our 1949 collective bargaining agreement and expressed in our last agreement in Section 3 of the Skilled Trades Supplement, It has been established over the years that these commitments are applicable throughout the units represented by your Union and are enforceable through the arbitration procedures provided in the Agreement. Since 1949, both the number and proportion of Ford skilled tradesmen in Company units represented by the UAW have increased substantially, the number by some 5,000, and the proportion from 15.5% in 1949 to an average of almost 19% for the last three calendar years.
The Company proposes the reaffirmation and the continuation of these contractual commitments for the duration of the new agreement currently being negotiated by the par-j	ties. This will guarantee to Ford skilled maintenance and
construction tradesmen the continuation of their present advanced protections.
In addition, the Company hereby assures you that it has no plans to depart from its general operating practice of placing primary reliance on its own skilled maintenance tradesmen to perform the running skilled maintenance work in its plants that they historically have done.
Very truly yours,

OUTSIDE CONTRACTING
October 9, 1999
Mr. Ron Gettelfinger
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Outside Contracting
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed the provisions of Article IV, Section 8, Job Security and Outside Contracting, of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and associated letters, from the 1949 Bugas/Reuther letter forward, concerning the topic of outside contracting.
The Union expressed its concern that the Company is not	j
adhering to the intent of the present contractual commitments, thereby affecting the job security of UAW-represented employees. Accordingly, this letter serves to	_
clarity and reaffirm our joint understanding regarding various procedures with respect to Advance Notification, Full	>
Utilization, and Warranty and Service Contracts. . ■
Advance Notification	|
The advance notification procedure and the establishment of	«
regular outside contracting reviews, as provided for in the
Letter of Understanding entitled Outside Contracting Re-	’
views dated September 15, 1993 is key to ensuring that a	,
proper review of all relevant outside contracting issues has been considered. This process provides for among other	i
considerations that advance discussion, except where “time	J
and circumstances” prevent it, will take place prior to a	4
Company decision to let a particular contract (i.e., before any decision has been made as to whether the work should be contracted out}. Accordingly, the parties have reaffirmed	,
and agreed that:	-
1. The Company will provide advance written notification to the Union of its intent to let an outside contract and discuss in detail the nature, scope, and approximate dates of the work to be performed and
200
OUTSIDE CONTRACTING
r
2.
3.
the rationale (specialized equipment, peculiar skills possessed by the vendor’s personnel, other economies, etc.) in accordance with the conditions and limitations set forth and referenced in the Letter of Understanding entitled Maintenance and Construction Work dated January 20, 1949.
The parties acknowledge there are legitimate reasons, such as emergencies, where the time and other circumstances prevent the required advance discussions with the Union prior to work being contracted out; however, absent legitimate reasons, the aforementioned provisions will not be used by Management solely to circumvent the contractual requirements relating to outside contracting notification.
The continuation of regular review meetings at the local level shall remain the appropriate forum for the parties to discuss contemplated outside contracting projects. This review process has generally been effective in resolving the vast majority of outside contracting issues since the inception of the review process in 1993. The parties agreed that the outside contracting clearing procedure outlined in the Letter of Understanding entitled Advance Notice of Outside Contracting and Effective Clearing Procedure dated October 4, 1979, will be adopted in all locations where a mutually acceptable clearance procedure does not now exist.
In order to address the concerns of the Union, the importance of the requirement of holding “advance discussions” before work is contracted out will be communicated to the appropriate parties at each location. In the event a Local Union experiences continued problems in this regard, the matter may be referred to the National Ford Department of the International Union, which may then raise it with the appropriate Division Labor Relations Manager.
In response to the information provided to the Union by the Company during the Outside Contracting Review Meeting, the Union will then furnish the Company with a written response commenting on the Company's plans in order to provide an oppoitu-
201
OUTSIDE CONTRACTING
nity for Management to give appropriate consider* ation to the response in light of all attendant circumstances.
Full Utilization
During our discussions regarding outside contracting, the utilization of Ford skilled trades employees has been a matter of mutual concern. The definition of full utilization is addressed in the Letter of Understanding entitled Outside Contracting Reviews dated September 15, 1993. The parties agreed that the appropriate forum in which to address this issue is at the local level, in conjunction with the outside contracting review process. It was indicated .that the definition of full utilization will vary from location to location, dependent on the circumstances of each contract, including the number of outside skilled trades personnel involved, the number of hours allocated to the project, and the extent to which outside contractors are contemplated for utilization on weekend work.
In these negotiations, the parties agreed additional consideration may bear on the definition of full utilization such as:
1.	Whether the contractor will perform work on overtime during the workweek, and/or on a weekend.
2.	Whether plant skilled trades forces are on layoff or in protected employee status (GEN}.
3.	Necessity for specialized equipment and /or contractor work skill sets or competencies that the Company may not possess.
4.	The percentage of affected trades to be assigned . work along with the contemplated contractor.
5.	The requisite number of plant skilled trades employees available and/or willing to work overtime during ' the workweek and/or on a weekend which may be required to complete the project under review, consistent with cost and training parameters. The par-■ ties agree the definition of “full utilization" may not necessarily be limited to working five (5) days per ■ week, eight (8) hours per day but, also is not necessarily seven (7) days per week, twelve (12)
202
OUTSIDE CONTRACTING
hours per day but may extend to daily, weekend, and other overtime periods, when outside contractors are on the plant premises and performing work customarily and historically performed by UAW bargaining unit personnel. .
Any alleged abuses of the aforementioned may be referred to the UAW, National Ford Department and the appropriate Division Labor Relations Manager.
Although no one of these considerations is necessarily controlling, each maybe instrumental in assisting the parties to determine whether the skilled trades workforce is fully utilized, as that concept relates to the decision to use an outside contractor.
Warranty and Service Contracts
The Letter of Understanding entitled Contracting of Work dated October 14, 1984, acknowledged the Union's concern that purchased maintenance service on leased equipment and extended warranty arrangements or service contracts impact the job security of seniority skilled trades employees. The provisions of that letter do not apply to arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided or the obtaining of service contracts. Rather, the letter provides that warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided or the obtaining of service contracts normally and historically performed by UAW-represented skilled trades employees are to be considered in the same manner as contracts for the performance of maintenance work in accordance with Article IV, Section 8, of the Master Agreement.
in these negotiations, the parties discussed at length the problems associated with the use of warranty and service contracts. The Company assured the Union that it has no plans to depart from its general operating practice of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades workforce to perform the day-to-day maintenance work historically and routinely performed in the plants, once the warranted equipment is released for production.
In order to remain competitive on a global basis, the Company must be able to utilize warranty arrangements
203
L____________________________
OUTSIDE CONTRACTING
and/or service contracts ordinarily provided by the vendor. Proposals for extended service or warranty contracts beyond those customarily provided by the vendor will be reviewed with the Union in the same manner as contracts for the performance of maintenance work in accordance with the provisions of Article IV, Section 8, of the Master Agreement.
To further address the Union’s concerns, it is agreed that any time a supplier visits a facility to perform warranty or service agreement work, as provided in the purchase agreement between the parties, the Union will be notified and an	'
employee on that shift with the appropriate skilled trades	j
classification will be assigned with the supplier. Additionally, in the event other employees from the same supplier are performing different warranty or service agreement work in other areas of the plant, an employee with an appropriate	•
skilled trades classification will be assigned with the supplier.
Where the Company or Union consider particular warranty	j
arrangement or service contracts to be of concern, the	'
parties agree to discuss such matters through the local	'
outside contracting review procedure with the goal of improving the employment opportunities of potentially affected employees without compromising operational flexibility and related cost efficiencies.
Checklist	'
In an effort to ensure all relevant considerations have been	.
reviewed by the Company and Union prior to letting a contract for the performance of skilled maintenance and	•
construction work, the parties have prepared a Checklist	1
(Exhibit) to guide the local review of potential outside	'
contracting matters. It is expected that locations which do not now have an effective advance notification process in place will use the Checklist in advance discussions with local	<
unions. For locations that do have an effective notification	'
procedure, the Checklist should be incorporated in the	'
procedure. Each party should sign the Checklist, acknowledging such a review has occurred. The Checklist should be	‘
utilized as a planning tool to ensure that those relevant
204
OUTSIDE CONTRACTING
t
factors related to outside contracting are considered fully prior to a decision to let a contract involving skilled maintenance and construction work to an outside contractor.
The parties agree to include appropriate language on the Checklist to indicate failure to comply with the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with respect to outside contracting could result in a grievance protesting the contemplated outside contract, including a possible strikeable issue grievance.

(Factors To Be Considered Prior To Letting an Outside Contract for Skilled Maintenance and Construction Work)
During the 1996 negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed the provisions of Article IV, Section 8 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and associated Letters of Understanding concerning the topics of Outside Contracting, Full Utilization, and Warranty and Service Contracts.
The following Outside Contracting Checklist has been developed and agreed to by the parties for use at U. S. plant locations as a planning tool to ensure that relevant factors related to Outside Contracting are fully considered prior to a contract being let to an outside contractor. The parties urge the adoption of this Checklist in all locations.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject; Application of Shipping Labels - Parts Distribution Centers	’
During 1999 negotiations, the parties discussed the duplicative work performed by both Company and carrier employees of applying shipping labels to outgoing parts on Parts Distribution Center shipping docks.	,
The Company advised the Union that as part of the Ford Customer Service Division’s ongoing efforts to improve customer service, a study is underway to determine the feasibility of implementing an automated parts tracking	’
system for emergency parts orders.	<
We anticipate that this will result in a new shipping label, that would meet the needs of both the carrier and the	1
Company. When implemented, the common label will be applied by UAW-represented employees of the Company and should result in an efficient ordering system.

Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Job Assignments (Parts Depots)
It is the policy of the Company, to give particular consideration to the older employees in each of the Company’s parts depots in making regular job assignments within their classification.
Management will be guided by factors such as physical requirements and location of work in carrying out this policy. It is not intended to give an employee another job merely because he would prefer it for subjective reasons. In addition, management is responsible for advising the union representative of any changes in job assignments. In the event the union representative is unavailable, this information should be provided after the representative becomes available.
This expression of policy should not be interpreted as establishing the principle of job preference within a classification, nor does it give any employee a right to protest his job assignment in the Grievance Procedure except as such assignment may be in violation of the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Dear Mr. Yokich:
Subject: MOM’s Program
During the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern that the installation of an upgraded computer system in conjunction with the Mechanization of the Master Parts Distribution Centers Program would be used to establish work standards and gather data for purposes of disciplinary action. It was pointed out that the use of the upgraded computer equipment is to facilitate order consolidation, mechanize the recording of material movements and accomplish more efficient direction of warehouse functions. Related work assignments are currently based on the free effort concept consistent with the fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay principle referred to in Article V, Section 1 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The information accumulated and generated by this equipment will not be used to establish production standards or to initiate or support disciplinary action.

In the current negotiations the Union has complained that Plant Protection employees are performing accuracy checking in the receiving area at the parts depot.
It has been pointed out by the Company that checking performed by Plant Protection employees, whether in the shipping area or in the receiving area, is for security purposes only. Under the currently revised procedure for the receiving area, spot checks of carton contents are to be performed simultaneously by Plant Protection and an included employee. If an accuracy error is discovered during a spot check it is to be handled by the included employee.
The above checks do not preclude the Company’s right to have Plant Protection perform duplicatory checks or to examine stock at any time in any area for the purpose of investigating suspicious circumstances. Plant Protection will continue, without change, to carry on other security measures.

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: PDC Starting Times
During the present negotiations, the subject of multiple starting times at the Company's Parts Distribution Centers was discussed. As was indicated during these discussions, the Mechanization of Masters (MOMs) program and the new contract carriage delivery system have altered substantially operating patterns and starting times at all distribution centers. .	,
The increase in the number of starting times and addition of a third shift, in turn, reflect the sequential, interdependent nature of the functions being performed at each center,	'
which are required to maintain a balanced flow of material	j
and meet fixed carrier departure schedules. In fact, starting	-
times are customer driven and supportive of our mutual goal of improving quality through improved order processing	'
timing, reduction in errors, better fill rates and more user friendly documents.	(
The Company is cognizant of the Union’s concern relating to	.
this matter and will commit that when contemplating	i
changes in starting times, local management will hold ad-	<
vanced discussions with local union representatives regarding the reasons for assigning particular starting times. Where the Union expresses concern regarding the number of starting times and it is determined that changes can be accomplished consistent with the requirements discussed in	<

•	Manpower projections will be utilized to determine the number of employees to receive training.
•	Employees who pass the assessment are not required to be reassessed.
•	Employees who pass the assessment will be trained and selected in seniority order for temporary and full time openings within the Maintenance General Plant Skilled classification.
•	Refusal of temporary assignment to Maintenance General Plant Skilled will have no impact on permanent placement.
•	Jointly developed preassessment materials will continue to be made available to future assessment candidates.
The joint technical training committee comprised of Ford Customer Service Division and National Ford Department representatives will continue to monitor the progress of, and modify as required, the training, and associated materials to provide for the introduction of new technologies.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Supplier Direct Ship Parts
During the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern with the volume of parts shipped directly to customers from suppliers (SDS). The Company stated that a variety of criteria were used to determine which >	parts were shipped SDS, including, but not limited to,
total distribution cost, hazardous-material status, inventory requirements and customer demand. The Company noted that the Daily Parts Advantage (DPA) ।	strategy, once effectively implemented, will enhance
Ford's ability to competitively distribute selected commodities to customers through new DPA Ford r	facilities.
To this end, the Company and Union commit to analyze current SDS suppliers, consistent with the aforemen-,	tioned criteria, to identify potential growth opportu-
nities. Given the nature of the service-parts business, the potential impact on customer satisfaction and the unique marketing requirements of certain commodities will also be considered. Upon completion of the analysis, the Company will review its decisions and rationale with the Union. If it is established that certain work can be performed competitively, judged by the above criteria, barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, the Company will bring the work in house.
Additionally, to facilitate ongoing, candid and effec

ARRANGEMENTS AND SHIPPING PROCEDURES
in new procedures. Examples of the changes include:
... At some locations, provision is to be made for racks, cribbing, shelves or similar storage facilities adjacent to the restricted tailgate area on the shipping dock to accommodate dealer “will-caU’’ orders awaiting pick-up.	1
... At locations where such identifications are not now utilized, dollies or hand-pushed trucks used in the order consolidation or shipping dock area are to be equipped with permanent identification (probably numbers and provision for additional changeable	‘
markings for truck line name and/or dealer name) to	।
permit ready identification of orders on the shipping dock.
... At a few locations where not already done, a specific	(
restricted area on the shipping dock will be	t
designated—an area in which completed orders are marshalled for shipment and in which truck drivers operate in fulfilling their responsibilities under tariff	,
provisions to load outbound merchandise.	4
... At some locations, rearrangements of cribbing, racks	*
or erection of barriers, etc. may be required to facilitate the flow or control of traffic in the shipping	«
dock area.
II.	The currently used “tailgate” check performed by Plant	,
Protection on “will-call” and on outbound freight ship-	■!
ment via common or contract carrier (checking number of cartons and bulk stock items against shipping documents as merchandise is being loaded) is to be discon-	.
tinned. Substituted for the check at the tailgate will be a system of pre-checking, described later, under which the	<
accuracy checking functions by hourly personnel and the	.
security checking functions of Plant Protection will be	•
performed simultaneously.
III.	The currently used carton-content checks performed
' exclusively by Plant Protection personnel (opening and	,
examining, for security reasons, of items in cartonized
bin stock awaiting shipment) is to be discontinued.	1
Substituted therefore will be a combination check for accuracy and security performed simultaneously by an	‘
hourly employee and a Plant Protection employee.	>

ARRANGEMENTS AND SHIPPING PROCEDURES
IV.	A general description of revised procedures for outbound shipments:
Outbound via common or contract carrier:
a.	A Plant Protection employee and an hourly employee would be stationed in the consolidation areas where bin and bulk stock is consolidated into completed orders. Tbgether, the Shipping Checker and the Plant Protection man would check simultaneously orders for accuracy and security.
b.	An order, completed and pre-checked, thus will have been consolidated on a dolly (or dollies) properly identified by a number and/or truck line symbol. This dolly is then pushed by an hourly employee from the consolidation area to a proper location in the restricted area of the shipping dock (or immediately adjacent to the restricted area when traffic conditions require a temporary holding area). No further checking would be required at the tailgate and, the truck driver (or “lumper” where appropriate) would merely be directed to Dolly X and/or Y in the restricted area and told that this was the shipment for him to load.
Outbound, via dealer, “mil call”:
The procedure for “will call” orders would be approximately the same as for freight shipments except that after the order has been consolidated on a dolly and pre-checked, similar to (a) and (b) above, the “will call order" would be moved by an hourly employee into the “will call" area of the shipping dock and, where appropriate, placed into spaces in shelves or racks or cribbing, etc.—probably marked with the dealer’s name—located in the “will call” area of the shipping dock. In the case of larger amounts of bulk stock, the identified dolly, or dollies, of bulk stock would be moved by an hourly employee from the nearby bulk stock marshalling area to a position in proximity to the dealer “will call" area.
When the “will call” driver arrives, he would be directed to his order by Plant Protection. The driver would load his material.

General —	■	'
1.	A Plant Protection man (other than the one assigned to the pre-checking activity in the consolidation area) will be on duty on the Shipping Dock area to perform such	।

8000 East Jefferson Avenue

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Use of Pallet Jacks on Parts Distribution Center Shipping Docks by Contract Carrier Personnel
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the use of any pallet jacks by contract carriers on the shipping docks at some Parts Distribution Centers. Both parties recognized that the issue is complex because of the varied locai practices and the heed to deliver parts efficiently to our customers.	’
In recognition of these concerns, the Company agreed that the current practice of contract carriers using pallet jacks will be restricted to those Parts Distribution Centers where the practice presently exists. In the interim, the practice will not be expanded to the remaining Parts Distribution Centers.
In those Parts Distribution Centers where contract carriers presently use pallet jacks, the local parties will discuss how best to eliminate the practice in shipping dock areas. Both employee needs and customer service should be considered. Failing to reach a local understanding on this issue within 120 days of the effective date of the Master Agreement, the local parties may refer the issue to the UAW, National Ford Department and the Human Resources Business Operations, Ford Customer Service Division for resolution.

Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Work Assignments in Parts Distribution Centers and Parts Depots
During the current negotiations, the Union alleged that, in certain Parts Distribution Centers and Tractor Supply Depots, Management quotes to some employees the average number of line items picked and that this data is then used as established production standards.
Operations in the Parts Distribution Centers and Tractor Supply Depots are not covered by production standards nor is it the Company's intent to use the above referenced data as established production standards. Instead, work assignments at these locations are currently based on the free effort concept consistent with the fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay principle referred to in Article V, Section 1, of the parties’ Agreement.

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Quality Upgrade Program
During the course of negotiations, there was considerable discussion concerning the Quality Upgrade Program in Vehicle Operations. The parties recognize the positive effect of the program on quality. The Union, while affirming its dedication to programs which improve product quality, raised concerns with the administration of the Upgrade Program at certain locations.
In response to those concerns, the Company confirms that quality upgrader employees will not be used to perform functions normally assigned to supervisors, to perform the core skills of a skilled tradesperson, or to perform repair work from an Inspection Traveler Card, or other electronic devices designed to replace the Inspection Traveler Card, e.g. datamytes or quality recording headsets.
Moreover, at the local Union’s request, local management will amend the appropriate occupational grouping agreement to allow employees classified Repair who are affected by a reduction in force to exercise seniority against quality upgrader employees.

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Appointed Representation at Certain Assembly Plants
During present negotiations, the Union expressed concern about providing adequate appointed representation in certain situations. Accordingly, the Company and Union agree that special provisions will apply at Kansas City Assembly, Kentucky Truck Plant, and Lorain Assembly on weekend situations when one assembly system is operating while the other assembly system is not operating.
Consistent with Article VI, Section 13 (b)(3), Appointed representatives will be allocated the average amount of	•
overtime as that to which elected representatives, excluding the chairperson, are entitled for Saturdays, Sundays, and	'
holidays. However, when only one system is operating at these locations, the weekend overtime allocation for appointed representatives will be supplemented, as described	,
below, to provide assurance that one representative from each appointed function is scheduled to work per day.	1
The supplement will be determined by subtracting the	_
formula amount from forty-eight (48) hours (determined by multiplying 6 representatives by 8 hours). These supple-	,
mented hours must only be used by properly appointed	,
representatives, and the hours are not to be “banked”.	<

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger.
Subject: Local Union Presidents
During the current negotiations the parties discussed the duties of the Local Union President in certain units. The Union agreed that the president’s function is not typically one of grievance administration or representation, but pointed out there are certain administrative functions related to the parties’ joint activities and National Agreement which can be performed by the Local Union President as its chief executive officer.
The parties further discussed and recognized the increase in Company and joint activities and the important role of Local Union Presidents in improving and advancing those activities for the mutual benefit of the Company and its employees. Local Union Presidents perform many such activities at the behest of the Company. For example, Local Union Presidents may be asked to provide significant leadership and participation contributing towards enhancing the Company’s relationship with the community and its consumers (e.g. Key Contact Program, Governmental Relations, automotive and related shows and exhibits, Voluntary Blood Donor Program) and towards enhancing the Company’s competitive position and the strength of its workforce (e.g. Continuous Improvement Meetings, Mutual Growth Forums, Equal Application Committees and Health and Safety Meetings).
Accordingly, the Company agreed that in units of 500 or more employees where the Local Union President is an employee and is not the Chairperson, such president will be paid his/her regular straight-time rate for up to forty (40) hours per week Monday through Friday, and up to ten (10) additional hours at time and one-half premium pay per week, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, so long as employees in the Unit are scheduled to work on the Local

Subject: Union Representatives’ Overtime
Article VI, Section 13(b) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement describes the process for determining the weekly allocation of overtime hours for union representatives. It provides that the local chairperson be notified by the Company of the overtime allocation and that the chairperson establish the daily work schedule for the unit committee.
This will confirm the parties’ understanding that these provisions contemplate that insofar as practical such overtime opportunities would be rotated by the chairperson among the representatives, depending upon their specific representation functions and the representation requirements in the unit, with the objective of equalization within reasonable limits over a period of time (e.g., Quarterly or semi-annually). In this regard, complaints that representative overtime opportunities are not being fairly distributed may be brought to the attention of the UAW National Ford Department and the U. S. Union Affairs Office, Ford Automotive Operations, Employee Relations, for review and resolution as the national parties deem appropriate.

provisions of paragraph 2 of the Agreement - Inspector -Tooling and Layout, dated July 21, 1975, employees who fulfill the requirements of the Inspector - Tooling and Layout - New classification shall, upon reclassification to Inspector -Tooling and Layout, be given date-of-entry seniority in such classification equivalent to eight years prior to the date of such reclassification, but in no case earlier than the initial date of reclassification or hire as an Inspector - Tooling and Layout - New.
This new method of determining Inspector - Tooling and Layout seniority shall not serve to create a seniority disadvantage with respect to other employees currently on that classification who completed the requirements of the Agreement—Inspector - Tooling and Layout and established date-of-entry seniority on the basis of paragraph 2 of that Agreement providing for date-of-entry seniority four years prior to their reclassification. In cases where the new method of determining seniority would disadvantage such incumbents, the local parties will establish mutually agreeable date-of-entry seniority dates for those to be reclassified Inspector - Tooling and Layout that avoid such disadvantage. It further is agreed that the Company shall assume no liability for back pay claims or any other matters as the result of the provisions for a new method of determining seniority and for local adjustments to avoid disadvantaging incumbents as set forth in this letter, and the only redress that may be sought shall be seniority corrections in the records of such individuals who may be called to the attention of the Company by the Union.

During the recently concluded negotiations the Union ex-	j
pressed to the Company its concern about the retention of	'
seniority recall rights of an employee who is recalled from	1
seniority layoff and is unable to work because of injury or	j
illness.	1
The Company informed the Union that, administratively, it	*
intends to continue changing the employment status of such employee from seniority layoff to medical layoff. At the same time, the Company advised the Union of its intention, beginning with the Effective Date, to determine when the seniority of such employee would be broken pursuant to either continuing seniority protection under the terms of
Article VIII, Section 5(7), or commencing seniority protec-	1
tion under the terms of Article VIII, Section 30. Further, that	.
262

at the date of medical layoff, his seniority protection would be governed by that Article and Section providing the longer period of protection.

SENIORITY IMBALANCES

UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Yokich:
Subject: Seniority Imbalances
Throughout the recent negotiations, there was a great deal of discussion regarding seniority as a form of job protection. The Union expressed particular concern for higher seniority employees who are on layoff while lower seniority employees in the same unit are working as a result of the normal application, in a reduction in force, of the seniority provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement,
During those discussions, the Company pointed out the complexity, the disruption to the plant, the problem of replacing employees on critical jobs as well as the extremely high costs inherent in attempting to completely level within a unit such seniority imbalances. All are major concerns to the Company. However, while the Company is concerned
263
SENIORITY IMBALANCES
about containing costs and maintaining quality, it also recognizes the importance of seniority as a form of job protection and the Union’s desire to eliminate seniority imbalances. Accordingly, in plants where seniority imbalances may from time to time exist and the local union so requests, the local parties shall adopt procedures to eliminate the imbalances within 30 days. It is recognized it is in the mutual interest of the parties to ensure quality of operations is maintained and there may be occasions when the lack of a qualified more senior employee for an operation will not permit correcting a seniority imbalance within the prescribed period. Accordingly, it is further agreed the local parties are empowered to adopt mutually acceptable arrangements to accommodate this circumstance.
Nothing in this letter of understanding is meant to preclude the Company from exercising its options under Article VIII, Section 27 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

It was agreed that, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VIII, Section 1(c), in such instances where the employee's new skilled classification either consists of duties closely similar to his prior skilled classification, or is an apprenticeable classification with classroom and shop training closely similar to his prior apprenticeable skilled classification, the employee’s original unit Appendix F date-of-entry seniority will be used for seniority tiebreaking purposes.

j	Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
f	Subject: Sourcing - Consolidated Letter of Understanding
‘	The following sourcing related understandings reflect vari-
ous concerns raised by the Union during 1999 negotiations
i	and Company responses to them as indicated below:
।	Associations
i.	The Union expressed interest in the Company’s association
with certain other automotive companies which assemble
•	vehicles sold by Ford Motor Company,	or design and source
i	vehicles built at Ford assembly plants.	The parties acknowl-
,	edge these associations have resulted in additional Ford-U.S.
jobs but that sourcing authority rests with these companies.
1	Nonetheless, the Company will meet with representatives of
t	the UAW National Ford Department upon request, to review
■	and discuss these products and the effects they may have on
’	UAW-represented hourly employees of the Company. When
appropriate, other automotive companies may be invited to participate in such meetings.
1	Coordination of Sourcing Evaluations
The Union described difficulties being experienced by local job security representatives when they attempt to investi->	gate and evaluate notices of proposed sourcing actions.
'	The Company acknowledges and commits that these matters
should be viewed as a high priority by both parties. There-;	fore, in order to facilitate the sourcing evaluation process
and respond to the Union’s concerns, the Company will >	assign coordination responsibility and authority to the facili-
।	ty’s Labor Relations Supervisor or the Plant Manager's
'	designee. Such responsibilities may include identifying the
appropriate management personnel to respond to Union inquiries on a timely basis, and the scheduling of meetings, I	as required.
271
SOURCING - CONSOLIDATED LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
At those facilities without Labor Relations Supervisors, the Company has assigned this coordination responsibility to the Human Resources Manager.
Make/Buy Issues
The Union emphasized the need to be involved upstream in the sourcing decision-making process and the importance of good communication regarding these matters at the local and national levels.
The Company pointed out a number of examples where the existing process provides such input and communication. Program Overviews, written notice to the Union advising of market tests, and opportunities for the Union to submit counterproposals are but a few examples.
The Company reaffirms that the plants and/or divisions will discuss and review all sourcing matters including make/buy issues in existing forums that the parties deem appropriate.
Prototype Sourcing
The Union requested a more effective communication process with respect to the sourcing of prototypes, which the Union believes would result in greater job security for its members.
In an effort to address these concerns and improve the sourcing notification process to the local union, this will confirm the Company's willingness to meet quarterly. Such meetings will be convened, at the request of the local Chairperson (Local 245, Local 931), to discuss the status of current and planned prototype builds and any circumstance (s) that may have an effect on that status.
Attendees at these meetings may include, as appropriate, local management and union representatives from the New Model Programs Development Center, Engine Manufactur-	1

Dear Mr. Yokich:
Subject: Supplier Selection Policy
This letter is pursuant to your inquiry regarding Ford Motor Company’s policy on supplier selection.	■
The Company’s decision to select or remove a particular supplier is based on numerous criteria, applied in conformance with legal requirements. It is definitely not Ford Motor Company’s policy or practice to remove a product from a supplier because that supplier’s employees have chosen to join the UAW.
As you know, Ford has a positive and constructive relationship with the UAW, and we encourage our suppliers to strive	j
for similarly constructive relationships with representatives	1
of their employees.
Ford also notes that many of our suppliers have recognized	'
the UAW based on a showing of majority support among the employees by means of a “card check” certified by a neutral third party. While use of such a procedure is entirely up to	<
the individual supplier, Ford does not in any way discourage our suppliers from using such peaceful means of determining employee sentiment.
Should you have any questions with respect to this matter, please call.	<

Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Local TPT Coordinator
During the course of negotiations, the Union alleged that temporary part-time employees, in some locations, were being utilized improperly.
As a further action to minimizing the possibility of this occurring, each location using temporary part-time employees will designate a coordinator in the employment office to administer the assignment and utilization of temporary part-time employees. The local union will be informed of the name of the coordinator. He will provide to the Union on a regular basis the number of temporary part-time employees utilized at the plant.

NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO HIRE TEMPORARY
■	PART-TIME (TPT) AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES

Dear Mr. Lofton:
i
Subject: Notification of Intent to Hire Temporary
’	Part-Time (TPT) and Temporary Employees
’	During these negotiations, the' parties discussed problems
'	that have arisen at certain locations with respect to hiring
'	and scheduling of Temporary Part-Time (TPT) employees
J	(employees normally scheduled to work Mondays and Fri-
days as provided for in Appendix K) and with respect to >	intent when requesting approval to hire employees on a
temporary basis (less than three months of continuous
'	employment).
■	A procedure for notifying the National	Ford	Department
when TPTs are to be hired has been established:
*	Temporary Part-Time Employees:
1	• Following notification to the Local	Union,	the	Division
Labor Relations Office will be responsible for notifying ’	the respective National Ford Department Servicing Rep-
resentative and a Job Security and Sourcing Representative, in advance of hiring TPTs.
‘	• As part of the notification process, the National Ford
.	Department will be advised of the operational need for
TPTs, the number of TPTs required, and the expected length of the assignment.
• If the exigencies of production prevent advance notice, the notice and an explanation of the urgency will be forwarded to the National Ford Department Servicing Representative and the National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee (NJ-SOESC) as soon as possible.
283
NOTIFICATION OF INTENT TO HIRE TEMPORARY PART-TIME (TPT) AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES
Temporary Employees:
• The Company also reaffirmed the intent that locations will lure employees on a temporary basis (less than three months) only in those instances where .the need for additional employees is expected to be of limited duration. Consistent with Appendix N, approval of the National Ford Department is required to hire employees for either temporary or permanent positions when Preferential Placement applicants are available for placement.
The Company acknowledged that misuse of the TPT (Appendix K) Agreement and consistent improper forecasting of the actual duration of assignments for temporary employees can impact the viability of these mechanisms which allow the Company to meet short-term or sporadic manpower requirements. The parties recognized that forecasts may be influenced by many variables. If there are meaningful differences between the Company’s forecast and actual experience in these matters, the Company will explain the specific reasons to the Local Union and the appropriate National Ford Department Servicing Representative.
The Company reaffirmed that TPTs and temporary employees are not to be employed to avoid hiring to fill permanent positions. It will be the responsibility of the NJSOESC to review and act on instances where this procedure is by-passed.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: 529 College Savings Program Payroll Deductions
The role of the Company regarding 529 College Savings Programs is limited. These programs are operated by each state through various service providers and are not a Company benefit. However, the Company	,
may be able to offer the convenience of payroll deduction.
In this regard, the Company agrees to determine the requirements for effecting payroll deductions (for	'
active employees). The paying agent of the Ford-UAW	,
Retirement Plan will be instructed to conduct a similar determination on behalf of retirees.	>
If feasible, payroll deductions for 529 College Savings Program contributions will be made. The Union and the Company will work together to determine a sched-	,
ule for implementation, considering the complexities involved with effecting payroll deductions with mul-	,
tiple vendors.

Dear Mr. Forchione:
Subject; Clarification of Holiday Pay Eligibility Policy
This is to confirm Company policy to not use an employee's absence from a properly scheduled work assignment on one holiday to disqualify that employee, if otherwise eligible, for holiday pay for an adjacent holiday under the eligibility rule provided in Article IX, Section 22(a)(3), of the Ford-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement, i.e., “... must have worked the last scheduled working day prior to and the next scheduled working day after ...” For example, when both “Thanksgiving” and “the day after Thanksgiving" are properly scheduled days of work for an otherwise eligible employee, absence on either day will not serve to disqualify the employee from receiving holiday pay for the remaining day. You were also advised that the above policy has no effect on other administrative policy or contractual provisions related to holidays.

ENGINEERING METHOD OF ROUNDING RE: THREE-MONTH AVERAGE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX
’	The following rules of rounding shall apply to the determi-
nation of the Three-Month Average Consumer Price Index: 1. If the leftmost of the digits discarded is less than 5, the ►	preceding digit is not affected. For example, when
rounding to four digits, 130.646 becomes 130.6.
2.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is greater than 5, or r	is 5 followed by digits not all of which are zero, the
preceding digit is increased by one. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.557 becomes 130.6.
3.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5, followed by zeros, the preceding digit is increased by one if it is odd and remains unchanged if it is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit retained is ►	even. For example, when rounding to four digits,
130.5500 becomes 130.6 and 130.650 becomes 130.6.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING

Mr. Ernest Lofton,
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Federal Income Tax Withholding
This will describe the methods to be used by Payroll Services in regard to withholding of Federal income tax from employee's wages attributable to grievance awards, vacation pay and pay in lieu of vacation from employee’s wages.
Grievance awards in excess of $600.00, but involving periods less than one calendar year, will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be calculated using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
295
FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING'
Likewise, pay in lieu of vacation also will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be withheld using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
It should be noted that the tax withholding referenced above only covers the Federal withholding amount. An amount for F1CA taxes and state or local income taxes, where applicable, will be in addition to the amount withheld for Federal income tax. •
Grievance awards which are less than $500.00, will be aggregated with the regular payroll and the income tax withholding will be calculated on the total amount.
If a grievance award is made for a period of more than one calendar year, the income tax withholding will be calculated as if the payment were for a single annual period. Thus, in such situations, Payroll Services will use the annual percentage table to calculate the income tax withholding for such awards. This method would be the same as considering the award as having been paid equally over the preceding 52 weeks.
For vacation payments made for time away from work, such payments will continue to be treated as a regular wage payment; i.e., income tax withholding will be calculated as if the vacation payment represented a regular weekly wage payment.
The above methods are dictated by Federal Income Tax Regulations. Therefore, any change or amendment to such Regulations will, of necessity, have to be reviewed for compliance with the above changes.
Formal procedures to effect these changes are being communicated to Payroll Services by separate letter, with instructions to make these changes as soon as practical.

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject.- Grievance Back Pay Awards
This letter will serve to consolidate and confirm the present and past understandings agreed to by the parties with regard to grievance back pay awards.	-
•	During the course of national negotiations, the Union expressed concern over alleged delays involved in the receipt of grievance back pay awards. This is to advise you that all plant Labor Relations Offices have been directed to insure the appropriate Past Period Adjustment TWOS task or Grievance Payment Authorization Forms, when required, are prepared concurrent with the dispositioning of the grievance involved. Upon request, a copy of the TWOS Past Period Adjustment Report of grievance payment data transmitted to payroll or a copy of the Grievance Payment Authorization Form will be provided to the Building Chairperson or a Unit Committeeperson at the time the grievance dispositions are presented to the Union.
Also upon request, the grievance payment portion of the Hourly Payroll Adjustment Report will be provided to indicate issuance of the back pay award to the employee.
•	Article V]], Section 24(b) provides that back pay awards will be paid within thirty days of such award except where the work involved makes it impractical. Although the Company is not aware of any problems or abuses with regard to the administration of this provision, the Company reaffirmed to the Union it is in the parties’ mutual interest that back pay awards be paid in conformity with this provision.
Should problems develop with the administration of this provision at specific Company locations and upon request by

October 7, 1990
Mr. Ernest Lofton
Vice President and Director UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Overtime
During the 1990 negotiations, the parties discussed both the Union’s and the Company’s concerns about the scheduling of overtime work.
On the one hand, the Company recognized the legitimacy of the Union's concern that production not be scheduled on a sustained basis on overtime rather than recalling laid off employees or hiring new employees. On the other hand, the Union recognized that the scheduling of overtime serves an essential purpose in many situations in order to meet temporary or seasonal increases in sales, at new mode! start-up, and to make up for production lost due to factors beyond the parties’ control, such as interruptions in the supply of parts. Also, the parties recognize the need for overtime on vital tooling and maintenance projects which often must be accomplished quickly on tight time schedules in order to avoid interruptions or delays in production and layoffs of production employees.
300
OVERTIME
As a result of these discussions, the parties agreed to establish a procedure for regularly reviewing overtime work schedules. This review will be accomplished between representatives of the Company and the National Ford Department, International Union, UAW and will be designed to focus on those plants and facilities that establish a pattern of high overtime scheduling on a sustained basis. The review is intended to assure that overtime work is not scheduled at a plant on an ongoing basis in cases where there are practical and economical alternatives. The alternatives to overtime considered by the parties may include manpower increases, innovative shift arrangements, or improvements or additions to the plant's equipment which could eliminate a bottleneck; or the parties may conclude that the reasons for the overtime are temporary or unavoidable and that there are no practical or economical alternatives.
The purpose of this review procedure is to assure a timely and thorough review of overtime work schedules and provide for a balanced consideration of the interests of both parties.

Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Yokich:
Subject; Overtime Scheduling
During the current negotiations the Union has expressed concern over the overtime schedules being worked in various plants while there are employees on indefinite layoff from those plants. The Company recognizes that extensive overtime schedules are a condition that is disconcerting and perplexing to persons on indefinite layoff who view the overtime as depriving them of work they otherwise might perform.
The parties also recognize that vehicle manufacture and assembly is a higldy integrated process and that overtime work is an inherent, unavoidable element of the process. However, to assure that avoidable overtime work may be identified, local management will meet with the local union to examine existing and proposed overtime schedules and consider the feasibility of modifying those schedules by the recall of laid off seniority employees from that plant. As an ongoing objective, the parties pledged their joint efforts to reduce scheduled overtime by up to two hours. It is agreed that such efforts must recognize the need to achieve required levels of production in a manner which maintains the quality of the product, the competitiveness of the operation, the demands of the marketplace and the job security of employees.
302
OVERTIME SCHEDULING
If the local union at a plant where employees are on layoff believes that plant is working avoidable overtime, it may refer the matter to the National Ford Department for discussion with representatives of the appropriate operating Division.

Dear Mr, Lofton:
Subject: Vacation Scheduling
Article IX, Section 25(b) of the Collective Bargaining Agree-	'
ment recognizes the importance of providing vacation time off in a manner that maintains efficiency of operations while
giving due consideration to the desires of employees. It also	,
provides that in the event a plant is scheduled for a vacation
shutdown, the Union will be notified by April 1 as to the	1
specific shutdown period and which employees have been '
selected to work during such shutdown.	'
The duration of the shutdown will be not more than two	i
weeks. Exceptions to this limitation can be made only by	'
mutual agreement between the local management and the	'
local union involved.	>
This will confirm that should the Company determine after
April 1 that an employee scheduled to work during the	<
shutdown is no longer needed, if the employee does not
desire to be on vacation during the shutdown period, he/she	1
will be placed on layoff during that period.	1

A AND X VEHICLE PURCHASE PLANS
September 15, 2003
To: Plant and Depot Human Resources Managers UAW Local Presidents
Unit Chairpersons	,
Cc; Plant and Depot Managers
Subject: A and X Vehicle Purchase Plans
During the course of the 2003 negotiations, the Union and the Company discussed, on a number of occasions, the importance of the A and X-Plans to both the employees and to the Ford Motor Company. The parties consistently agreed that our employees are the best ambassadors for the sale of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.	.
During our discussions, attention focused on the opportunity chat Company and Union leadership have to encourage our employees to utilize their full allotment of A and X-Plan PINs. Accordingly, local leader ship will develop promotional messages addressed to all employees stressing the importance of seeking out potential customers, especially those driving competitive products. In addition, local leadership will develop programs that would recognize employees who use their full A and X-Plan allotment within the constraints of Policy Letter A-109. There are many creative ways to encourage our employees to use their PINs while at the same time remaining within the provisions of the program and Company policy.
As you know, the Company often gives favorable consideration to extending additional PINs to those employees who have used their full allotment. With this in mind, you are encouraged to develop a local communication reminding employees that they can submit a request for additional PIN numbers, after having used their full yearly allotment. In order to prevent abuse, the management and control of the approval process are handled centrally at Vehicle Programs and approval may be obtained by calling 1-800-348-7709.
314
A AND X VEHICLE PURCHASE PLANS
Determination of eligibility to participate in the A and X-Plans is at the sole discretion of the Company. Violation of any of the Plan provisions outlined in the New Vehicle Purchase Plan policy will result in disciplinary action and the privilege to participate may be withdrawn or suspended as a result. The Company reserves the right to unilaterally modify or discontinue the Plans at any time.

Under the provisions of Appendix I of the Ford-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement, the parties have agreed to establish a Two-Shift, Three-Crew/Manufacturing Team Operating System to invest in the future of the Van Dyke and Sharonville Plants, and potentially in other operations when appropriate. This memorandum sets forth the goals, general design features, and the parties' agreement as to the application or waiver of certain provisions of the Ford-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement (Agreement) to accommodate implementation of the System.
The new operating system is being developed to better empower the work force, enabling higher quality and more cost effective production of the new FN Transaxle, and for potential application in other operations when appropriate. The overall goals of the new system are to establish a .120 hours per week operating pattern capable of running equipment 20 hours per day, six days per week, with an Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of 80% of optimum for machine operations, and 96% of optimum for assembly operations. General design features include:
•	A two shift, three crew,-120 hour per week shift pattern;
•	Manufacturing Teams (MT's) comprised of trade and non-trade employees who perform production, maintenance, quality, material handling and cleaning functions to achieve, safety, quality, cost and schedule operating objectives; work assignment practices within the MT’s will include the CRAFTT concept for skilled trade personnel, and will be limited only by an employee's ability
323
ALTERNATE OPERATING PRACTICES - VAN DYKE AND
SHARONVILLE PLANTS
to perform the work safely, a working leader will be assigned from among the members of each MT; membership of each MT must be stable for the MT to be effective;
• Utilization, only as required, of other skilled trades specialists not assigned to the MT. ' ■
The parties have agreed to the application or waiver of certain provisions of the Ford-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement as described herein to accommodate the implementation of alternate work schedules at the Van Dyke and Sharonville Plants, effective July 24, 1997.
1.	The alternate work schedules authorized by determination of the National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee, pursuant to the Ford-UAW Agreement and for the purpose of' this memorandum, are as follows:
(a) A shift pattern (Exhibit 1) consisting of two 1 O-hour shifts, Monday through Saturday, using three crews (A,B, and C) of employees, with each crew working
; , four days per week, with Saturday as a normal work day.
■ ’Cb) Optional utilization, as required, of other skilled trades assigned to “zone maintenance outposts1’, who are available to assist MT’s at the team’s request. The regular work schedules traditionally recognized by the Agreement would be.used for this circumstance.
2.	Employees will be selected for FN operations on a voluntary basis locally or, absent sufficient numbers of local volunteers, obtained through the placement hierarchy provisions of the Ford-UAW Agreement, including new hires as required.
3.	Notwithstanding the existing provisions of the Ford-UAW Agreement, it is agreed, that the following will apply during the time the alternate work schedules are in effect: (a) Appendix H, Memorandum of Understanding on Voluntary Overtime and other related provisions of the Agreement governing voluntary overtime will be waived and not apply.
(b) Employees regularly assigned to the 1 O-hour daily schedules described in Exhibit 1 will:
324
ALTERNATE OPERATING PRACTICES - VAN DYKE ANO

(1)	Be eligible for bereavement pay of up to 10 straight-time hours, depending on their schedule, for each regularly scheduled workday, to a maximum of. five days based on Article IX, Section 19 provisions. It is understood that paid holidays and other days the employee is not scheduled to work will be included in determining the bereavement period.
(2)	Have their daily jury duty pay and short-term military duty pay eligibility determined on the basis of up to 10 straight-time hours, depending ' on their regular schedule.
(3)	Use their vacation entitlement in increments of 40 hours for each week of vacation and then-excused absence allowance in increments of five straight-time hours for “hair days and 10 straight-time hours for “whole” days, depending on their regularly scheduled hours for the specific day. ■	.
(<;) The provisions of the Agreement covering EDTP funding for overtime hours worked in excess of five percent of straight time hours worked shall not apply to time worked by employees following the two-shift, three crew schedules described herein.
(dj Employees regularly assigned to the 10-hour daily schedules described in Exhibit 1 will have their holiday pay determined on the basis of:
(1)	Eight straight-time hours for each holiday falling on a day when they would not otherwise be scheduled to work; or
(2)	Ten straight-time hours for each holiday failing on a day when they would otherwise have been scheduled to work, except for such specified holiday; provided however, that holiday pay for the full week of holidays between Christmas and New Year shall not exceed 40 straight-time hours of pay.

SHARONVILLE PLANTS
(f) The provisions of Article IX, Section 22 (a)(3)® Qf the Agreement, if otherwise applicable, will be waived and not apply for the Saturday’s immediately preceding and immediately following the Christmas holiday period.
4.	In the event the alternate work schedules described in Exhibit i would affect and require changes in the administration of other wage or benefit payment practices, the parties agree that such changes shall maintain the original intent of those practices to the extent practical, but shall not increase their cost to the Company in comparison to their application to work schedules traditionally, recognized by the Agreement.
5.	Local agreements affected by the alternate work schedules described in this memorandum shall be interpreted in such a manner to make them consistent with the terms of this memorandum. Either party may refer specific unresolved local issues to the UAW National Ford Department and the Company's U.S. Union Affairs Office for resolution.	,
Finally, it is understood that this memorandum does not limit in any way management’s rights to schedule and determine	I
the working hours of employees pursuant to the Ford-UAW
Agreement. In that regard, however, if it becomes necessary	‘
for the Company to discontinue the alternate work schedules	,
or the Manufacturing Team concept described herein, the regular work schedules traditionally recognized by the Agree-	,
ment would be reinstituted. Moreover, in the event problems arise relative to the disposition and placement of redundant	■
personnel under the GEN provisions of the Agreement, such problems will be subject to discussion and resolution by the	'
parties in a mutually satisfactory manner.	,

Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger;	.
Subject: Alternative Work Schedules
During the course of the current negotiations, the parties discussed at length the emergence and application of alternative work schedules, the business cases underlying their enactment, their impact upon the workforce and the parties’ relationship, and the positive results derived from continuing such innovative and advantageous programs in the	<
future.
Both parties acknowledged the mutual benefits derived from such programs to date and recognized the need to explore work schedules in the future that are uniquely designed to respond to challenges and opportunities in the market place and to gain a competitive advantage for the Company and its employees. These benefits include, but are not necessarily	1
limited to the following: increased employment levels, greater job security, enhanced plant viability, shorter work weeks/more free time, expanded production capability, improved asset utilization, increased profitability, and focused responsiveness to consumer demand and expectations.
In addressing the benefits and need for such alternative work	,
schedules in the future, the parties also recognized that the circumstances giving rise to these schedules will differ sub-	i
stantially and may require creative solutions which are unique to particular operations or responsive to rapidly changing consumer expectations, competitor initiatives and employee preferences. To this end, the parties have pledged to carefully review the business requirements involved in	(
each situation, the impact such schedules may have upon	’
existent contractual provisions, and the impact upon the employees' welfare and family considerations to ensure mutually beneficial results, in crafting alternative work schedule	■
agreements the parties recognize that, while individual seg-
328
ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULES
merits of an alternative work schedule agreement may differ from the provisions of the master agreement, the agreement as a whole generally should neither advantage nor disadvantage either party as compared to a traditional schedule.
In the event that the local parties agree that a particular alternative work schedule fulfills and properly balances these objectives, and in order to facilitate the changes required, it may be necessary to change certain provisions of the parties’ Agreement, supplemental agreements, and appropriate local agreements at specified locations. It is understood that such changes would not be effective unless agreed to by the local Company and Union and approved in writing by both the Labor Affairs of the Company and the National Ford Department of the Union, consistent with Article X, Section 8 of the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Dear Mr. Yokich:
Subject: Application of Statistical Techniques	,
During the course of 1987 negotiations the parties discussed	,
the issues concerning the application of statistical problem
resolution techniques (generally known as ‘Management-by-	1
Facts”) to monitor processes and operations in car and truck assembly plants. It is recognized that utilization of such techniques contributes to continuous improvement in prod-
uct quality and process reliability which are of mutual	1
benefit to the parties. At the same time, the Union expressed	,
concern about the process used by local management to select bargaining unit employees assigned full-time to the	■
“Management-by-Facts” program and the appropriateness of

APPLICATION OF STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES
their wage rates based on the tasks performed. .
The Company is sensitive to the concerns expressed by the Union on this subject. Accordingly, it is agreed that within forty-five (45) days of the Effective Date of the' new agreement a representative of the Company’s Wage Administration Section and a representative of the National Ford Department will review the tasks performed by such employees. Thereafter, the appropriate representatives of the Company’s Employee Relations Staff and the National Ford Department will meet to resolve the issues related to (I) whether or not the assignment to employees of certain statistical problem resolution techniques requires an adjustment to their wage rate and, if adjustment is necessary, what wage rate is appropriate and (2) the selection process of the employees assigned such tasks.

total in lieu of bereavement pay for which the employee
■	otherwise would be eligible, except for the employee’s
r	non-work status during such vacation week(s). Such
■'	requested, hours will be in addition to those excused
absence allowance hours for which the employee other-■	wise is eligible and are to be scheduled under the terms
of Article IX, Section 25(c) of the Agreement.
•	An employee who, in conjunction with approved absence due to bereavement, requests limited additional time off for the disposition 'of financial, administrative or legal matters associated with the death of an immediate family I	member as defined in Article IX, Section 19 of the
,	Agreement, should be given consideration for additional
‘	time off (up to two (2) days) as unpaid personal time or
,	excused absence allowance. It is further understood that
the request must be in advance and the time off, itself, j,	should not negatively impact operations.
•	Employees will be eligible for bereavement pay in cases 1	where the body of an immediate family member, as

provided the employee furnishes local Management with 1	documentation reflecting that the employee attended a
bona fide memorial service held at a funeral home or an ’	acknowledged place of worship within ten (10) calendar
,	days of the date of death in the overseas location.
333
BEREAVEMENT APPLICATION
•	Representatives of the UAW National Ford Department and representatives of Labor Affairs may discuss the disqualification of certain employees from bereavement pay due to the unique circumstances associated with the death of an immediate family member to determine on a case-by-case basis the possibility of providing bereavement pay to those otherwise ineligible employees.
•	In cases where an employee's spouse of five (5) years or longer predeceases an immediate parent of that spouse, and provided the employee has not remarried, the employee will be eligible for bereavement payment pursuant to the provisions of Article IX, Section 19 of the Agreement, in the event of the death of a parent of that former spouse.

BUSINESS LEADERSHIP INITIATIVE (BLI) CLARIFICATION
tation of Business Leadership Initiative (BLI) at some locations, particularly as it impacts the assignment of work and the scheduling of skilled trades employees. The Union is concerned that some locations have misunderstood the intent of BLI, resulting in arbitrary overtime restrictions, changes in preventative maintenance programs, and sourcing of project work to outside contractors.
Operating management has clarified that BLI is not intended to set a “blanket" limit on overtime contrary to good business sense. While opportunities to improve the efficiency or effectiveness of preventative maintenance should be pursued, such initiatives are not intended to prohibit the assignment of skilled work to skilled trades that they normally and customarily perform.
Concerns in this area not resolved at the local level should be referred to the Company’s Labor Affairs Office.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
t	Subject: Compliance with the Family and Medical Leave
Act of 1993
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA J of 1993. The Company assured the Union that it will continue to comply with the provisions of the FMLA.
As part of its compliance, the Company has established a new category of unpaid leave called “FMLA Leave.” In some instances, FMLA Leaves will be concurrent with leaves of absence covered by Article VIII, Sections 29 and 30, of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Accordingly, in those cases where the employee is eligible for leave under the Ford-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement and the leave also qualifies under the FMLA, the Company intends to comply with the requirements of the FMLA as well as the
339
COMPLIANCE WITH THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT OF 1993
separate provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement regarding covered leaves of absence. •
Pursuant to the Company’s present plan for compliance with the FMLA, the Company's rights under the Act have been modified to.-
•	Provide that an employee on FMLA Leave will continue to accumulate seniority in the same manner as the employee also would be eligible under Article VIII, Section 29 or 30, as appropriate;
•	Permit but not require employees to substitute vacation and/or excused absence allowance for unpaid FMLA Leave;
•	Provide that employees who are married to each other will be each entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks of qualifying leave under the Act;
•	Provide that, when a third opinion is necessary under the medical certification and dispute resolution sections of the FMLA, the neutral provider will be selected jointly by the Company and the Union from a list, provided by the appropriate local or state professional medical association, of board-certified specialists in the' field of medicine in which the point of controversy exists;
•	Continue Company-paid Group Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Disability Insurance during all FMLA Leaves that are not also Ford-UAW Medical Leaves as if such leaves were Ford-UAW Personal Leaves of Absence.
In addition, the Company’s plan for compliance would:
•	Beginning with the Effective Date of this Agreement, not automatically designate and apply absence time that is compensated under the Accident and Sickness Insurance provisions of the Group Life and Disability .Insurance Program against an eligible employee’s FMLA entitlement, unless requested by the employee;
•	Continue to use, initially, a calendar year as the 12-month period of the leave entitlement;
•	Continue to require repayment of the cost of health care coverage provided during Che leave from employees who fail to return from FMLA Leave to the extent permitted by law.	■

1	Subject: Computer Systems Access for UAW
Representatives
During the course of these negotiations, the parties discussed the importance of certain International Union representatives having access to certain Corporate databases containing information pertinent to r	the accomplishment of their responsibilities.
The Company recognizes the potential for efficiencies that may be gained by expanding certain access to .	different Corporate data systems. At the same time, it
\	must be recognized that the widespread availability of
I	e-mail and the public Internet, increases the possibili-
'	ties for the misuse or improper control of the Compa-
ny’s proprietary information. As such, the Company must ensure that access is limited to those individuals with a demonstrated business need related to primary job functions. Furthermore, to protect the Company’s intellectual properties, the handling of such data must comply with security policies and procedures, and regulations governing the public disclosure of this information. To meet these standards it is essential that the Company database business owner has reviewed and approved any access. Inappropriate access or misuse of data related to the Ford Motor Company can lead to potential unauthorized disclosure of data, which could cause reputational damage, compromise the competitive position of the Ford Motor Company, create potential violations of consumer privacy protection, and could result in financial harm to the Company.
Consistent with the guidelines listed above, and within 30 days following the Effective Date of this
343
COMPUTER SYSTEMS ACCESS FOR UAW REPRESENTATIVES
Agreement, UAW and Company representatives from the Joint Programs, along with representatives from the Company’s Information Technology organization will form a committee to complete a feasibility study and to develop an action plan for expanding the access of certain International Union representatives to certain Company databases.
Following this joint study, it is understood that access will only be granted to specific Corporate systems on the basis of demonstrated business relevance. Prior to the granting of any such access, the parties discussed and agree to develop a mutually acceptable indemnification provision from the UAW to the Company.
In all instances, the granting of access will conform to the Company’s Corporate Information Management Policy (Policy Letter Number 20), which includes, but is not limited to, proper information management and retention standards. At all times, the Company reserves the right to periodically reevaluate access, audit usage, and to remove access rights immediately upon awareness of inappropriate access and/or usage. Furthermore, should access be granted, UAW representatives must comply with regulations governing the public disclosure of the Company’s proprietary information. Additionally, representatives must recognize the need to protect and limit the Company’s exposure and potential liabilities that may result from the improper, inaccurate, or inconsistent use of information.

Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Definition of Bargaining Unit at Research and Engineering Center
Discussion in the current national negotiations with the UAW have highlighted the desirability of a definition of the Bargaining Unit as it presently exists at the Research and Engineering Center, consistent with the general provisions of Article I, Section 1 of the Agreement.
Therefore, in supplementation of Article I, Section 1 of the Agreement, as applied to the Research and Engineering Center, a joint committee of Company and Union representatives shall be established.

Meetings will commence as soon as is practicable following the completion of negotiations and at such time thereafter as agreed to by the parties.
It shall be the function of the committee to discuss and explore work assignment practices at the Center in order to formulate guidelines for the assignment of included employees. It will not be an objective of the committee to alter, either enlarging or diminishing, the composition of the Bargaining Unit. And nothing in this letter is intended to preclude the Umpire from ruling on included-excluded disputes in grievances appealed to the Fourth Stage of the Grievance Procedure by the Union pursuant to the Agreement.
The Company reiterates that it has no intention of altering the composition of the Bargaining Unit by reassigning work to excluded employees that has been performed traditionally and exclusively by employees represented by the UAW at the Center. The Company will continue to abide by Umpire decisions, or letters of understanding, or other criteria that

IMPROVED COMMUNICATION
October 7, 1990
Mr. Ernest Lofton
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Improved Communication
During subcommittee meetings on various subjects in the course of this year's bargaining, both parties cited examples in which improved communication could have enhanced relationships in our plants and eliminated potential sources of friction. The parties also discussed the need to consolidate, where possible, several meetings into one meeting in order to provide local union and management representatives more time in which to conduct their regular assignments.
Among the meetings that we agreed might be consolidated at each location are:
•	Cost reviews
•	Quality reviews
« Job Security and Operational Effectiveness meetings • Outside Contracting and Sourcing discussions.
This list is not intended to be all inclusive. The list does suggest that there are a number of elements directly related to the employees and operations at each location that might be combined and reviewed jointly by the parties on a regular basis.
By regularly reviewing the key elements of each location’s business, the parties will be able to address approaches to ensure a highly motivated workforce that will produce “best-in-class” products and thereby assist in ensuring the viability of each location. In addition, the parties will be able to regularly review those elements of each plant’s business that can cause concern within the workforce and friction between the parties.
358
IMPROVED COMMUNICATION
As we have learned by working together on other projects, meetings of this nature should also be conducted on a regular basis at both the divisional and national level. We will ensure that this process is continued at those divisions at which it is already taking place and implemented at other divisions.
While it would not be our intention to prescribe meeting frequency for local parties, experience does suggest that, in light of the complexity of plant operations, frequent meetings are the best approach. In addition, in light of the subjects to be discussed in these meetings, it is imperative that the meetings be conducted by the senior operating and bargaining unit personnel at each location.
We have also agreed that these meetings are not intended to supplant the regular UAW/Fo'rd grievance procedure.

JURY DUTY PAY
October 7, 1990
Mr. Ernest Lofton
Vice President and Director UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Jury Duty Pay
This will confirm understandings reached in previous negotiations concerning the eligibility requirements for jury duty pay: 1, An employee is eligible only if summoned, or subpoenaed, However, in locations where a summons or subpoena system is not followed by the court authorities, the plant management and local union involved will be expected to develop a suitable alternative as proof that the employee was required to perform jury duty.
2.	Where an employee is selected to serve on a jury and reports for service but is not required to serve, the employee is eligible for payment. If the employee performs jury duty for only part of a day (or loses part of a day in reporting for jury service even though not required to serve) and thus loses wages, the employee is eligible for jury duty payment.
3.	It will not be necessary for an employee to complete jury duty service before applying for jury duty pay from the Company. Where necessary arrangements can be made with the appropriate jury commission, an eligible employee may request to be paid on a weekly basis, provided the employee submits weekly to the Company evidence

The Company reaffirms the provisions of Article X, Section 6 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. However, to maintain production requirements some employees may on occasion work rather than take a lunch. The Company agrees this will not be done without the employee’s consent.
This provision is not intended to prohibit the Company from altering an employee’s scheduled lunch period, pursuant to the provisions of Article X, Section 6(bj.

Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Major Plant Rearrangements—Local Agreements
During the course of the present negotiations, the International Union raised the potential problem of major plant rearrangement and its possible impact on local agreements covering bargaining unit employees.
The Union specifically expressed concern over the impact such major rearrangements could have on local overtime, shift preference and occupational group agreements.
Where there are such major changes in facilities, both parties agree that it is in their mutual interest to review the potential impact on local agreements with the objective of minimizing misunderstandings and reducing or eliminating possible disputes as far in advance of the event as practicable. Accordingly, the Company will discuss such situations with the National Ford Department as far in advance as practicable.

MEDICAL TREATMENT TIME OUTSIDE

Mr. Ernest Lofton
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Medical Treatment Tune Outside Employees’ Normal Working Hours
During 1993 bargaining, the Union expressed concern that, in some locations, employees who suffer compensable work injuries are being scheduled, on occasion, by the plant medical facility for medical treatment outside their normal working hours.
Subsequent to negotiations, plant medical facilities will be advised to make every reasonable effort to schedule employees' recurring medical appointments with due regard for the convenience of such employees. In regard to these scheduling issues, plant medical facilities should consider not only the employee’s convenience but also the availability of treatment facilities and medical specialists, as well as the exigencies of plant operations.
The parties agreed that, in those instances in which the Local Union believes that appropriate consideration has not been made by the local medical facility in scheduling such appointments, the matter maybe brought to tire attention of the location's Employee Relations Manager for resolution.

MULTIPLE STARTING TIMES
October 5, 3976
Mr. Ken Bannon, Vice President
International Union, UAW
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear' Mr. Bannon:
Subject; Multiple Starting Times
During the current negotiations, the subject of multiple starting times at various locations was discussed by the Company and the Union.
As was indicated during these discussions, the number of starting times at individual Company locations is predicated primarily upon the interdependent and sequential nature of the various assembly, manufacturing, and related supportive operations. Similarly, warehousing operations also require various starting times to maintain a balanced flow of parts and material. Additionally, it was noted that various operating conditions along with the necessity for proper utilization of facilities, as well as such cost implications as overtime, are factors which must be considered in making determinations with respect to various starting times. Accordingly, starting times are established to accommodate these various needs and to provide for the efficient utilization of manpower to ensure achievement of operating requirements.
However, cognizant of the Union's expressed concern relating to this topic, local management will discuss with local union representatives the reasons for assigning particular starting times, and where it is determined that the number of starting times can be reduced consistent with the requirements referred to above, the Company will take appropriate action.

NEUTRALITY
September 15, 2003
Mr. Gerald D. Bantom
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Neutrality
We have had previous discussion with you regarding the Union’s efforts to organize non-represented hourly employees elsewhere in Ford Motor Company. The commitments in this letter cover all hourly employees in all facilities operated in the U.S. by Ford Motor Company, or any affiliate or subsidiary of Ford Motor Company.
Ford Motor Company on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates, also agrees not to enter into any joint venture, sale of assets, stock sale or other transaction or business combination regarding U.S. manufacturing operations unless it has discussed with the purchaser or resulting entity the benefits of voluntarily adopting this Agreement.
Ford and its subsidiaries and affiliates respect their employees’ rights regarding union representation. Ford has a positive and constructive relationship with the UAW as well as its many other unions. Ford and its subsidiaries and affiliates are committed that they will remain neutral during a UAW organizing campaign directed at hourly employees in facilities of Ford or its affiliates or subsidiaries. Ford also recognizes that employees are permitted to express their views and opinions regarding union representation, provided their actions are lawful and conducted in accordance with Company policies.
Ford, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates, agrees to recognize the UAW as the bargaining representative of hourly employees in an appropriate unit the Union seeks to represent, upon a showing, pursuant to a card check conducted by a third party, that a majority of such employees have expressed their desire to be represented by the Union.
371
NEUTRALITY
Ford, on behalf of itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates, agrees not to take any retaliatory actions against any of its employees, or any facility, based upon a decision of the employees to join a Union. Ford also agrees that, upon request by the Union, it will send a copy of the attached letter to the hourly employees at any U.S. facilities of Ford or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates the Union seeks to represent. We will provide the UAW with an opportunity to address such employees during a meeting to be conducted on the facilities premises during working time.
Within 30 days of the effective date of the National Agreement, Ford Motor Company will provide the UAW with a list of all U.S. manufacturing facilities operated by Ford or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, including the location, nature of work performed, union status, and number of employees.
Further, Ford and its subsidiaries and affiliates will, if requested by the Union, give the Union limited access to such employees in non-work areas, during non-work time provided such access is not disruptive to the operations of the facility. In addition, we will provide the union, upon request, with a list of such employees, their home addresses and job classifications.
Ford and the Union agree that employees are best able to make decisions on representation when the decision is based on accurate information as opposed to inaccurate or misleading information. Ford, on behalf of itself and its U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates, agrees no agent of Ford Motor Company or any such subsidiary or affiliate will comment in a negative manner about the Union.
In the event the Union is aware of any actions by Ford or a U.S. Ford affiliate or subsidiary or its agents that are viewed as anti-union, or if the Union has a concern that Ford or its subsidiaries or affiliates, or their agents, are acting in a manner that is inconsistent with this letter, the issue may be presented by the National Parties directly to the Umpire on

It was recognized that the local parties should work together to ensure that reasonable efforts are made to place medically restricted employees on work which they can perform in accordance with their seniority and applicable provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. In addition, the medically restricted employee is expected to show an active, continuing interest in being placed in the workforce. Placement options may include appropriate vacant jobs and displacement of lower seniority employees occupying jobs which the medically restricted employee can perform.
It is understood that appropriate personnel from either the National Ford Department or the Employee Relations Staff of the Company may contact the other party in situations where problems have developed concerning these obligations at specific Company locations.

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: POW/MIA Flags
During the current negotiations, the Union requested that Ford facilities fly POW/MIA flags. As discussed, flying of flags at Ford locations is a matter of Company policy administered by the Corporate Identity Office.

Dear Mr. Lofton;
Subject: Privacy — Confidentiality of Personal Data and Information
During these negotiations, the Union raised a number of concerns regarding the subject of personal privacy. The discussions centered on the collection and dissemination of personal data concerning employees and/or their conduct in the workplace.

:	Subject: Promotions
During the current negotiations, the Union expressed con-r	cem with the application of Article IV, Section 2(a) of the
।	Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Union specifically
i	expressed concern over the use of disciplinary and atten-
I	dance records in determining the merit of candidates, rather
*	than awarding the promotion to the employee having the
:	greatest seniority.
■	The Company advised the Union that retaining the ability to
I	promote the most qualified candidates for promotional open-
ings is essential to its commitment to make quality products '	and to maintain efficient operations. The Company assured
[.	the Union that, in evaluating disciplinary and attendance
[	records in determining merit for promotional opportunities,
the exercise of good judgement is essential. In evaluating the ■	records of two employees bidding for a promotion, if the
f	records are to be the deciding factor, there must be a
t	meaningful difference between them. Among the factors to
I	be considered when evaluating a meaningful difference, is
’	the amount of time elapsed since an employee’s last disci-
plinary action. If a meaningful difference between the ,	records of the two employees is not readily distinguishable,
,	the employee having the greater seniority shah receive the
r	promotion. Any complaint regarding this provision of the
agreement, including clarification of meaningful difference, '	may be raised by the local union with local management for
,	resolution.
If an ongoing concern regarding the application of these ’	provisions arises at a particular location, the issue may be
referred to the Division Human Resources Office and the
'	National Ford Department for resolution.

Subject: Reassignment of Employees	-
During our current negotiations, the Union has asserted that on occasion a foreman will reassign an employee to another job within his classification either for punitive reasons or as “retaliation” for having filed a grievance or other similar actions.

This statement of policy is not intended to limit in any way the foreman’s right of assignment to promote orderly and efficient operations. Nor is anything in this statement intended to recognize any principle of job preference within a

REFERRAL — DIFFERENCES OF OPINION
BETWEEN PERSONAL AND PLANT PHYSICIAN
REFERRAL—DIFFERENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN PERSONAL AND PLANT PHYSICIANS
Where there is a difference of opinion between the employee’s personal physician and the plant physician regarding the employee’s physical status, it is the plant physician’s responsibility to resolve these differences in a fair and equitable manner. This difference of opinion may be at the time an individual is returning to work foilowing sick leave, at the time of initiating a sick leave or at the time of job assignment. The disagreement may not always involve the question of the employee’s fitness to work but more frequently involves the question of the individual’s capacity to perform a certain type of work. It may, on occasion, involve the question of disability of the employee.
In most instances this can be resolved by discussing the problem with the employee’s personal physician. In some cases broad recommendations are made by the individual's personal physician without full knowledge of the work demands on a specific job assignment. A discussion of the case in question between the personal physician and the plant physician will usually settle any points of disagreement because usually the physicians will agree on the clinical findings of the patient but the personal physician may not have adequate knowledge of the job requirements. The plant physician may review with the personal physician those factors which he considers when placing physical restrictions or limitations on the individual.
These factors are.- (1) a condition which may limit his ability to perform his work, (2) a condition which may be aggravated by certain types of work, or (3) a condition which may create a hazard to himself or the safety of others. In such cases, work restrictions or limitations must be established. When the point in question cannot be resolved by discussion between the two physicians, the plant physician should refer the employee to a consultant for examination and impartial recommendation at Company expense. The plant physician should preferably use a board-certified specialist in the field of medicine in which the point of controversy exists. For example: an eye case should be referred to an ophthalmologist, a back case to an orthopedist, a heart case to a
391
REFERRAL — DIFFERENCES OF OPINION
BETWEEN PERSONAL AND PLANT PHYSICIAN
cardiologist or specialist in internal medicine. The job demands should be thoroughly described to the consultant at the time of referral. The plant physician should follow the recommendation of the consultant.

Subject: Saturday Excused Absence Allowance Requests
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern regarding employees not being provided the opportunity to request payment of Excused Absence Allowance entitlement when the employee is pre-excused by management from working a scheduled Saturday overtime shift.
The parties recognized the need to run production operations efficiently and agreed that excessive absenteeism adversely impacts the Company in terms of product quality, operating costs, efficiency of operations and employee morale and places an unfair burden on those employees who regularly work as scheduled.
The parties agreed that an employee who is scheduled to work a Saturday overtime shift and who, in advance of that Saturday shift, is pre-excused by management from working such shift, may receive payment of Excused Absence Allowance for such pre-excused shift, only at the employee’s request.
If such request is granted, an eligible employee will be paid for eight (8) hours (or the balance of unused Excused Absence Allowance hours if the balance is less than eight (8) hours) at the employee’s straight time base hourly rate inclusive of applicable cost-of-living allowance and shift premium but exclusive of overtime premium.

Because of the sensitivity of sexual harassment issues, all investigations will be designed to protect the privacy and reputation of all individuals concerned. Ford will take appropriate steps to assure that a person who in good faith reports complaints about, or participates in the investigation of, a sexual harassment allegation, will not be subject to retaliation. Ford will also take appropriate steps to assure that a person against whom such an allegation is made is treated fairly.
Ford is firmly committed to providing a work environment free of harassment and will not tolerate harassment of any kind. Violations will result in appropriate corrective action. Appropriate discipline, up to and including discharge, may be imposed.

notice” of potential disciplinary action, and that any act(s) of retaliation will not be tolerated. Dependent on the circumstances of the individual case, the Human Resources Manager may deem it prudent to suspend the accused individu-al(s) until the investigation is concluded.
Absent extenuating circumstances, an Investigation Team will be formed within five (5) working days of receipt of an allegation of sexual harassment. The Investigation Team will include at least one (1) but not to exceed two (2) representative's) from the Local Union which may include members of the local Civil Rights Committee and an-equal number of management representatives. Recognizing the desirability of an investigative team made up of an equal number of males and females, wherever possible, each facility will attempt to structure the team accordingly. Local facilities are encouraged to confer with the Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office for any guidance that may be required. The Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office may elect to name a representative to serve I	as an additional member of the Investigative Team. In
conjunction with Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office presence, the National Ford Department may elect to also name an additional representative to the Team. Also, where the Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office is not part of the investigation, the local Human Resources Manager will, upon completion of such investigation, forward to that activity a confidential copy of the file. Investigations of sexual harassment are to be conducted in as expeditious a manner as possible. During interviews conducted in conjunction with a sexual harassment complaint, only members of the Investigative k	Team and the interviewee will be present. If the interviewed
.	employee is a bargaining unit employee, he or she can have
|	a Union Representative present during the interview. As part
of the investigation, attempts will be made to obtain signed statements from all parties, including the complainant, accused, and witnesses where applicable. In cases where disciplinary action results, copies of all documentation and notes relied on as the basis for such action will be provided to the Union and Management Investigators, All individuals involved in the handling of sexual harassment complaints, from the original receipt of such complaint through the

entire investigative process are required, to the extent possible, to maintain confidentiality of any information obtained or prepared during the process. No copies of information obtained or prepared by the Investigative Team will be provided to any employee unless required by law to do so. Once the investigation has been concluded, the local Management, i.e., Human Resources Manager and facility operating head, shall review the facts with management team members and determine the appropriate action to be taken. The Union team member will have no role in this determination and will make no recommendations regarding disciplinary action. In cases, however, where the Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office participated on the Investigative Team, the investigation results will be reviewed for final disposition by designees from:
•	Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office
•	Operations Labor Relations Office
•	Union Affairs Office
Note: The Office of the General Counsel will upon request provide advice and counsel.
Actions taken in sexual harassment cases will be reported by the local Human Resources Manager to his or her respective Operations Labor Relations Office, as well as the Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office. Or in the case where Personnel Relations and Equal Employment Planning Office participated, final disposition shall be reported to the local Human Resources Manager by his or her Operations Labor Relations Office. In all cases, the complainant is to be advised when the case is “closed". Such actions shall be monitored to ensure closure to all allegations is accomplished and corporate wide consistency relative to actions taken is maintained. Any discipline assessed shall be handled in accordance with established principles of employee discipline. Appropriate discipline, up to and including discharge, may be imposed.
While the foregoing is an attempt to put in place guidelines which will allow the local facilities to investigate and dispose of the majority of sexual harassment complaints, it is recog

nized there may be circumstances that require investigations to be handled in an alternate manner. Regardless of the investigative process that is followed, the parties commit to ensure all complaints are taken seriously, that an objective and thorough investigation consistent with Company policies and applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements is conducted, and that fair and equitable action results. Furthermore, it is agreed that training in investigating sexual harassment complaints will be provided to appropriate union representatives, management personnel, and members of local investigation teams.
The Company bears the ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of laws and corporate policy which prohibits sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is something that cannot be tolerated by management or the Union, Accordingly, the Company and National Ford Department of the International Union, UAW are committed to ensuring investigations of sexual harassment are to be conducted in the spirit of determining the truth and subsequent sharing of all available pertinent information between the parties. The Union’s involvement in no way precludes it from grieving any resultant disciplinary action, since the assessment of such discipline would remain the sole discretion of Management.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Supplier Corporate Citizenship
During these negotiations, the UAW stated its interest in having the Company continue to recognize the importance of using suppliers which are good corporate citizens and which can be relied upon for quality products and reliable delivery. The UAW further pointed out that the Company’s selection of and relationship with suppliers have a significant bearing on its relationship with the Union. In this regard, the Union stressed repeatedly the importance of the Company's use of high-quality, reliable suppliers which maintain good, fair and equitable relations with their employees.
The Company fully understands the Union’s concerns in these matters, because quality products, uninterrupted delivery and good corporate citizenship — by the Company and its suppliers — contribute significantly to the Company's success in the marketplace, and all of these factors have a direct bearing on the job and income security of UAW members.
The Company agrees that its relationship with the Union is of paramount importance to the Company’s long-term success. The Company has told its suppliers and the business community in the past of the positive aspects of its relationship with the UAW and will continue to do so in the future. The Company therefore has no interest in embarking on a purchasing strategy that would detract from that relationship.
Correspondingly, the Union has, from time to time, expressed to the Company its concern about certain aspects of the Company’s relationship with particular suppliers in the area of quality, continuity of supply, and overall performance as a supplier including the maintenance of good relations by the supplier with its employees. The Union recognizes that
412
SUPPLIER CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP
the Company has expressed its views and made suggestions to its suppliers as a result of the Union’s concerns, ail within the bounds of applicable legal principles.
The parties recognize that instances in which these matters arise are inherently dependent upon the particular facts that ,	are present in each situation and plan to continue to deal
'	with these matters on a case-by-case basis as they have in
the past, and in compliance with applicable laws.
In particular, the Company will continue to urge its suppliers ►	to treat their employees in a good, fair and equitable manner,
to provide them wages and benefits competitive within their industry, to provide a safe workplace and to avoid conduct which violates national or state labor and employment laws, in addition, the Company will, in a manner which is in compliance with applicable laws, notify suppliers of the importance the Company places on harmonious relation-r	ships between suppliers, their employees and any union that
may represent them.
Ford will certainly not take retaliatory action, such as canceling or refusing to renew contracts with a supplier baaed on a decision of that supplier’s employees to join a labor union.
In addition, the Company will send each of its current suppliers two letters, in the form attached hereto (the “Letter") within 60 days after the effective date of the National Agreement. The Company will also send the Letter to any particular supplier identified by the Union, within 14 days, at the Union's request. The Company will also distribute the Letter, and communicate Ford’s position as reflected I	in the Letter, to its suppliers in manners to be mutually
I	agreed. The Company will also ensure that the Letter is
I	provided to each new supplier within 14 days after reaching

Form Letter to be Sent to Suppliers
This letter will set forth the views of Ford Motor Company with respect to unionization of employees of its suppliers. This letter is not meant to suggest or imply that Ford will not do business with a supplier unless the suppliers’ employees are represented by a union.
Ford Motor Company recognizes that it is in the mutual interest of employers and their employees for the employer to fully respect the right of employees to ►	seek representation by a union. The Company does not
in any sense reject collective bargaining for employees of our suppliers. We do not discourage employees of our suppliers from forming or joining unions to bargain collectively with their employer.
Ford Motor Company does not require, or encourage, our suppliers to resist organizing efforts by their employees to form or join labor unions.
Ford Motor Company has a positive and constructive relationship with the UAW as well as the other labor organizations that represent our employees. In our experience, it has also been very helpful to deal with efforts by our employees to form or join unions in a constructive and positive manner. We respect the UAW and the UAW respects us.
Ford Motor Company will certainly not take retaliatory action, such as canceling or refusing to renew contracts with suppliers, based on a decision of that supplier’s employees to join a labor union.
It may be appropriate for you to share this letter in its entirety with your employees so that they are accurately informed of Ford's position on this matter.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
This letter is pursuant to your inquiry regarding Ford Motor Company's policy on supplier selection.
The Company’s decision to select or remove a particular supplier is based on numerous criteria, applied in conformance with legal requirements. It is definitely not Ford Motor Company’s policy or practice to remove a product from a supplier because that supplier’s employees have chosen to join the UAW.
As you know, Ford has a positive and constructive relationship with the UAW, and we encourage our suppliers to strive for similarly constructive relationships with representatives of their employees.
Ford also notes that many of our suppliers have recognized the UAW based on a showing of majority support among the employees by means of a "card check" certified by a neutral third party. While use of such procedure is entirely up the individual supplier, Ford does not in any way discourage our suppliers from using such peacefill means of determining employee sentiment.
Should you have any questions with respect to this matter, please call

TOTAL COST MEASURABLES
October 9, 1999
Mr, Ron Gettelfinger
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Total Cost Measurable®
During the 1999 negotiations, the Union and Company discussed the continuing pilot activities in total cost measurement presently under way in some Vehicle Operations plants. As the parties refine these joint efforts, the Company will review the findings in consideration of a broader application. This was in response to the Union's concern that local Managements were relying primarily on work force reductions to reduce costs, without exploring other areas where cost reductions could be accomplished. These concerns mainly involved the car and truck assembly plants, but were said to be present at other Company locations as well.
In responding to the Union's concerns, the Company pointed out that continuous improvements in all aspects of the business, including work force productivity and cost reduction, are essential to meet competitive challenges in the auto industry. Together, the parties have recognized, through several negotiations and Agreements, that competitiveness and job security go hand in hand. In assembly and other labor intensive operations, the bulk of the opportunities relate to work force productivity and labor costs. This situation is true as well for Ford’s foreign and domestic competitors including the transplants. As they continuously improve labor productivity and other competitive factors, so must the Company. Therefore, to remain competitive, the Company must continue to explore all opportunities for potential total cost reduction measures.
417
TOTAL COST MEASURABLES
The Company has recognized the Union’s interests and concerns in this regard and has taken them into full account in the comprehensive job and income security provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The Company will continue to emphasize a total cost approach, in its cost reduction efforts. Plant cost objectives are based on achieving total cost objectives, including labor, overhead, inventory, raw and bulk material, freight, production material and spending related costs. In addition, the local parties are encouraged to review cost reduction measures affecting the hourly work force at their locations, and to consider appropriate suggestions concerning the implementation of such measures.

Subject: Apprentice Graduate Skilled Trades Seniority - Brownstown
During these negotiations, the parties discussed Apprentice Program administrative issues within the Ford Rouge Center. Specifically, the parties recognized the administrative complexity resulting from the multiple facilities and organizations within the Ford Rouge Center, including facilities physically located outside the Center but which participate in the Center’s apprentice training activities. Apprentice seniority was highlighted as a particularly complex issue.
Based on these discussions, the parties agreed that issues related to apprentices who graduate from the Apprentice Program within the Ford Rouge Center but originated from another unit, will be directed to the National Joint Apprenticeship Committee for resolution.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Apprentice Needs Forecasting Methodology Pilot
During 2003 negotiations, the parties jointly created an improved methodology to forecast apprentice in-denturements to align with business requirements, and agreed to pilot the methodology for a two (2) year period.
During the pilot, the parties will annually forecast skilled trades requirements for the next four (4) years, on a rolling basis. The Company intends, to the extent practical, to indenture apprentices to fill the forecasted apprentice needs. The parties agree to extend their best efforts to forecast accurately.
Following the pilot, the forecasting methodology will be evaluated jointly. If the Company has not followed the intent of the methodology by indenturing apprentices according to the forecasted need and existing business conditions, the Company agrees to indenture a number of apprentices equal to the difference between the forecasted number of apprentices for the first two years, and the actual number of apprentices indentured during the tem of the pilot, no later than the first half of the following year, business conditions permitting. If after evaluating the pilot, the parties determine the methodology is not effective as a forecasting tool and choose to discontinue the methodology, the Company agrees to indenture 1500 apprentices (inclusive of Visteon), less the number of

Vice President and Director	'
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Apprentice Program Quality and Administration
During these negotiations, the UAW brought to the Company's attention administrative issues which the Union believed should be addressed in order to improve further the operation of the Program and the quality of its graduates. These issues were: apprentices working alone, review of a major reduction-in-force of apprentices, availability of uniform related training, rotational apprentice assignments and plant subcommittee — management representatives.
Apprentices Working Alone
The Union raised the question of apprentices being assigned to work alone. The parties agreed that good judgment and a rule of reason should be used when making these assignments.
As a result of these discussions it was concluded that, consistent with existing training methods and facilities in the
441
APPRENTICE PROGRAM QUALITY AND ADMINISTRATION
plant, apprentices should not be assigned to perform work without a journeyman being present unless the apprentice has been trained to do the job, has been instructed in the proper safety procedures, and is considered competent to perform the assignment. Experienced journeymen will generally be available to assist the apprentice in many normal floor assignments until that level of competence has been reached. Problems in this regard are a matter for review by the Joint Apprenticeship Committee.
Unresolved issues concerning apprentices working alone may be referred by the Committee to the UAW National Ford Department and Employee Relations Staff.
Review of a Major Reduction-In-Force of Apprentices
The parties also discussed the meaning and intent of Article 11(h) providing authority to the Joint Apprenticeship Committee to review and approve in advance any facility plan to lay off all apprentices in a particular trade. In addition, the parties agreed that the Joint Apprenticeship Committee shall review in advance those facility reduction-in-force plans affecting a significant number of apprentices in a magnitude which could threaten the operation and continuity of the facility’s apprentice program. Joint Apprenticeship Committee concerns about such planned reductions should be brought to the attention of the Employee Relations Manager of the facility and the Local Union Chairperson.
Availability of Uniform Related 'Draining
The Union discussed the inability of some provider schools to deliver advanced training courses in a convenient, timely, and uniform manner and noted that some courses are not always available because apprentice enrollments are less than the minimum class size required by the provider schools.
The parties shall request the Joint Apprenticeship Committee to consider one or more of the following approaches to assist in minimizing the lack of uniformity in related instruction:	.
• Coordinate planned' attendance and scheduling of related training courses in multi-plant areas to enlarge the number of apprentices attending at the local provider school.
f

• Consult with education providers to possibly alter certain required instruction courses on a pilot basis using ,	more generic course content and permitting a larger
1	number of apprentices or other employees to enroll.
>	• Take the necessary actions to provide such courses,
'	where appropriate and feasible, in-plant or at a selected

;	• Replace providers where necessary and feasible.
•	Investigate with providers their ability and willingness to '	deliver course content via high technology education
methods, while assuring mastery of material.
•	Work with other companies to supply sufficient students to meet class size minimums.
To meet special circumstances, the Joint Apprenticeship .	Committee may approve the offering of related training
courses during normal working hours subject to the concurrence of local management and union at those facilities. Courses conducted during normal working hours are not eligible for a training incentive.
'	Rotational Apprentice Assignments
,	The Union complained that apprentices at some plants,
particularly plants operated under an area management ■	organizational structure, encounter difficulties in obtaining
appropriate rotational movements in a timely manner.
As a result, the Company has committed to review these ,	complaints with operating management and request that
corrective measures be taken as appropriate. The Company’s policy in this matter is to provide meaningful rotational shop assignments in a timely manner so that the apprentice’s ’	development can result in a best-in-class journeyman to
support the success and viability of the operations served.
Plant Subcommittee - Management Representatives
'	The Union also expressed concern that in some instances
the management members of the Plant Subcommittee of the Joint Apprenticeship Committee do not possess sufficient skilled trades knowledge or experience to adequately dis-Icuss apprentice training concerns.
The Company advised the Union that at those facilities where the management member does not have skilled trades experience, Plant Employee Relations Managers will be
443

advised of the desirability of providing such a resource. Problems in this regard may be brought to the attention of the Plant Employee Relations Manager by the local Union for review and correction, as necessary.

Mr. Gerald D. Bantom

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Apprentice Selection Procedure — Source of Candidates
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the apprentice selection procedure regarding the source of apprentice candidates. It was agreed that beginning January 2,1991, the Joint Apprenticeship Committee (JAC) will implement the practices outlined below:
446
APPRENTICE SELECTION PROCEDURE —
SOURCE OF CANDIDATES
• A plant which receives JAC approval to conduct testing will accept applications from the following candidate sources: - Candidates for List A
•	Employees of the facility. (Employees presently on eligibility Lists will be assigned to List A and will continue to be offered apprenticeship opportunities based on their eligibility position.)
•	Employees of a facility which the JAC has approved for common testing as a standard prac-
•	tice,
~ Candidates for List B
•	Employees of other plants within an area if the testing will be in (1) Michigan area or (2) Cleveland/Lorain, Ohio area.
« The total number of candidates to be considered in developing or supplementing an eligibility list will be the forecasted two-year supply for the subject facility.
•	Candidates who qualify and fill available openings on List A will have first priority for placement on the program, followed by candidates who qualify and fill available openings on List B.
•	In the event of an excess of applications for List B openings, the JAC may implement an applicant lottery as appropriate. Specially recruited minority or female candidates will be incremental to List B.
•	Employees from another facility applying for openings on List B will be governed by the following criteria:
-	They may, on a one-time basis, request placement on the eligibility list of one facility other than their own in their respective area.
-	They must test at the facility where they are seeking an eligibility list opening at the time that facility is conducting apprentice selection testing.
-	They will compete for openings on List B on the same basis as external candidates.
-	If they turn down an opportunity to go on course in a trade preference they selected, they will be removed from that facility’s eligibility list.
-	In instances where several applicants from the same facility are to be released to fill apprentice openings
447
APPRENTICE SELECTION PROCEDURE —
SOURCE OF CANDIDATES
in other Company facilities, the release of these applicants should occur in a manner that minimizes disruption to the operation of the applicant’s department.
- Apprentice seniority is governed by Article 15 of the Apprenticeship Standards.
The JAC will monitor the operation of these procedures and will report periodically to the UAW National Ford Department and U.S. Union Relations Staff on that operation. The parties will examine the reported experience to determine whether revisions are required to achieve the objectives of obtaining well-qualified candidates, competitive parity, and continued fulfillment of the parties’ commitment to equal employment opportunity and affirmative action.
Provisions of this letter may be suspended by mutual agreement of the UAW, National Ford Department and the Company’s Labor Affairs Office for the duration of applicable Pilot Programs.

Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr, Yokich:
Subject: Apprentice Utilization and Journeyman Status
During the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern about the number of apprentices in training and the qualifications of journeymen hired to fill certain apprenticeable trade requirements.
While depressed busmess conditions in recent years have resulted in substantial reductions in the number of apprentices on course, the Company continues to recognize the apprenticeship program as an important source of journeymen, among other measures to maintain an adequate and qualified skilled work force. In this regard, the Company intends to continue to maintain an active and viable apprenticeship program, consistent with local employment needs, and provided that facilities and opportunities for appropriate training are sufficient to support the program.
The apprenticeship program, however, cannot be the only source utilized to meet the Company’s journeyman requirements in the apprenticeabie ■ trades. Some locations have insufficient requirements or facilities to support the program; situations frequently arise where training projections cannot fully anticipate fluctuations or shifts in needs; and other unforeseen or unusual conditions can occur. Therefore, the Company must retain the necessary flexibility to fill its needs through an appropriate balance of apprentice training (with realistic apprentices to journeymen ratios), the hiring of journeymen and the transfer or promotion of plant employees consistent with the parties' local agreements.
450
APPRENTICE UTILIZATION AND JOURNEYMAN STATUS
With respect to hiring on the apprenticeable trades, it is the Company’s policy that, as practical, applicants before being hired as journeymen generally must satisfy one of the following criteria:
•	completion of a bona fide apprenticeship program with standards equivalent to the Ford-UAW Apprenticeship Standards, or
•	eight (8) years of experience in the trade, or
•	experience and training equivalent to that required in a bona fide apprenticeship program as set forth above.
In applying this policy, it is understood that the Company must maintain appropriate flexibility to be able to meet its skilled work force requirements in those unusual situations where applicants who fully meet the criteria are unavailable. Local agreements having a journeymen definition, of course, remain in effect and apply to skilled trades classifications at particular units as locally negotiated; however, it is understood such local agreements shall not provide for journeyman experience requirements of more than eight years.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Modification to Apprentice Selection Procedure
During the 1999 negotiations, the parties discussed the procedure used to select candidates for the Apprentice Program. Subsequently, the Company implemented a modified apprentice selection procedure on a pilot basis during the term of the 1999 agreement. Specifically, the modification affected the process by which Apprentice Program applicants who took the Apprentice Training Selection System (ATSS) test battery were selected for placement on a facility’s Apprenticeship Eligibility List.
454
MODIFICATION TO APPRENTICE SELECTION PROCEDURE
The modification to the selection procedure is as follows;
« Applicants who achieve test results at or above the qualifying level will be considered “assessment-qualified”. Applicants whose test results are below the qualifying level will not be considered “assessment-qualified”.
•	Assessment-qualified applicants will be ranked according to their Company Service Date, longest service to shortest service. Where ties in Company Service Date occur (i.e., two or more applicants with the same Company Service Date), such ties will.be broken by ranking the tied applicants by the last four digits of their Social Security Number, in highest to lowest order (i.e., 9999 is highest; 0000 is lowest).
•	Candidates will be selected for addition to the facility’s Apprenticeship Eligibility List based on their abovedetermined ranking. As has been the standard practice, the number of candidates to be added to a facility’s Apprenticeship Eligibility List will be based on that facility’s forecasted two-year apprenticeship requirements.	.
« Applicants who, based on their test results, are not assessment-qualified will be provided feedback on their assessment results. The purpose of this feedback is to provide the applicants insight into skill areas in which improvement may be needed if they wish to pursue future apprenticeship opportunities. Feedback will not be provided to assessment-qualified applicants, whether or not they are selected for addition to the facility’s Apprenticeship Eligibility List.
•	Applicants who are not selected for placement on the facility’s Apprenticeship Eligibility List (whether or not they are assessment-qualified) will be required to re-take the test battery if they wish to pursue future apprenticeship opportunities.
455
MODIFICATION TO APPRENTICE SELECTION PROCEDURE
Effective with the 2003 agreement the Company will adopt the above procedure for apprentice selection. Any changes to this procedure will be reviewed in advance with the Union.

Dear Mr. Lofton:	•
Subject: Placement on Apprentice Eligibility Lists Following Transfer
During 1990 negotiations, the parties discussed certain administrative practices of the Joint Apprenticeship Committee (JAC) concerning situations in which the JAC has approved an employee’s request to transfer from the apprenticeship eligibility list of one seniority unit to another. (The employee’s transfer between seniority units must be in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement between Ford Motor Company and the Union including Memoranda of Understanding and/or Article 15(g) and (h) of the Apprenticeship Standards.)
456
PLACEMENT ON APPRENTICE ELIGIBILITY
LISTS FOLLOWING TRANSFER
•	If the employee's present facility has tested apprentice applicants since the transferred employee was tested, then the employee’s name is to be placed on the apprentice eligibility list of the employee’s present facility following the name of the last applicant on that facility’s eligibility list.
•	If the employee’s present facility has not tested apprentice applicants since the transferred employee was tested, then the employee’s name is to be placed on the apprentice eligibility list of the employee’s present facility but only after that facility conducts the next apprentice selection testing session. At that time, the employee's name shall be placed on the list following the name of the last applicant placed on that list as a result of this latest testing. Alternatively, the employee may elect to retake the selection test battery with the latest testtaking group and be placed on the eligibility list of the employee’s present facility on the basis of results from that retesting. If one or more of the employee's previous trade preferences are not available at the present facility, the employee may be given three trade preferences applicable to the present facility.
Also covered by the above practices are-.
•	Employees who were apprentices at their previous facility and who were subject to a reduction-in-force in their previous apprentice classifications.
•	Employees who are apprentices at'their present facility and who elect to “return home” under provisions of Appendix 0, Memorandum of Understanding, Return to Basic Unit.
The JAC will determine the trade or trades for which the employee is eligible at the employee’s present facility, examining such factors as forecasted trade requirements and availability of JAC-approved apprenticeship in those trades at that facility. If the previous trade in which the apprentice was indentured is not available at the present facility, the apprentice may be given three trade preferences.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Appendix F (Skilled Trades) Licenses
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed the cost burden on certain employees in Appendix F (Skilled Trades) classifications of renewing governmentally required licenses. In addition, the parties discussed how the Company’s UAW-represented joumeypersons and apprentices could obtain the appropriate certifications and/or licenses required by state and local governments for work customarily performed at Ford facilities.
The Company agreed to continue the present practice of reimbursing such employees for the payment of renewal fees for licenses required by federal, state or local ordinances in order to perform their specific jobs. Further,- it is understood that, except in eases of graduating apprentices, >the Company will not reimburse the cost of initial licenses required as a condition of employment or to qualify for a promotional opportunity. In the case of graduating apprentices, the Company will reimburse the cost of licenses required for the initial • journeymen/women classification into which they are placed. Additionally, during the term of this Agreement, in those situations wherein a new federal, state or local ordinance is introduced which requires certain employees in Appendix F (Skilled Trades) classifications to become certified or recertified to continue performing work which those employees have normally and historically performed, the parties will meet to discuss and resolve issues associated with the procurement and renewal of such licenses.
More specifically, regarding the appropriate licensing required of the Company’s UAW-represented joumeypersons and apprentices to perform work in their trade within the Company, the parties agreed to pursue the following:

Dear Mr. Bannon:
Subject: Clarification of Breakdown, Exhibit II Skilled Trades Supplement Agreement
During our meeting of October 26, 1964, you commented on the misunderstanding which exists among some Union representatives and skilled tradesmen concerning the meaning or intent of the first paragraph of the Section entitled ’Emergencies' in Exhibit II of the Skilled Trades Supplemental Agreement. We feel that this misunderstanding is best resolved by means of this letter of clarification.
463
CLARIFICATION OF BREAKDOWN, EXHIBIT fl SKILLED TRADES SUPPLEMENT AGREEMENT
This is to advise you that the Company interprets the word “breakdowns" as it is used in the paragraph cited above to mean emergency or unforeseen breakdowns, not all breakdowns. Your attention is also directed to the language later in the same paragraph providing that in such cases “trade lines are not to be disregarded where the time within which the repairs are to be made and the availability of the appropriate tradesmen permit their observance.”
We trust that this letter of clarification will resolve such misunderstandings as may exist.

Vice President and Director ’ • UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Competitive Skilled Trades Work Practices
During these negotiations, the parties discussed in .	considerable detail the important role of the skilled
I	trades in the Company’s competitive position with
I	respect to safety, quality, productivity, morale and
cost. The manner in which the skilled trades are utilized substantially affects the day-to-day success of our manufacturing, assembly and maintenance activities.	'
In our highly competitive, global industry, it is essential to improve our product quality and operational efficiency, if the Company is to provide the long-term job security that all our employees value. For the Company to improve its competitive position, the parties must facilitate a more efficient use of the skilled trades.	.
The parties have long recognized the Company’s assignment policy for skilled tradespersons in conformity with the principles set forth by the Ford-UAW Umpires in Opinions in A-223, A-278, and B-14 and other umpire memoranda. However, it is also recognized that several of our plants’ skilled trades work practices are not at competitive levels.
This letter serves to revitalize the agreements from past negotiations pertaining to skilled trades work practices, and Birther defines expectations of the local parties and requires the following actions:
• Within 90 days of the Effective Date of this Agreement, a letter, co-signed by the appropriate operating executive, U.S. Union Affairs and National Ford Department, will be issued requiring local Manage
465
COMPETITIVE SKILLED TRADES WORK PRACTICES
ment and local Unions to review existing work rules and practices. The intent of the review will be to reinforce the existing language in the Skilled Trades Supplemental Agreement, Exhibit II,' on incidental work and overlapping capabilities.
It is imperative that skilled trades employees utilize the skills that are germane to their trade.
• The results of the review will be submitted, by March 1, 2004, to the Company’s U.S. Union Affairs Office and to the UAW-National Ford Department for review and approval. Work practice revisions must be consistent with the principle, that our workforce works safely within and up to its capabilities, while becoming more flexible, efficient and ’ participative in all business operations.
Both the Union and Company recognize that they have a key role in .the effort to modify skilled trade work assignments. As such, the local parties will facilitate support for these actions through a comprehensive communication plan. '
It is recognized these actions are essential to improve our competitiveness. Therefore^ the National parties agree to co-lead the implementation of this initiative, and will provide ongoing support to the local parties during the implementation of this process. It is further understood that these efforts will be ongoing, with a focus on maximizing effectiveness and improving overall efficiency.

UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214	'	.
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger;
Subject; Enhanced Skilled Trades Training
During these negotiations, the parties had extensive discussions regarding training for skilled trades employees. It was mutually recognized that while a number of Company locations independently have undertaken (and should be encouraged to continue] significant efforts in this area, it also would be advantageous to centrally develop and deliver certain types of skilled trades training to joumeymen/women throughout the Company through multi-media or other appropriate delivery systems. It also was mutually recognized that joumeymen/women’s active participation in such training would maintain, increase, and broaden their technical skills while enhancing product quality and plant operational effectiveness, thus resulting in greater job security for the skilled trades workforce.
Given these considerations, the parties agreed to form a joint task force at a national level to develop recommendations for development and implementation of a skilled trades training program. Although the focus of the program would be on specific technical skills, subject matter could include other topics (e.g., team problem solving, best practices skill set study) as appropriate.	’
It is envisioned that a dedicated central facility would be the optimal setting for training delivery. The Huron Technical Training Center is one site that would be considered for this purpose; other training venues could include local community colleges or another Company facility. While Company funds would be committed to support the program! it may be I	appropriate, in some instances, to seek’ funds available
through the UAW-Ford Technical Skills Program. Additionally, the parties may seek to utilize the resources established for apprentice training and development (i.e., course mate

rials, course instructors, and instructional systems design and administrative personnel) in the interest of implementing the program efficiently.
The joint task force will review its recommendations for developing and implementing a skilled trades training program with the UAW National Ford Department and the Company’s Labor Affairs Office no later than six months following ratification of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. Upon approval of a basic skilled trades training plan,the joint task force or, by mutual agreement, a successor task force will assume responsibility for the actual development, implementation, and ongoing administration of the program.

Subject: Job Security — Apprentice Development and Joumeymen/women Retraining
During these negotiations, the Union and the Company acknowledged that skilled trades personnel provide vital maintenance and construction support to operations, and that there is a direct relationship between the effectiveness of skilled trades personnel and the success and viability of the operations they serve. Establishing new levels of competence within the apprenticeable trades through training, retraining and assessment of apprentices will permit the Union and the Company to pursue the critical objective of continuous improvement in quality, flexibility and operational effectiveness and, in turn, enhance job security.
474
JOB SECURITY — APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT
AND JOURNEYMEWWOMEN RETRAINING
Program Size	■
Consistent with these discussions and the October 14, 1984 Apprentice Utilization and Journeyman Status Letter of Understanding and in response to present skilled trades demographics, potential future retirements, and attrition, the Company commits to retaining a viable apprentice program. It is recognized, however, that the current depressed business conditions, increasing competitive pressures, and the future business outlook will continue to have a substantial impact on the number of apprentices required to be placed on course. Nevertheless, the Company recognizes the Apprentice Program as an important source of qualified journeymen/ women. Both parties recognized that an active, viable Apprentice Program must align with the business requirements. As such, during these negotiations, the parties developed and agreed to pilot an apprentice needs forecasting methodology and further agreed to an annual review to align apprentice needs with business requirements. As soon as practicable following the ratification of the Agreement, specific details and guidelines regarding the apprentice needs forecasting methodology will be published in an administrative letter and distributed to ail Company facilities. Titis letter will be consigned by Union and Company NJAC Representatives and will be endorsed by appropriate operating executives.
In an attempt to ensure that an appropriate number of apprentices are placed on course when and where required, the pilot forecasting process will be utilized by local parties, with input from the local JAC, to project future skilled trades needs, and recommend the number and timing of apprentice indenturements to meet such needs. This pilot forecasting process will include factors such as:	.
• historical and anticipated skilled trades attrition a projected graduations of apprentices
« apprentice vacancies • skilled trades hires
* operational requirements, business plan considerations, and Implications of new technology
475
JOB SECURITY — APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT
AND JOURNEYMEN/WOMEN RETRAINING
Following these negotiations, and annually in each remaining year of the Agreement, a letter will be co-signed by the NJAC and an appropriate Operating Executive, and issued to each Ford facility with an Apprentice Program, directing that the above forecast be completed and submitted to the NJAC and the Company’s U.S, Union Affairs Office. This communication will include details regarding information to be included in the forecast and timing for its submission. The U.S. Union Affairs Office, in conjunction with the NJAC will review, compile, and provide concurrence that the pilot methodology used to complete each facility’s forecast was appropriately applied. The parties will jointly forward a recommendation to the appropriate Operating Executive regarding the number of apprentices required. ,
Apprentices will be added in accordance with the annual recommendation, subject to the approval of the Operating Executive, provided that qualified candidates can be found who meet all the selection criteria. An effort will be made to manage the flow of accessions to facilitate the orderly scheduling of core skills training for new apprentices.1 It is understood that while the existing work force will be a major source of future apprentices, this will not limit the NJAC from making adjustments based on mutually agreed upon business conditions.
It is also understood that in cases where there is an immediate need for joumeymen/women skills at a particular location, it may be necessary to add joumeymen/women in place of apprentices agreed upon in this letter. In this regard, provisions of Appendix N, Memorandum of Understanding on Preferential Placement Arrangements and Appendix M, Memorandum of Understanding, Job Security Program -GEN will be considered as required.
The National Joint Apprenticeship Committee will monitor the indenturement of apprentices and will review this information with the U.S. Union Affairs office and the National Ford Department on a regular basis.

Enhanced Apprenticeship Training
The fallowing enhancements to apprenticeship training will be undertaken:
•	Continue to explore means to deliver more uniform related instruction to ail locations having an apprentice program, based on analysis of needs, available materials and technology including various forms of distance learning,
•	Continue to improve and expand the core skills training for new apprentices (e. g., FTPM concepts) and in-course progress assessment for participants mid-way through the program. The core skills training may be conducted at the Huron Technical Thaining Center or at a vendor’s facility selected by the National Joint Apprenticeship Committee (NJAC). Generally, apprentices selected for the in-course assessment should have worked not less than 3,000 nor more than 5,000 shop hours. Appropriate remedial action plans, based on assessment outcomes, will be developed for the individual apprentices included in this assessment. The results of such , assessments shall be considered but shall not be the sole determinant of continuance on course.
•	Advance the highly successful Troubleshooting Strategies course, originally developed for the Elec' trical Apprenticeship, to other apprenticeships such as Tool and Die, Machine Repair, and PlumberPipefitter. Apprentices should complete this course between 2,000 and 3,000 hours.
•	Continue as a standard element of the Apprentice Program the basic training to introduce apprentices in the metal trades to the principles used in computer-controlled equipment and devices associated with job performance involving operating coordinate measuring machines (CMM), related computer-aided design (CAD) equipment, and computer operating systems. This training would include classroom as well as “hands-on” lab exercises.
This introduction to CMM provides apprentices with a basic understanding of the work involved and assists them in determining whether they should
477
JOB SECURITY — APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT
AND JOURNEYMEN/WOMEN RETRAINING
pursue a career leading to Inspector - Tooling and Layout. Apprentices pursuing such a career would be offered an opportunity to enroll in supplemental training in CMM and related subjects being offered to employees classified as Inspector - Tooling and Layout.
•	Continue, as appropriate, to benchmark exemplary apprentice programs to further continuous improvement in all aspects of the Apprentice Program.
•	identify (a) the various types of welding applications that require certification, (b) local, state, and/or federal certification examination requirements, and (c) the welding equipment necessary to conduct such examinations.
Continue a welder certification process for identified applications after review by the National Joint Apprenticeship Committee with the UAW, National Ford Department and the Company’s Labor Affairs Office.
•	Review and revise apprentice curricula, as necessary, to ensure that apprentices receive training and instruction in reducing repair time and methodology for increasing time between machine failures, in accordance with FTPM principles.
•	Review and, as necessary, revise apprentice curricula to ensure that training reflects current and anticipated technology.
Task Analysis and Performance Assessment
The Union and the Company acknowledged that the present Apprentice Progrant can be improved by standardization of training delivery and periodic assessment of apprentice performance to ensure skill development. The parties agreed to jointly develop a task-and-performance-based apprentice program. Consistent with this objective, the following steps will be undertaken:
•	Continue to conduct task analyses of the apprenticeable trades (a minimum of two per year) to ensure that shop area learning and performance objectives can be expanded to ail locations having an apprentice program.
478
JOB SECURITY — APPRENTICE DEVELOPMENT
AND JOURNEYMEN/WOMEN RETRAINING
•	Continue development of periodic performance assessment guidelines which can be implemented at the apprentice's workplace to measure performance on basic trade, tasks.
•	Continue development of a graduation requirement and assessment to verify delivery of appropriate shop training and related instruction, and to ensure the successful job performance of apprentice program graduates.
Expenses
All non-wage related expenses incurred as a result of the above described Enhanced Apprenticeship Training, and Basic Training for Apprentices on Principles of Coordinate Measuring, including the expenses for design, delivery, necessary equipment, supplies, facilities, faculty, administration, ongoing evaluation, and non-local student travel, where necessary, and for wages of the trainees would be charged to the National Education, Development and Training Program fund.
The Joint Apprenticeship Committee shall oversee the initiatives described above and shall periodically review the results, including evaluations by mutually selected outside parties, with the Joint Governing Body and appropriate representatives of the UAW’s National Ford Department and the Company’s Labor Affairs Office.	'
Joumeymen/women Retraining	•
Further, where changes in the type of operation, volume, product life cycle, or other reasons have caused an excess number of joumeymen/women in a particular skilled trade and placement in their trade is not possible, the parties will continue to explore and support, where feasible and practical, the retraining of journeymenAvomen to qualify them in another skilled trade. Such retraining could be done within or outside the Apprentice Program, When in-zone or other transfer opportunities in the trade have been exhausted, the NJAC shall have the authority, where the Company and Union agree, to direct such retraining where indefinite placement in job security program’s protected status (GEN) or layoff is the alternative for the individual. Employees who refuse such retraining placement opportunities shall be

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Local Skilled Trades Work Assignment Guides
This letter will serve to consolidate and confirm the understandings contained in letters of understandings agreed to by the parties in previous negotiations with regard to the development of local skilled trades work assignment guides pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 7 of the Skilled Trades Supplemental Agreement.
During previous negotiations, the Union has insisted that disputes over skilled trades work assignments frequently result from lack of knowledge concerning local work assignment practices on the part of newly hired or transferred journeymen or supervisors. The Union urged that many such disputes could be prevented or quickly resolved if local work assignment practices were defined and agreed upon by the parties.	.
As you are aware, the Company holds a deep conviction regarding the necessity to retain current work assignment flexibility in order to assure the most efficient utilization of
480
LOCAL SKILLED TRADES WORK ASSIGNMENT GUIDES
skilled manpower. On numerous occasions the Company has . expressed its concern that local negotiations in this area would likely result in featherbedding, or result in increased claims for back pay or attempts to Limit the Company’s flexibility particularly with respect to incidental and overlapping work assignments.	-
Based upon unequivocal assurances from the Union that these are not the objectives of the Union nor would attempts to achieve these harmful results be sanctioned, the Company-agreed to amend the Skilled Tirades Supplemental Agreement to permit local parties to develop skilled work assignment guides for the apprenticeable trades pursuant to Paragraph 7 of the Skilled Trades Supplemental Agreement. The parties also have discussed the feasibility of applying the procedures of Paragraph 7, Development of Local Skilled Trades Work Assignment Guides, of the Skilled Trades Supplemental Agreement to nonapprenticeable skilled trades (Appendix F) classifications. This will confirm the parties’ agreement to extend the provisions of the aforementioned Paragraph 7 to nonapprenticeable skilled trades classifications in Appendix F excluding various machining classifications related to the tool and die trade, various inspection classifications and certain other classifications which are not commonly recognized as skilled trades.
With respect to the Rouge Area, because of its multi-unit complexity and the proliferation of Appendix F classifications, it was recognized that further study of the subject would be required; Accordingly, appropriate Company and Union representatives wifi study the feasibility of developing such guides for nonapprenticeable skilled classifications excepting those for which guides are inappropriate as described above.

During 1993 negotiations the potential for effectively utilizing skilled trades employees assigned to Protected employee status for plant project work was discussed. The focus of the discussions was primarily on full utilization of the skilled trades workforce with emphasis on those locations with large numbers of skilled Protected employees.
The parties agreed that in those locations in which large numbers of Protected skilled trades employees exist, the local parties can discuss the possibility of using these employees for project work as well as other non-traditional work, it is understood that such project work would have to be cost effective, and that work assignments on such projects would be performed in the spirit of the parties' understanding on skilled trades classifications.
This consideration may also be extended to the existing skilled trades workforce should suitable opportunities arise.

Dear Mr. Lofton: '
Subject: Skilled Trades Classifications
During these National Negotiations, the parties discussed at length the necessity for the Company to become competitive in all aspects of the business. Among the issues discussed were the existing skilled trades classification structure, work rules, and past practices.	,
With regard to the skilled trades classification structure, the Union expressed concern over basic skilled trades classifications being consolidated. In this regard, the Company observed that it will not dictate consolidation of specific skilled trades classifications to its plants. Competitive advantages of a review of skilled trades classifications at any Company facility must be weighed and determined by the local parties in view of all attendant circumstances at that location.
With regard to work rules and past practices, the Company stated that many plants feel hampered in their efforts to enhance competitiveness in today’s environment by historically restrictive practices which originated at a time when competition was less • threatening. Given recent improvements in the area of job security, the need for such stringent work rules and delineation of job responsibilities has been reduced.
Therefore, the National parties concur that local Management and local Unions should review existing work rules and practices, especially in the area of Lines of Demarcation, to insure that only those necessary to protect the safety of employees, the integrity of the basic trades, and the efficiency of operation in today’s competitive environment are carried forward. Incidental, overlapping, and other minor access type work should be discussed and handled locally consistent with sound business judgment.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Skilled Trades Diversity
During these negotiations, the parties discussed many aspects of the Apprentice Program, including diversity issues. It is recognized that the Apprentice Diversity Initiative developed and undertaken by the National Joint Apprenticeship Committee (NJAC) following the 1999 negotiations has aided in increasing representation of minorities and women among employees applying and qualifying for placement on the Apprenticeship program. The parties agree that the Apprentice Diversity Initiative should be continued, and to maximize effectiveness, it should become institutionalized at the local level. As such, the administration of the Initiative should become a core responsibility of facility’s local JAC, with support, upon request, of other local

entities that have related missions and purposes. The NJAC win assist in effecting this transition on a timely basis*
The parties recognize the desirability of considering additional methods and strategies which could better prepare individuals who may want to enter the skilled trades as a profession. Further, it was agreed that outreach efforts must be proactive to inform, educate, and encourage potential minority and women candidates to consider skilled trades work as a career option.
The National Joint Apprenticeship Committee has agreed to continue to recommend new approaches to attract, prepare, and obtain a more diverse pool of qualified candidates for future skilled trades opportunities.

This letter will serve to consolidate and confirm the understandings contained in letters of understandings agreed to by the parties in previous negotiations with regard to skilled trades employees' tools.
• Conversion to Metric System
439
SKILLED TRADES EMPLOYEES' TOOLS
The parties have discussed the subject of conversion to the metric system and its effect on certain employee-owned tools. The Company indicated its intention to make available during the transition period metric toois and calibrated measuring instruments to skilled trades employees when required in the performance of their work. Such toois will be available in a manner determined by local management and charged out to skilled trades employees when they have need for them.
This policy does not preclude the use of conversion tables or any other alternate means of changing to the metric system in place of utilizing such tools or calibrated measuring instruments, nor does it alter the present requirement that skilled trades employees provide their own tools necessary to perform their duties, except as provided in the preceding paragraph.
• Replacement of Broken or Damaged Tbols
The parties also have discussed replacing personal tools of skilled trades employees broken or damaged on Company premises. The Union was advised that the Company will accept and review claims for broken or damaged tools that are no longer usable. Where it is determined that personal tools were broken or damaged on Company premises due to conditions beyond the employee’s control such tools will be repaired or replaced, provided there is no evidence of employee negligence, abuse or improper usage. It is understood that this arrangement will be over and above any locally

TECHNICAL SKILLS TRAINING FOR INSPECTOR — TOOLING AND LAYOUT
September 15, 1993
Mr. Ernest Lofton
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Technical Skills Training for Inspector — Tooling and Layout
During 1993 negotiations, the parties discussed the effects of changing technology on the regular work assignments of employees classified as Inspector - Tooling and Layout, and Inspector - Tooling and Layout - New, as well as the findings of a study (commissioned as a result of 1990 negotiations) on whether a separate apprenticeship was appropriate for the Inspector - Tooling and Layout.
The parties agreed on the following points: (1) within the Inspector - Tooling and Layout classification, there is a need for additional training on skills required to use numerically controlled dimensional quality equipment and other metrology hardware; (2) apprentices in the metal trades should receive an introduction to the basics of technical training provided to Inspector - Tooling and Layout journeymen; (3) the core skills of the metal trades provide the fundamentals for Inspector - Tooling and Layout; (4) journeymen or apprentices who seek to qualify for Inspector - Tooling and Layout should have a basic trade; and (5) consideration should be given to phasing out use of the Inspector - Tooling and Layout - New.
Accordingly, the parties agreed to pilot a training program for employees classified Inspector - Tooling and Layout, and Inspector - Tooling and Layout - New, in concert with suppliers of such technology and training, to enhance the employees' abilities to perform their regular duties in an increasingly automated manufacturing environment. Such employees will be trained in using numerically controlled dimensional quality equipment and other metrology hardware that may replace measuring devices and methods presently in use.
494
TECHNICAL SKILLS TRAINING FOR INSPECTOR —
TOOLING AND LAYOUT
The pilot program would include classroom as well as lab training designed to provide “hands-on” operating and graphical programming skills. The training would occur in one-week intervals over an approximate two-year period; such scheduling would provide participants with the opportunity to reinforce the classroom and lab training with on-the-job experience. The training may be modified based on results of the pilot program.
With respect to apprentices, the letter of understanding on Job Security — Apprentice Development and Journeymen Retraining dated September 15,1993, describes, under Basic Training for Apprentices on Principles of Coordinate Measuring Technology, a pilot training program for apprentices that will be undertaken.
Apprentice candidates who elect a metal trades apprenticeship may designate a preference for training experiences which would qualify them as candidates for Inspector -Tooling and Layout opportunities. These experiences would include available related, shop and supplemental training. This designation of preference is to be made at the time of trade selection or within the first 3,000 shop hours.
Consistent with this effort to enhance the skills of Inspector - Tooling and Layout, as of October 4, 1993, the parties agreed to phase out the Inspector - Tooling and Layout - New classification as present incumbents complete the eight-year experience requirement. Accordingly, future openings for Inspector - Tooling and Layout classification will be filled with journeymen and apprentice graduates principally from the metals trades and based on availability.
Following the 1993 negotiations, the parties will identify method (s) of training and certifying journeymen and/or apprentice graduates as qualified for Inspector - Tooling and Layout while allowing the individual to attain/retain seniority in a basic trade, e.g., Toolmaking, Diemaking.

Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214	.
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Integration of SSDIB and Retirement Plan
This is to confirm our understanding regarding the interrelationship between eligibility for and amount of temporary benefits or supplemental allowance under the Retirement Plan and Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (SSDIB).
When a retiree is awarded SSDIB, a portion of that award generally consists of a lump sum payment attributable to a period before the effective date of the award. The effect of eligibility for SSDIB is to disqualify the employee for a temporary benefit under Article V, Section 2 or 3 of the Retirement Plan, to reduce the early retirement supplement and to eliminate the interim supplement under Article VI. In the case of receipt of a part of SSDIB as a lump sum for an earlier period by a retired employee who has been receiving a temporary benefit, early retirement supplement or interim supplement, an overpayment obligation also accrues under the Plan.
When an initial claim for SSDIB is denied and the employee engages the services of an attorney to appeal such denial, if on or after October 5, 1987 the appeal of the attorney is successful and a portion of the lump sum payment not to exceed 25% is awarded to the attorney, the retired employee’s repayment obligation will be satisfied if he notifies the Plan within 30 days of the receipt of a retroactive SSDIB award and repays to the Plan within 30 days after notice from the Board of Administration an amount equal to the overpayment of any temporary benefit, early retirement supplement or interim supplement less in such case the amount of attorney fees involved on that portion of the award. This reduction applies only to attorney fees associated with a successful appeal of an initial denial by Social

Security for SSDIB and includes only that portion of the attorney fees associated with the period of time the employee received a temporary benefit or a supplement. Such attorney fees considered for this purpose may not exceed the lesser of $5,000 or 25 percent of the overpayment due to the Plan. Attorney fees for services prior to denial of initial application .for SSDIB will not reduce the amount of an overpayment due to the Plan.

This will confirm the understanding we reached with you in the negotiations leading to the new Retirement Plan agreement between Ford Motor Company and the Union with respect to certain investments that might be made with a portion of the contributions to the pension fund.
It was agreed that, upon and subject to the terms set forth in this letter, a portion of the Company’s annual contribution to the pension fund maintained under the Retirement Plan agreement for each year this letter remains in effect, not exceeding five percent (5% J of the amount of such contribution that is available for investment after deducting the
505
INVESTMENT OF PENSION FUND
portion of the benefits payable under the Retirement Plan for such year which is in excess of the investment income (including dividends and interest, but excluding both realized and unrealized capital gains) earned by the pension fund may be invested in (1) residential mortgages in communities where there are substantial numbers of UAW members and (2) debt obligations of nonprofit nursing homes, nursery schools, federally-qualified health maintenance organizations, hospitals or similar nonprofit institutions in communities where there are substantial numbers of UAW members. Solely for purposes of this paragraph, the Company’s annual contribution to the pension fund shall be the amount determined by the independent actuary under Section 5(a)(1) of the Agreement Concerning Retirement Plan.
The residential mortgages will be available for and it is intended primarily will consist of mortgages on single and multiple family dwellings (including cooperatives and condominiums), the purchase price of which is not greater than the market price of 90% of similar housing in the community involved. It is intended that such mortgage financing will be at rates and upon terms prevailing in the communities selected and will be available to the general public, including UAW members, but shall not be limited only to UAW members. The Union may submit to the Company annually a list of investments in nonprofit institutions of the kind described above which the Union deems appropriate.
It was also agreed that the Union may submit to the Company annually a list of not more than seven (7) companies, including companies doing business in or with South Africa, and those selling that country military equipment or supplies, and to companies transporting military equipment or supplies to it, with the recommendation that the pension fund would not be invested in the securities of such companies. Such recommendation shall not apply with respect to any portion of the pension fund that is invested in interests in a common or collective trust fund or pooled investment fund maintained by any of the investment managers or to any insurance contract constituting part of the pension fund. The investment managers of the pension fund shall exercise investment judgment with respect to recommendations received by them pursuant hereto. The investment managers
506
INVESTMENT OF PENSION FUND
have the responsibility to secure, over the long term, the maximum attainable total return on investment consistent with the principles of sound, prudent pension fund management. They are expected to discharge their duties solely in the interest of Plan participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries, to avoid prohibited transactions, and to meet all other fiduciary responsibilities imposed by Tile Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) or other applicable law. Also they are expected to discharge their duties with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in a conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims. It is intended that the investment managers of the pension fund shall continue to have full investment discretion. Accordingly, if in the judgment of the investment managers, any recommendation should not be implemented because in the exercise of their investment responsibilities they conclude that the recommended action is not appropriate or it otherwise does not meet the standards of prudence required or is not consistent with the fiduciary obligations and responsibilities of the investment managers, they shall not implement the request and shall so inform the Union.
The Company agrees that it will not privately or publicly urge the investment managers to reject any recommendation given by the Union pursuant to this letter.
Nothing in this letter shall prevent the investment managers of the pension fund from investing, at their discretion, a larger amount of the pension fund than that specified in the second paragraph of this letter in investments of the type described in that paragraph.
ft is understood and agreed between the parties that the assets (excluding passively managed index funds and U. S. treasury and agency securities) to be managed by employees of Ford Motor Company pursuant to Article VIII of the Plan shall .be limited to an amount equal to 10% of the total pension fund assets.
This letter is subject to the requirement that there are maintained continuously (1) a ruling satisfactory to the

OUTSTANDING PLACEMENT DETERMINATION REQUESTS
PURSUANT TO APPLICATION FOR DISABILITY RETIREMENT
September 16, 1996
Mr. Ernest Lofton
Vice President and Director	.
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Outstanding Placement Determination Requests Pursuant to Application for Disability Retirement
During these negotiations the Union noted its concern that some placement determination requests were not being processed promptly by plants, thereby delaying some disability retirements.
When an employee has applied for disability retirement and is found not to be totally and permanently disabled, the Retirement Board forwards a placement determination request to the employee’s plant. The placement determination request process involves (1) the plant physician determining what restrictions, if any, are appropriate for the employee and C2) the plant personnel office determining whether there is any work in the plant for the employee given such restriction. If there is no suitable work, the employee’s application for disability retirement is processed.
In some cases the placement determination process appears to take undue time thereby delaying certain disability retirements.
In the future, when a placement determination request has been pending for 30 days after such request was initially sent, and the National Employee Services Center fNESC) has not received a response from the plant, the NESC will notify the appropriate division Labor Relations Manager and request that the manager take action to expedite the placement determination request.	.

The Retirement Board will continue to provide a monthly listing of the outstanding placement determination requests .to the UAW. The listing will include the applicant’s name, social security number, the date the placement determination request was sent to the plant, and the plant’s name.

PENSION ADMINISTRATION - DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS (DROS)

Mr. Gerald D. Bantom
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Pension Administration - Domestic Relations Orders (DROs)
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the current practice by the administrator (Fidelity) of immediately withholding 50% of a retiree’s benefit under the Ford-UAW Retirement Plan (Plan) following receipt of a Domestic Relations Order (DRO). The administrator continues to withhold such amount until it is determined that the DRO has met the requirements to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. Upon qualification, a final determination of the benefit amount payable to the Alternate Payee is made, and any adjustment to the retiree’s benefit or the
512
PENSION ADMINISTRATION - DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDERS (DROS)
alternate payee's benefit (including recovery of overpayments) is made.
The parties agreed for DROs filed with the administrator on or after January 1,2004 that this procedure, during the period required for qualification of the ORO, would be modified as follows:
•	Where the DRO specifies a flat dollar amount to be paid to the Alternate Payee such dollar amount will be withheld from the participant’s pension benefit and held for the Alternate Payee.
•	For any other DRO where a flat dollar amount is not specified, the present procedure of withholding 50% of the retiree’s pension benefit will be continued.
Once the DRO becomes a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, the amount of withholding will be adjusted as required by the order. Adjustment to the retiree’s benefit or the Alternate Payee’s benefit, including recovery of overpayments will then be made.

WORKERS’ COMPENSATION - CREDITED SERVICE

Mr. Ron Gettelfinger
Vice President and Director UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:.
Subject: Workers’ Compensation - Credited Service
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed problems related to the application of the credited service provisions of the Retirement Agreement. This is to confirm that an employee who is absent from work on an approved leave of absence because of occupational injury or disease and on account of such injury or disease, receives Workers' Compensation temporary total disability payments, will receive credited service at the rate of 40 hours for each complete week that the employee is on such leave.
For an employee on an approved medical leave of absence for a condition not initially considered to be the result of an occupational injury or disease, but which condition is subsequently changed to be compensable as an occupational injury or disease, credited service will be given for the period for which workers’ compensation temporary total disability benefits are deemed payable.
In addition, effective for employees who have not retired or broken service prior to October 1,1999, in those cases where Workers’ Compensation temporary total disability benefits are no longer payable because the employee has reached maximum medical improvement or the time certain beyond which benefits are not payable, the employee will also be given credited service at the rate of 40 hours for each complete week that he/she is on an approved leave of absence because of occupational injury or disease. Individual cases brought to the Company’s attention will be reviewed based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case to determine if the employee should be deemed to have received workers compensation for such absence in accordance with the above.
519
WORKERS’ COMPENSATION - CREDITED SERVICE
The above notwithstanding, should an employee who would be otherwise eligible to receive credited service break seniority under the terms of the contract or be able to perform any job in the plant for which he/she has seniority, credited service shall cease to accrue as of that date.
To the extent an employee has not received credited service consistent with these provisions, credited service will be corrected if the error is brought to the attention of the employee’s local Human Resources Office, and the National Employees Service Center (NESC).

In conjunction with such discussions, the parties may elect to jointly conduct on-site reviews of such examiners. The reviews may consider the performance of individual examiners in meeting acceptable standards for adequacy of examinations, courtesy, cleanliness of facilities, independence, accessibility for employees, promptness in reporting findings and other criteria of mutual concern to the parties. If the parties conclude it is in their best interest for the Insurer not to continue to utilize a particular . examiner, the Insurer will be so advised and the examiner or clinic will no longer receive examination assignments. The parties also may explore, during such meetings, recommendations made by either party with respect to new medical examiners or medical facilities for consideration by the Insurer.
•	Western Union, U.S. Postal Service, or another reliable delivery service which provides proof of delivery will be utilized to notify employees to report for examinations.
•	The Company will instruct the Insurer to provide examiners with an accurate description of • the employee’s job classification duties and to encourage the examiner to discuss with the employee the nature of the employee’s job and < work environment in order to facilitate the examiner’s determination as to whether the employee is able to work.

Refrain from, scheduling for an examination any employee who has not filed a claim for A&S benefits for a period of 18 consecutive months immediately prior to the disability absence (not including time off the roll due to permanent separation), provided the disability absence does not extend beyond the anticipated duration of disability.
•	An employee will be given 48 hours advance written or verbal notification of the scheduling of an examination. Examinations will not be performed during a benefit waiting period.
•	Reasonable effort will be made to determine by telephone or other means why an employee fails to show up for a scheduled examination. Benefits will be suspended for any employee who fails without good cause to appear for a scheduled exam without timely notice supplied to the Insurer.

integration of a&s and.
SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS (SSDIB)
. ■ October 9, 1999
Mr. Ron Gettelfinger
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue	,
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Integration of A&S and Social Security Benefits (SSDIB)
This is to confirm our understanding on several issues related to the integration of Accident and Sickness (A&S) benefits with Social Security Benefits (SSDIB).
In those instances where an employee provides evidence of having made application for Primary SSDIB within six (6) months of the onset of disability, no presumption of SSDIB eligibility will be made; A&S benefits will be reduced by the amount of the award only when an award is made. If the employee makes application for SSDIB after six (6) months following the onset of disability or makes no application for SSDIB, the presumption at the fortieth week will be that the employee was eligible for SSDIB beginning with the twentysixth week following the onset of disability and that A&S benefits should have been paid in a lesser amount beginning with the twenty-sixth week.
When an employee has received A&S benefits for sixteen (16) consecutive weeks, a letter will be sent informing the employee of the importance of filing for SSDIB if it appears that the disability period will exceed twenty-six (26) weeks and of the effect that failing to file for SSDIB will have on A&S benefits. In addition, reminder notices will be sent in both the twentieth and twenty-fourth weeks.
Where an initial claim for SSDIB is denied and the employee engages the services of an attorney to appeal such denial, if the appeal by the attorney is successful the employee’s repayment obligation will be satisfied if he/she pays to UNICARE within thirty (30) days of the receipt of a retroactive SSDIB award that portion of the award which represents an overpayment of any A&S benefits and Extended Disability Benefits (EDB) less the amount of attorney fees

involved on that portion of the award. This reduction applies only to attorney fees associated with a successful appeal of an initial denial by Social Security for SSDIB and includes only that portion of the attorney fees associated with the period of time the employee received either A&S or both A&S and EDB. Such attorney fees considered for this purpose may not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the overpayment due to UNICARE. Attorney fees for services prior to denial of initial application for SSDIB will not reduce the amount of an overpayment due to UNICARE.
Confirming our conversation regarding old age insurance benefits, no presumption will be made regarding Social Security eligibility unless the employee refused to provide evidence that such a benefit is not being received.

MEDICAL PLACEMENT OF RESTRICTED EMPLOYEES

Mr. Gerald I>. Bantom
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department ■ 8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Medical Placement of Restricted Employees
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern over the effectiveness, of the Company's procedures for returning employees who have medical restrictions to work. It is recognized that placement of medically restricted employees within the constraints imposed by the seniority provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement is the responsibility of local plant management and that the compliance of individual locations with Company medical placement standards and guidelines and the effectiveness of local placement efforts may vary among locations.
To address the Union’s concern in this matter, the Company will, within six (6) months of the effective date of this agreement, develop standards of practice and Company guidelines for medical placement of employees and convey them to management and other involved personnel at operating locations for implementation. At a reasonable time thereafter, the Company will review the medical placement practices of plant locations and make recommendations for their improvement, as appropriate. Among the local activities to be reviewed will be the extent of compliance with Company medical placement standards and guidelines, adequacy of the training provided to local personnel involved in the medical placement process, unique procedures and concepts which may benefit other locations if communicated to them, techniques which are, or may be, utilized to condition or train a medical restricted employee to perform other work, overall effectiveness of Die local medical placement program, and other issues as may be appropriate.
538
MEDICAL PLACEMENT OF RESTRICTED EMPLOYEES
The results of this review will be conveyed to the Union through the Company-Union Committee for Group Life and Disability Insurance at which time the Union may make recommendations for further improvement of the medical placement process.

When IME examinations are schedule with a medical examiner located more than 40 miles (or the distance driven to work, if greater) from their residence, employees upon request, will be reimbursed by UNICARE at a rate of thirty-six (36) cents per mile for the actual miles driven from the residence to the physician’s office and back using the most direct route available. Mileage reimbursement will be made after employees have kept their appointment with the IME examiner. Mileage reimbursement will not be made for IME examinations conducted within 40 miles of the employees'residence.

PRESUMPTION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY - EDB

Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue	.
Detroit, Michigan 48214	,
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger.
Subject; Presumption of Eligibility for Social Security -
' EDB Provisions
During these negotiations, the Union discussed the issue of employees who have applied for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (SSDIB) but have not received a determination by Social Security at the time they become eligible for Extended Disability Benefits (EDB) under the GL&DI Program. EDB payable to such employees is reduced based on a presumption of eligibility for SSDIB. The Union believes the reduction of EDB in advance of a determination by Social Security creates a hardship for employees. Under the Accident and Sickness provisions of the Plan, the presumption of eligibility is waived for employees who have filed for SSDIB on a timely basis. The Union has proposed that the waiver of the presumption of eligibility by extended to the EDB provisions for those same employees until a decision is issued by Social Security on their SSDIB application.
Employees may request that the Company waive the presumption of eligibility for SSDIB under the EDB provisions, by presenting the Company with a voluntary authorization to deduct, from the employees’ benefits under the Retirement Plan, any overpayment attributable to a retroactive SSDIB award for the period covered by the waiver of the EDB presumption. If the request is accepted by the Company, the claims processor, UNICARE, will be instructed to waive the SSDIB presumption until such time as a decision is issued by Social Security. The voluntary authorization for retirement withholding may be revoked by an employee at any time. The Retirement Plan deduction authorization would only be utilized in those cases in which the residual EDB payment owed to employees, after adjustment for the Social Security Award, is not sufficient to allow recovery of the overpayment
547
PRESUMPTION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY - EDB
PROVISIONS
from future EDB payments within a reasonable period of time. In the event an employee revokes the authorization allowing withholding of the overpayment from retirement benefits before the amount of the overpayment is fully recovered and refuses to repay the balance of the remaining EDB overpayment, the matter will be referred to a collection agent employed by UNICARE for recovery action up to and including litigation.	,
This is to confirm the parties have agreed that, as soon as practicable after these negotiations are concluded, a national pilot program will be developed to implement the above referenced EDB .waiver and retirement plan recovery process. Two years from the date on which such program is implemented, the parties will evaluate the process to determine if it has achieved their objectives. If the process proves successful and meets the parties objectives, it will be continued for the balance of the Agreement. ’
In the event the process does not meet the objectives of either of the parties, the waiver procedure will be discontinued and the existing Plan provision for presumption of eligibility for SSD1B when eligible for EDB will again be applicable to the claims of the above referenced employees.

Mr. Ron Gettelfinger ' Vice President and Director UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Procedure for Giving Notice to Employees for Impartial Medical Examinations
During past negotiations, the Union expressed concern about the procedure used to notify employees that they are scheduled for an Independent Medical Examination (IME) in conjunction with their disability benefits claim. The Union expressed specific concern that some employees were not receiving the examination notice in a timely manner. To improve this situation, the parties agreed to an employee notification procedure. This is to confirm that UNICARE Life and Health Insurance Company will continue the following employee notification procedure when processing employee disability claims.
1.	An IME appointment Mailgram will continue to be sent to the address provided by the employee on the statement of claim or, in instances in which an address has not been provided, to the employee’s address of record with the Company.
The Mailgram will be amended to request that the employee notify UNICARE immediately by calling the toll-free (800) number to be provided on the Mailgram if, for some reason, the appointment cannot reasonably be kept.
2.	An IME appointment will be immediately rescheduled for an employee who advises UNICARE within two working days of the scheduled appointment date of an inability to keep the appointment for justifiable cause.
3.	Upon receipt of notice from the IME examiner that an employee has failed to keep a scheduled IME appointment, UNICARE will review the time keeping record of the employee’s work location to ascertain if the employee has returned to work.
549
PROCEDURE FOR GIVING NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES FOR IMPARTIAL MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS
An employee who has failed to keep a scheduled IME appointment and who has not returned to work will be sent a second Mailgram advising the employee that:
•	An appointment was scheduled for an IME which the employee did not keep.
« Disability benefits are suspended as of the date following the scheduled IME appointment. -
•	UNICARE should be contacted immediately at the toll-free (800) number provided in the Mailgram to reschedule the IME appointment.
•	Suspended benefits will be restored if the IME confirms the employee’s disability.
4. Requests from an employee for reinstatement of suspended benefits will be considered by UNICARE on an individual case basis. Claims which cannot be resolved by UNICARE may be appealed to the Life and Disability Programs Department, Human Resources.
The parties expressed a mutual concern for the fairness and consistent application of the procedures used to administer Impartial Medical Examinations. In the event the procedure does not resolve the Union’s concerns, changes may be considered by the Company-Union Committee as provided under Section 19 of the Group Life and Disability Insurance Program.

Expeditious Payment: Reimbursement of claims and payment for the delivery of benefits will be paid on the same timely basis as with insured plans so as not to negatively affect the delivery of benefits.

ALTERNATIVE PLAN VALUE
October 9, 1999
Mr. Ron Gettelfinger
Vice President and Director UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Alternative Plan Value
In calculating the Company's monthly contributions (and any required member contributions) under Section 4(f) of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program toward the cost of coverage for eligible members subscribing to an alternative plan under Section 2 of the Program, the following method will be used:
1.	At the time of any change in the component premium rates (i.e., single, two-party, family) of either an alternative plan or the corresponding local plan, the alternative plan composite premium shall be compared to an adjusted local plan composite premium developed by using comparable local plan component rates and the alternative plan enrollment mix of Company employees who are then members of the alternative plan. If less than thirty (30) employees of the Company are then members of the alternative plan (which includes all new alternative
553
ALTERNATIVE PLAN VALUE
plans), the national enrollment mix of all Company employees who are enrolled in alternative plans will be used in calculating its composite premium rate and comparing its rate to that of the corresponding local plan so as to produce more reasonable statistical results. Whenever possible, these calculations will employ separate enrollment mixes for Company hourly and salaried employee groups, respectively.
2.	If the adjusted local plan composite premium is in excess of the alternative plan composite premium, the Company shall pay the full premiums of eligible members subscribing to the alternative plan. See Example #1 on the attachment.
3.	If the alternative plan composite premium is in excess of the adjusted local plan composite premium, the Company’s contribution on behalf of an eligible member enrolled in such alternative plan shall be limited to the amount obtained by multiplying the amount of the applicable component premium rate for the alternative plan by the ratio derived from the adjusted local plan composite premium divided by the alternative plan composite premium. The alternative plan member contribution amount shall be the difference between the appropriate alternative plan component rate less the applicable Company contribution. See Example #2 on the attachment.
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed the method used in determining the Company’s monthly contributions for alternative plans as described above. The parties agreed the present method could be improved and should reflect other measures of plan performance as a means of determining the value of the plan to the member and the Company.
The Parties agree to continue to study, in the CompanyUnion Committee described in Section 12, using the assistance of outside advisors, as appropriate, other methods of determining Company contributions. The study will consider additional measures such as the outcomes of care and other quality indicators, health status of members, and utilization patterns. Effective no later than the 2002 plan year, the
554
ALTERNATIVE PLAN VALUE
Company contribution will be determined by a new method reflecting the recommendation of the Company-Union study and agreed to by the Parties.
If the Parties fail to reach agreement on a new method by October, 2001, for plan year beginning in 2002 the Company will use the method described in 1-3 above in calculating the Company’s monthly contributions (and any required member contributions) under Section 4 (f) of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program toward the cost of coverage for eligible members subscribing to an alternative pian under Section 2 of the Program.
Any subsequent mutually agreed to change to this methodology should be implemented in tone for the next open enrollment period.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Ambulatory Surgical Facilities (ASF) and Freestanding Ambulatory Surgical Centers (FASC)
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the criteria that would be applicable for determining coverage for services provided by ASF and FASC. The parties agreed that, subject to approval for benefit payment by the carrier, the criteria that is applicable for a ASF/FASC to be recognized as an approved facility under the H-S-M-D-D-V Program is shown below:
•	must meet all local state licensing and any Certificate of Need (CON) requirements that may exist in the state; and
•	be accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), the American Osteopathic Association for the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), and
•	be approved for reimbursement as an ambulatory surgical center (ASC) under Medicare; and
« have a written referral agreement with at least one acute care hospital; and
•	if required by the carrier, meet any carrier-designated need tests and enter into a written agreement with the ►	local carrier to provide services in accordance with
established reimbursement and utilization review policies for such facilities.
•	. if limiting services to a single specialty, be subject to a Certificate of Need (CON) required by the state or other carrier-designated need tests.
557
AMBULATORY SURGICAL FACILITIES (ASF) AND FREESTANDING AMBULATORY SURGICAL CENTERS (FASC)
To the extent a local carrier has a process for relating approved capacity to anticipated need and actual capacity within the area exceeds anticipated need, the carrier may, with the approval of the parties, contract with a limited number of facilities. Similarly, the Company and the Union may conclude that it is in the best interest of the'Program to limit approved outpatient surgical capacity in a geographic area. In such cases, selections will be made on the basis of quality and cost. Further, the Company and the Union may withdraw approval of particular facilities in the event of quality concerns.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Carrier Administration
During present negotiations, the Company and Union discussed the feasibility of pursuing competitive bids related to the administration of the H-S-M-D-D*V Program with the objective of improving the quality of Program administration, reducing administrative costs, promoting practices which lower claims costs, and improving customer service. The Union stated that, alternatively, it would be more appropriate to develop and implement performance standards that would enhance the present carriers' performance and cost effectiveness.
We agree that as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the present negotiations, the Company-Union Committee, as described in Section 12 of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program, will
562
CARRIER ADMINISTRATION
meet to discuss the establishment of such performance standards. The standards will be designed to encourage carriers to achieve a higher level of administrative performance in such areas as claims Management, employee/ retiree servicing, record Keeping, reporting capability, cost containment programs administration, data processing, and overall cost effectiveness.
If it is determined after an appropriate period of time that certain carriers are not meeting the agreed-upon performance standards, the Company-Union Committee will consider requesting competitive bids for the services provided by those carriers with poor performance. Following receipt of the competitive bids, the Company-Union Committee will review the proposals and jointly determine the course of action to be taken.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Community Health Care Initiatives
During these negotiations, the Union and the Company conducted extensive discussions regarding the continued development of the Community Health Care Initiatives process. In designated communities the Company and the Union work with others in the community to initiate community activities designed to improve the overall health status of area residents and improve the quality and cost effectiveness of the local health care delivery system.
The parties reaffirm that Community Health Care Initiatives Programs have the potential to promote high quality, cost effective health care delivery systems for the entire community and thereby enhance the effectiveness and value of the health care benefits provided to UAW-represented eligible Ford enrollees, under the H-S-M-D-D-V Program. Accordingly, the Company and Union have agreed that as soon as practicable following ratification of the Agreement, the
565
COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE INITIATIVES
Company-Union Committee described in Section 12 of the
H-S-M-D-D-V Program will meet to further develop specific	<
measurable objectives focusing on cost-effective, quality action plans, to be implemented as soon as practicable in the Kansas City pilot and Louisville. The	i
objectives will be consistent with the principles outlined in the attached Vision-Mission Statement.
The parties are committed to work closely together to ensure the success of these initiatives.	|
The Action Plans will identify areas for program activities designed to achieve demonstrable improvements in health status, quality and cost effectiveness of the health care delivery system over time. Typical community activities would include, but not be limited to:
•	collaboration with consumers, purchasers, providers, health care plans, carriers and other interested	',1
parties to develop activities that will assist a community in utilizing all its health care resources effectively, and balancing those resources with its health care needs,
•	' evaluation of provider cost disparities as well as practice variations,
•	creation of specific programs that incorporate pharmacy data with medical data so that treatment patterns may more accurately reflect evidence-based medicine,
•	identification of best practices of care and delivery, and encouragement of their adoption by local health care providers,
•	improvement in the health status of all members of the community through the use of community activities, such as educational and informational programs, and
•	provision of environmental scans, resource and needs assessments and other data that give the community access to significant data and information to enable it to develop action planning.
The Action Plans developed by the Company-Union Committee will be tailored to reflect the unique environment of each community. The Committee will jointly adopt specific

short-term and ongoing measurable goals for each location, monitor the activity within each of the two communities and receive quarterly reports from the Community Initiatives Directors. The parties agree to collaborate with other organizations involved in community health care initiatives programs to ensure maximum effectiveness of the programs. Further, the parties will evaluate on or before January 1, 2006, those initiatives based on the adopted measurable goals. Based on the results of these evaluations, the parties may agree to take appropriate actions including the termination of the Community Health Care Initiatives and expansion to a third community as determined by the Committee.
IW Community Initiatives Directors (CIDs) will be assigned to each targeted community and will be responsible for working as a team to implement each Action Plan under the oversight of the Company-Union Committee. One CID will be appointed by the Company and one by the Union. The CIDs will be employees of'the Company and receive pay and benefits from the Company. Any consulting fees will be reimbursed from National Program Center funds.

We are firmly committed to encourage the development of community health care delivery systems that provide high quality health services, promote disease and accident prevention, expand health education, improve community health status and enhance the quality of life, while reducing
567
COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE INITIATIVES
costs by efficient and appropriate cost-effective delivery of services.
The Community Initiatives process will stimulate community activity, including coalitions and other consensus building forums, to encourage collaboration and cooperation of consumers, purchasers, providers, health care plans, carriers and other interested parties to improve the health care system by promoting:
•	the delivery of high quality health care;
•	a culture of “best practice”;
•	state-of-the-art data collection and information systems;
•	a balancing of the health care resources of the community with the community’s health care needs; and
•	cost effective care delivery.
Community activity supported by information acquired through the assessment of community needs and resources and a survey of national and local “best practices”, will generate the development and implementation of action plans to ensure that health care resources in the community are used efficiently and effectively to meet its needs.
This commitment to community activity and collaboration will be ongoing and emphasize continuous improvement of the delivery system. An immediate goal will be achieving a voluntary community commitment to a moratorium on expansion that does not have a consensus of need.

Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department	■
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
Subject: Confidentiality of Health Care Information
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union agreed on the desirability of maintaining a set of principles concerning the confidentiality of medical information. The Company reviewed with the Union its processes and practices in this regard. The parties acknowledged that medical information means any record, written or electronic, identifying a participant in the Ford-UAW Retirement Plan or the H-S-M-D-D-V Program or the Group Life and Disability Insurance Program (collectively, “Benefits Programs”), containing diagnostic or treatment information and used in connection with the administration of the Benefits Programs. Accordingly, the following are understood:	'
•	Participants in the Benefits Programs have a legitimate interest in the confidentiality of medical information pertaining to them.
•	The Company, third party administrators, and other parties acting on behalf of the Company or third party administrators in connection with the Benefits Programs (“Other Parties”) have a legitimate need to collect, maintain, and use medical information in the course of performing administrative and other fiduciary functions required by the Benefits Programs and the law (e.g., verifying eligibility and benefit status, claims adjudication, audits for payment purposes, case management, coordination of benefits).
*	The Company, third party administrators and Other Parties have a legitimate need to collect, maintain and use aggregate medical information for purposes of analysis, evaluation, oversight and quality control.
•	In addition to applicable legal requirements, access to medical information maintained by the Company, third
570
CONFIDENTIALITY OF HEALTH CARE INFORMATION
party administrators and Other Parties will be limited to persons having a need to use the information in the course of performing their job duties, and where appropriate and feasible, narrowly tailored in terms of scope and detail to achieve intended business purposes. Aggregate data and/or summaries will be used by the Company to the extent feasible.
•	Medical information exchanged with Other Parties for analysis and evaluation will be used and maintained only for the purpose for which it is provided and not redisclosed by Other Parties without the prior consent of the Company and the Union.
•	The Company will establish internal safeguards concerning the exchange of medical information by the Company. Employees who inappropriately exchange medical information will be subject to disciplinary action. The Company will also require third party administrators and Other Parties to establish and enforce policies and procedures consistent with this letter.
•	Medical information may be exchanged with Other Parties for clinical, public health and academic research only if a meaningful purpose is to benefit participants in the Benefits Programs. Absent such purpose, the prior agreement of the Company and Union on all aspects of the research (e.g., topics, selection of researchers, distribution of results) is required.
•	Benefits Programs treatment interventions should not be made by employees of the Company other than its medical personnel in the course of their normal activities, e.g., in-plant medical facilities.
The Vice President and Director, UAW, National Ford Department will designate an International Union, UAW, individual to participate in the consensus building atmosphere in the activities of the Quality Consortium and the Scientific Review Board. At the discretion of the Vice President and Director, UAW, National Ford Department, the individual who participates in the Quality Consortium and the Scientific Review Board need not be the same person.
The parties agree that a medical ethicist will be jointly selected as a member of the Scientific Review Board.

confidentiality of health care information
The Company, in consultation with the Union, is committed to continuing its development of processes and practices regulating the use of medical information within the Company and by third party administrators and Other Parties. The Company and the Union also discussed proposed federal legislation and the possibility of new regulations addressing specific uses of medical information. In the event that federal standards are adopted, the parties will meet to discuss plans for compliance. Should issues arise during the course of-the agreement concerning the confidentiality of medical information, the Company will meet with tire Union to discuss mutually agreeable solutions.
The Company agrees that it shall indemnify and hold the tinion harmless for any sums paid by the Union to any person or persons as a result of the Company’s use of medical information pursuant to or in violation of this Agreement.

Re: Eligibility Verification of 19-Year-Old Children
Dear Mr. Bantom:	,
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the benefit overpayment recovery process as provided in Exhibit VI, Article XVI of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program. In order to attempt to reduce the number of primary enrollees affected under the provision and the extent of overpayments, the parties agree to remove from coverage dependent children upon reaching age 19 unless the respective primary enrollees respond to the Company's request for eligibility verification.
581
ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION OF 19-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN
The Company will identify dependent children approximately 60 days prior to the month in which they will reach age 19 and will mail a communication to the respective primary enrollees. The communication will contain an explanation of the Ford Healthcare Plan dependent eligibility requirements and a Letter of Relationship, Residency and Intent to Claim form. Primary enrollees will be instructed to review the Ford Healthcare Plan dependent eligibility requirements in order to conclude whether their dependents meet the eligibility requirements.
If a primary enrollee concludes that his or her dependent does not meet the Ford Healthcare Plan eligibility criteria, he or she is not required to respond to the Ford communication. The dependent will be removed automatically from coverage effective on his or her 19th birthday. The primary enrollee will not be required to repay any overpayment for such dependent. If a primary enrollee concludes that his or her dependent meets the Ford Healthcare Plan eligibility criteria, he or she must submit a completed Letter of Relationship, Residency and Intent to Claim form to the National Employee Service Center (NESC). By completing the form and submitting it to the NESC, the enrollee certifies that his or her dependent meets the Ford Healthcare Plan eligibility criteria.
If a primary enrollee concludes that his or her dependent meets the Ford Healthcare Plan eligibility criteria, and he or she submits a completed Letter of Relationship, Residency and Intent to Claim form to the NESC after a dependent has been removed from coverage, the dependent will be reinstated to coverage retroactive to the date removed.

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Enrollment in Medicare Part A
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the issue of H-S-M-D-D-V enrollees (Ford enrollees) who are eligible for but not enrolled in Medicare Part A. ‘
The parties have agreed that, under the auspices of the Company-Union Committee, the parties will jointly develop an educational program designed to provide advance notice to affected Ford enrollees of the importance of enrolling in Medicare Part A and the steps required to do so.
Enrollees who subsequently join Medicare Part A and, in doing so, incur a payment required by Medicare due to delayed or discontinuous enrollment will receive a lump sum payment from the Company equivalent to the amount of such payments required for Medicare Part A participation. On and after the date of this Agreement, the CompanyUnion Committee will select a date after which future health claims will be paid with the presumption of enrollment in Medicare Part A for those eligible for premium-free coverage under Medicare. The Company agrees that, for health claims pending as of the date of this Agreement, or incurred on and after the date of this Agreement but before the date jointly selected by the parties for the presumption of Medicare Part A enrollment or re-enrollment, it shall instruct the plan administrators not to apply offsets to pending or future claims for Ford health benefits based on benefits Medicare

would have paid had an individual been enrolled in Medicare Part A. The Company-Union Committee will resolve any matters in dispute over such benefit offsets.

Dear Mr, Gettelfinger:
Subject: Health Care Quality
During these negotiations the Company and the Union discussed their joint concerns regarding wide variations in the quality of health 'care by location and by provider, and the risks our employees, retirees and their dependents are exposed to because of such variations. We agreed that it is essential to encourage evidence-based medicine and the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines. We also agreed that measurement of outcomes and effectiveness of care, by hospital and physician, and communication of that information to our employees, retirees and their dependents is necessary to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their health care.
The Company and the Union have a long histoiy of working together to improve the quality of health care including our Community Health Care Initiatives and the requirement for HMO NCQA accreditation incorporated in the last.Agreement and the requirement for NCQA or URAC accreditation of PPOs in this Agreement. To supplement those efforts and accelerate the pace of change each HMO, PPO, or hospital-surgical-medical-drug-dental-vision-hearing aid coverage plan provided in Section 1 (a) of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program offered shall be required to submit by April 1, 2000 detailed quality improvement plans on how such Plan will: ■
• Encourage evidence-based medicine and the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines (including pharmaceutical-prescribing guidelines].
. • Develop measurements of outcomes and effectiveness of care by hospital and physician.
• Communicate provider specific outcomes/effective-ness information to participants.
601
HEALTH CARE QUALITY
The Plan(s) should work to the extent possible with providers, local coalitions, other health plans, unions and employers, etc. to achieve these objectives on a community basis. These quality improvement plans should include an implementation start date of not later than January I, 2001 with substantial progress to be achieved by December 31, 2002. Plans that do not meet these requirements will not be offered in the open enrollment period for 2002 unless mutually agreed to otherwise.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: H-S-M-D-D-V and Self-funded PPO Prescription Drug Program	'
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the quality, safety, efficacy, delivery, and costeffectiveness of the H-S-M-D-D-V Prescription Drug Program, as well as the self-funded Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) Prescription Drug Programs. The parties agreed that these Programs could be improved. Therefore, the Company and Union agreed to implement, effective January 1, 2004, the following changes to these Prescription Drug Programs.
Generic Prescription Drug Program
(Effective January 1, 2004)
In order to promote the usage of generic prescription drugs to reduce costs while maintaining the quality of care, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) will automatically substitute an approved generic drug for prescriptions written for multi-source brand name drugs, except for a list of narrow therapeutic index agents, e.g. dilantin. .
1.	In those instances when a physician prescribes a multi-source brand name drug and indicates on the prescription, Dispense As Written or DAW, the brand name drug will be dispensed and the enrollee will pay the brand name co-payment specified in Section 1 (a) of the H-M-S-D-D-V Program plus the difference (up to a maximum of SI 0.00) in cost between the generic drug and the brand name drug. The enrollee may request a review of the medical necessity for the brand name drug. If the medical necessity is not established, future dispensing will be subject to section 3 below.
606
H-S-M-D-D-V AND SELF-FUNDED PPO PRESCRIPTION DRUG
PROGRAM
2.	In the case described in Section 1, above, the enrollee may request a review of the medical necessity for the brand name drug through the PBM’s process. If it is found that dispensing of the brand name drug was medically necessary, amounts paid by the enrollee in excess of the brand name co-payment will be refunded to the enrollee. The PBM’s record systems will be adjusted to allow dispensing of the brand name drug for the period of time the eligible enrollee is receiving that drug.
3.	If the brand name drug is dispensed at the enrollee’s request or after the determination in Section 2 above that the brand name drug is not medically necessary, the enrollee will pay the appropriate generic drug co-payment plus the full difference in cost between the generic drug and the brand name drug.
Employees who retire on or before January 1, 2004 (and their eligible dependents), are exempt from the Generic Prescription Drug Program as described in this letter. All other existing provisions of the Prescription Drug Program shall continue to apply as described elsewhere in this Agreement.	■
Mail Order Prescription Drug (Home Delivery) Program (Effective January 1, 2004)
1.	Prescription medications on the Maintenance Legend . Drug List (MDL), and used on a long-term basis will be available only through home delivery, following an original prescription and two refills. Alfter an original prescription order and two refills for the same prescription drug at the same therapeutic strength, additional refills will be available only through the home delivery program. Additional refills obtained at retail of MDL drugs and related supplies if applicable are subject to 100% enrollee co-payment.
2.	The Maintenance Drug List at Retail (Volume II, Exhibit VI, Section VI) will be discontinued effective January 1, 2004 and will become the home delivery Maintenance Drug List as referenced in 1 above. Additions and deletions to the Maintenance Legend Drug List or the home delivery Maintenance Drug List may be made during the term of the Agreement by mutual agreement of the parties.

Dear Mr. Bantom;
Subject; Improving Benefits Service Through Technology
During these negotiations, the parties recognized the need to continue the development of systems and applications and to provide ongoing technical support to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees.
The parties recognize the need to provide new tools to full-time Union .Benefits Representatives so that they may improve the service they are providing to hourly employees. Plant Union Benefits Representatives fully support the services provided by the NESC and are an essential force in promoting its use. At the same time, Union Benefits Representatives* require basic information that can be accessed quickly in order to confidently and accurately answer many of the questions they receive.
The parties recognize the need to provide access to pension related data to Union Benefits Representatives. The parties agree that access to Pension data in the Defined Benefits
608
IMPROVING BENEFITS SERVICE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
Client Server (DB c/s) will assist Union Benefit Representatives in servicing hourly employee concerns regarding their creditable pension service. The Company and National Ford Department teams at the NESC will mutually agree on the elements and screens of information that would be provided.	■	■
The Union Benefits Representatives will continue to have view-only access to information for UAW hourly employees at the particular location. Any training requirements associated with this effort will be proposed to the National Programs Joint Governing Body to be charged to the Education, Development and Training Program Fund.
The present method of providing benefit services to hourly employees involves an on-line benefit documentation system that enables Union Benefit Representatives to use the computer to search documentation for relevant plan data needed to resolve employee inquiries. Therefore, the parties agree that upgrades to Union Benefit Representative computer hardware and software (and ongoing support requirements) will be included in the Corporate “Bulldozer" Program at each location. The cost of computer equipment, software, and support and training for Union Benefits Representatives will be charged to the Education, Development and Training Program Fund as approved by the Joint Governing Body.
The parties agreed to continue using voice response technology to handle investment of all or a part of profit sharing distributions in the TESPHE. Employees will be able to elect cash or direct their distribution to their Ford Money Market Account. In. addition, employees making regular contributions to the TESPHE will need only to designate the portion of the profit share distribution to be invested and it will be invested according to the investment election already in place in the account. Employees not making regular contributions to the TESPHE also will be able to invest in the TESPHE from their profit share and to select among the investment options. The process will provide voice confirmation at each step of the transaction, followed by a printed confirmation sent to the employee following the transaction. Employees would be provided a reasonable time following receipt of the confirmation to call Fidelity for a correction.
609
IMPROVING BENEFITS SERVICE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY
Employees will be provided all necessary assistance to assure their transaction is received. Such assistance will be available from representatives at Fidelity during normal business hours. Employees may also seek assistance from their Local Union Benefit Representative.
In conclusion, during the term of the new Agreement, the Company and National Ford Department teams at the NESC pledge to carefully consider every opportunity to improve quality and efficiency in benefits delivery.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Long-Term Care Discussions
During these negotiations, the UAW has expressed an interest in a beneficiary-paid long-term care insurance (LTC) product for its members. The parties have discussed the advantage of making this insurance available to UAW-represented employees at an affordable price. The UAW has stated that it is not seeking employer Binding or subsidy of such insurance.
Based upon the latter commitment by the Union regarding funding and subsidy, the Company has agreed to study with the UAW the feasibility of offering a beneficiary-paid LTC product. It is anticipated that such a product would not be employer-specific and could be offered to all UAW-represented employees and others, as determined by the Union and the insurance carrier, regardless of employer.
The purpose of the feasibility study would be to understand the requirements of the UAW as well as to understand the needs and demographics of prospective beneficiaries. The study also would survey the marketplace with the goal of evaluating the products available, their designs, underwriting criteria, premium structures and administrative processes. The feasibility study should identify an appropriate benefit design, the population to be served and key bid specifications.
It is understood that the Company would not bear responsibility beyond participation in the study and contributing appropriate, non-confidential data and experience from the salaried program and the UAW hourly pilot. It also is understood that if the offering of such a product is determined to be feasible, any

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Long-Term Care Pilot Program
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed the issue of long-term care benefits and. the present long-term care pilot program. The Company has indicated its concerns about such a program because of the limited information available on cost and use patterns, availability of services, and effect on the family support system. The present pilot was implemented in Louisville in April 1989.
The Company and Union agree to extend the present pilot program through September 14, 2007. However, the Company-Union Committee (described in Section 12 of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program) will evaluate this pilot and may implement appropriate changes during the term of this Agreement. The design of the program incorporates the features of the program described in a memo dated September 14,1987. The benefit coverages will be the same as the present pilot program; the annual benefit maximum per enrollee per benefit year for .home and community services shall be $9,300. The cost of the program will be no more than two and one-half cents (2.5<t) per hour worked by employees at the pilot site.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger;
Subject: Medical Emergency Care
During these negotiations, situations were discussed in which medical emergency care that meets the coverage definition of the H-S-M-D-D-V Plan was provided to Ford-UAW members but the resulting claims for these services were denied.	■
The Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan Participating Hospital Manual directs hospitals to evaluate medical emergencies by use of the following criteria:
« “The criteria for judging a medical emergency will be based on the signs or symptoms shown by the patient as verified by the physician at the time of treatment and not on the basis of final diagnosis.” In administering the medical emergency benefit, hospitals also are guided by the following information;
•	“A provisional or working diagnosis as determined by the attending physician, rather than a final diagnosis, will be used to administer the medical emergency benefit.”	.	•
Blue Cross and Blue Shield and UNICARE Life & Health Insurance Company require hospitals when completing the Universal Claim Form UB-82 for medical emergency claims to reflect the Admitting Diagnosis Code. In addition, a separate Principal Diagnosis Code is required when the final diagnosis is completed.
The above criteria also relate to billings for physician services. In Michigan, the standardized admitting form requires both an Admitting Diagnosis Code and a Final Diagnosis Code. Similar claim forms are used in other plan areas. The Medical Emergency Benefit for physician services in
615
MEDICAL EMERGENCY CARE
other plan areas also is based on the same admitting criteria that is utilized in Michigan.
Since both claim forms require data that reflect the admitting diagnosis code, and policy requires that this code be used when determining if a medical emergency exists, the Control Plan will immediately implement an action plan to include the following:	- ■
Step 1. Conduct Audits of Medical Emergency Room Claims at Selected Locations
Certain Participating Plans will ,be instructed to; .
A.	Reopen claims for a specific twelve-month period.
B.	Obtain medical records.
C.	Verify the admitting code.
D.	Determine whether or not the claim was rejected appropriately.
Audit sites for consideration could include: Florida, Georgia, Kansas City, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. Locations will be chosen upon mutual agreement of the parties.
In addition, all Participating Plans will be instructed to reopen claims and obtain medical records to verify the admitting code when they receive an inquiry on a rejected medical emergency claim.
Step 2. Develop an Aggressive Provider Education Program Participating Plans will be re-instructed in the scope and critical importance of the medical emergency benefit, and their respective provider communities wifi also be re-educated on an ongoing basis to ensure a better understanding of the reporting process and benefit coverage.
Step 3. Additional Actions
When the audits are completed (Step 1the parties will meet to determine what further corrective actions should be taken. Additional corrective actions could include:
A.	Continuous monitoring of local plan rejection rates of medical emergency claims. Should such rejection rates exceed a standard rejection rate
616

MEDICAL EMERGENCY CARE
that would be developed from the audits, the Control Plan, after discussions with the Company and Union, would then take corrective action at those aberrant plans.
B.	A process whereby any claim that cannot be paid on the basis of the diagnosis listed and on which there is not a clear indication of the presenting "	symptoms and initial diagnosis will be pended
and returned to the facility for resubmission. Such claim shall remain pended until the carrier ,	receives sufficient information to process the
claim.	.
'	C. Or other necessary actions.	’
,	The Company believes that it is essential that all negotiated
health care benefits be delivered effectively to Ford-UAW members. The Company stands ready to work with the Union and will direct the Control Plan to take whatever steps '	are necessary to ensure that these benefits are delivered in
accordance with H-S-M-D-D-V Program requirements.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Medical Management/Continuum of Care Program '
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed health care management and the importance of providing quality health care in a cost-effective manner. These discussions included the Coordinated Care Management (CCM) program, the pilot Cardiac Rehabilitation Program, the Centers of Excellence concept, the Franklin Health or similar program(s), and Hospice care. We also discussed finding a way to link present wellness activities that are under the Employee Support Services Program (ESSP) with these programs to identify opportunities for early intervention.
As soon as practible after these negotiations, the Company and Union agree through the CompanyUnion Committee, as defined in Section 12 of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program, to evaluate these existing programs with the intent of providing a healthcare model based on the Continuum of Care concept.
The Parties further agree that following this evaluation, which also will include a study of the most prevalent chronic and high cost conditions, if it is determined that there are opportunities to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of care for those who are affected by these conditions, the parties will work to incorporate these conditions in a Medical Manage-ment/Continum of Care Program. These conditions will combine the best features of the existing programs and include other care management provisions such as those listed in this letter. The Program must include all of the following elements:
• Effective population identification,
618
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT/CONTINUUM OF CARE PROGRAM
•	Positive enrollment,
•	Evidence-based practice guidelines,
•	Collaborative practice models,
•	Patient self-management education,
•	Decision support,
•	Provider accountability,
•	Routine reporting/feedback involving patients, physicians, plan and care terms, and
•	Demonstrated Return On Investment (ROI) -In addition, the parties agree to:
•	Evaluate current utilization review programs and focused utilization review and other review formats that take into account various hospital reimbursement methodologies (such as the new Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Michigan Hospital Agreements). Consideration will be given to revising the existing predetermination process with the objective of enhancing efficiency and effectiveness, taking into consideration new information, practice patterns and technological advances, prior experience, and new utilization review programs and reimbursement methods.
•	Evaluate the appropriateness of retaining independent third-party utilization reviewers.
•	Review, evaluate and, if appropriate, adjust the Case Management Program with respect to the nature of cases receiving consideration, the effective use of existing Program coverages prior to the development and implementation of Alternative Benefit Plans, early identification of cases, and Case Management for outpatient conditions.
•	Review the H-S-M-D-D-V Program provisions relating to transplant surgeries. Consider the development of pilot programs involving the "Centers of Excellence" concept as a means of enhancing both quality and cost-effective delivery of covered services.
619
MEDICAL MANAGEMENT/CONDNUUM OF CARE PROGRAM
• Explore effective ways of involving patients in treatment decisions, including but not limited to the use of interactive shared decision-making tools.
The parties will evaluate multiple vendors, including the current vendor, to determine ones which will provide the most positive results with respect to quality and cost-effectiveness for eligible enrollees. If it is determined that vendors can demonstrate successfill outcomes as well as meet or exceed the required criteria, the Company-Union Committee will choose the most appropriate vendor to manage such program.
The parties agree to continue the existing programs listed in this letter until the new program is implemented.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger:
,	Subject: National Health Plan Reform
’	During these negotiations, the Company and the Union
,	discussed initiatives presently under consideration at the
federal government level to reform the health care delivery r	system. The proposed reforms include provisions that would
'	impose, among other things, (i) liability on health care plans,
!	employers, employees, agents and other entities for punitive
and compensatory damages arising out of the provisions of benefits, (ii) requirements for timely decisions of certain .	benefit claims, (iii) access to external, independent claim
reviews, (iv) access to speciality care, and (v) protections
'	for the provider/patient relationship.
।	The likelihood of any initiatives becoming law is unknown,
and the elements and impact of any legislation cannot be
,	predicted. Nonetheless, the parties agreed that if any na;	tional health plan reform legislation is enacted during the
;	term of the agreement, the Company and the Union, through
* the Company-Union Committee, will discuss and implement '	modifications to the H-S-M-D-D-V Program that comply with
,	federal standards as they become effective. The compliance
effort will also be undertaken in a manner that achieves the i	following objectives.
• Minimizes litigation risk to the H-S-M-D-D-V Program and its fiduciaries.
!	• Provides greater opportunities for participants to resolve
denied claims through the H-S-M-D-D-V	Program appeal
'	processes.
,	• Addresses the legitimate concerns of participants in
1	awareness and understanding	of health	care issues	and
■	benefit terms.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Pharmaceutical Company Drug Promotions
During these negotiations, the Company and the Union discussed the issue of rising prescription drug costs and the efforts of major pharmaceutical companies to increase the use of high cost prescription drugs through a variety of promotional programs. Both parties expressed concern that the widespread practice of providing sample medications and various promotional incentives to providers has most likely had an adverse impact on drug costs by encouraging physicians to prescribe drugs that may not be the best value for patients or the health care plans that provide prescription drug coverage.
The Company and the Union agreed to work jointly with the various health care plans offered to Ford employees and retirees to assist them in developing professional standards that would minimize the influence that pharmaceutical company representatives may have on network physicians. The Company-Union Committee described in Section 12 of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program will meet as soon as practical to develop such performance standards and will jointly determine the specific course of action to be taken.

Subject: Physicians Charging for Completing . Company-required Disability Forms
During the course of these negotiations, the parties discussed the issue of H-S-M-D-D-V enrollees enrolled in Health Alliance Plan (HAP) being charged a fee by physicians within the Henry Ford Health System for the completion of Company-required disability forms. After investigation into this matter, the parties determined that such fees were not directed by HAP but by certain physicians who are contracted with HAP. To remedy this situation, HAP agreed that it would intervene with these physicians in an effort to eliminate this practice but if that were not successful, HAP would reimburse enrollees for such fee upon receiving proof of payment for such fee from the enrollees.

Implementation of the law shall be accomplished in a manner that promotes the purposes of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program to make available high quality,- cost effective benefits for eligible enrollees. In particular, the Company and the Union recognize and agree that the integration of such legislation into the H-S-M-D-D-V Program shall not reduce the level of benefits provided in the H-S-M-D-D-V Program and, to the extent allowed by law' shall permit the Company to administer the H-S-M-D-D-V Program as a secondary payor of prescription drag benefits.

Mr. Gerald D. Bantom
Vice President and Director	■
UAW, National Ford Department

Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Managed Care Program
During the 2003 negotiations, the parties discussed the Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Managed Care Program and concluded changes to this program were necessary. The parties also discussed the changes made during the term of the 1999 Agreement where the parties reduced the role of the Administrator in this Program by either reassigning those responsibilities to the CDRs or eliminating those items from this Program. This Program was designed to improve care for patients/clients, including alternative plan enrollees (such enrollees are covered under a separate Letter of Understanding). This Program provides, among other features, an effective follow-up plan for after-care essential for recovery. The Company and Union continue to support their commitment and agree to a managed care, limited provider psychiatric and substance abuse program with the following objectives:
•	To create an environment for all hourly employees and their eligible dependents to receive psychiatric care and substance abuse treatment most appropriate to their condition and obtain care from quality providers.
•	To place substantial emphasis upon follow-up care as a necessary part of the recovery plan.
•	To recognize that the most appropriate course of treatment will be the most cost effective in the longer term.
The parties reaffirm the components listed below which, when taken together, comprise the Managed Psychiatric
635
PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM
and Substance Abuse Program. The provisions cover all hourly active employees represented by the UAW enrolled for Traditional Plan coverage and their eligible dependents. Hourly retirees, surviving spouses and their eligible dependents will continue to receive psychiatric and substance abuse benefits under present arrangements. The Company and Union will consider whether to include these persons under a managed care plan at a later date. Until such effective date, provisions for psychiatric care and substance abuse treatment as contained in the 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement and in the Administrative Manual dated March, 2001 (or as may be updated by the parties), shall remain in effect.
A.	Program Structure	' '
1.	A Managed Care Program (MCP) with panels comprised of a limited group of participating providers for psychiatric care and substance abuse treatment have and will continue to be developed for all hourly employees and their eligible dependents,
2.	A nationwide, inpatient, limited panel of facilities (hospital, day/night programs, halfway houses, detoxification facilities and residential facilities) and an outpatient limited panel of psychiatric and substance abuse professionals (Psychiatrists, Ph.D. Psy-. choiogists, Masters degreed and licensed Psychiatric Social Workers, and Clinical Nurse Specialists with advanced training in adolescent or adult mental health nursing) and approved Outpatient Psychiatric Care facilities will be established.
3.	The Company and Union have established an Oversight Committee for the MCP. The goal of the Committee is to enhance provider accessibility, quality care, and cost effectiveness. The Committee will perform evaluations of the MCP, including establishing criteria and selecting and approving CDRs, on an as needed basis, but not less than once annually, that will include data provided by the CDR’s. Based on such evaluations, the Company and Union may address changes to the MCP (not related to enrollee eligibility or benefit provisions except as contemplated under the last paragraph in
636
PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM
Section C. 1.) that would improve MCP effectiveness.
4.	The carrier identification card contains and 800 number for pre-authorization information.
B.	CDR Responsibilities
1.	The CDR under contract with the UAW-Ford Employee Support Services Program (ESSP) will be the Case Manager for the MCP. The CDR will provide to Ford hourly employees and dependents enrolled in Traditional plan coverage the following services: assessment, differential diagnosis, treatment plan development, referral, consensus with the client and provider on the treatment plan, and follow up to support a continuum of care. The CDR, as Case Manager, also will provide the hospital predetermination function for psychiatric and substance abuse admissions presently performed by the Control Plan except that the Administrator may provide such functions for emergency and out-of-area cases as described in Section C. 2. a.
2.	If the CDR, the provider and/or the patient/client could not reach a consensus on the treatment plan, the enrollee/patient or enrollee’s/patient authorized representative has the right to appeal the CDRs decision. Claims for benefits under this Plan, or with respect to an enrollee’s right under the Plan, shall be administered in accordance with the Plan’s appeal procedures as described in the CDR Program Manual to be updated during the term of this Agreement.
3.	When referring patients/clients, the CDR will use the most appropriate providers for that case chosen from the available participating providers. In exceptional cases, the CDR, after consultation with the Administrator, may refer to a non-participating provider.
4.	Follow-up protocols by the CDR, respectful of confidentiality, should be emphasized to prevent relapse and the progressive dysfunction that occurs as a result of relapse. Following completion of the formal course of treatment, the CDR would be responsible for follow-up with the patient/client to encourage
637
PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM
receipt of the recommended continuum of care. In addition, ■ the CDR (with the permission of the pa-tientfolient) would elicit the involvement and support of the plant ESSP representative.
5.	The CDR will provide short-term problem solving services.
6.	The UAW-Ford National Programs Center would continue to fund CDR operations at the present annual calendar year level of $1.9 million for 2004 and an amount equal to 37% of total CDR costs under the MCP for 2005 and subsequent years, and also will fund additional CDR fees associated with new, non-MCP related services. CDR fees for MCP related services exceeding these amounts will be paid by the Company. The CDR shall keep adequate records so the Administrator may audit to attribute appropriate costs to each program component.
C.	Program Benefits
1.	The following psychiatric and substance abuse coverages will be provided to hourly employees and their eligible dependents enrolled in Traditional Plan coverage who receive the services listed in Section B. 1. from the CDR and receive treatment from a participating provider:
a. Inpatient - 45 day limit
-	including detoxification days
-	renewable after 60 days under the same terms as with existing hospital renewal provisions
b.
Outpatient - 35 visits; annual (calendar year) limit
- visits I - 20
- visits 21 - 35
- visits 21-35
paid in full
paid in full for substance
abuse services
paid at 75% for psychiatric services
Utilization of CDR for outpatient psychiatric or substance abuse assessment, referral, and shortterm problem solving do not count as outpatient visits.
638
PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM
c.	Day/Night - 90 visits; each visit reduces the number of remaining inpatient days by one-half day.
d.	Halfway House - 120 days lifetime maximum; no more than 90 days in any one calendar year.
e.	Psychological testing - Covered only when authorized by the CDR as medically necessary and administered by a participating provider; or when authorized by the Administrator as medically necessary in an emergency situation.
The Company and Union have expressed a mutual concern for employees and dependents who fail to complete their substance abuse continuing care treatment plans. The parties agree to monitor such use patterns. If upon consultation with the CDR the Company and Union determine that a prevalent problem exists and needs to be addressed, the Company and Union will discuss appropriate corrective actions. By mutual agreement, such actions may include future financial penalty for persons who do not complete their substance abuse treatment plans.
2.	Notwithstanding the provisions of Section C. 1., there would be certain exceptions where the patient/ client may bypass the CDR but still receive full MCP benefits:	.
a.	For ■ emergency or out-of-area (i.e. away from home plan area) cases, providers must call the
• Administrator at the 800 number within 24 hours of providing initial care to receive full MCP payment. .The Administrator will approve the ■initial care and refer the case to the appropriate
. CDR. This referral will allow the CDR to consult ■ with the provider regarding their treatment plan .
. and to monitor the prescribed care. As soon as the CDR, after consultation with the attending provider, determines it is appropriate, the pa-tient/client will be referred' to a participating provider. In such situations, the CDR, after consultation with the Administrator, may judge it appropriate to treat a non-participating provider as a participating provider under the MCP for
639
PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM
that case if the provider agrees to abide by MCP provisions.	.
b.	Full MCP benefits also may be provided to non-participating providers in exceptional cases where the CDR, after consultation with the Administrator, makes a specific referral of the pa-tient/elient to such provider. .
c.	For outpatient psychiatric cases in which the patient/client goes directly to a participating provider under the MCP, the provider will receive full payment for the initial service if the provider ■ contacts the CDR within 24 hours of providing such service. Thereafter, payment for subsequent services will be contingent upon the CDR, provider and the patient/client reaching consensus on a treatment plan. The CDR will perform its usual Case Manager responsibilities.
d.	For outpatient psychiatric cases in which the patient/client goes directly to a physician general practitioner, a non-participating provider, the provider will receive full reasonable payment for the initial service if the provider contacts the Administrator at the 800 number within 24 hours of providing such service. The Administrator will approve payment for the initial service and refer the case to the appropriate CDR. Up to two additional visits may be approved by the CDR if ‘ the CDR and the physician general practitioner agree upon the necessity of care. If continuing care is needed, the CDR will facilitate transfer of the patient/client to an approved provider.
3.	Except for Subsection 2. a., b. and d. of this Section C, patients/clients who receive psychiatric and substance abuse services from non-participating providers will receive the following benefits:
a. Psychiatric Care
- Inpatient facility care—for general acute care hospital admissions, up to $160 per day ■ plus $20 per day for ancillaries; for other facilities, $15 per day.
640
PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM
- Outpatient facility care—50% of participating provider reimbursement,
■	- Inpatient physician care—50% of participat-
ing provider reimbursement. Non-pltysician ■ -services will not be covered under the MCP.
- Outpatient physician care—50% of participating provider reimbursement. Nonphysician services will not be covered under
’ the MCP. '
b. Substance Abuse Treatment—no benefits are payable.	.
D.	ESSP Responsibilities
1-	Local ESSP representatives would continue to be integral participants and use of the ESSP represen. tatives would remain a voluntary part of the MCP.
2.	Employees and their dependents would be encouraged by the CDR to use the ESSP representative. In addition, the CDR would request authorization from the patient/client to consult with the ESSP representative on the individual’s behalf. The relationship between the ESSP representative and the patient/ client is important because the ESSP representative can provide valuable support to the patient/client and family members during the recovery process.
E.	Administrator Responsibilities ’
An Administrator for the MCP shall be mutually selected ■ by Company and Union representatives. The Administrator shall have the following responsibilities;
1.	The Administrator will establish a pane! of participating providers and obtain contracts, that have been reviewed by the Company and Union, with such providers. In selecting participating providers, the Administrator will consult with the CDR and the Oversight Committee members. In contracting with participating providers, the Administrator will ensure that the providers fully understand the provisions of the MCP including benefit levels and “hold harmless” provisions. The size of the panel should be sufficient to provide appropriate access. The Admin
541
PSYCHIATRIC AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE
MANAGED CARE PROGRAM
istrator will negotiate appropriate fees with such participating providers.
2.	The Administrator will establish an 800 number that will be staffed 24 hours a day for use by Ford members who need services under the MCP in an emergency situation or where the patient/client is out’Of-area. By using the 800 number, the Ford members will be able to obtain from the Administrator referrals to providers, to a. CDR and/or approval for initial necessary care. The Administrator will refer a case to the appropriate CDR in that area who will manage the case.
3.	The Administrator will make benefit payments to the participating providers or, in the case of services received from non-participating providers, the Administrator will make benefit payments to the member or non-participating provider, as appropriate.
4.	It is expected that the Administrator will cooperate with the CDR to enable the CDR to perform its responsibilities contained in Citis Letter of Understanding. Such' cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, sharing data necessary to perform the Case Manager function.
5.	The Administrator will undertake these responsibilities through a contract with the Company that places the Administrator at a business risk.
It is believed that this psychiatric and substance abuse program should accomplish the goal of the Company and Union of maintaining a limited provider plan for such services that better meets the needs of Ford-UAW enrollees.

Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214	.
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Psychiatric Care and Substance Abuse Treatment — Alternative Care Plans
During the past several negotiations, the Company and Union expressed their joint concern regarding the adequacy of delivery of psychiatric care and substance abuse treatment by certain approved alternative care plans. The parties also discussed the need for closer coordination between the UAW-Ford Employee Support Services Program (ESSP) and alternative care plans in connection with early identification and treatment of psychiatric and substance abuse conditions. ■
The Company and Union have agreed upon a Managed Care Program for psychiatric care and substance abuse services for ah Ford hourly active employees represented by the UAW and their eligible dependents enrolled under traditional coverage. Under this Program, to receive benefits, all such Ford hourly members generally must obtain certain services (assessment, differential diagnosis, treatment plan and referral) from the Central Diagnostic and Referral Agencies (CDR) before receiving services for psychiatric and substance abuse conditions. The Program will also encourage strongly hourly active employees represented by the UAW and their eligible dependents enrolled under alternative plan coverages to receive an assessment, diagnosis and treatment plan from the CDR before receiving services for psychiatric and substance abuse conditions from their respective alternative plan providers. In the event that the alternative plan member requests treatment from the alternative plan without first contacting the CDR, the plan is expected to coordinate treatment for such patienVclient with the CDR who should act as Case Manager. Such coordination should
643
PSYCHIATRIC CARE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT —
ALTERNATIVE CARE PLANS
recognize any limitations to comply with confidentiality restrictions.
The parties’ expectation is that:
•	the CDR’s recommended treatment for the first 24 hours of care in emergency cases will be given due consideration by the alternative plan in which the member is enrolled, provided the CDR notifies the alternative plan of the action the CDR has taken within 12 hours of commencement of treatment.
•	the alternative plans will provide expedited assessment of serious cases.	.
This Program will require close coordination between the CDR and the alternative plans. In this regard, the parties expect the alternative plans’ full participation in this Program. if these arrangements are to be effective, the relationship between the CDR and the alternative plans must be based on mutual trust, full cooperation and professionalism. Should problems arise where alternative plans and CDRs are unable to coordinate care, the parties, through the Managed Care Oversight Committee, will intervene, as appropriate.
As soon as practicable after these negotiations, the Managed Care Program Oversight Committee will establish a process whereby CDRs and alternative plans may raise concerns with each other.
In the event an alternative plan fails to cooperate with the Program guidelines, including the CDR in its role as Case Manager for the Program, the parties will consider appropriate corrective actions which may result in removal of the plan as a health care option for Ford hourly enrollees represented by the UAW.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Quality and Cost-Effective Health Care
During these negotiations, the Company and Union discussed and recognized .the importance of providing high quality, cost effective health care to eligible members. The Company recognizes the contributions made by the UAW National Ford Department towards reducing health care cost increases during the 1999 agreement. These contributions include improving the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of health care plan administration, re-bidding selected health care plan providers, improving the quality of plan delivery and administration, and improving member access to plan providers.
The parties also acknowledge that, in spite of these and other joint efforts, additional efforts are necessary to help control the increase in health care costs. The Company and Union agree that even more aggressive efforts must be pursued during the term of this agreement. These efforts will include the following measures, as well as others mutually agreed to by the parties and are intended to provide improved quality of delivery and reduce Company costs while maintaining reasonable access.
♦	Conduct re-bids of selected health care plans to improve member service and reduce costs.
•	Review the availability of alternative plans in large markets and, where feasible, reduce the number of plan offerings to create market competition while assuring reasonable access to members.
•	Identify efficient health care plans and study their administrative practices and procedures for pos-

sible inclusion in the H-S-M-D-D-V program.
•	Review alternative plan administrative processes including prescription drug management and disease management processes and, if appropriate, approve modifications through the Company-Union Committee.
•	Evaluate through the Quality, Utilization, Evaluation and Satisfaction Team (QUEST) alternative plan evaluation criteria that would be required of all alternative health care plans to be offered to eligible members. Proposed changes in provider 1 networks and administrative processes would be reviewed by the QUEST team for recommendation to the Company-Union Committee.
•	Evaluate the service delivery quality and cost effectiveness of service specific PPOs to determine if they should be continued, expanded or discontinued. Identify new service specific PPOs to include in the health care plan to improve service and cost.
•	Evaluate collaboration with other plan sponsors in the health plan bidding process to improve costs by leveraging the size of contracts.
The parties strongly support the development of new activities that will enhance quality of care and cost effectiveness and mutually agree that the Company-Union Committee will explore these and other activities. The Company-Union Committee will meet after these negotiations and develop an action plan that addresses the measures listed above by January 1, 2004.

Dear Mr. Bantom:	■
Subject: Quality Health Care Activities •	.
The Company and Union have recognized the importance of providing quality health care in a cost-efficient manner by addressing these issues in previous negotiations and by implementing pilot programs which have met our mutual objectives. The parties believe that joint efforts addressing both quality improvement and the ongoing cost effectiveness of benefits provided to employees should'be continued.
i	During these negotiations, the Company and Union reem-
phasized their commitment that the Company-Union Committee defined in Section 12 of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program is to investigate, consider and, upon mutual agreement, engage in activities that may have high potential for cost savings and improvement of quality of care. These activities may also include the implementation of Pilot Programs to maximize coverage under the H-S-M-D-D-V Program for the money spent for such protection.
Other activities to be considered by the parties include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following;
1. Develop performance standards that preferred provider organizations and health maintenance organizations must meet for acceptance and continued participation as a health care plan option under the H-S-M-D-D-V Pro-
. gram. These standards will address such issues as provider selection and retention, quality, cost, utilization, price, administration and expansion of the availability of cost-effective managed care options for the Medicare enrolled retiree and surviving spouse population.
t	2. Conduct audits of the eligibility of guardianships, prin-
cipally supported children, sponsored dependents and other categories of dependents where abuse of the eligibility provisions may occur. The intent of such audits
647
QUALITY HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES
will be to ensure that those entitled to coverage are enrolled, and that the Program provisions are not being utilized to transfer to the Program the responsibilities of other parties.
3.	Explore with the carriers and the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) methods of expediting the processing and administration of claims for enrollees with Medicareprimary coverage (e.g., Medicare “Crossover” system).
4.	Engage in efforts to increase enrollee awareness of the positive impacts of effective coordination of benefits administration and to assist in effective and expeditious carrier implementation of a pilot project to emphasize cost avoidance.
5.	'Develop and implement a process for identifying enrollees who are end-stage renal disease or kidney transplant patients and who are not enrolled.for Medicare, and for counselling them concerning the advantages of Medicare enrollment.
6.	Review the standards for appropriateness of technical surgical assistance, and nurse practitioners in underserved areas, particularly with regard to the outpatient setting.
7.	Explore pilot programs, individually or in concert with other payers, to develop relationships with high quality, cost-effective providers and to encourage enrollee use of such providers.
8.	Review, evaluate, and act upon the recommendations of the Company-Union Committee (using the assistance of outside advisors, as appropriate) regarding matters concerning the overall performance and continuation of individual HMO and PPO options on the basis of: quality, access, benefit design, cost effectiveness, and delivery of services. This review and evaluation shall utilize, in addition to the current standards, demographic adjustments for variations in age, gender, and family size, as well as other available information including health status and utilization patterns. Work with carriers to promote the development of cost-effective Health Maintenance Organization and Preferred Provider Organization options which may include offerings to Medicare and non-Medicare enrollees, in areas

where not available currently.
9.	Work with dental carriers and Dental Health Maintenance Organizations (DHMOs), to monitor utilization and to determine if there is a potential for abuse in the performance of such dental procedures as root planing and sealing, application of fluoride, occlusal equilibration and gingival curettage-	■
10.	Continue to have HMDs and PPOs develop and distribute informational materials through direct mailings or otherwise about how members may: obtain coverage and receive care; gain access to other plan services, including referrals outside of the plan network; and register complaints and utilize the plan's grievance process. The parties intend that the plans will continue to make such information available. The parties can take such mutually agreed upon steps as they deem appropriate (including termination of the plan offering) should a plan refuse to comply.	.
11.	Explore the development of wellness programs that have a positive influence on the quality of life, product produced, absenteeism, health care costs and productivity to include the following components:
•	Health Risk Assessment (including cholesterol & blood pressure screenings) to identify employees’ risks and provide motivation to reduce these risks,
•	Education to provide employees with basic knowledge and skills needed to make health lifestyle changes. ■	'
•	Maintenance to help combat the widespread problem of relapse and support change by providing ongoing awareness, group involvement and meaning. ful incentive opportunities.	' ’
•	Evaluation to identify priority needs, monitor program implementation, measure program effectiveness in reducing risk and obtain information about the overall success of the program.
12.	Explore non-traditional services that would assist in the management of serious health conditions including treatment that can alleviate chronic debilitating pain and alternative treatment modalities which will enhance
649
QUALITY HEALTH CARE ACTIVITIES
recovery during an inpatient admission.
13.	Gather and evaluate data relative to fertility services, as soon as practicable after these negotiations but prior to August 1,2004, and determine the feasibility of delivering such services in accordance with the concept described below; ■
The benefit will be designed so that a common treatment approach is achieved. Panel providers will be credentialed who:
•	are qualified in their field;
•	agree to abide by a consistent treatment of diagnostic tests, drugs, and protocols;
•	maintain quality standards; and
•	are willing to meet conditions as the parties may require.
Eligibility for services under this fertility program may be limited to those received from the panel providers. Once a pregnancy has been confirmed, the patient may continue obstetrics services with her regular doctor.
To the extent feasible the benefits may be carved- out from all plans and centered ima national reproductive services program and done in concert with the Union and their other employer partners.
The,benefits may include,,but not necessarily be limited , to, counseling, treatment for underlying conditions of sexual dysfunction, diagnostic services, pharmaceuticals, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, surgical intervention, cryopreservation, transvaginal ultrasound, and donor gamete. The parties may also consider adopting: • a set number of cycles for services (because of the declining probability of success).
•	a maximum number of transfers per cycle (in order to reduce the likelihood of multiple birth).
•	a number of episodes of treatment that will be covered under the program or otherwise set a frequency limitation.
14.	Gather and evaluate data relative to the new procedures for early detection of diseases or routine screening for conditions to determine the viability of incorporating such procedures into the hospital-surgical-medical-drug-

SAME-SEX DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS
September 15,.2003
Mr. Gerald D. Bantom.
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department 8000 East Jefferson Avenue ' Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Same-Sex Domestic Partner Benefits
The parties agreed to offer domestic partner benefits in recognition that the Company employs, and the UAW represents, people from various and diverse backgrounds. Consistent with our belief that a diverse workforce is an important asset, and in line with the interest to be fair, equitable and fiscally responsible, the Company and the UAW agreed to expand the eligibility requirements to eligible same-sex domestic partners of eligible active employees for hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and hearing-aid coverages effective August 1, 2000.
Eligibility Rules for Same-Sex Domestic Partners
The Company offers domestic partner H-S-M-D-D-V coverages to eligible active employees who have a qualifying same-sex domestic partner relationship. Employees who retired effective August 1, 2000 or after under the Ford-UAW Retirement Plan or employees who terminated effective August 1, 2000 or after as provided under Section 4 (d) of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program, while covering a domestic partner and/or a domestic partner’s eligible children, will be permitted to cover those dependents under the Company’s hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and hearing-aid coverages during retirement, subject to the applicable terms and conditions which apply to all other H-S-M-D-D-V Program participants. Additionally, in the event a retiree under the Ford-UAW Retirement Plan dies while having an eligible and enrolled domestic partner, the domestic partner (and eligible and enrolled children, if any) will be eligible for coverage in the same manner as if the domestic
653
SAME-SEX DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS
I
partner were a surviving spouse under Section 4 (e) (1) of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program. No new same-sex domestic partner dependents may be added after reI tirement.
This understanding is an expansion of Section 10, Dependent Eligibility Provision, H-S-M-D-D-V Program presently available under our Agreement for active employees and their eligible dependents. In addition, all other applicable provisions of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program shall apply.
In the event an active employee dies while having an eligible domestic partner enrolled for coverage, the Company will continue hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug, hearing-aid expense coverages (but not dental or vision expense coverages) for the enrolled and eligible domestic partner (and eligible and enrolled children, if any) as if the domestic partner were a surviving spouse under Section 4 (e) (2) or (3) of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program provided such domestic partner otherwise meets the terms of Section 4 (e) (2) or (3) (a domestic partner for this purpose will be treated as a Class A or Class B Survivor if the domestic partner relationship has existed for at least 1 year immediately prior to his/her death). Nothing contained herein shall be construed as providing eligibility for monthly survivor income benefits.
The parties agree that a same-sex domestic partnership is defined as a relationship between two people who meet ALL of the following criteria:
•	Are the same sex,
•	Have shared a continuous committed relationship with each other for no less than € (six) months, intend to do so indefinitely, and they have no such relationship with any other person,
•	Are jointly responsible for each other’s welfare and financial obligations,
•	Reside in the same household,
•	Are not related by blood to a degree of kinship that would prevent marriage from being recog-
654
SAME-SEX DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS
'' nized under the law’s of their state of residence,
•	Must reside in a state where marriage between persons of the same sex is not recognized as a valid marriage by the state, or, if residing in a state which recognizes same-sex unions, have entered into such union as recognized by the state,
*	Each is over age 18, of legal age, and legally competent to enter a contract, and
•	Neither is married to a third party.
Employees will be - required to submit a notarized affidavit attesting that their domestic partner relationship meets all of the above criteria. The effective date of coverage will be the date the affidavit is notarized provided the employee is otherwise eligible for health care coverage and notifies the Company within 30 days from the date the affidavit is notarized or, if later, the first of the month following receipt of the affidavit by the Company.
■	'	’ J	- i
The Company shall have the. right of determining eligibility for the benefit, consistent with the provisions described above. The primary enrollee claiming initial or continuing eligibility of a domestic partner and/or dependent(s), if any, shall furnish any documentation that may be necessary to substantiate the claimed eligibility of the domestic partner and/or dependent(s).	■	'
The parties agreed that in those instances where a legal jurisdiction (i.e., state) recognizes same-sex marriages, or other forms of same-sex unions, a legal marriage, or other legal union, will be required, to establish or continue coverage for those employees who reside in such jurisdiction.
In these cases, coverage will be effective as of the date of the marriage, or other such state recognized union, provided the employee is otherwise eligible for health care coverage and notifies the Company within the time limitations presently in place for adding a dependent.	■
655
SAME-SEX DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS
Children of an employee’s domestic partner will be considered eligible if they meet the requirements to be the employee’s dependents under Section 151 and 152 of the Internal Revenue Code. In those cases, employees will not be taxed on the value of the child’s coverage (see Thx Consequences below).
It continues to be the employees’ responsibility to remove dependents who are no longer eligible for coverage under the Company provided health care plans, i.e., at the point in time when they are no longer eligible under the provisions of our negotiated agreements and this letter of understanding.
Continuation of Coverage
Same-sex domestic partners, when deleted from Company provided coverage, do not qualify for COBRA coverage under the federal government’s regulations regarding COBRA continuation of coverage. In addition, certain alternative plans may not provide COBRA-like coverage. The Company has made arrangements for a COBRA-like cash pay continuation of coverage with eligibility rules and payment arrangements as apply under COBRA, for persons who no longer meet the eligibility rules as defined in this letter and under our bargaining agreement.
Tax Consequences . ,
Because of IRS regulations, enrollment of a domestic partner is likely to result in tax consequences to the employee since the IRS and state laws as of the date of this agreement do not recognize a same-sex partner as a legal spouse. In those instances when the noriemployee partner does not qualify as a dependent of the employee under1 Sections 151 and 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, the fair market value of the benefits provided for the partner win be imputed (taxable) income to the employee.
The Company will assume that when employees enroll same-sex domestic partners for hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and hearingaid coverages, the domestic partner does not meet the Internal Revenue Code requirements for dependent
656
SAME-SEX DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS
status, unless the employee provides acceptable proof to the Company to the contrary.
Confidentiality	.	.
As with all personnel files, health care elections are treated as strictly confidential information. Company and UAW Benefits Representatives will be instructed regarding the confidentiality of all benefit matters and to apply strict confidentiality regarding the issue of domestic partner eligibility.
Health Care Plan Options Accepting Same-Sex Domestic Partners
It is the intent of the Company to make same-sex domestic partner coverage available under ail health care plans offered by the Company to eligible members. Some Health Maintenance Organizations, (HMOs), Preferred Provider Organizations (PROs), and Dental Health Maintenance Organizations (DH-MOs) may not make such coverage available to the Company and therefore, the Company will not be able ,to make such coverages available to employees who are enrolled under these plans.
Some state laws may not allow insured plans to provide same-sex domestic partner benefits for health care. In these instances, employees eligible for Traditional Plan coverage who elect domestic partner coverage may change their health care plan to the Traditional Plan (which is self-insured and therefore not subject to such state laws) or to another available alternative plan that does accept domestic partner coverage, concurrent with the effective date of adding a qualifying domestic partner for coverage.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Traditional Plan PPO Network
Introduction
f	During these negotiations, the Company and the
Union discussed the various health care plans that currently are available to Ford employees and retir-F	ees. The Company expressed concern that the Tradi-
tional Plan has become increasingly less cost-effective and indicated that more favorable provider rates might be obtained if the network of participating providers was narrowed.
The Company and Union mutually agreed to develop and implement a program to administer the Tradi-F	tional Plan through a national Preferred Provider
Organization (PPO) in those states in which Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) is the claims processor. The k	basic benefit schedule will be identical to Traditional
Plan benefits, except for psychiatric care and substance abuse treatment, which will be administered separately as described in the Letter of Understand
661
TRADITIONAL PLAN PPO NETWORK
ing, subject: Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Managed Care Program, dated September 15, 3003. The following details some of the features which will comprise the basis for the new plan.
Control Plan Responsibilities
The Control Plan, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM), will assume responsibility for establishing the new PPO network and for managing day-to-day operations subject to the approval of the Company-Union Committee described in Section 12 of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program who will retain general oversight of the plan and will work with BCBSM to ensure that all enrollees have adequate provider access,
The PPO plan will be based on a panel of providers within a defined service area. In establishing and maintaining the panel of providers in each state, BCBSM will be responsible for:
•	defining the network and recruiting providers (physicians, hospitals, laboratories, therapists, etc.)
•	establishing the terms for provider participation in the panel network, including payment rates
•	credentialing providers, as appropriate
•	periodically evaluating the performance of the panel providers
•	conducting the Predetermination Program and utilization reviews
•	monitoring the appropriateness of referrals by panel physicians
The Benefit Schedule
The Traditional Plan basic benefit schedule as of September 15,2003, will be unchanged. The enrollee’s share of the cost will be determined by whether or not the provider is:
•	a panel provider
•	a BCBS participating provider
•	located within the network service area
662
TRADITIONAL PLAN PPO NETWORK
Payment in Full ' ' ' •	■ . ■
Benefits will be paid in fall if services are received from:
•	a panel provider
•	a non-panel provider outside the plan’s service area, if the provider is a BCBS participating provider
•	any provider the enrollee is referred to by a panel provider
Enrollee Co-payments
Each enrollee will be responsible for paying 10% of the reasonable and customary rate, but not more than $250 per individual or $500 in each plan year for the entire family, if services are received from:
•	A non-panel provider inside the plan’s service area, if the provider is a BCBS participating provider
•	A non-panel provider either inside or outside the service area, and the provider is not a BCBS participating provider. .	.
Office Visit Charges
Special rules apply to office visit charges by panel providers. In order to afford enrollees in the new PPO plan the opportunity to take advantage of the lowest rates paid to panel providers, office visits will be regarded as a covered service, but with a 100% co-pay. Enrollees will be responsible for paying office visit charges, but will pay the discounted PPO rate. Office visit charges paid by the enrollee will not apply to the $250 individual or $500 family annual out-of-pocket maximum described above. This special arrangement for office visits does not apply to non-panel providers. Timing
The Company and Union recognize that there are several issues concerning the transitioning of enrollees to the new program and developing appropriate adjustments to calculating the local plan’s composite premium rates (as defined in the letter of understanding: Alternative Plan Value, dated October 9,1999) to account for the differences in provider discounts.
663
TRADITIONAL PLAN PPO NETWORK
Therefore, the parties agree to further develop the specific design, resolve associated issues, develop a transition plan, and to implement the plan no later than March 1, 2005.	'

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Act of God Determinations for Employees Reporting for Work
During the present negotiations the Union requested an explanation as to how the Company determines when weather conditions are sufficiently severe to be considered an Act of God under the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan.
In making this decision the Company considers the specific weather conditions in relation to normally expected weather for the area. The weather conditions must not merely be adverse but severe. Severe weather would be expected to create hazardous travel conditions which prevent a meaningful number of Employees from reporting for work despite the exercise of reasonable effort and foresight. However, the weather conditions that would constitute an Act of God for employees who were sent home when operations were

suspended would be less severe than the conditions described in the September 17, 1987, letter entitled “Act of God Determinations - Employees Not Reporting for Work". Employees who report for work and are sent home when operations are suspended due to absenteeism of other Employees shall be considered on a qualifying layoff for the balance of the shift if the Company determines the severe weather constitutes an Act of God for such Employees reporting for work.

Dear Mr. Gettelfinger;
Subject: Act of God Determinations — Employees Not Reporting for Work
During the present negotiations, you requested an explanation as to how Company determinations are made that Employees are or are not on a qualifying layoff, within the meaning of Article I, Section 3 of the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit plan, in the event of severe weather constituting an Act of God.
In making these decisions the Company considers the following factors:	.
668
ACT OF GOD DETERMINATIONS —
EMPLOYEES NOT REPORTING FOR WORK
•	Weather conditions in relation to normally expected weather for the area and the experience of local govern' mental agencies and the population in dealing with such weather.
•	Existence of legally enforceable government directive affecting a substantial number of Employees, that any motorist will receive a fine for any driving in the affected area including television or radio announcements that driving is prohibited due to road closings. ’
•	Disaster area declarations.
•	Weather related experience of other area employers (especially any other automotive manufacturers in the area). .
•	Road closings in the vicinity of the facility which prevent reasonable access to the facility.
•	Effect of severe weather on the facility, e.g., collapsed walls, power outages, inability to move stock, etc.
« School closings.	.
•	Airport closings.
•	Government office closings.
•	Postponement or cancellation of public or private events.	' ■
•	Shutdown or serious weather-related impairment of rail and truck transportation.	'
•	Attendance and tardiness patterns in the Plant and other Company Facilities in the area.
No single factor in and of itself may be determinative. These factors are considered as a whole based on a reasonable assessment. The critical determination is the ‘impact of the severe weather, based on the pertinent factors listed above; on Employees and Facilities.
With respect to a day during which a plant operates in an area in which severe weather conditions have occurred, if over 40% of the Employees scheduled to report for work on a shift do not report to work at any time during their shift, the facts and circumstances of the local situation will be reviewed by the Company and a decision shall be made with respect to any SUB Plan eligibility for an Employee for such day.

ACT OF GOD DETERMINATIONS —
EMPLOYEES NOT REPORTING FOR WORK
It. was also agreed by the parties during these negotiations that in the case of an Employee who reports for work on a । day for which a Company determination is made that a qualifying layoff, by reasons of severe weather, exists with respect to Employees in such plant who did not report for work, all hours worked by such reporting Employee will be disregarded in calculating Compensated or Available Hours for the Week and such Employee shall be deemed to be on qualified Layoff for the shift.

AUTOMATED SUB APPLICATION PROCEDURE
September 15, 1993
Mr. Ernest Lofton
Vice President and Director
UAW, National Ford Department
8000 East Jefferson Avenue
Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject-. Automated SUB Application Procedure
During these negotiations, the Company and Union recognized the need to improve the timeliness and accuracy of	,
SUB Regular Benefit payments and to improve the efficiency of the application procedure.	<
The parties agreed to pursue the implementation of an Automated SUB Regular Benefit Application Procedure. The procedure would be implemented initially in Michigan with roll out to other states on a mutually-agreed basis as these other states develop the ability to provide the requisite information to the Company.
670

AUTOMATED SUB APPLICATION PROCEDURE
The automated procedure would be applicable to laid off Employees eligible for Regular Benefits under the Ford-UAW SUB Plan who receive a State System Benefit. The contemplated procedure described below is subject to the development of specific business process rules and the establishment of effective means of transferring potentially large volumes of information from the states to the Company.
Under the automated procedure, the Company would utilize State System Benefit payment information provided by the states to calculate the payment of Regular Benefits for each full week of layoff. For this purpose, each otherwise SUB eligible Employee's application for a State System Benefit for each week will constitute an application for a SUB Regular Benefit for the respective week. The submission of a written Regular Benefit application for each week of layoff will not be required by an Employee otherwise eligible under the automated procedure. '
A laid off Employee ineligible for a State System Benefit will be required to submit an application form for each week of layoff in accordance with the present Regular Benefit application procedure' ■	'	'
A basic condition upon which the automated SUB application procedure would be implemented is the Company's ability to obtain from the states in a timely and acceptable format, all State System Benefit payment information, including, but not limited to, any weekly Unemployment Compensation (UC), TYade Readjustment Allowance (TRA), Extended Unemployment Compensation and Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUG), necessary for the Company’s determination of an Employee’s eligibility for, and the amount of, a Regular Benefit under the Ford-UAW SUB Plan. If timely and acceptable State System Benefit information becomes unavailable from'a state after an automated procedure has been implemented, the automated procedure will be suspended in that state immediately and eligible Employees will be required to submit applications in accordance with the present Regular Benefit application procedure.
As noted, when these automated SUB application procedures apply, an Employee’s application for a State Benefit will constitute submitting an application (and supporting information) for Regular Benefits from the SUB Plan with
671
AUTOMATED SUB APPLICATION PROCEDURE
the same force and effect as though the Employee had provided the application (and related information) directly to the Plan on a paper application. Although information initially is submitted to the State Benefit system, as it affects SUB processing, the Employee will have the same responsibility for providing accurate information as applies for paper SUB applications (with determinations and appeals regarding possible SUB errors or misrepresentations determined solely under the present SUB review provisions).
In the event a significant number of Employees at a plant receive a State System Benefit and are determined by the Company to be ineligible for a Regular Benefit because they are not on a qualifying layoff under the provisions of Article I, Section 3(b)(2) of the SUB Plan, the Company will promptly notify the National Ford Department and Local Unions of such determination. In addition, the Company’s determination will be posted on local plant bulletin boards in accordance with local practices. Such posting will be deemed to satisfy the denial of benefits notice requirements as provided under Article V, Section 2(c) of the SUB Plan. This provision is intended solely to prevent substantial and duplicative SUB administrative processing and will not be interpreted in such a manner as to preclude any Employee from filing an appeal with respect to any such Company determination.

The parties agreed that effective for a layoff on or after the Effective Date the references in Article IX(4) of the SUB Plan and in Section 19C of the GIS Program to ninety (90) calendar days will be changed to one year if an Employee experiences a permanent layoff due to a plant closing.

Dear Mr. Bantom:
Subject: Employer Filed Unemployment Compensation Claims
During these negotiations, the Union expressed its interest to expand the employer filed unemployment claims process beyond its present Michigan, Missouri and Georgia locations to Company locations in other states. This is consistent with the growing interest by many states to implement various remote initiated unemployment compensation claims processes, e.g., telephone, internet and employer filed.
The Company and Union agreed to pursue the expansion of the remote initiated claims process to the benefit of those employees who are laid off from Company locations. The feasibility of implementing this process will be explored mutually, with an initial focus on those states having the larger numbers of Company employees. The final determination to implement will be based on factors such as: state willingness to participate; the ability of the Company to meet state data requirements in a mutually agreeable format; the ability of the Company and state to find mutually agreeable data transmission methods; development and maintenance costs; and other related factors. ■	-

676
EXHAUSTION OF SUB CAP
As of such 1987 Plan reinstatement date, an Employee’s Credit Unit balance, if any, shall be the unused balance of Credit Units (i) to the employee’s credit on October 29,1990, if on the active employment rolls on such date,'- or - (ii) remaining to the employee’s credit as of the employee’s return to work date subsequent to October 29, 1990, if on layoff on October 29, 1990, or (iii) remaining to the employee’s credit as of the 1987 Plan reinstatement date, if the employee is on layoff as of October 29,1990 and does not return to work prior to such Plan reinstatement date, or (iv) suspended under the provisions of item #2 of the “Level of Benefit Entitlement for Laid-Off Employees" Letter of Understanding attached to the 1990 SUB Plan, dated October 7, 1990.

Dear Mr. Yokich:
Subject: GIS Eligibility — San Jose and Sheffield
During the 1984 negotiations, the Union expressed concern over certain Employees from the San Jose, California and Sheffield, Alabama Plants who had fifteen (15) or more years of Seniority on March 1, 1982, but were on disability leave of absence on and after March 1, 1982. The Employees subsequently recovered and reported for work but were placed directly on layoff (without returning to work) because their Plant closed. Such laid-off Employees would otherwise have been eligible under the GIS Program had they not been on disability leave, but solely because of such leave were ineligible under the Program because they were not “at work” for the Company on or after March 1, 1982.
The parties have agreed that effective October 29,1984, San Jose, California and Sheffield, Alabama Employees who had at least fifteen (15) years of Seniority on March 1, 1982, were on disability leave on and after March 1, 1982, subsequently recovered, reported for work and were placed on layoff, and who except for such disability leave, would have been scheduled to work on or after March 1, 1982, shall be deemed to have satisfied the Program requirement of having been “at work” on or after March 1, 1982 and, if otherwise eligible, shall be eligible for GIS Benefits for weeks of layoff beginning on or after October 29, 1984.

Subject: GIS — Health Care Coverage
The purpose of this letter is to confirm the discussions between the parties during these negotiations as to the supplementary nature of the hospital-surgical-medical coverage (HSM Coverage) or hospital-surgical-medicalprescription drug-vision-hearing aid coverage (HSMDVH Coverage) under Section 4B of the Guaranteed Income Stream Benefit Program (the GIS Program). The Company will provide HSM Coverage or HSMDVH Coverage in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1 of the H-S-M-D-D-V Program through Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan utilizing an Administrative Services Only arrangement. If any insurer or self-insurer whose hospital-surgical-medical coverage or hospital-surgical-medical-prescription drug-vision-hearing aid coverage is intended to be supplemented denies benefits to an Employee because of the coverage available under the GIS Program, the Company will take such steps as it deems appropriate to compel the insurer or self-insurer to provide such coverage. Further, as stated in Section 5D of the Agreement concerning the GIS Program, the Program may be modified by the Company, with respect to eligible Employees in a state where other such Coverage is being denied, in order to meet the intent of the parties to provide HSM or HSMDVH Coverage on a supplementary basis.

In the interim, however, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan will reimburse the eligible Employee or the provider for payments otherwise covered by the HSM or HSM-DVH Coverage as if there were no other such coverage available to the Employee.

the Union with information as to the revenues of subsidiaries established or acquired since 1998 and the percentage of such revenues which is Automotive Related (as defined in the Profit Sharing Plan). The Company will notify the Union I	of the Company’s determination of whether or not such
!	subsidiaries are Automotive Related and the basis upon
I	which such determination was made.
The Company agreed that, in the event a non-Automotive Related subsidiary is established from an existing compo-rient or components of U. 8. Operations in which employees are covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreements, such subsidiary's sales and profits would be included in Sales and ,	Profits (as such terms are defined in the Plan), for purposes
of determining the Tbtal Profit Share, in the same proportion that sales of the operations formerly included in U.S. Opera,	tions that are included in such subsidiary bear to the total
i	U.S. sales of such subsidiary. Such calculations would be
made for each Plan Year using the proportion determined for the latest year for which such sales data are available.
The Company further agreed that such otherwise eligible employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreements included in such newly established subsidiaries would continue to be covered by the 2003 Profit Sharing Agreement. Such employees shall be considered Eligible Hourly Employees (as such term is defined in the Plan) for all purposes of the Plan. Also, for purposes of determining the Allocated Profit Share, the number of Salaried Employees of such subsidiaries will be deemed to be the number of persons who would have been Salaried Employees if the component of the
691
PROFIT SHARING PLAN — ESTABLISHMENT OF SUBSIDIARIES
newly established subsidiary had remained a component of U.S. Operations or, if such number is unavailable, that number will be determined by multiplying the number of Eligible Hourly Employees at such subsidiary by the ratio of the number of Salaried Employees on the last date such number was available to the number of Eligible Hourly Employees on such date.
The parties agree to work out a mutually satisfactory solution to any technical problem that may arise in implementing this understanding.

Dear Mr. Lofton:
Subject: Profit Sharing Plan — Local Union Leave
During discussions between the parties held in conjunction with completing the Profit Sharing Plan language, the Union requested that all employees on leave under Article VIII, Section 31(a) of the present Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and the Union to engage in the t	business of or to work for the Local Union be included as
eligible participants under such Plan. The Company pointed out, however, that certain employees, such as Trustees, Sergeants at Arms, and Guides, and any other employees not involved in the in-plant administration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, would not be included in the Plan, and would not receive eligible pay under the Plan while on such leave. Moreover, it is understood that the Local Union will advise Local Management each year, in December, of the name, Social Security number, job title and periods of time each employee is eligible for benefits under the Profit Sharing Plan. Local Management shall review and verify whether the employee was on approved leave.

To elect not to be covered for a year, an individual, by December 1 of the preceding year, must deliver to the Administrative Committee an election not to be covered for the year in question. Except as provided in the following sentence, in order for an individual who has elected not to be covered to regain coverage for a year, the individual by December 1 of the preceding year, must deliver to the Administrative Committee an election to be covered for the year in question.

Medical leaves issued under the above circumstances also	«
have been considered subject to the third paragraph of
Article VTH, Section 5(4) which permits the Company to cancel medical leaves in unusual situations such as suspected abuse of the Company’s medical leave procedure.
During 1984 negotiations, the parties spent considerable time discussing circumstances under which medical leaves are cancelled by the Company. As a result of these discussions, the Company informed the Union that where a medical leave is issued under the terms and conditions

ADMINISTRATION OF ARTICLE VIII, SECTION 5(4)

either by birth or by adoption.
•	Brother or Sister~The relationship that is established by having the same parents or one parent in common by birth or by legal adoption.
•	Stepbrother or Stepsister—A son or daughter of one’s stepparent by a former marriage.
3.	The employee must make written application and, upon request, present substantiating evidence of their relationship to the deceased and of attendance at the funeral. Acceptable evidence of relationship to the deceased may be in the form of a published obituary or church notice or record that lists the employee as a	i
member of the immediate family, a copy of the death certificate or a birth certificate. Also, a statement from the employee’s supervisor or another member of management who may have personal knowledge of the employee's relationship to the deceased would be sufficient to establish this fact.
The employee’s statement of attendance at the funeral	1
normally will be accepted; but, where abuse is suspected, substantiating evidence such as a statement from the funeral director may be requested. Further, in cases where the body of a member of an otherwise eligible employee’s immediate family is cremated and a	j
bona fide memorial service is held at a funeral home or a place of worship in the same community area at the time of cremation, attendance at the memorial service will satisfy the requirement of attending the funeral.
In administering this phase of the provision, plant personnel should keep in mind that it is not the Company’s intention to impose an unnecessary or unreasonable burden of proof upon the employee, but simply to insure that this provision is not abused. Put another way, it will not be the requirement in each case to secure massive, airtight proof; but the facts should be sufficiently established to assure that misapplication or abuse does not occur. A greater degree of control will be necessary in the case of covered steprelatives and grandparents to assure that misapplication or abuse does not occur.
4.	An employee may be eligible to receive bereavement pay more than once in any calendar year; however, in the

case of simultaneous deaths in an employee’s immediate family, or deaths occurring within the same three-day period or five-day period in the case of the death of an employee's present spouse, parent, child, stepchild, or in the case of multiple deaths of members of the employee’s immediate family, only one bereavement payment will be made for any one day. For example, if the death of an employee’s grandparents should occur on the same day, one day or two days apart, the employee would be eligible for five days of bereavement pay.
Pay Provisions	.
1.	The employee will receive pay for up to three (3) regularly scheduled days of work during the three (3) days (excluding Saturdays and Sundays, and regular days off in the case of seven-day operations) or five (5j regularly scheduled days of work, in the case of the death of an employee’s present spouse, parent, child, stepchild, or in the case of multiple deaths of members of the employee’s immediate family, (excluding Saturdays and Sundays, and regular days off in the case of sevenday operations) immediately following the death. As a matter of policy, holidays are also excluded. Days an employee is not regularly scheduled to work because the employee is on vacation, on layoff or on leave of absence are not excluded; however, an employee who is granted a personal leave of absence expressly because of the illness of a member of their immediate family who subsequently dies during the stated period of the leave will be eligible for bereavement pay. (See attachment for various scheduling examples.)
2.	For purposes of determining days for which bereavement pay will be provided, the bereavement period will begin on the first full day of absence following death. Thus, it may begin on the day of death if the employee has performed no work that day; or, if the employee has performed work, it will begin the following day.
3.	The requirements that the bereavement period will begin on the first full day of absence following death and will be the three regularly scheduled days of work during the three days (excluding holidays and Saturdays and Sundays and regular days off in case of seven-day
721

UAW-REPRESENTED HOURLY EMPLOYEES
operations) or five regularly scheduled days of work, in the case of the death of an employee’s present spouse, parent, child, stepchild, or in case of multiple deaths of other members of the employee’s immediate family, during the five days (excluding holidays and Saturdays. and Sundays, and regular days off in case of seven-day operations) immediately following death are waived when the date of the funeral is outside the three or five-day period. In these situations, bereavement payment will be made to eligible employees for any three regularly scheduled days or five regularly scheduled days in the case of the death of an employee’s present spouse, parent, child, stepchild, or in the case of multiple deaths of other members of the employee's immediate family, not necessarily consecutive, up to and including the date of the funeral. To cite an example, if the death occurs on Sunday and the funeral is held on Friday, an employee would be eligible for any three days or five days in the case of the death of an employee’s current spouse, parent, child, stepchild, or in the case of multiple deaths of other members of the employee's immediate family of absence from regularly scheduled work occurring Monday through Friday.
In addition, if in the opinion of local management travel considerations in attending a funeral are involved, up to two calendar days immediately following the funeral may be considered as part of the three or five-day bereavement pay eligibility period, provided such days are within the employee’s regular five-day workweek and the employee is scheduled to work such days. Calendar days for this purpose include holidays and Saturdays and Sundays (Sundays and Mondays for Tuesday through Saturday #1 shift employees) or regular days off in the case of seven-day employees. For example, where a funeral is held on Friday and local management determines two days’ return travel time is required fur a five-day Monday through Friday employee, Saturday and Sunday would be the calendar days immediately following the funeral and, as they are not within the regular five-day workweek, bereavement payment would not be made for these two days. On the other hand, for a seven-day employee who is scheduled to work on Satur
722
BEREAVEMENT PAY FOR
UAW-REPRESENTED HOURLY EMPLOYEES
day and Sunday as part of the forty-hour workweek, such days could be considered for bereavement payment.
4.	Payment may not exceed eight hours per day and will be at the employee’s regular straight-time hourly rate on the last day worked (or in the case of incentive employees the employee’s average straight-time hourly earnings including incentive earnings for the last four pay periods ;	worked immediately preceding the week prior to the
week in which the absence commences) including shift premium and seven-day operations bonus, where applicable, but excluding overtime and any other premiums.
r	5. Paid absence time because of bereavement will not be
counted as hours worked for purposes of overtime.
Procedure
'	1. The employee should make application at the Hourly
Employment activity on Form 618 (Application for Bereavement Pay).
>>	2. Form 618 should then be returned to the Hourly Em-
ployment activity for additional verification if deemed appropriate or necessary, and for authorization of payment.
3.	When verification has been made, the Hourly Employ-r	■ ment activity should complete Form 618, after insuring
the accuracy of the dates shown, by listing the total r	number of hours payable and the rate of pay for which
bereavement payment should be made. In the case of employees under incentive plans, write in “Inc.” in the k	space provided for rate of pay. After the authorizing
signature of the Labor Relations supervisor has been obtained, Form 618 should be distributed as follows:

UAW-REPRESENTED HOURLY EMPLOYEES
qualify for holiday pay, even though a bereavement day intervenes between the holiday and such scheduled day. For example, when the holiday falls on Wednesday and days for which the employee receives bereavement pay are Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, the employee must work on Friday (the next scheduled working day following the holiday) in order to qualify for holiday pay.
Vacation
The day(s) an employee receives bereavement pay will not be counted as day(s) of absence in computing hours of vacation entitlement.
Retirement
For each hour the employee receives bereavement pay from the Company, the employee will be given credit in computing future service credits under the retirement plan.
SUB
If the 1987 SUB Plan is reactivated, any week or part thereof in which an employee is absent and receives bereavement pay will be counted for accruing SUB credit units.	.
Daily Report of Time	.
Days of absence because of a death in the immediate family, even though the employee may be eligible for bereavement pay for these days, will continue to be recorded as absent time on the supervisor’s Daily Report of Time in the same manner as heretofore.

APPLICATION OF BEREAVEMENT PAY
Example
1.	The first day of absence because of death in the immediate family occurs on Friday. The days for which the employee becomes eligible for bereavement pay are Friday and the following Monday and Tuesday (also Wednesday and Thursday if death of spouse, parent, child, stepchild or in the case of multiple deaths of members of the employee’s immediate family).
2.	The first day of absence occurs on Monday. The employee is not scheduled to work on Wednesday because it is a holiday- Eligible days of bereavement are Monday, Tuesday and Thursday (also Friday and Monday if death of spouse, parent, child, stepchild or in the case of multiple deaths of members of the employee’s immediate family).
3.	An employee is on scheduled vacation Monday through Friday. A death in the employee's immediate family occurs on Tuesday. The employee is not entitled to bereavement pay because in the three-day period immediately following the death the employee was not scheduled to work (but eligible for the following Monday and Tuesday if death of spouse, parent, child, stepchild or in the case of multiple deaths of members of the employee's immediate family). However, if in the above example death occurred on Thursday, the employee becomes eligible for bereavement pay on the following Monday and Tuesday if otherwise scheduled to work (also Wednesday and Thursday if death of spouse, parent, child, stepchild or in the case of multiple deaths of members of the employee’s immediate family).
4.	Friday is a day of temporary layoff. The employee is absent beginning Wednesday because of a death in the employee’s immediate family. In this case the employee is eligible for only two days of bereavement pay (or four days if death of spouse, parent, child, stepchild or in the case of multiple deaths of members of the employee’s immediate family) because the employee was not sched

Director and Managers,
Industrial’Relations Office, NAAO
Division Industrial Relations Managers
Division Personnel and Organization Managers
Persons Designated by the Above
Subject: Excused Absence Allowance —• UAW Hourly Employees
The eligibility requirements, pay provisions, procedures and general rules as set forth below are to be used in the administration of Article IX, Section 25(c), Excused Absence Allowance.
Eligibility Requirements
1.	Absences because of personal illness or other personal reasons must be excused by the employee’s supervisor for an absence payment to be made.	.
2.	In the case of personal illness, detailed proof will usually not be required when the employee's absences are no more frequent than what could be reasonably expected of the normal employee. However, if an employee's attendance record is such that there is good reason to doubt the validity of a particular absence, a request for an excused absence payment may be denied unless the absence is substantiated by convincing proof.
3.	In the case of other personal reasons, requests for excused absence payments should be made in advance when the employee is reasonably able to do so. When the employee is not excused in advance and .there is good reason to doubt the justification for failure to have been excused in advance, a request for an excused absence payment may be denied.
4.	Notwithstanding No. 3 above, requests for excused absence payments for other personal reasons shall be granted provided that: (a) the employee makes a written request on a form supplied by the Company at least one week in advance of the requested day; (b) there will be no adverse impact on operations (and if more than one employee desires the same day off, this will be taken into consideration when determining operational impact);
727
T
EXCUSED ABSENCE ALLOWANCE —
UAW HOURLY EMPLOYEES
and (c) if more employees, working for the same immediate supervisor, request the same day off than can be accommodated, the first employee(s) submitting a written request shall be granted the day off..
5.	Notwithstanding Nos. 2 and 3 above, supervision should, in considering requests for excused absence payments for the day immediately prior to, or following a holiday (s), be guided by criteria now used to determine holiday pay eligibility when employees are absent on these days; that is:
a.	Absences because of claimed illness must be medically substantiated before an excused absence payment is made.
b.	Absences because of other personal reasons ordinarily must have been excused in advance.
6.	Inasmuch as Saturdays and Sundays are not normally considered part of the vacation period, excused absence payments may not be made for these days when an employee is absent from scheduled work, except that, in the case of a seven-day operations employee, an excused absence payment may be made when Saturday or Sunday is part of the employee’s 40-hour scheduled workweek.
7.	In scheduling portions of the 40 Excused Absence Allowance hours as additional vacation, such time must be added to other scheduled vacation time and not scheduled as separate days or parts thereof. For example, a primary use of these 40 hours will be to enable an employee with 60 or 100 hours of regular vacation eligibility to round out a half-week period. Depending on production and vacation scheduling requirements, these hours may also be used as extra vacation in other ways as well—again, so long as they are added to other vacation time.
8.	For purposes of Paragraph (3) of Section 25(c), “additional scheduled vacation time" shall be the scheduled number of hours that exceed the total amount of other vacation hours for which an employee is eligible. For example, an employee with 100 hours of vacation eligibility (60 regular hours and 40 additional hours) who is scheduled for a continuous vacation period -of two
728
EXCUSED ABSENCE ALLOWANCE —
UAW HOURLY EMPLOYEES
weeks (80 hours) would have 20 hours of the scheduled vacation period applied against the 40 hours available under Section 25(c). If, on the other hand, an employee is scheduled for 60 hours of. vacation, none of these hours would be charged to the 40 Excused Absence Allowance hours because they do . not exceed the total amount of regular vacation time to which the employee is entitled.
9.	An employee whose vacation allowance is reduced as a result of not being on the active employment roll 32 ‘	weeks or more, or because of accumulating more than 35
unexcused days of absence in the preceding vacation period prior to the employee’s eligibility date, may use only 20 hours of the reduced vacation allowance to pay for excused absence because of personal illness or other r	personal reasons. For example, an employee whose
vacation allowance is reduced from 140 hours to 70 hours as a result of not being on the active roll at least 32 r	weeks, may use only 20 of the 70 hours’ vacation
allowance for excused absence payments.
10.	The Company’s right to schedule vacation does not I	extend to the 40 hours provided for under Section 25(c)
r	unless the employee elects to use such hours as addi-
tional vacation. An employee does not have to schedule these hours as vacation. However, once all or a portion of these hours have been requested as additional vacation and are so scheduled, the employee may not revoke this designation without Company approval for the purpose of using such hours for excused absence payments.
'	11, The Company’s right to deny vacation and instead pay in
lieu of vacation, as provided for in Article IX, Section 25(d), does not apply to the 40 hours available under the Vacation Plan as excused absence payments for personal illness or other persona] reasons. These hours may be f	taken by the employee for such purposes so long as the
time off is excused and the employee meets the other eligibility requirements described above.
Pay Provisions
I	1. An excused absence payment shall be paid on the same
f	basis as regular vacation, i.e., at the employee’s basic
hourly rate, inclusive of shift premium but exclusive of
*	729
EXCUSED ABSENCE ALLOWANCE —
UAW HOURLY EMPLOYEES
all other premiums, on the date such period begins. For an employee working under incentive plans, the hourly rate to be used instead of basic hourly rate shall be the employee’s average straight-time hourly earnings, including incentive earnings and shift premium, but excluding all other premiums, for the last four pay periods worked immediately preceding the week prior to the week in which the excused absence or vacation commences.
2.	If by the last day of any vacation period, an eligible employee has not received a vacation, including unused Excused Absence Allowance hours, the employee shall be paid a lump sum as vacation pay in lieu of vacation, the sum to be computed as the amount to which the employee would be entitled if the vacation were to begin on the last day of the vacation period.
3.	Hours for which excused absence payments are made shall not be considered as time worked for purposes of determining overtime premiums.
Procedures
1.	The employee should make application for an excused absence payment for personal illness or other personal reasons on revised Form 2611 (Vacation/Excused Absence Pay Request).
2.	When completed, Form 2611 should be distributed by the supervisors as follows:
Original—Payroll
Duplicate—Timekeeping
Triplicate—Supervision-Plant Office Quadruplicate—Employee
The ‘'Supervision-Plant Office" copy should be used for two main purposes: (1) to maintain a current record of each employee’s hours of vacation/excused absence allowance; and (2) to record excused absence days as such on individual employee absenteeism records maintained at many locations. For this latter purpose, if such records are maintained by the Plant Employment activity, arrangements should be made with the Timekeeping activity io obtain a regular report of employees receiving excused absence payments.

3.	Regardless of whether an excused absence payment is made for a particular dayfs) of absence because of personal illness or other personal reasons, such time will continue to be recorded as absent time on the supervisor’s Daily Report of Time in the same manner as heretofore.
General Rules
1.	In order to qualify for holiday pay, the employee must work the scheduled working days prior to and following the holiday(s) in the same workweek or, in the case of the Christmas holiday period, regardless of workweek, even though a day of excused absence intervenes between the holiday(s) and such scheduled day.
2.	Hours for which an employee receives an excused absence payment shall be used in computing future service credits under the Retirement Plan.
3.	Any week, or part thereof, in which an employee is absent and receives an excused absence payment shall be counted for accruing SUB credit units.
4.	A day for which an excused absence payment has been made will be excluded insofar as the 35-day absence count in computing vacation entitlement is concerned.

temporary assignment to another location — COMPENSATION FOR TRAVEL TIME
September 16, 1996
Operations/Division Human Resources Managers Operations/Division Labor Relations Managers Plant and Parts Distribution Center	-
Human Resources Managers
Persons Designated by the Above
Subject: Temporary Assignment to Another Location — Compensation For Travel Time
Increased instances of travel by hourly employees which are attributable to work and/or training assignments have given rise to numerous questions regarding payment for the travel time associated with such assignments. Compensation for travel time in these situations is addressed in Article IX, Section 16 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. In addition, these payments are subject to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and various interpretive Bulletins issued by the Federal Wage and Hour Administration, U. S. Department of Labor. This letter will summarize these current interpretations and outline guidelines for the administration of travel time payments.
Paragraph (2) of Article IX, Section 16 states that when an employee is required by the Company to spend a portion of the time during which the employee normally is scheduled to work in traveling to or from the plant the employee is temporarily assigned, the employee shall be compensated for such portion as if it were time worked. This means, for example, that a day shift employee whose normal schedule is from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. would be eligible for travel pay on any of the seven days of the week, including holidays, if the travel occurs during those hours. Conversely, a third shift employee whose normal schedule is from 3:30 p.m. to 12 midnight would not be eligible for travel pay if traveled on any day prior to 3:30 p.m. Although these criteria are consistent with current interpretations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, their application often results in disparate treatment of hourly employees depending upon the individual travel circumstances involved.
735
TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT TO ANOTHER LOCATION —
COMPENSATION FOR TRAVEL TIME
For this reason, the following guidelines have been established to provide equitable and consistent treatment of all hourly employees engaged in Company-directed travel:
• When employees travel to another city on the day prior to a temporary training or work assignment, regardless of the assignment’s duration, they are to be paid for all such travel time at their regular hourly rate including appropriate premiums as follows:
-	Air Travel; Travel time begins at the scheduled flight departure time until the actual arrival at the airport, plus actual ground travel, up to two (2) hours, to the destination, for example, hotel/motel, seminar, or work location, etc.
-	Driving Personal or Company Vehicle: Travel time begins at the time the employee leaves home until arrival at the destination, for example, hotel/motel, seminar or work location, etc., if not more than 300 ‘ miles. If the destination is over 300 miles, the employee will be paid the air travel time as prescribed above.
• Assuming that the return trip occurs outside of the normal work hours on the last day of the temporary assignment, employees are to be paid such travel hours at Che regular hourly rate, including appropriate premium as follows:
-	Air Travel: Travel time begins at the scheduled flight departure time until the actual arrival at the airport, plus the actual ground travel to the employee’s home, up to two (2) hours.
-	Driving Personal or Company Vehicle; Travel time begins at the time the employee leaves the temporary training, assignment, seminar, or work location until arrival at the employee’s home if not more than 300 miles. If the destination is over 300 miles, the employee will be paid the air travel time as prescribed above.
• These temporary assignments, particularly for training events, are held during day shift hours.
736
TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENT TO ANOTHER LOCATION —
COMPENSATION FOR TRAVEL TIME
•	In the event there are extenuating circumstances concerning a particular travel situation, the plant Human Resources Manager may approve additional travel time after concurrence from the Arbitration and Wage Administration Section, Labor Affairs.
•	Travel time for special one-day assignments to another city is compensable even though it may be outside of the employee’s'normal work hours. On such occasion, however, the normal travel time from the employee’s home to the regular work location should be deducted when computing travel pay. Total remaining travel time is to be paid at the applicable overtime rate to the extent the combined travel and training/work hours exceed eight (8).	.
Trave] time for temporary one-day assignments within the same zone (as defined for purposes of Preferential Placement) as the employee’s home location is not considered compensable work time.
•	When commercial travel is provided and the employee elects to use private transportation, travel compensation, if applicable, is based on the commercial travel time that would have been required.
•	When commercial travel arrangements are provided outside of normal work hours and an employee elects to travel during normal work hours through personal preference (traveling for example, on Saturday morning rather than Friday evening), travel time is not paid.
It should be noted, that for days spent performing work or attending training sessions where travel considerations outside of normal hours are not involved, employees should be paid the greater of eight (8) hours or the actual hours spent in the session(s). Overtime premium payments should be paid for hours over eight (8) in a day.
