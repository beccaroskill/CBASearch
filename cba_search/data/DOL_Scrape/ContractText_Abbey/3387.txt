Prescription Program
Generic Pricing means that, if the physician does not specify a brand name drug and a generic equivalent is available, the pharmacist will substitute the generic^ehvered as written (D.A.W.))
Members who insist ou the brand name'drug when a generic is available will be required to pay the higher brand name co-payment, plus the difference in cost between the brand name and generic drug. For example, if a brand name drug is S108 and its generic equivalent is S41, the employee electing the brand name -will need to pay the brand name co-payment plus the S67 difference.
Of course, if no generic is available, the member continues to pay only the brand co-payment.
Does generic substitution compromise the quality of your employees’ prescriptions?
Absolutely not Generic drugs, or drugs sold under a "generic" or chemical name, are identical in chemical composition and have the same therapeutic effect as brand name drugs. Generic drugs . meet the same strict PDA (Food and Drug Admmlsfration) requirements a brand~name drugs. In. fact, the only significant difference between generic and brand name drugs is generic drugs cost i considerably less.

Attachment 3
Pension Changes Agreed Upon
The Port Authority of Allegheny County Retirement and Disability Allowance Plan for Employees Represented by Local 85 of the Amalgamated Transit Union (the "Plan") shall be amended effective December 1, 1997 to provide the following benefits:
1.	One time ad hoc cost of living increase for retirees as follows:
1.	15% if retired prior to 1/1/85
2.	10% if retired between 1/1/85 and 11/30/91
3.	2 1/2% if retired pursuant to and receiving benefits under the special
retirement option offered pursuant to the bargaining agreement effective December 1, 1991 as set forth in Appendix III of Plan document (the "Window Package")
4.	5% if retired between 12/1/91 and 11/30/97 forthose retirees whose
benefits were not enhanced by the Window Package.
This is a one time only adjustment which will not apply to those who retire after November 30, 1997. The above increase shall begin December 1, 1997 and shall not be applied to the $300.00 monthly supplement payable pursuant to the Window Package.
2.	Only certain employees have been credited with pension service with respect to their initial training while on the payroll of Port Authority at the beginning of the employee’s employment with Port Authority. For pension calculation purposes only, and not with respect to any other employee benefits or seniority under the collective bargaining agreement, service credit shall be recognized with respect to time served in Port Authority sponsored initial training on the payroll of Port Authority at the beginning of the employee’s service with Port Authority. This recognition of service shall only apply to those unit employees on the payroll as active employees on December 1, 1997. This provision will make the starting service date for pension purposes uniform for all unit employees as of December 1, 1997. Beginning January 1, 1998, employees accruing such service will contribute participant contributions with respect to this pension service in the same manner and respect as contributions made for other currently accruing pension service.
3.	Effective December 1, 1997, a $500.00 per month retirement supplement will be paid to eligible employees who retire on or after December 1, 1997. To be eligible, an employee must (a) retire pursuant to the terms of the Plan on or after P349693 1
13
December 30, 1997
December 1, 1997, (b) have rendered at least 25 years of service in the unit and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, and (c) have not attained the age at which the employee would be entitled to a reduced or unreduced old-age insurance benefit under Title II of the Social Security Act ("Social Security Benefit"). The supplement will be paid for each month beginning on the employee’s retirement date until the earlier of the month in which employee attains the age at which he or she is entitled to a reduced Social Security Benefit (currently age 62) or until the employee's death. If the employee’s Social Security Benefit (assuming for purposes of this calculation the employee, on his/her retirement date, had attained the age necessary to receive such benefit) is less than $500.00, then the $500.00 supplement will be reduced to be equal to such Social Security Benefit.
4.	Currently employees are not paid for accumulated sick leave at retirement. Currently the Plan states that in computing Continuous Service "there shall be included all unused sick leave credited to the employee at his retirement" (hereinafter "Service Credit"). Beginning for retirements on or after December 1, 1997, employees will be paid from the Plan, in a lump-sum, one-half the current value of sick days accrued at the time of retirement, or if so elected by the employee, as an alternative to the lump-sum payment, the employee will be permitted to elect to receive the Service Credit. Employees who receive the lump-sum payment will not be eligible for the Service Credit. The lump-sum payment will not be used in the calculation of the pension benefit. The election of Service Credit must be pursuant to the forms developed by Port Authority.
5.	Currently employees receiving benefits pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the "Act") who return to active employment with Port Authority are credited with Continuous Service under the Plan with respect to the period during which they were not actively employed but rather were receiving benefits pursuant to the Act. Beginning for employees who leave active employment on or after April 1, 1998 and receive benefits under the Act and return thereafter to active employment, in order for such employees to receive credit for the period during which they receive benefits under the Act, they must, within (180) days of return to active employment, contribute to the Plan the employee contributions that they would have paid had they made employee contributions on the amount of benefits received under the Act. Failure of the employee to make such employee contributions will result in Continuous Service of the employee being determined without inclusion of the period during which benefits under the Act were received and thus Continuous Service of the employee will be determined by adding Continuous Service prior to the beginning of the benefits under the Act to Continuous Service after the benefits under the Act stop.
6.	Currently Plan participants receiving a disability allowance from the Plan who return to active employment with Port Authority are credited with Continuous Service
P349593 1
14
December 30, 1997
under the Plan with respect to the period during which they were not actively employed but rather were receiving a disability allowance from the Plan. Beginning for Plan participants who leave active employment on or after April 1, 1998 and receive a disability allowance under the Plan and return thereafter to active employment, the period during which they receive the disability allowance will not be credited as Continuous Service. Thus Continuous Service of the employee shall be determined by adding the Continuous Service prior to beginning of the disability allowance to the Continuous Service after the disability allowance stops.
P349693.1

Attachment 4
December 30, 1997
Section 1001 in the Agreement which expires on November 30, 1997 shall be -deleted and replaced by the following new Section 1001 in the Agreement to be effective 12:01 a.m. December 1, 1997.
Section 1001 SMALL TRANSIT VEHICLES
The parties have agreed to the continued introduction and use of Small Transit Vehicles (STV’s) for the purposes of providing service (1) to Low Density Areas, which are defined hereinafter and, (2) fixed routes replaced on a limited basis as set forth hereinafter. Therefore, the parties agree that effective on or after December 1, 1997, STV’s may be added in Port Authority’s service area under the following conditions:
1.	The matter set forth in the introductory paragraph above is hereby incorporated and included in this Agreement.
2.	A small transit vehicle (STV) is any transit vehicle with an original seating capacity of not more than 24 seated passengers.
3.	A Low Density Area is defined as an area not serviced by the Port Authority existing fixed route service. Fixed route service is defined as service being provided by large buses or LRV's. The low density area to be serviced by the STV’s may cross, extend, supplement or parallel existing service, provided that the route is designed to supplement ridership on existing routes and does not replace fixed route service.
P 339800.1
16
Attachment 4
December 30, 1997
4.	STV’s shall be permitted to replace any fixed route service only on the limited basis as set forth in this paragraph. STV’s may be used to replace fixed route service as long as the number of STV’s used to service any fixed routes does not exceed 3% of the total number of large buses in customer service at peak time operation. (Currently in the fall of 1997, there are 740 such large buses; therefore, the number of STV’s to be used to service existing fixed route service is set at 22).
5.	If any layoffs occur for any reason during the term of this Agreement, operators shall be entitled to bump operators at the 65% rate without any reduction in pay.
6.	STV’s may be leased or purchased at the discretion of Port Authority.
7.	Port Authority maintenance employees shall do all first echelon maintenance on all STV vehicles used by Port Authority. First echelon maintenance is defined as oil changes, fluid changes and/or additions and lubrications. All other leased vehicle maintenance may be performed under contract or the lease. If Port Authority purchases STV’s, all maintenance and repairs shall be performed by Port Authority employees.
8.	It is the parties’ intent to have all of the current collective bargaining agreement provisions be applicable to STV operations, provided, however, that if any other section of the collective bargaining agreement is in conflict
P339800 1
17
Attachment 4
December 30, 1997
with this Section 1001 on small transit vehicles the provisions of this section shall be given effect.
9.	Notwithstanding the Progression set forth in Section 201-E, Port Authority shall be permitted to hire and to maintain at 65% of the top operator rate that number of operators which shall be determined by dividing forty into the sum of the total number of STV vehicle hours of service available for picking at each pick. (Hours of work per week per individual (40) divided into the sum of hours of STV service per week.) This number of operators hired after January 1, 1998 shall be paid at the 65% rate. They shall start on the Section 201-E progression as the number of operators at the 65% rate exceeds the number of 65% operators guaranteed under the formula set forth herein. When the number of operators at the 65% rate exceeds the number established by the formula described herein, the senior operator(s) at the 65% rate shall start at the first step (67%) of the Section 201-E Progression.
An example of this formula is:
420 STV vehicle hours of service divided by
40 hours per week = 10.5 operators
which will be rounded up to 11 operators.

Methods, approaches and procedures employed by the parties will be consistent with their ongoing commitment to cooperation in the bargaining relationship.,
2.	Unit, Welfare and Maintenance Apprenticeship Program (MAP) grievances will be handled through a one step process by the Manager of Employee Relations of his/her designation.

3.	All other grievances (but not any matter within the jurisdiction of the Retirement and Disability Allowance Committee under the Plan) shall consist of a two (2) step process. The first step is to be heard by the division management representative. These grievances shall be heard at such time as not to cause the grievant(s) loss of any pay in attending the hearing. The elected Board of persons or other Officers of the Union shall have the right to accompany employees at such hearing. The elected Board person of the location or department (Automotive Garage Section Assistant Board person) shall process and conduct grievance hearings through the 1st step of the grievance process. The grievance hearings shall be conducted during working hours and the Board person shall be compensated by the Authority. This provision is to be carried out strictly to the letter. The Management Representative shall provide a written answer within ten (10) calendar days after the hearing and, if such answer is not provided, the grievance will automatically be moved to the second step of the grievance procedure. If the answer is provided, the grievant and/or the Union shall have ten (10) calendar days to appeal to the second step.

E.	Should any dispute arise between the parties concerning the interpretation or application of any action or sections in this Agreement which cannot be adjusted, the matter shall be submitted to a board of arbitration for decision as provided for hereafter, and during such arbitration, the employees shall continue in the employ of the Authority.

If the parties are unable to agree within fifteen (15) days, they shall obtain a panel of seven (7) arbitrators who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and shall alternately eliminate names in order to arrive at a neutral arbitrator. Each party shall bear the expense of the arbitrator of its own selection, and the expense of the third arbitrator and the joint expenses incidental to the arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties.

Side Letter
The parties agree that the amount received in each pay should be broken down with the amount of overtime shown separately as is currently the case for standard deductions such as FICA, Union dues, etc. To provide pay stubs with this information is not possible using the current Port Authority system, except by hand which the parties agree is cost prohibitive. Port Authority agrees that the system should be changed and that the change should include the overtime broken out as a component of gross pay on the pay stubs. The Union agrees that Port Authority should make the change when it is technologically feasible considering the limitations of the current system, but not until it can be cost effectively achieved as part of Port Authority’s overall payroll system.
