Stoppage occurs during the shift, the person performing the job goes to the service group; 2. If a known stoppage is in effect prior to the start of a shift then the least senior Associate reports to the Service Group) and maintain the pay class. If there is a permanent displacement (6 (SIX) weeks), in a particular class then the Associate has the right to bump the least senior person in any job and shift that he/she is qualified to perform. The person bumped shall immediately be able to bump the least senior Associate if they meet qualifications.

If a sufficient amount of Associates do not sign up, then the Company will offer the remaining overtime to qualified Associates on that shift that have signed up on a seniority basis. If no one accepts the offer of overtime, in those cases then the junior qualified Associate(s) in that class, on that shift will be scheduled to perform the overtime work.
