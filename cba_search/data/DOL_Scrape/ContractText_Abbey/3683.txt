Orchestra Inc., ("Employer" or "Orpheus") 490 Riverside Drive, 11th floor, New York, NY 10027-5788 and the Associated Musicians of Greater New York, Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, ("Union" or "Local 802"), 322 West 48th Street, New York, NY 10036. This Agreement covers the wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment of all Musicians ("Employees" or "Musicians") employed by the Employer.
ABOUT ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA
Recognized internationally as one of the world's great performing ensembles, the Grammy Award®-winning Orpheus Chamber Orchestra has been thrilling music lovers on four (4) continents since it was founded in 1972. Rehearsing, performing and recording without a central authority figure, Orpheus Musicians share leadership roles and a deep personal artistic commitment to forge strong emotional connections with the audience and composer while eliminating barriers between the listener and the music. Drawing on the tradition of 20th century chamber music masters, Orpheus Musicians collaborate to create a vital dialogue of musical ideas that is at once, liberating, exhilarating and virtually tactile in its translation.
In meeting the challenges of the 21st century, their shared talent and vision will insure that every Orpheus Musician is a passionate advocate for the combined expression of each composer's inspiration and energy, making each and every Orpheus performance an intensely memorable experience. The unparalleled manner in which Orpheus has empowered its Musicians by integrating them into virtually every facet of the organization has literally changed the way the world thinks about musicians, conductors and orchestras.
ARTICLE I:	RECOGNITION
The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of all Musicians it engages during the term of this Agreement, and recognizes the rights and obligations of the Union to administer this Agreement on their behalf.
ARTICLE II:	UNION SECURITY AND DUES CHECK OFF
Musicians who are employed by Orpheus on the date of the signing of this Agreement or on its effective date (whichever is later), who are members of the Union, shall continue to be members in good standing of the Union as a condition of their employment with Orpheus. Musicians covered by this Agreement on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following the commencement of their employment with Orpheus or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, shall become and continue to be members in good standing of the Union as a condition of their employment with Orpheus.
In accordance with the submission of lawful Union dues deduction authorizations signed by each Musician, Orpheus will deduct three and one-half percent (3 ¥2% or the Local 802 Single Engagement Scale at the time the service is rendered, whichever is higher) of gross wages from each Musician's pay and will remit the same amount to Local 802 as work dues concurrent with the submission of benefit payments.
ARTICLE III:
GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
A.	DEFINITION
A "Grievance" is defined as any dispute between the Employer, on the one hand, and the Union or a Musician, on the other, arising under the terms of this Agreement.
B.	PROCEDURE
Step 1: Grievances shall first be submitted in writing to a committee formed of a representative of the Salary and Benefits Committee (as defined herein) (the "SABC"), an Artistic Director (as defined herein), a representative of the Employer and a non-Musician board member (the "Dispute Resolution Committee" or the "DRC"). The DRC shall send a copy of any written Grievance it receives to the Union and the Employer. A Grievance shall be submitted to the DRC within thirty (30) days from the date of the alleged dispute or the date the grievance is discovered, whichever is later.
Step 2: If the Grievance is not resolved within sixty (60) calendar days of submission of the Grievance to the DRC, the members of the DRC shall jointly agree upon a neutral party to serve as a mediator. If the Grievance is not resolved within thirty (30) days of designating a mediator, or if a mediator cannot be agreed upon, the party the Grievance was filed against shall so notify the other party in writing. After receipt of the notice, the party who filed the Grievance shall have thirty (30) calendar days to submit the Grievance to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") for final and binding arbitration in accordance with its labor arbitration rules and regulations. If the Grievance is not submitted to the AAA within such time period, the Grievance shall be considered waived. If appropriate, either party may request expedited arbitration.
The AAA's decision shall be final and binding and may be enforced by either party through appropriate judicial proceedings. The Arbitrator shall not have the authority to add to, subtract from, modify or amend any of the terms of this Agreement. The Arbitrator's fee and charges of the AAA shall be borne equally by the parties hereto. Both parties shall cooperate in making available to the other all information and evidence relevant to the processing of the grievance, which shall be kept confidential.

17
b.	UNIT NUMBER OF GROUPS
Participation for both the Local 802 Musicians Health Fund (see Article XIII) and membership is determined by calculating the unit number of Groups (as herein defined) performed versus the unit number of Groups offered.
The following will count as one (1) unit:
A Concert
A Tour day as defined by Orpheus Tour Rules
Any day a Recording Session(s) take place
Any educational service (Educational Service, Access Orpheus/Community Engagement Service, Educational Auditions, Process Demonstration) will count as one-half (%) of a unit.
All Members are offered the same number of units. A Member is given credit for a Group(s) if the concert program does not require their instrument but the Member indicates that they are otherwise available. Orpheus Management will use reasonable efforts to distribute units evenly amongst Members.
The following units will count toward the work accepted for Members that participate while not being added to their total number of units offered. The participation of Members not accepting these units will not be affected:
Units that are offered after June 1st and scheduled to take place during the September 1st- June 15th season period including non-compensated units such as Donated Benefit Services. Units offered that are scheduled to take place outside the September lst~June 15th period (June 16th-August 31st).
Educational services meeting the above criteria will be treated in the same manner but count as one-half (!4) of a unit.
c.	SCHEDULE CHANGES/CANCELLATIONS
Should Orpheus make changes to a performance schedule or cancel units after June 1st, Members who intended to participate typically would be given the units scheduled. Also, the total number of units offered is decreased by the same number.

This engagement shall be
18
scheduled outside of regular concert activity.

All Non-Members asked to perform Donated Benefit Services will be paid at the then-current applicable rates. The donation of this service will be made clear when the work is offered.
e.	MEMBERSHIP PARTICIPATION MINIMUMS
Any Member whose participation falls below an average of thirty-five percent (35%) over two (2) seasons will be informed in writing by June 15th by Management. The Member will be required to attend a meeting with three (3) components of Orpheus, (ADs, SABC, and a member of Orpheus management) to discuss their past participation below thirty-five percent (35%), as well as their projected future participation above thirty-five percent (35%). The meeting will be held at the Orpheus office and be scheduled between September 1st and 30th of the same calendar year as the letter was sent.

Management will make all reasonable attempts for five (5) business days after the deadline has passed to reach Members who have not returned forms. A list of all Members, with phone numbers, who have not responded by the deadline, will also be faxed to the Union. After the five (5) business day grace period has passed, Management will assume the Member is unavailable for the offered work.
g.	LEAVE OF ABSENCE
After four (4) consecutive years of service, each Member that has met the Membership Participation Minimums of Article XI, E will be entitled to a Leave of Absence not to exceed one (1) year without pay and without loss of position or other employment rights if the request is made in writing to the General Manager by June 30th of the season before the requested leave. During this year, participation for the purposes of benefit calculation will be fifty percent (50%) percent.

In the event that the Employer incurs costs associated with updating documentation provided by Musician(s) due to failure to follow instructions provided by the Employer, the Musician will be invoiced for all direct costs related to updating such documentation. In the event that a Musician who accurately, completely and timely submitted all information required for visas, work permits and the like is barred from entering or remaining in a country where the Orchestra is to perform due to the Employer's negligence, the Musician shall be paid wages as if he/she had performed all services on the Tour in that country. If a Musician is barred from entering or remaining in a performance country because the Musician did not submit accurately and completely all information required for visas, work permits and the like, or due to any other
24
negligence on the part of the Musician, then the Musician shall not be entitled to any wage payment from that time through the earlier of the conclusion of the Tour or such date that the Musician returns to the Tour and performs his/her first service.
