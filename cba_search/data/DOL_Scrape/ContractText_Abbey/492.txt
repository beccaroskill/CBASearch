(C) When an employee waives his right to a position, the next employee shall be entitled to such position, on a seniority and sufficient qualification basis, and so on until the position is filled.
(d)	An employee waiving his right under this provision cannot later claim that particular job as a seniority right; however, the employee making such waiver shall not prejudice his right to accept future vacancies or positions that may occur, on a basis of his classified seniority and qualifications.
(e)	An employee permanently established in a classification under the provisions of this section of the Agreement shall not be replaced later by an employee who may have developed sufficient seniority or qualifications.
(f)	Any employee who may make application to the Employment Office for transfer to a starting job for which he may be qualified will be given preference for consideration before a new employee is hired for the job. Anyone transferring as provided herein

The employee already in the job classification within the Division who cross bids and who can qualify will be selected; however, only one cross bid will be allowed. When an opening has been filled in accordance with the procedure outlined above, the resultant openings will be filled by promotion of employees from the next lower job classification in the particular promotional sequence in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. An employee shall not have the right to bid on a demotion but may request in writing consideration for a demotion.
The procedure outlined above is not applicable to those Divisions where the multiple posting system is in use. In the Divisions where multiple posting is used, the employees are permitted to submit their applications for

promotion or cross bid in advance of an opening. An employee shall not have the right to bid on a demotion but may request in writing consideration for a demotion. When openings occur, they will be posted on the bulletin boards at the various headquarters within the appropriate Division(s). In the Divisions where multiple posting is used and job openings exist cross bids will be permitted at each job classification level before promotions are made and until the posting is completed.
This Section of the Agreement shall not be interpreted in such a way as to enable employees to utilize seniority in the selection of a particular shift, working crew or job assignment, but supervisors may make such assignments on the basis of an employee's request with consideration to the requirements of the job to be filled and the seniority of the employee.
(h> All new employees and all employees transferring from other bargaining units into a job classification represented by the Union shall be classified as probationary employees for a period of one (1) year and shall have no system service and seniority rights during that period.

Exhibit *B
Power Operations Team Guidelines
These guidelines were initially established for the implementation of Production and Support Teams in Power Operations. The guidelines were developed in a partnership of Union and Management, using the many ideas and suggestions that were provided through the participation of employees in the workshops, labs, pilots and rollouts. The initial guidelines were a starting point to begin building a new way of working together to achieve business goals. Contract language continues to apply unless modified in these guidelines. This revision was developed as a result of continued Union and Management partnership.
The guidelines were first implemented for the pilot at East Bend Station and were subject to change from our experiences as the implementation moved from station to station. These guidelines may occasionally' change upon changing business needs and approval of Union and Management.
The input and suggestions from all employees are welcome and encouraged as the guidelines are implemented. The involvement of every Union and Management employee is critical to achieving continued success.

Production Team Staffing
1.	In the event insufficient l&C and/or Maintenance skills exist on the Production Teams the expectation exists that these skills will be developed on the Production Teams in an expeditious manner. Employees possessing the sufficient skills will work on and with the Teams for their development. In order for this to occur, represented personnel possessing the skills will be assigned to the Teams on a rotational basis for up to three months at a time to perform on-the-job training. This will continue for a period of three years, or until such time the necessary skills transfer takes place. These training assignments will be made "in plant", with everyone possessing Intermediate and above skill sets in Mechanical, Electrical, and Instrumentation and Control required to participate, as determined by the insufficient skill set. Flexibility should be given to personnel in these training assignments to pick their rotational assignment. However, if no agreement can be reached, assignments will be made beginning with the lowest classified seniority person first.

2.	Any new hires, exempt employees returning to the bargaining unit, or those |	coming from outside of Power Operations
P	and System Resources, will start on the
Production Team.
3.	Job postings for Production Teams will be P in-plant first, then within the Department, then within Re-deployment, and then |	Company wide. Every effort will be made
j	to staff Teams on a voluntary basis. Any
employee entering the Production Team job sequence during the initial Team , staffing at a station was exempt from taking the combined POSS/MASS test battery.

exempt from taking	the combined
।	POSS/MASS test battery. Any others
ll	(internal or external)	are required to
successfully complete	the combined
POSS/MASS test battery prior to entering the Production Team job sequence.
4.	Non-Power Operations personnel must first pass a combination of the | POSS/MASS testing batteries to meet the / minimum qualifications for the Production Team Member. Filling of positions for those outside of Power Operations will be
112
according to the Pool letter that currently exists. The present Team Members and Team Consultants will have the opportunity to interview any candidates and offer recommendations for hiring,
5.	In the case where a qualified person from one plant bids onto a Production Team at another plant, the census at the two plants will change. Management and Union representatives will review the effects and resolve any potential staffing issues.
6.	All Team Members will select an Advanced skill set in one discipline, as well as qualifying to the Intermediate skill set level in the remaining disciplines. A continuing education and skill maintenance system will be in effect for all personnel in the pay for skill model. The Skill Maintenance System is designed to assist Team Members in further developing, refining, and maintaining their skill bases, to insure that Cinergy employees continue as the best in class, high value added supplier of services. It is not the purpose of the Skills Maintenance System to remove or reduce compensation earned in the Skills Acquisition Program. If Team Members are unsuccessful at maintaining the skills required for their position, an
113
action plan of additional training and work exposure will be implemented to re-gain the skills.
7, Equal opportunity policies of the company will apply to the selection process.
Support Teams Staffing
1.	Job postings for Support Teams will be in-plant first, then within the Department, then within the Pool, and then Company wide. Any employee entering the Maintenance Services Support Team job sequence during the initial Team staffing at a station was exempt from taking the MASS test battery. Any employee who has previously been in the former Maintenance (Electrical, Mechanical, or I & C) job sequence is exempt from taking the MASS test battery. Any others (internal or external) are required to successfully complete the MASS test battery prior to entering the Maintenance Services Team job sequence.
2.	Those employees remaining in the Maintenance Services or Material Services Teams are in a pay for skill profile requiring multiple skills to obtain wage increases and bonuses. Employees not in the Maintenance Services or Material
114
Services pay for skill profile, remain in their former classification based seniority, and are not in a pay for skill model at this time. Any changes to the present design must be firmly supported by a tangible business case demonstrating positive financial impact to the corporation and must be agreed upon by both Union and Management.
3.	Using the Cinergy Skill Qualification Process developed for the flexible multiskilled worker concept, all Support Team Maintenance Services and Material Services personnel, with the exception of the Hoist Fleet Operator position, will have the opportunity to obtain the skills necessary to progress to their respective skill profile's maximum wage rate and bonus. Maintenance Services Team Members may choose the discipline in which they prefer to achieve their Advanced Level Skill Set, and will also obtain the Intermediate Level Skill Sets in the remaining disciplines.
4.	The top wage rate for Maintenance Services Team Member is established equivalent to the former top wage rate of Maintenance First Class Repairer and Instrument and Control Technician I. The Material Services Team Members may
115
progress to the former AFO rate of pay for all stations, excluding East Bend. The East Bend Material Services Team Members may progress to the former Senior Landfill Operator wage rate. All Material Services Team Members must successfully demonstrate the multiple skills to qualify for the wage increases. Maintenance Services and Material Services Team Members who are in the pay for skill profile and successfully complete the skill set will be compensated as described in Attachment C.
5.	Support Team personnel are expected to travel to other plants as plant work loads dictate and availability exists. The travel assignments will be in accordance with the present 1347 collective bargaining agreement.
6.	When Support Team Members are being utilized as a shared service they will be given notice to report to the new work location based on the change of schedule guidelines in the present 1347 collective bargaining agreement. There may be a situation at Their home station which requires additional resources. If the employees are required to return to their normal work location ahead of the previously established schedule, the same
116
guidelines for the change of schedule above will be utilized. (Presently this is not less than forty-eight hour notice.)
7.	A continuing education and skill maintenance system will be in effect for all personnel in the pay for skill model. This Skill Maintenance System is designed to assist Team Members in further developing, refining, and maintaining their skills, to insure that Cinergy employees continue as the best in class, high value added supplier of services. It is not the purpose of the Skills Maintenance System to remove or reduce compensation earned in the Skills Acquisition Program. If Team Members are unsuccessful at maintaining the skills required for their position, an action plan of additional training and work exposure will be implemented to re-gain the skills.
8.	For the certified welding skill base for Production Teams and Support Teams, the guidelines of how this will be administered are included in Appendix B.
117
Skids Acquisition and Compensation Process
1.	Point System
Development of flexible, multi-discipline Team Members in the Cinergy Qualification Process will be tracked by a point system. The point system design is based on assigning each Duty Area in the qualification handbook a given point value. Each handbook and the point values will be unique to the station. Compensation, including bonuses, is based on a predetermined total of points.
A tracking tool will be implemented to track each Team Member's progress by the Group Leaders in the program monthly. This tracking tool will ensure that the necessary points and skills are being acquired. The Point System allows Team Members the flexibility to choose their own skills acquisition path based upon Team needs (see attachment C).
2.	Alternate Career Path
Employee's may qualify and choose an alternate career path due to previous work history and experience based on the criteria listed below. These employees are
118
still expected to act as flexible workers and are required to participate in the Skills Acquisition Process as validaters, trainers and PQS's.
GROUP A: A Team Member who is age 50 or has a combined age and years of service that is equal to or above 72 on or before July 31; 1998 is fully exempt from the written and performance testing for the multi-skilled worker.
GROUP B~. A Team Member who is age 45 or has a combined age and years of services that is equal to or above 67 on or before July 31, 1998 is partially exempt. Employees in this category are required to acquire the Two Year Point Total, but are not required to acquire the Later Points in their pay for skill model.
Employees in group A or B can acquire at their option additional points. If a employees choose to do this they will receive additional compensation (See attachment C).
Apprenticeship Program
In 1998 an apprenticeship Program will be developed for new hires in the Pay for Skill Model by a Union and Management Team.
119
Bidding Between Production and Support Teams
1.	Personnel have the option to bid between Production and Support Teams when such openings are available. Any initial wage rate increase associated with their original bidding or placement on a Production Team will be lost by a Team Member returning to a Support Team position. Departing Production Team Members may be required to continue on their job in order to maintain the continuity of the Team until those positions are filled.
2.	For an inter-Team bid and placement to occur, a vacancy must exist, the candidates must be qualified, and the departing Production Team Member must be replaced by a qualified person, possessing the necessary skills to properly and effectively replace the Team Member. Production Team Members may not be permitted to assume the new position if absence from the Production Team will negatively impact the operation and maintenance of the station, or they do not possess the necessary skills to be effective on the respective Support Team. This is especially applicable to Team Members with only the Operations skill base. If the departing Team Member is
120
from the former Operator classification, and has not developed non-operating skill sets, wage rate adjustments will apply {see paragraph 4). The release of employees from existing positions to the new positions will be in a mutually agreed time'frame.
3.	Support Team Members will be given preference for any Production Team job openings.
4.	When bidding off a Production Team, the bidder's pay will be reduced by $0.50 or to the top rate of the Support Team whichever is less. If they do not meet the requirements of the Support Team position they are moving into they will have a predetermined time frame to acquire these skills. If they fail to acquire these skills in the pre-determined time frame, a new wage rate will be negotiated and established based on their relative acquired skill level in the Skill Profile they are entering.	If the new position on the
Support Team is not applicable to the pay for skill model, then they shall maintain the red-circled rate and be subject to the appropriate job summary or profile.
5.	- For Support Team vacancies, it is understood that any new hires will start
121
on the Production Team and a Production Team Member will fill the Support Team vacancy through the job posting process. The remaining most senior "forced" Production Team Member willing to exit the Production Team will be awarded the position. Absent any remaining "forced" personnel on the Production Teams, the position will be filled by the most senior qualified Team Member on the Production Team, with the described wage rate adjustments applying. If no bids are received from Production Team Members, the position will be filled directly to the Support Team from external applicants.
6. Production Team and Support Team voluntary trades will be considered on a case by case basis. These trades should be approved provided no adverse impact through the loss of skills to either Team is encountered. If and when these trades take place the traders must remain in the job for three years.
Bidding Between Plants
1.	Inter-plant bidding will be allowed. There are no "bumping" rights. If an opening exists, and no one at the plant bids, and/or meets the minimum requirements, the opening will be posted department
122
wide and then company-wide. If more than one bidder meets the minimum requirements, the bidder with the highest Power Operations seniority wilt be awarded the position.
2.	In the event that no bidders meet the Skill Profile requirements of the position, the job may be awarded to a bidder of lesser skills, provided the applicant agrees to acquire and demonstrate they have the skills for the position within a mutually agreed upon time frame. The employee will demonstrate the skills by completing the appropriate Cinergy Skills Qualification Process for their respective job. Failure to achieve these skills in the agreed upon time frame will be handled on a case by case basis.
3.	For personnel moving from a Support Team to a Production Team, they will receive a 5% increase in wage rate, but no more than the maximum wage rate of the top Production Team Member pay.
4.	Qualifications being sufficient, preference will be given to the person with the most Power Operations seniority.
123
Team Rules / Guidelines
Team Leaders
1.	The Team Leaders will be selected from the represented Team Members. The Team Leader role is expected to rotate periodically among the Team Members to allow for continued development of leadership roles within the Team. The Team Leader^should stay in the job long enough to establish continuity and become proficient at the job. The Team will have input on the proper rotation frequency. Team Leaders will receive feedback from the Group Leaders, Team Consultants, and other Team Members as it relates to their Team duties. Overall job performance evaluation of Team Leaders will continue to be conducted by the Team Consultant with input from the Group Leaders.
2.	Everyone on the Team is encouraged to become a Team Leader at some time, although no one will be forced. The company encourages responsible risk-taking from its employees. It is anticipated that Teams may make some mistakes in their development. It is expected that the Teams will learn from these errors and incorporate their learning's to avoid repeating them.
124
3.	In the Team Management system Teams are expected to resolve most Team issues. Matters involving discipline will be handled by management personnel. The Team Leader does not discipline Team Members.
4.	Consistent with past practices for orderly transition of shifts, arriving Production Team Leaders may report % hour early each day to consult with the on-duty Production Team Leaders. It is expected that this transition should be accomplished in less than ’A hour, for which overtime will be paid. In the event that unit conditions or project activities require more than % hour, the Team Leader should be paid appropriate overtime . It is expected that this applies to Production Teams only, not Support Teams. However, in the event that it is necessary for Support Team Leaders to report prior to the start of the shift they will receive the appropriate pay. Team Members will also need to meet together at the beginning of each shift. A one-on-one shift relief procedure will be established by the Teams for Team Member transition on a straight time basis.
125
5.	Production and Support Team Leader duties include, but are not limited to, the following:
• Facilitate regular Team meetings to: a) Discuss who will be doing what, b) Make plans with Team help to fill vacancies in the most economical manner,
c)	Get updates from KFA's ,
d)	Interface with the Team Consultant on any problems, questions, or needs.
•	Brief the relieving Team Leader,
•	Perform daily work assignments,
•	Communicate routinely with Group
Leaders,
•	Facilitate Team problem-solving /
decision-making,
•	Coach / counsel other Team Members as appropriate,
•	Work with the Team Consultant and balance of management to help transfer the appropriate management roles to the Team and provide leadership skills in transitioning the Team to the Team Management System.
126
Team Performance Guidelines
1.	Production Teams will work a schedule (that makes business sense) to provide coverage 24 hours per day, seven days per week . Flexibility will be maintained, so tfiaf the Teams can work out whatever rotation allows them to accomplish their tasks, as long as coverage is maintained within the business demands of the station and corporation. All schedules will need to be approved by a joint Union and Management Leadership Team.
2.	The Support Teams are responsible for providing support services to the Production Teams. In order to meet the needs of the Production Teams, Support Teams will work rotating shifts as needed.
3.	When a temporary vacancy exists on a Production Team, that Team will decide the appropriate course of action. I In some cases it is not possible to get the Team together in a timely fashion so the Team Leader and Team Consultant will need to address the vacancy ) Options will include changes of schedule, working overtime, or not filling the vacancy at all, depending on the work load. The Production Team Group Leaders will decide whether they will go outside the Team to request
127
Support Team assistance, or implement schedule changes.
4.	Team Members who are not Team Leaders are requested to assume, but are not limited to, the KFA duties below. In the event that there are no volunteers these duties will be assigned. These will rotate on an annual basis.
■	Permits & Inspections (burning and welding, agency notifications)
■	Safety (switching & tagging, safety meetings)
B Quality (prioritize Support Team activities)
■	Personnel / Administrative (interface with office, scheduling and relief for vacations, performance review scheduling and overtime)
B Training (monitor training needs for Team Members, scheduling mandatory training, first aid, confined space, fire brigade, etc.)
B Materials & Supplies (outage planning, CMMS responsibility)
■	Predictive Maintenance (procedures and tracking)
5.	Management and Union leadership empower and encourage Team Members to resolve any problems or disputes 128
internally that may arise. However, this does not diminish the rights of either the Management or the Union under the collective bargaining agreement, nor does it intend to alter or amend the parties' existing grievance procedure.
6.	A Team Consultant will be assigned to each Team. The Team Consultants and Plant Specialists are responsible for, but not limited to, the following duties.
B Providing resources (training material, assist with parts and supplies)
B Making emergency decisions if the safety, of personnel, the environment, or the station assets are in jeopardy
B Coaching and counseling
B Paperwork, reports, performance statistics, etc. not part of the Team Management System
B Handling discipline as required
B Continuous discussions about Team health and career guidance, etc.
B Provide technical advice and assistance
B Assisting with on-the-job training
B Transferring their old roles to the KFAs and incorporate the Team Management System
129
It is expected that as emergency conditions arise, the Team will look to the Team Consultant for assistance. As time goes on, the Team will handle these situations on their own.
7.	With the implementation of the new Skill Qualification Process, it is the responsibility of both the Union and Management Team Members to accomplish this transfer to a multi-skilled work force while still managing the operation and maintenance of the Station, Union and Management support is essential to this process.
Group Leaders
1.	Bargaining Unit and Management Group Leaders are selected through a joint selection process. A Member of Management, the Union, and Human Resources Specialist will conduct the selection process.
2.	Bargaining Unit Group Leaders will receive an additional $1/hour above the top Production Team Member wage rate when selected as Group Leaders. This will be utilized until such time as a wage rate can be established by the parties. The
130
represented Group Leaders may work overtime in their respective skill disciplines in cases of emergencies, mandatory overtime for all Team Members, or in cases of "forcing" other Team Members. This list is not all inclusive.
*
3.	Group	Leaders	will receive	performance
reviews with	input from Management,
Union	leadership, and the	Team on a
regular basis.
4.	Union	Group	Leaders will	pick their
discipline and initially slot in a discipline at the same time as the plant employees that are in the pay for skill model.
5.	The Management and Bargaining Unit Group Leaders' duties include, but are not limited to, the following:
■	Develop and provide business and people goals, long term strategies, and objectives to the Team (the Teams will use them to set their own goals)
M Provide win-win problem resolutions
■	Provide	performance	data and
feedback to the Teams
■	Provide	direction to	the Team
Consultants and Team Leaders
131
■	The Union Group Leader may still do hands-on work
■	Investigate accidents and safety concerns
■	Implement, support, and facilitate the Team Management System and model partnership behaviors
■	Acquire core competencies, including but not limited to, leadership, business understanding and technical knowledge.
Seniority
1.	Production and Support Team seniority will be maintained while employees are participating in the Team concept.
2.	System seniority will be maintained as it is presently.
3.	Classified seniority will be maintained in the employee's original classification and will continue to accrue after bidding to a Production Team. (This is for the purpose of layoffs or surplus of personnel. Union Group Leaders & Team Leaders fall under the same guidelines as all represented employees, in the event of a layoff or surplus, they fall back to their former classified seniority.)
132
4.	In the unlikely and unforeseen event of a layoff, employees' seniority will be listed in their previously held classification with no break in seniority.
5.	The ’October 11,1996 contract letter will apply in the case of a declared surplus due to plant or unit shut down.
6.	The Production and Support Teams vacations will be selected, as covered by existing contract language, based on system seniority within each individual Team. As long as business needs are met. Teams are responsible for vacation selection with input from the Group Leaders.

133
Attachment A
Fractional Slotting (* Grand fathering "I of skills 6/2/97
Purpose
The purpose is to determine the objective methodology to employ for fractional grandfathering of skills within a discipline for the initial placement and assessment of skills. The wholesale skill base grandfathering is agreed upon by the Steering Committee and is defined within the Qualification Guidebook. Those former job classifications used for whole skill grandfathering are all inclusive of the relative skills within the new definitions.
Initial Slotting
All existing employees will be initially slotted into the Qualification Program based on their previous job category or discipline and the position or classification they held in that category. They will not be required to test for qualification in the Duty Areas contained in or below the Skill Set into which they are slotted. The Qualification Handbook contains a slotting chart indicating the initial position for each former classification. No pay adjustment will be made based on this initial slotting.
134
Fractional Slotting Process
Recognizing that employees can also have unique circumstances in their employment background that may warrant fractional "grandfathering" in some Duty Areas within a Skill Set,' .without being fully qualified in that Skill Set, a process for requesting "fractional slotting" is available. The process listed below will guide the employee in the application for this Fractional Slotting. The basis for the program is that the employee assumes the responsibility and must request and present valid and objective information supporting their petition for the Fractional Slotting to be approved.
Application and Review Process
11 Initiate Request
The employee will initiate the request for consideration of Fractional Slotting in a Duty Area by presenting a written formal request for review of their specific skill base. This request must include the supporting documentation validating their fractional skill assessment, and be provided to the Review Committee. Consideration for fractional assessment
135
will only be reviewed within their former discipline, unless they have documented, formal working experience in the other disciplines. The requests will be processed on a first come, first serve basis, dependent on the availability of committee Members. Request for Fractional Slotting should be made on a Duty Area level. Request for partial
Duty Area Fractional Slotting are discouraged, but will be reviewed on a case by case basis. In most cases, partial Duty Area Slotting will have no affect on the skill testing of the individual. If a full Skill Set is achieved by Fractional Slotting, the Qualification testing process, or a combination of the two, the Team Member will be compensated as agreed to in the Pay for Skill Model.
2)	Review Committee
The Review Committee will be formed by: • One station specific, represented employee. Subject Matter Expert (GLs selected)
•	One Power Services Employee Development Specialist
•	A Station Manager, or manager designee
136
•	A Facilitator from Change Management (nonvoting)
The committee will review the request and accompanying documentation and based on the objective comparison to the Duty Area tasks, and determine whether Fractional Slotting is warranted. An employee interview is optional, but will be required prior to any rejected request. Employees may waive the interview at any time.
3)	Supporting Documentation
The documentation that will be necessary to support the request is dependent on the Duty Area being petitioned. It should include but is not limited to the following:
•	The Qualification Quidebook tasks checked off for that Duty Area.
•	Temporary promotion time and JR # and what tasks were performed.
•	Former Job Duty Checklist of approved tasks qualification.
•	Training records or education certificates or diplomas.

Upon review, and subsequent approval of the request by the Review Committee for Fractional Slotting, the employee will be placed into the Duty Area approved and will not be required to take any qualification tests associated with that Duty Area. If all of the Duty Areas of a Skill Set are approved, then the employee will be granted Fractional Slotted within that Skill Set.
Employees will be expected to perform any task that they possess the skills to accomplish. Any task they performed in their previous job category, or any task within a Duty Area in which they have received initial slotting or fractional slotting, they will be expected to perform with out temporary upgrade pay. Temporary upgrade pay for all other task will be phased out as agreed upon in the Temporary Upgrade Pay Policy.
There will be a joint Union/Management Team formed in one year to review the Fractional slotting process. At this point the Team will determine if the fractional slotting should be continued.
Skill Development for non-Slotted employees
The employees not receiving Intermediate or Advanced Initial or Fractional Slotting will receive developmental assistance in the
138
Qualification process. This applies primarily to the former Maintenance Third Class Repairer, the former Operations Assistant Auxiliary Operator, and the former Instrumentation and Control Technician III who have been unsuccessful in obtaining Fractional Slotting. This same structure should apply to all employees, but is emphasized with this group due to their current skill and wage levels.
The Power Services Employee Development Specialists will work jointly with the respective Group Leaders, Team Consultants, Team Leader, and the Team's training Key Functional Area representatives to meet with the employee to develop an action plan for the acquisition of skills. The action plan will be based on the Qualification Guidebook content; and will consists of work assignment opportunities, cross-functional training strategies, curriculum availability, and the Team Consultants or Plant Specialists educational coaching and training sessions. The employee. Employee Development Specialist and Training Key Function Area point person are responsible to create the action plan with assistance from these mentioned groups and individuals. The action plan must incorporate the other business demands to maintain a constructive balance within the every day work environment.

EAST WELDING SKILL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE HOLISTIC PAY FOR SKILL MODEL
Multi-Skilled Worker Welding
The following elements of the welding skills Duty Area will be put in place when the multi-skilled work force is established;
1)	All welding done at ECBU Plants by 1347 represented employees will be done by Qualified welders.
2)	The welding skills will be divided into two general categories; General and Certified welding. The General welding tasks will require intermediate level skills while the Certified welding tasks will require advanced level skills.
3}	The Welding skills will be a Duty Area of the Support Team Maintenance Services and the Production Team in the Mechanical discipline.
4)	Support Team Maintenance Services and Production Team Members are
140
required to Qualify in the General welding tasks.
5J The Advanced sections of Cutting and Welding Duty Area are a requirement of the Advanced Mechanical Maintenance Skill Set, however, it will be optional, such that it will be available to all other Team Members, at their choice and the Station's approval, on the Support or Production Teams, regardless of their selected/current Skill Set. Additionally, for existing IBEW 1347 employees, as of May 1, 1997, it will not be required to complete the Advanced sections of this optional Duty Area to qualify in the Advanced Skill Set of Mechanical Maintenance in the pay for skill model.
6)	To Qualify in Cutting and General welding the employee will be required to pass a written test and up to four performance demonstrations conducted by the Technical Programs group. To complete Certified welding requirements the employee will need to pass up to three written tests and twelve performance demonstrations conducted by the Technical Programs group.
141
7)	When an IBEW 1347 employee has been successfully Certified in the Pressure welding and Boiler Tube tasks, they will receive additional compensation in the form of a welding differential (see 1347 Welding Differential, next page). This differential will be added to their current pay level when they are performing the actual Certified Pressure welding or Boiler Tube tasks.
8)	Once a Team Member has Certified in Advanced welding tasks they will be required to maintain their Certification by welding or demonstration testing every 6 months to retain their Certified status. If a Team Members initially completed this Advanced Duty Area as an option (see #5 above), rather than as a requirement of their Advanced discipline, they retain the option to recertify, as long as business needs are being met.
9)	Preference should be given to utilizing available Support Team Certified welders, for pressure piping welding, before a Production Team Certified welder is used to make a certified weld. However, if the use of the Production Team Certified welder will
142
eliminate the requirement to pay overtime compensation, premium pay, or other additional costs, they can and should be utilized to perform the welding.
10)	A' . Union/Management Team will address the total number of Certified welders that will be maintained. An initial limit will not be put on how many of these welders may exist at any one time. However, this will be continually reviewed to assess quality control, training requirements, skill maintenance requirements, and overall value added. As such, the total number of Certified welders may be limited if the concerns above are negatively impacted.
11)	The existing IBEW 1347 Certified Welders wages will be grandfathered and they will pick vacation within their Teams.
Existing IBEW 1347 Certified Welders
Existing IBEW 1347 employees that are in the Certified Welder Classification on May 1, 1997 will be initially Slotted in the Advanced Mechanical discipline of the Qualification
143
Program and may remain as Certified Pressure Piping welders at their option.
These current Certified Welders will be grandfathered at their current pay level until they separate, transfer to a different job, or fail to maintain their certification.
If they fail to maintain their certification they will be red circled until the top wage of the multi-skill Support Team Maintenance Services Team Member equals or surpasses their existing pay level.
IBEW 1347 Welding Differential
Initially the new Welding Differential pay for IBEW 1347 employees will be equal to the differential between the employees present rate of pay and the current Certified Welding top wage rate. This Welding Differential will be paid in addition to the employees present wage, anytime they are being utilized to perform Certified welding.
Production Team and Support Team Maintenance Services Team Members that reach maximum pay for their respective multi -skilled pay for skill models, will still receive this differential above their existing wage rate.
144
Existing Certified Welders would be compensated at their existing, grandfathered, wage rate. They will receive no additional welding differential.
Additionally, an annual travel bonus, at a rate of *$2/hr, will be paid to all certified welders based on the differential between their travel hours and the travel hours of all Support Team Members who travel.
New Hires
Any new hires entering the Advanced Mechanical skills section of the pay for skill model of Support Team Maintenance Services or Production Team would be expected to achieve the Certified welding as a required skill. This requirement may be adjusted over time to maintain the number of certified welders required to meet the needs of the Business Unit.
Attachment C
Skills Qualification Point System
In order to allow for more flexible navigation through the Skills Qualification Program, a Skills Acquisition Point System has been developed. Originally, the movement through the Pay For Skill Models were based
145
on Skill Set acquisition. The Point System allows a Team Member or Trainee to move through the Pay for Skill Models without requiring complete acquisition of a Skill Set to trigger compensation adjustments. Instead, Team Members earn points for each Duty Area completed, regardless of discipline, thereby obtaining increased compensation while acquiring cross discipline skills.
The following steps were used in the development of a Point System:
1.	Each Duty Area, in each Stations customized Skills Qualification Handbook, was assigned a point value based on criticality, difficulty and importance to the Station.
2.	An estimated acquisition time (in calendar days) was assigned to each Duty Area in the Skills Qualification Handbooks. (An example would be the Ash Handling System which has an estimated 14 calendar days window to acquire the knowledge and skills. This does not mean it will take 14 days, 8 hours a day to complete this learning, but that
146
it can be accomplished in this window)
3.	Each job category (discipline & past position level) was assigned a 'Total Points" number based on ’ the points that would be obtained in acquiring all the Duty Areas in their complete Pay For Skill Model.(Refer to attached Single Unit example Chart)
4.	Initial Slotting was then applied to the job category. The Initial Slotting point value was subtracted from the Total Points to obtain the "Needed Points' total.
5.	The 'Needed Points" Duty Areas are sorted first by longest acquisition time (worst case for acquisition) and then by the highest point value (best case for acquisition). Each sort is reviewed to obtain the point totals at the 730 calendar day level. The mean between these two point values is used as the 'Two Year Points' total.
147
6.	An estimate of Fractional Slotting potential is then applied to the "Needed Points" Duty Areas. These Fractional Slotting points are added the "Two Year Points" total to obtain the "Total Points to Top Pay" total. If There is no actual Fractional Slotting points acquired by the Team Member the "Total Points to Top Pay" is equal to the "Two Year Points" total. This will ensure Team Members are compensated for Fractional Slotting while still assuring each employee has an individualized "Total Points to Top Pay" level.
7.	The "Two Year Points" and the Fractional Slotting Points are subtracted from the "Needed Points" to obtain the "Points Later" total.
8.	The "Total Points to Top Pay" is then divided by four to obtain the point levels that trigger compensation adjustments in the Pay For Skill Models.

Compensation Progression
The compensation trigger points discussed on the previous page will either result in hourly wage adjustments or bonus payouts, depending on the Team Member's position relative to top pay. The far right columns indicate what these adjustments will be.
Administration
As well as being used to trigger compensation adjustments, the points assigned to The Duty Areas will be used to help each Team Member monitor their successful progress through the
151
Skills Acquisition Program. This tracking program will be administered as follows:
1.	An average number of annual points will be earned by each Team Member.
2.	This average point total will be determined by dividing the "Needed Points" total for each Team Member by five years. (THIS IS NOT TO IMPLY A FIVE YEAR UP OR OUT PROGRAM FOR THE EXISTING WORK FORCE)
3.	It is expected that, as designed, the Skills Qualification Program can be accomplished in five years. Union and Management Group Leads will monitor each Team Member's progress monthly, so that problems with skills acquisition can be identified in a timely manner. Group Leaders assistance and/or coaching and counseling will be used to resolve failure to obtain the Skills in the expected time frame. If these problems are due to inaccurate time estimates in the design or unavailable testing tools, adjustments can and will be made to the employees Skills Acquisition Plan.
4.	During the transition from present state to the fully developed multi-skilled
152
work force, problems may be encountered. If employees aren't keeping pace, or if the company isn't providing needed training opportunities or testing as scheduled, or if time estimates discussed above are off, Management and Union will work together to resolve the issue. Compensation won't be unduly withheld. These situations will be handled on a case by case basis.
5.	It is required for all nonexempt Team Members in the Pay For Skill Model to complete the Skills Qualification Program. If warranted, Management will utilize progressive and constructive discipline for failure to participate in the Skills Qualification Program.
Qualification Issues and Review Committee (QUIRC)
A Qualification Issues Review Committee has been formed to monitor and, if required, make adjustments to the Qualification program. This committee is tasked with maintaining a continuous development of the flexible, multi-disciplined work force and making recommendations for program enhancements to the Steering Committee. Members of the committee include management and union
153
Group Leads along with Members of the Employee Development Team and Qualification Program development Team.
