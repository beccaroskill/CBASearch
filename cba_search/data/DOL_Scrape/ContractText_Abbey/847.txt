1.2	The term "nurses" as used in this Agreement refers to all members of the bargaining unit described in 1.1 unless specifically differentiated as “Regular Staff” hereinafter referred to as “Staff", or "Relief.
1.3	In the event the Employer determines that the content of a nurse's job covered by this Agreement is such that the job should no longer be in the bargaining unit represented by CRONA, the Employer will notify CRONA in writing. If CRONA does not agree that the job should be removed from the bargaining unit, CRONA will notify the Director of Employee and Labor Relations or designee, within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the Employer's notice that it wishes to challenge the removal of the job. The Employer shall arrange a meeting to include the nurse whose job is in question, a CRONA representative and an Employer representative to review the content of the nurse's job. Except to the extent specified above, removal of positions from the bargaining unit will not be reviewable under this Agreement.

Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4701/04 - 3/31/07
covered by this Agreement, if the Employer retains control or majority ownership of the new owner or such changed entity, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be applicable to such work. In all other cases, upon CRONA’s written request, the Employer will meet with CRONA to discuss CRONA’s recommendations and suggestions concerning the effect of the change on CRONA Nurses, with the objective of ensuring the terms of the Agreement are kept in effect. The Employer shall not use any sale, transfer, or other mechanism for the purpose of evading the terms of the Agreement. The Employer is obligated to notify in writing any new owner, buyer or partner of the contract between the Employer and CRONA.
The Employer will notify CRONA in writing as soon as practicable but no later than thirty (30) days prior to any elimination of any unit or area of practice in which nurses covered by this Agreement are employed. Upon written request, the Employer will meet to discuss any proposed elimination and the effects of such elimination if any, upon the bargaining unit. The Employer shall not eliminate any unit or area of practice for the purpose of evading the terms of the Agreement.
SECTION 2 NO DISCRIMINATION

Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
5.2.1,a or 5.2.1.b. However, the Employer shall have no obligation to discharge or otherwise discipline any such nurse who does not desire to do so.
5,2	New Employees. It shall be a condition of employment that all nurses hired on or after July 1, 1978, shall, within thirty (30) days after the beginning date of such employment, either become and remain members of CRONA or comply with the provisions of 5.2.1.

Such petition shall request, and by such request shall allow the nurse to cease membership in or not become a member of CRONA and to do either of the following on an annual basis:

5.3.5	CRONA shall indemnify, defend and save the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reason of action taken or not taken by the Employer in the deduction and remittance of CRONA dues as described in this section.

-5-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
hereafter payable to me from the Employer, there be paid to CRONA my CRONA membership dues or an equivalent service fee as indicated below, and I hereby authorize and direct you to deduct such sums from my earnings and pay the same for my account to CRONA.

SECTION 6 CLASSIFICATION AND COMPENSATION PROCEDURES FOR STAFF NURSES
6.1	New Hires.
6.1.1	All newly hired Staff Nurses will serve a Trial Period of six (6) months, unless extended pursuant to Section 23 of this Agreement except current employees who have already served a trial period. During the
-6-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
trial period or extension thereof a Staff Nurse may be terminated at any time at the Employer's sole discretion and the Employer's discretion shall not be subject to review under any provision of this Agreement.
6.1.2	Current employees of the Employer who have completed a trial period and are newly hired into a Staff Nurse or Relief Nurse position will serve a six (6) month probation during which s/he can be terminated for just cause. If in the judgment of the Patient Care Manager, the Staff Nurse is not meeting all the clinical nurse criteria at the end of the six (6) months but is making significant progress toward the clinical nurse criteria and overall job performance, the Patient Care Manager has the option to extend the probation period for an additional three (3) months.
6.1.3	The Employer will place newly hired Staff Nurses with six (6) months or less experience at the Staff Nurse I level. Newly hired Staff Nurses with more than six (6) months experience will be placed at the appropriate level and step based upon the Employer’s assessment of the nurse’s education and experience, at its sole discretion, provided that:
a.	Experience must be within the past two (2) years.
b.	Experience must be applicable to the unit or area(s) in which the Staff Nurse is hired, as determined by the Patient Care Manager.
6.1.4	After completion of not more than three (3) months of employment, the Employer will give the Staff Nurse an informal, interim evaluation. If the Staff Nurse is having difficulty in meeting expectations during this three (3) month period, the evaluation will be in writing. After completion of not more than six (6) months of employment, the Staff Nurse will be evaluated for the purpose of Staff Nurse level placement in accordance with the established Clinical Performance Criteria. This provision does not limit in any way the right of the Employer to terminate a Staff Nurse without cause during the trial period; nor does it give rise to any claim concerning such terminations under the Grievance and Arbitration provisions.
6.1.5	If the Staff nurse is not performing at the appropriate level after the initial six (6) months of employment, the Employer will determine which of the following actions it deems to be appropriate and act accordingly.
a.	Extension of trial period pursuant to Section 23 up to a maximum of three (3) months, with postponement of any salary increase. The Staff Nurse will be evaluated at the end of the extension period and reclassified at the Staff Nurse level consistent with
-7-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
his/her performance, or if the Employer determines that performance is still unsatisfactory, terminated.
b.	Immediate reclassification to the level consistent with the nurse’s clinical performance with salary decrease processed as necessary and the trial period extended pursuant to Section 23 up to a maximum of three (3) months. The Staff Nurse will be evaluated at the end of the extension period and reclassified accordingly, or if the Employer determines that performance is still unsatisfactory, terminated.
c.	If the Employer determines that extension of the trial period is not appropriate, the Staff Nurse will be terminated.
d.	The Employer may determine, at its sole discretion, that the Staff Nurse be transferred (to be restricted to one transfer) to a more suitable position. If a transfer is deemed appropriate, the trial period will be extended pursuant to Section 23 up to maximum of three (3) months. The Staff Nurse will be evaluated at the end of the extension period and reclassified at the appropriate Staff Nurse level or if the Employer determines that performance is still unsatisfactory, terminated.
e.	If a Staff Nurse placed at the Staff Nurse III or IV level upon hire has not met all of the criteria required to maintain the Staff Nurse’s status at that level within a period of nine (9) months after hire, the Employer may extend the period for three (3) months if the Staff Nurse has substantially completed the criteria, or may reclassify the Staff Nurse to the level consistent with the criteria met, if any, and a salary decrease processed as necessary.
f.	The Employer will not reclassify a Staff Nurse downward pursuant to this subsection by more than one (1) level on a single occasion, except that the Employer may reclassify a Staff Nurse IV to the Staff Nurse II level, provided that it has given the Nurse three (3) months' written notice that the Nurse is not meeting the clinical performance requirements and standards and/or criteria specifying those requirements and/or criteria standards where the Nurse is deficient and the improvement required.
6.2	Transfers After Completion of Trial Period - Staff and Relief.
6.2.1	A Nurse of Stanford Hospital and Clinics and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital who has completed the trial period shall be eligible for transfer to a position represented under this Agreement. Such transfer shall be in accordance with applicable transfer procedures of this Agreement.
-8-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
A Nurse who transfers to a position represented under this Agreement shall maintain her/his adjusted hire date, and shall be eligible for benefits and other terms in accordance with this Agreement based on the employee's adjusted hire date, if any.
In the first year of employment following the transfer, the Nurse shall have all applicable benefits appropriately prorated not to exceed the amount provided under the terms of all Agreements for that year.
Nothing in this Agreement shall permit the involuntary transfer of a Nurse from a position represented by CRONA to a position not represented by CRONA.
6.2.2	If the Staff Nurse requests a transfer and the transfer is approved or the Staff Nurse is involuntarily transferred, s/he has nine (9) months to meet the Clinical Performance Criteria of that area at her/his Staff Nurse level. After completion of not more than six (6) months, the Staff Nurse will be provided an informal evaluation regarding her/his progress towards meeting the Clinical Performance Criteria. If the nurse is not meeting the performance level at the end of the nine (9) months, reclassification downward will occur to the next lower Staff Nurse level with salary decrease processed immediately as necessary. Thereafter the Staff Nurse shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

9.5.2	Eligibility. All Staff Nurses (excludes Relief) who are categorized as regular or trial period whether full-time or part-time are eligible for PTO.
9.5.3	Accrual.
a.	PTO is accrued on the basis of productive hours worked, including holidays, educational hours, CRONA days, short notice compensation, and overtime at established accrual rates on a maximum of eighty (80) hours in a pay period. Except that eight (8) hour double shifts worked in a workday may result in an accrual of PTO over eighty (80) hours in a pay period.
b.	PTO accrual will continue for all hours off on Jury Duty and legal appearances as defined in Section 27, for hours the Staff Nurse would normally have been scheduled to work.
c.	The following accrual rates are derived from the assumption that a Staff Nurse who works full time will take off the PTO days s/he earns in a year. The PTO days and hours per year are listed for illustrative purposes only to show the PTO days and hours which will accrue each year, for an 8-hour full-time employee, if all permissible PTO is used in such year.

b.	PTO, as with all other time off, such as absent time, must, except in unusual circumstances, be requested in writing in advance of the time off desired, and approved in writing by the Supervisor, except for an emergency or illness. Approval will be based upon the Employer's determination of its staffing needs. When time off is requested without prior approval due to an emergency or illness, a specific reason for the request is to be given and accrued PTO time must be used. The Staff Nurse requiring time off without prior approval must call at least two (2) hours before the start of the assigned shift. If the department is not open before the start ol the shift, the employee has sixty (60) minutes after the opening of the office within which to call. If the Staff Nurse does not have approval for each day of absence, it shall be considered an unpaid, unexcused absence. Such absences can become cause for disciplinary action. The Employer may request a doctor's certificate of illness, to be documented by a treating licensed health care provider and/or require the Staff Nurse to be seen by the Employer's designated Physician or Nurse Practitioner if the amount of time off due to illness is deemed excessive by the Employer.
c.	The Employer shall use its best efforts to provide Staff Nurses rotating off the night shift to the day shift with a schedule which allows two (2) consecutive unpaid twenty-four (24) hour periods off between shifts. In the event two (2) consecutive unpaid twenty-four (24) hour periods off are not scheduled, the Staff Nurse may request, at her/his option, either Absent Days or PTO. Such scheduling and such requests shall be given preferential treatment over other PTO requests. Such requests shall not affect the Staff Nurse's rights to receive premium pay for weekends when appropriate under the terms of this Agreement.
d.	PTO or an absent day may be offered to and accepted by a Staff Nurse if such Staff Nurse is extra on her/his respective unit and cannot in the determination of the Employer be utilized elsewhere to meet a staffing need.
e.	In units where there is prolonged low census, those nurses who have depleted their PTO will be eligible, depending on operational needs, for up to two weeks of vacation annually without pay. CRONA and Nursing Administration will mutually agree on the definition of a period of prolonged low census.
f.	PTO shall be granted to Staff Nurses having Herpes who are assigned to specialty units (Delivery Room, Nurseries), and cannot be utilized in other areas.

A Nurse will be eligible to take prescheduled vacation, even if the Nurse has insufficient PTO, if the insufficient PTO is a result of the use of PTO for bereavement, as per 9.5.4.p. This will apply if the insufficient PTO is a result of the use of PTO for bereavement which occurred following the scheduling of the vacation.
9.5.5 Holidays. The following holidays are built-in components of the PTO accrual rates: New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King’s Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and the Staff Nurse’s Birthday or alternatively, any other work day mutually agreed upon by the Staff Nurse and her/his supervisor within the year following the nurse’s birthday.

Relief Nurses sent home because of health problems will be reimbursed for the time worked only.
A newly hired Relief Nurse must work three hundred fifty (350) hours to be eligible for "off-call" as defined in this subsection. An eligible Relief Nurse may take up to a total of eight (8) weeks off ("off-call") with a limit of four (4) weeks during the period from June 1 - September 30. "Off-call" will be considered only applicable to requested periods comprising at least seven (7) consecutive days and when the nurse's commitment is not met in that pay period.

The CRONA Nurse Advocate or a CRONA officer or officers designated by CRONA as the representative for the purposes of this paragraph will be notified when supervision determines that a nurse may be placed on probation and at the nurse's request may be present at the meeting to discuss the probation. CRONA will inform the Employer in writing of the CRONA officers so designated within thirty (30) working days after execution of this agreement and thereafter within ten (10) working days of any change in officer designation.

SECTION 24
GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
Purpose: The purpose of the procedures set forth herein is to provide the parties with an orderly means of resolving differences which may arise between them. The parties intend that the procedures set forth shall be in lieu of any other formal procedure established by the Employer for resolution of employee grievances and shall be the exclusive means for resolution of CRONA's grievances against the Employer.
24.1	Grievances.
24.1.1	Only nurses who have successfully completed the trial period of employment are eligible to use this grievance procedure, except that trial period nurses may use this procedure for disputes over whether their paychecks are in accordance with the pay provisions of this Agreement, or whether they have been subjected to any discrimination of the type described in Section 2.
24.1.2	A Formal grievance is a written claim by a nurse or CRONA concerning a nurse's wages, hours, or working conditions and involving the interpretation or application of this Agreement. A grievance may be filed by any individual nurse covered by this Agreement or by any officer designated by CRONA. A grievance filed by CRONA when not on behalf of an individual nurse shall be started at Step Two of this procedure.
-64-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
24.2	Grievance Procedure.
24.2.1	Step One - Informal Discussions. A grievance may be started when a nurse (called "grievant") tells her/his supervisor the facts of the grievance and asks for resolution within five (5) working days. A CRONA representative may be present at the option of the individual nurse. If the grievant does not accept resolution of any part of the grievance, s/he may proceed to Step Two of this procedure or the grievant may at her/his option skip Step One and begin the grievance at Step Two.
24.2.2	Step Two - Submission of Formal Grievance. The grievance shall be submitted in writing to the Vice President of Patient Care within the time frames set forth in paragraph b. Timeliness below. The Vice President of Patient Care will submit a copy of the grievance to CRONA and to the Director of Employee and Labor Relations within two (2) working days from receipt of such grievance.
a.	Content of Formal Grievance. The formal grievance shall be signed and dated by the grievant or designated CRONA officer and shall contain a brief description of the action or inaction complained of, the Employer management representative, if known, who is believed to have taken the action or failed to act, the date the action occurred or should have occurred, the resolution desired, and the Section or Sections of the Agreement alleged to be involved.
b.	Timeliness. In cases of discipline, separation or layoff, the formal grievance shall be submitted no later than twenty-one (21) calendar days, and in all other cases no later than thirty (30) calendar days, after the date the action occurred or should have occurred. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if in the case of a grievance, the nurse aggrieved did not know of the action or failure to act when it occurred, then the grievance shall be submitted no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the day when the nurse could reasonably have been expected to have known. If, in the case of a grievance which is not a claim on behalf of any nurse, neither CRONA nor any of its agents, knew of the action or failure to act when it occurred, then the grievance shall be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days after the day CRONA or any of its agents could reasonably have been expected to have known. Disputes as to timeliness shall be resolved by the arbitrator should the grievance proceed to that stage.
24.2.3	Step Three - Resolution or Referral for Review. The Vice President of Patient Care shall respond to the grievance or refer it to a reviewing
-65-

24.2.4	Step Four-Arbitration.
a.	When CRONA has requested arbitration in accordance with this Section, CRONA and a representative designated by the Employer shall attempt to reach Agreement on an arbitrator by informal discussion. If agreement has not been reached within five (5) working days of the request for arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected from the following seven (7) persons by the alternative striking of names, with the Employer striking first, until one remains, who shall be the arbitrator:
Charles Askin, Howard Block, David Nevins, Alexander Cohn, Kathy Kelly, Anita Christina Knowlton and Frank Silver.
b.	Hearing. The arbitration shall begin as soon as possible giving due consideration to the schedules of the representatives and witnesses of the parties provided that failure of CRONA to request the setting of a hearing date within sixty (60) calendar days of the referral to arbitration shall result in a waiver of the claim. The hearing shall be closed unless the arbitrator rules otherwise. Prior to the hearing the parties shall attempt to reach agreement on a joint submission of the case to the arbitrator. If the parties fail to agree on a joint submission, each shall present
-66-

However, each party shall bear its own expenses of representation and witnesses.
e.	Expedited Arbitration. The parties may agree in writing that an individual grievance or grievances be submitted to expedited arbitration as set forth in this subsection e.
(1)	The arbitrator shall conduct a hearing at the earliest date;
(2)	Unless ordered by the Arbitrator, there shall be no
transcript of the hearing and post-hearing briefs shall be waived.;
(3)	The Arbitrator shall use best efforts to render a decision within ten (10) working days following the Arbitrator's closing the hearing record.
Except to the extent modified in this subsection e.( the remaining provisions of Section 24 shall be applicable to expedited arbitration.

a.	Representation at formal steps. A grievant may be assisted or represented by a representative of CRONA at any formal step of the grievance procedure.
b.	Representation at Investigatory Interview. When in the Employer's judgment an investigatory meeting is called for prior to any decision to discipline a nurse, the nurse may upon request have a CRONA representative present. Prior to the meeting supervision will inform the nurse of the purpose for the meeting.
c.	Representation at Disciplinary Meeting. When the Employer has determined that a nurse is to be disciplined, the nurse may upon request have a CRONA representative present at any meeting concerned with such discipline. Prior to the meeting supervision will inform the nurse of the purpose for the meeting.
d.	Definition of Discipline. For the purposes of sub-sections b. and c. above only, an oral warning or reprimand shall not be considered discipline. Nothing in Section 24 shall require the Employer to schedule an investigatory meeting prior to making a decision to discipline a nurse.
24.2.6	Adherence to Time Limits.
a.	Processing of Grievances. The Employer and CRONA agree that grievances should be raised, and settlement attempted, promptly. Failure of CRONA or a nurse to proceed within any time limit set forth in this Section shall constitute a waiver of the claim. Failure of the Employer to act within any time limit set forth herein shall entitle the grievant or CRONA officer to proceed to the next step. If the Employer has not responded within the required time limit, the Employer shall be deemed to have rejected the grievance on the last day of the period for response and the matter may be appealed to the next level. However, any of the time limits set forth in this Section may be extended by mutual written agreement of the Employer and CRONA.
b.	Limit of Liability. The Employer shall not be liable for, nor shall any review or arbitration hearing concern, a claim for back wages or other financial reimbursement for any period prior to one hundred twenty (120) calendar days before the filing of the formal grievance which is the subject of the claim, review or arbitration hearing.
-68-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
24.2.7	Grievance Pending. Grievances filed prior to the effective date of the current Agreement shall be heard under the terms and procedures set forth in the prior Agreement.
24.2.8	Informal Settlement Discussions. CRONA or the Employer may attempt to resolve a grievance at any time or at any level through informal settlement discussions. Such discussions shall in no way interfere with the grievance procedure nor require the participation of the grieving nurse. All such discussions shall be treated as confidential and shall not be used as evidence for or against any position in any subsequent arbitration. No adjustment of a grievance through such discussions shall conflict with or supersede the terms of this Agreement or serve as precedent for the settlement of any other grievances filed under this Agreement.
SECTION 25 NO STRIKES OR LOCKOUT
There shall be no strikes, slowdowns, sympathy strikes, work stoppages, picketing, or concerted interference with the business of the Employer, on the part of CRONA, CRONA officers or it's agents. There shall be no lockout on the part of the Employer during the term of this Agreement.
SECTION 26 NOTICE OF PERSONNEL GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURE CHANGES
CRONA recognizes that, except as provided in this Agreement, the Employer establishes and maintains personnel guidelines and procedures of general application to all the Employer’s employees including nurses, and, subject to this Agreement, the Employer retains the sole discretion to add to, delete from, or otherwise change the provisions of these guidelines and procedures. The Employer will notify CRONA in writing at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance of implementation of any changes in those personnel guidelines and procedures which apply to nurses covered by this Agreement and upon request meet with CRONA to discuss CRONA's recommendations and suggestions concerning the proposed changes. Upon request by CRONA, the Employer will meet with CRONA to discuss current hospital and department policies which apply to nurses covered by this Agreement to discuss CRONA’s recommendations and suggestions regarding the current policies with the goal of achieving consistency. The Employer's discretion with regard to personnel guidelines and procedures shall not otherwise be subject to review under this Agreement.
SECTION 27 JOINT CONFERENCES
27.1	The Employer and CRONA recognize their mutual interest and concerns regarding numerous matters and their effects on nurses, e.g., health and safety, work environment, human resources matters, parking and security and
-69-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
personnel policies and procedures of specific application to nurses and of general application to the Employer's employees, including nurses. The Employer desires to have CRONA share with the Employer their suggestions and recommendations regarding such matters. Therefore the Employer and CRONA agree that at the request of either the Employer or CRONA, joint conferences with CRONA, Stanford Hospital and Clinics and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital shall be held monthly between appropriate Employer representatives and CRONA officers for the purpose of discussing such matters. A representative from Nursing Administration from each Hospital shall attend the meetings. It is understood that no matters discussed or action taken as a result of such conference shall, in any way, change or alter any of the provisions of this Agreement or the rights or obligations of either party under the terms of this Agreement. The parties also may mutually agree to schedule special conferences.
27.2	The Employer respects the legitimate concerns of nurses who may prefer not to participate in procedures in keeping with an individual nurse's moral, ethical, and/or religious beliefs except in an emergency when a patient's life is endangered or when the nurse's actions are not consistent with good nursing practice. The Employer will raise and discuss as appropriate individual cases involving these issues in joint conferences. CRONA recognizes that the Employer retains the sole discretion to make a final determination in such matters and agrees that to the extent disputes are processed in the grievance procedure the Employer's determination will not be overturned except upon a showing that such determination is arbitrary or capricious.
27.3	The parties recognize that issues may arise during the term of this Agreement regarding a possible conflict between the terms of this Agreement and a reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals with a disability. Where such issues arise, the Employer will consult with CRONA to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a mutually acceptable solution can be found.
SECTION 28
NURSE PRACTICE COMMITTEE
28.1	Composition.

In the event that either the Employer or CRONA wishes to have additional representatives appointed to the Nurse Practice Committee from departments outside the Department of Nursing who have CRONA R.N. staff, the appointment would be subject to the committee's approval. This committee will have a co-chair from the Employer and from CRONA chosen by the respective parties from within the eight (8) appointed members.

Upon request the Committee will review changes in the composition of personnel of the affected units which result in a material change in the duties or work load of Nurses working on the affected unit. Recommendations on staffing levels will be made to the Vice President of Patient Care. If the Nurse Practice Committee does not reach consensus on its recommendations the issues will be referred for final discussion between the Vice President of Patient Care and the President of CRONA.
In meeting the staffing needs of the unit, the Resource Nurse is permitted to use judgment in adjusting staffing levels that may not be fully addressed by the acuity and staffing matrix.
b.	Assignment Despite Objection Form (ADO) as prepared by CRONA, will be an open agenda item for review by the Nurse Practice Committee with recommendations, if any, made in accordance with 28.3.3. ADO forms will be made available on the units. The manager or designee shall respond in writing to this Assignment Despite Objection Form (ADO) within two (2) weeks after notification by CRONA.

The committee shall defer placement of the issue on its agenda until the issue has been fully discussed and reviewed at the appropriate unit or region level.
28.4.2	The Nurse Practice Committee shall discharge its responsibilities in accordance with mutually agreed upon procedures. The Committee shall meet once a month, if necessary, to work on outstanding agenda items.
28.4.3	The Committee's discussions will focus on the facts of the particular issue and identification of potential ways, if any, to resolve the issues. The Committee shall attempt to prepare a joint recommendation to the Vice President of Patient Care if appropriate to the particular issue or problem. If a joint recommendation is not made, either the Employer or CRONA representatives may request that the Committee refer the issue or problem for final discussion and review between the Vice President of Patient Care and the President of CRONA.
28.4.4	It is understood that in order to promote full exploration of issues and efforts at problem solving, no matters discussed or action taken as a result of the work of the Committee shall change or alter any of the provisions of the Agreement or the obligations or rights under the Agreement of either CRONA or the Employer.

-72-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07

Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
Nurse's signature on her/his application for employment, subject to seniority adjustments. If the dates of the signatures are the same, or one of the Nurses does not have a copy of an application on file, seniority among such Nurses will be determined by lot.
31.2	Staff nurses who were employed by UCSF Stanford Health Care on March 31, 2000 and were employed by Stanford Hospital and Clinics on April 1, 2000 will be credited with their accrued seniority as of March 31, 2000.

32.1	Staffing. The final determination of appropriate staffing levels is one of the rights reserved to the Employer as defined in Section 34 of this Agreement. CRONA recognizes that the Employer's daily staffing needs may change from unit to unit, shift to shift and that the Employer has the right to schedule Staff and relief nurses according to those needs.
32.2	Temporary Staff Reductions.
32.2.1	If, in the judgment of the Employer, budgetary or operational considerations require a temporary reduction of Staff nurses covered by this Agreement the Employer will notify CRONA and at CRONA’s request meet and discuss ways in which to develop equitable staffing for the regular full-time and part-time Staff Nurses affected. These discussions shall include the feasibility of the following:
a.	Voluntary temporary reduction in work commitment.
b.	Credit for voluntary use of PTO.
c.	Credit for mandatory "A" days.

In periods of staff reduction and layoffs, relief nurses shall be scheduled according to need and pursuant to the terms of Section 11 of this Agreement.
32.2.2	When it is necessary to cancel Nurses on a unit, cancellations will occur in the following order if the remaining staff have the necessary skills and abilities to meet operational needs: voluntary, over commitment, Registry, Relief and Staff. A Nurse Supervisor/Manager will be taken out of the count before a Staff Nurse is canceled;
-75-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01704 - 3/31/07
however a Nurse may be required to float within the Nurse’s region prior to a Nurse Supervisor/Manager being taken out of the count.
32.2.3	“A" Time Credit. Staff Nurses eligible to accrue PTO shall accrue “A“
Time Credit on the same productive hours as PTO is accrued, at the following accrual rate. The purpose of the “A” Time Credit is to compensate Staff Nurses at their base hourly wage rate, including shift differential, when they are absent from work as a result of “A” Time resulting from excess staffing on a unit. The nurse may choose to use PTO, “A" Time Credit or unpaid hours for Absent time. Accrued “A" Time may be used during any waiting period for state disability insurance or Workers' Compensation and to supplement any such disability payments during a period of disability.
"A" Time Credit	Time Accrued Per Hour Worked
First Year of Employment	.0243
2™ through 3rd year	.0253
4tri through 9’" year	.0265
10in and subsequent years	.0273
Effective in August of each year a Staff Nurse’s accumulated “A” Time will automatically be retained in the Staff Nurse’s “A" Time bank, unless the Staff Nurse requests that the "A” Time be converted to PTO, or cashed out based on the same calculation as cashing out PTO.
32.3	Permanent or Indefinite Layoff. If, in the judgment of the Employer, budgetary or operational considerations require a permanent curtailment of operations or permanent layoff of regular full-time or part-time Staff nurses covered by this Agreement, the layoffs will be accomplished in accordance with this subsection.
32.3.1	Notice. When the Employer determines that a permanent or indefinite layoff of Staff Nurses is imminent, it shall give CRONA such advance notice as is reasonable under the circumstances. When individual nurses are selected for layoff, each shall be given at least thirty (30) calendar days notice or pay in lieu of such notice. A copy of each individual notice shall be sent to CRONA at the same time. The notice may be rescinded if circumstances develop that the nurse is to be retained, reassigned, or offered another position. If a nurse resigns after being given notice of permanent layoff, the balance of the notice period will not be converted to pay. However, the nurse will, if otherwise eligible, continue to be entitled to severance pay.
32.3.2	Selection of Those to be Laid-Off. The Employer shall designate the area or areas including the region or work unit as appropriate where layoffs are to occur and the number of Staff nurse positions. Within the designated areas, the Employer will select nurses for layoff pursuant to
-76-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
Section 31 of the Agreement and in accordance with the Employer's assessment of operational needs.
32.3.	3 Placement Alternative to Lay-Off. The Employer will, to the extent practicable, attempt to place nurses selected for layoff in units with unfilled vacant positions, provided that in The Employer’s judgment, the nurse possesses the requisite skill and ability to perform the actually expected work without additional training (as distinguished from orientation).
The Employer will meet with CRONA in Joint Conference to discuss the placement of nurses under this subsection. A nurse who is offered and refuses placement in a position at substantially equivalent pay shall not be entitled to severance allowance as defined in subsection 4. below.
32.3.	4 Severance Allowance. Regular full-time and part-time staff nurses with one (1) year or more continuous employment as a regular full-time or part-time staff nurse, who have not refused a position of substantially equivalent pay offered by Stanford Hospital and Clinics, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, or Stanford University, will be entitled to receive a severance allowance from the Employer according to the calculation schedule set forth below. Repayment of severance is in accordance with 32.3.5.
If a Nurse subsequently accepts employment in another division or department with the Employer at any location other than those listed above, the nurse is obligated to repay the severance in accordance with 32.3.5.
Calculation: Severance pay will be calculated by using the base monthly pay at time of layoff.

32.3.	5 Repayment of Severance. Prior to receiving severance pay, a nurse must sign an agreement (Payroll Deduction Authorization) to repay severance to the Employer if re-employed within one (1) year of the effective date of layoff. In that event, the nurse may retain that portion of the severance pay equal to the base pay s/he would have earned if not laid off. The balance is to be repaid either in full at the time of reemployment or by payroll deduction. A nurse may request other arrangements and, if approved, the schedule of repayment will be established by written agreement between the nurse and the Director of Employee and Labor Relations, or designee.
32.3.	6 Continuation of Benefits. Nurses on layoff status have the option of purchasing health, dental and life insurance at the group rate available to the Employer pursuant to COBRA. These premiums must be paid monthly, in advance by the nurse.
32.3.	7 Re-Employment. Nurses who have been laid off have preference for re-employment as specified below, for twelve (12) months from date of layoff. Repayment of a portion of the severance allowance may be required in accordance with 32.3.5. The Employer and CRONA will discuss in Joint Conference ways in which laid off Staff Nurses can be made aware of vacant positions as they arise.
32.3.	8 Re-Employment Preference. A nurse who has been permanently or indefinitely laid off shall be given preference for employment in any posted Staff Nurse vacancy for which s/he applies, if in the judgment of supervision s/he possesses sufficient skill and ability to perform without additional training the actually expected work, unless another applicant for the position is better qualified. The Employer shall have sole discretion as to the determination of appropriate Staff Nurse level for nurses exercising this preference.

SIDE LETTER
Between Stanford Hospital and Clinics And Committee for Recognition of Nursing Achievement (CRONA) 2000
During negotiations between Stanford Hospital and Clinics and CRONA the following items were agreed to be included in a side letter for the term of the current agreement.
A.	Parking.
The Employer recognizes the concerns raised by CRONA over security and parking and will use its best efforts to work with Stanford University to provide adequate shuttle service and security for nurses on all shifts. During the term of the agreement, the parties will continue to explore problem-solving issues regarding parking and lighting at the Quarry Road parking lot.
B.	Criteria.
Definitions
For the purposes of this Side Letter:
“Goals" means the document entitled “Goals for Demonstration of Leadership and Educational Skills" for attainment of Staff Nurse III and IV are as contained in the June 4, 2000 letter from Stanford Hospital and Clinics to CRONA, as modified on June 19, 2000 as modified in this side letter.
“Performance Standards" means the number attributed to each activity in the Goals - hours shifts, etc.
Assessment Period
In an effort to establish objective and measurable Performance Standards to meet the Goals, the first 15-months following the settlement of this Agreement shall be used as an assessment period for evaluating and establishing appropriate Performance Standards (the “assessment period"). During the assessment period, the target Performance Standards are the standards set forth in the Goals and these target numbers shall be used to assess the reasonability and attainability of the Performance Standards and are not minimum standards. The Nurse Practice Committee will develop a mechanism to review and assess the Performance Standards.
-84-
016.323960 6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
It is not the Employer’s intention to create or maintain Performance Standards which have the effect of limiting the number of Nurses advancing on the clinical ladder nor to limit the number of Nurses holding positions at each level.
During the assessment period, the target Performance Standards contained in the Goals are not intended to be a minimum standard which individual Nurses will be required to meet.
During the assessment period, the Nurse Practice committee shall review the experience gained during the assessment period, evaluate the Performance Standards contained in the Goals against such experience and determine whether the standards are workable for both the staff and the managers. Thereafter, the Nurse Practice Committee shall make recommendations regarding the Performance Standards. The Nurse Practice Committee may determine which activities may count as two activities and will discuss the concept of tenure as it relates to leadership activities.
As part of the evaluation process, each Nurse at the Staff Nurse III or IV level, or seeking to be reclassified to such levels, shall meet with her/his manager to agree on acceptable goals and Performance Standards targets. During the evaluation year the manager and the Nurse shall review the Nurse's progress toward achieving the target Performance Standards and, if appropriate, adjust the targets.
During the assessment period, the employer shall not initiate the process to reclassify a Nurse downward involuntarily solely upon not achieving the Performance Standards as identified in the Goals. The assessment period will be extended for an additional 12-months, for a total of 27-months following the settlement of the initial Agreement on July 27, 2000.
Modification of the Criteria
The parties agree that there may be occasions when the Criteria, including the Performance Standards, may require modification. Any such proposed modification shall be reviewed by the Nurse Practice Committee either as a whole committee or in a subcommittee as decided by the Nurse Practice Committee.
Decisions of the Nurse Practice Committee shall be by majority vote. There shall be present a quorum of at least six (6) members and only an equal number of CRONA nurses and management shall be permitted to vote. If the committee is unable to reach agreement, the parties agree the issue(s) may be referred to the FMCS for mediation.
Individual Managers may not set specific criteria without going through the Nurse Practice Committee.

Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
C.	Staffing.
For the term of this Agreement, the parties agree that if there are issues under Section 28.2.1.c which have been referred to the Vice President of Patient Care Services and the President of CRONA and have not been resolved, they will engage a mediator through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to facilitate consensus building. The parties further agree that notwithstanding this side letter and Section 28.2.1.C the Employer retains the ultimate discretion regarding issues that arise under Section 28.
D.	Relief Nurses.
The employer shall not unreasonably restrict a Relief Nurse “A" from moving to Relief Nurse “B”.
E.	Medical Plans.
1.	Hospitalization: Hospital charges (excluding physician charges) for employees covered by the CIGNA PPO will be waived if a plan participant is hospitalized at SHC and/or LPCH. Hospitalization includes same day surgery and ATU, This does not include charges when the plan participant is not hospitalized, e.g., outpatient charges for MRI.
2.	Prescription Drug Program - for CIGNA PPO participants.
■	Formulary Drugs
Co-payments per prescription $5 for generic drugs $10 for brand name drugs
■	Non-Formulary Drugs - which are prescribed and FDA approved

SIDE LETTER
Between Stanford Hospital and Clinics And Committee for Recognition of Nursing Achievement (CRONA)
The following side letters were previously agreed to between the Stanford Hospital and Clinics and CRONA and will be continued for the term of the current agreement.
A.	Weekend Differential. (8/20/96)
This letter will record and confirm our agreement pertaining to the interpretation of the application of weekend differential contained in the 1996-1998 collective bargaining agreement.
Weekend differential will be paid to Staff nurses for productive hours worked on a weekend. Refer to Section 7.5.4 of the Agreement for details. The weekend for the purpose of weekend differential pay only is defined as follows:
Saturday and/or Sunday for all or part of the day and evening shifts; Night shift beginning Friday and/or Saturday night unless otherwise designated by agreement between Nursing Administration and the nurse (i.e., Saturday and/or Sunday; Friday and/or Sunday).
In order to clarify in more detail how the definition of the weekend and the application of the weekend differential would apply, the following examples will serve as guidelines;
A Dav or Evening Nurse:
Who is called into work the Friday night shift is eligible for weekend differential. However, the nurse who works 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM on a Friday is not eligible.
Who works a Sunday night shift is not eligible. However, the nurse who works 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM on Sunday is eligible.
A Night Nurse:
Who works 7:00 PM Friday to 7:00 AM Saturday is eligible. However, the nurse who works 7:00 PM Sunday to 7:00 AM Monday is not eligible, unless this is the designated defined weekend agreement.
Who works Friday night, but who has an agreement with Nursing that the weekend designation is Saturday and Sunday nights, is not eligible.
-87-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
All Nurses:
Who are on absent time or PTO are not eligible.
Who work overtime hours which are not part of the weekend shift as defined above, but which are contiguous to a weekend shift worked, will receive the weekend differential if the overtime is for a period of less than three (3) hours. If the overtime is for a period of three (3) hours or more, weekend differential is not applicable to the shift worked. Conversely, nurses who work overtime hours which are part of the weekend shift, but which are contiguous to a non-weekend shift worked, will not receive weekend differential unless the overtime is for a period of three (3) or more hours.
For example:
An evening nurse who works 3:00 PM Friday to 12:01 AM Saturday does not receive weekend differential. If that nurse continues to work until 4:00 AM Saturday, the nurse is eligible for weekend differential for the entire overtime shift.
An evening nurse who works 3:00 PM Sunday to 12:01 AM Monday receives the weekend differential. If that nurse continues to work until 4:00 AM Monday, the nurse does not receive weekend differential for the overtime shift worked.
B.	16-Hours. (8-20-96)
CRONA and the Employer agree that it is in the interest of the Employer and the nurses to relieve nurses who have worked sixteen contiguous hours who request to be relieved of duty. If the nurse does request to be relieved of duty, the Employer will use its best efforts to relieve the nurse as soon as practicable after the request is made.
C.	Vacation and Holiday Time. (6/11/98)
We will continue to grant vacation and holiday time based on seniority and unit equity. Disputes will be reviewed and resolved on a case by case basis.

SIDE LETTER
Between Stanford Hospital and Clinics And CRONA re On Call and Overtime Issues In The O.R.s , P.A.C.U.s, Cath Lab And Endoscopy
2004
This Side Letter applies to the Employees in the O.R.s and P.A.C.U.s only, unless and to the extent that the application of a portion hereof is made applicable by specific reference to other unit/departments.
A.	On Call Shift Selection/Assignment Procedures
With the exception of the Cath Lab, the on call shift selection and assignment procedures in effect in the various departments will remain in effect unless and until the Unit/Department on call committee recommends a change which is adopted by the vote of 2/3 of the employees performing call in the Unit/Department, and reviewed and approved by the Employer.
In the Cath Lab, and in any new unit where call is utilized during the life of this Side Agreement prior to the development of an on call selection and assignment procedure by an on call committee, and adoption by 2/3 of the employees to perform on call in the unit and review and approval by the Employer, the following selection process will apply:
Each Nurse will select one weekday on call shift and, if there is weekend call, one weekend on call shift in order of seniority until every Nurse eligible to take call has had an opportunity to select one shift. Thereafter, Nurses may select one or more additional shifts in order of seniority until all shifts are selected, or no one wishes to select additional shifts. The Employer may limit the number of shifts selected by any Nurse based upon considerations of patient and employee safety.
If all of the on call shifts are not selected through the preceding process, the Employer will assign on call shifts by inverse seniority, except that it will first assign a shift to any Nurse who declined to select any on call shifts in the voluntary selection process, allowing the Nurse to select which of the unassigned on call shifts he or she wishes from the shifts remaining at the time, until all of the shifts have been assigned. The Employer may decline to assign a shift to a junior Nurse based upon considerations of patient and employee safety.
-89-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
With specific regard to the Cath Lab, in adopting this selection process, the on call schedule will cover a period of twelve (12) weeks, and weekend shifts remain at 48 hours in length.
B.	On Call/Catl Back Contiguous With a Scheduled Shift
On call schedules will be posted at least two (2) weeks prior to the effective date of the on caff schedule. If a Nurse has volunteered for or been assigned to an on call shift that begins immediately upon the end of the Nurse’s regular work shift, and the Nurse is advised that his or her services on a call back basis will be required at the beginning of the on call shift, or is called and reports back to work within ninety (90) minutes of the end of her/his regular work shift, then on the second and each subsequent occasion during a pay period that the Nurse is similarly on call beginning at the end of his/her regular work shift and is informed that (s)he will be required to perform call back work at the beginning of the shift, or is called back and reports to work within ninety (90) minutes of the end of his/her regular work shift, the time spent on call back will be paid an additional half time premium (i.e., double time if the call back would otherwise be paid at time and one-half, and double time and a half if the call back pay would otherwise be paid at double time). This provision does not apply to time spent working beyond the shift to finish reporting or charting, or to finish the Staff Nurse’s own assigned duties where the time spent is sixty (60) minutes or less.
C.	Mandatory Overtime
If, during a pay period, a Staff Nurse has already performed mandated overtime and the Staff Nurse is subsequently mandated by the Employer to perform additional overtime during the same pay period, the mandated overtime hours worked on the second occasion and all subsequent mandated hours of overtime worked during the pay period shall be compensated at two times (2X) the Staff Nurse’s regular rate of pay if the overtime would otherwise be at time and one-half (I-I/2X), or at double time and one-half (2-1/2X) of the Staff Nurse’s regular rate if the overtime would otherwise be at double time (2X). In order for the overtime to be ‘'mandated'' or “mandatory,” the Staff Nurse must have refused in writing to take the assignment, and thereafter been directed to do so by the Employer. Overtime at the end of the Staff Nurse’s shift of up to one hour to complete a procedure, to complete charting or report, or otherwise to finish the Staff Nurse’s own assigned duties will not be considered to be mandated overtime for purposes of this Side Letter.
D.	Unavoidable Conflicts and Unforeseen Emergencies
If a Staff Nurse has a specific unavoidable commitment or an emergency that affects the Nurse’s ability to stay beyond the end of his or her shift beyond the time required to complete charting and report, or to finish his/her own assigned duties, the Nurse will inform the Patient Care Manager, Assistant Patient Care Manager, or in their absence the Resource Nurse, of the unavoidable conflict or emergency as far in advance as is possible. Should the need for overtime thereafter arise on the date and shift involved, the Employer will make all reasonable efforts to secure the needed coverage by other
-90-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
Nurses who are present and working, or by floating in order to accommodate the conflict or emergency if possible. The Nurse so accommodated will be expected to be reasonably available to assist in providing coverage should another Nurse have an unavoidable conflict or emergency on a subsequent occasion.
If a Staff Nurse has volunteered for or been assigned to an on call shift and is unable to perform it because of an unavoidable conflict or emergency, the Nurse will inform the Patient Care Manager, the Assistant Patient Care Manager, or in their absence the Resource Nurse, as far in advance as is possible, and if the conflict is known in advance will make all reasonable efforts to obtain a trade of on call shifts with another Nurse. If the Nurse cannot obtain a trade of on call shifts with another Nurse and no other Nurse volunteers to take the on call shift with the result that the Employer Is required to provide the necessary coverage by involuntary assignment to another Nurse or Nurses, the Nurse who was unable to work the shift as scheduled will be expected to be reasonably available to assist in providing coverage by a trade 'of on call shifts, or by volunteering to take an additional on call shift, should another Nurse subsequently have an unavoidable conflict or emergency requiring similar efforts to accommodate his/her need.
While the Employer will continue generally to make efforts to obtain voluntary coverage for overtime and on call shifts, it is understood that the provisions described above are intended to address the occasional unavoidable conflict and emergency situations only.
The provisions of this Section do not constitute a guarantee that the Employer will be able to accommodate the occasional unavoidable conflict or unforeseen emergency in every instance.
Disputes concerning the application and interpretation of the provisions of this Side Letter will be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the Master Agreement between the parties.

SIDE LETTER
Between Stanford Hospital and Clinics And CRONA Re In-House Registry Nurse Pilot Program 2004
This Side Letter is entered into between Stanford Hospital & Clinics (“Employer'’) and the Committee for Recognition of Nursing Achievement ("Union”), for the purpose of establishing a pilot program for In-House Registry Nurses, and in order to provide additional Nursing resources, greater flexibility in covering staffing needs arising on a shift or partial shift basis, and reducing the occurrences of overtime and involuntary floating for existing full-time and part-time Staff Nurses.
“In-House Registry Nurses” are Registered Nurses employed for the purpose of floating within designated “pods” according to their skills and competencies. In-House Registry Nurses will be required to make themselves available for a minimum of two (2) shifts per pay period, including one (1) weekend shift per four (4) week schedule period and two (2) shifts per year on nationally recognized holidays; provided that they will be able to make themselves unavailable for up to eight (8) weeks each year, with a limit of four (4) weeks between June 1 and September 30, by giving a prescribed prior notification to the Employer. In addition, the In-House Registry Nurse must comply with other standards to be established for In-House Registry Nurses by the Employer in consultation with the Nurse Practice Committee, regarding such matters, for instance, as call in requirements for unscheduled absences, and must also meet other conditions of employment such as competency requirements for their assigned pod, Annual Review, BLS, etc., as defined by the Employer and by regulations and regulatory agencies. In-House Registry Nurses will be limited to less than 1000 hours of work per year, and will not be entitled to benefits.
In-House Registry Nurses must have two (2) or more years of experience in nursing environments relevant to one or more of the designated floating “pods.” Current Relief Nurses may apply for transfer to a position as an In-House Registry Nurse, and will be considered based upon their skills and abilities and their agreement to accept the terms and conditions for an In-House Registry Nurse. A full-time or part-time Staff Nurse may not participate in the in-House Registry Nurse program in addition to his/her regularly scheduled work.
The Employer will establish the number of In-House Registry Nurses per pod, per shift and per day, and may adjust the numbers as it deems necessary or appropriate during the life of the program. An in-House Registry Nurse may be employed to work eight (8), ten (10) or twelve (12) hour shifts.
-93-
016.323960.6
Stanford Hospital and Clinics * 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
In-House Registry Nurses with two (2) or more but less than five (5) years of experience will be paid a flat straight time hourly rate of $45.00 per hour for the day shift, $49.50 for the evening shift and $53.00 per hour for the night shift. Registry Nurses with five (5) or more years of experience will receive a flat straight time hourly rate of $50.00 per hour for the day shift, $55.00 per hour for the evening shift and $58.50 per hour for the night shift. Weekend differential of 5% will be paid for work on the weekend in accordance with the provisions of the Master Agreement. Overtime premium and pay for working a holiday designated in the Master Agreement will be in accordance with the provisions of the Master Agreement between the parties.
The Employer may increase the straight time rates for In-House Registry Nurses if it determines that competitive considerations make such an increase appropriate, but will notify the Union prior to doing so, and will meet upon its request to explain the increases and the basis upon which they are being made. In-House Registry Nurse wage rates will be reviewed at least annually so long as the program remains in place.
Each In-House Registry Nurse will serve a six (6) month probationary period which may be extended once by the Employer in its sole discretion for up to an additional three (3) months. During the probationary period, the In-House Registry Nurse may be disciplined or terminated by the Employer as may be determined by the Employer, and the discipline or termination will not be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the parties' Agreement. Upon successful completion of the probationary period and any extension thereto, the In-House Registry Nurse may be terminated for cause, provided that failure to meet the availability requirements and/or failure to maintain the necessary competencies to work on the units within the assigned pod will be conclusively deemed to be cause(s) for discipline up to and including termination in the judgment of the Employer. A Relief Nurse who applies for and receives an In-House Registry Nurse position will be in a probationary period for the first six (6) months after transfer, and if the Nurse fails to meet the necessary In-House Registry Nurse requirements, will be returned to a Relief Nurse position, unless discipline or termination is warranted under the cause standard applicable to Relief and full-time and part-time Nurses under the Master Agreement.
The pods to which an In-House Registry Nurse may be assigned are as follows:
#	1. Med Surg Units, BMT/Oncology/ATU and Psych;
#	2. Intermediate Care, D2/D3, Cath Lab, Cardiac, and Cardiac Surveillance;
#	3. ICU, ED, D1CCU and PACU; and
#	4. Main/ASC OR, Main/ASC PACU and SAU
The In-House Registry Nurse will receive his/her initial assignment for the start of the shift either in advance or at the time of reporting to work, but may be reassigned within the pod to which (s)he is assigned during the shift, as needs arise in the judgment of the Employer. Should the Employer determine that it is necessary and appropriate to do so, the In-House Registry Nurse may on occasion be assigned from one facility within the pod to another, where units in more than one facility are included within the pod. An In-House Registry Nurse so reassigned will be reimbursed for mileage between the

Stanford Hospital and Clinics • 4/01/04 - 3/31/07
facilities and far tolls paid upon submission of appropriate documentation in accordance with the Employer’s mileage and reimbursement policies.
Should the need arise to cancel a Nurse, In-House Registry Nurses will be cancelled prior to Staff Nurses (including relief), provided that the Unit’s skills needs are met. Should the need arise to float a Nurse from one unit to another, provided that both involved Units have skills needs met, the In-House Registry Nurse will be floated first, unless a Staff Nurse volunteers to float.
The Pilot Program will be in place for an initial period of one (1) year, and may be extended by the Employer for an additional six (6) months; provided, however, that such extension shall end no later than the last day of the Master Agreement between the parties. At the end of the initial one (1) year period, or if it is extended upon the expiration of any extension, the Pilot Program will automatically terminate unless the parties agree in writing to extend the In-House Registry Nurse Program under the same or different terms. The Employer will notify the Union in writing of the starting date of the Pilot Program, and will also notify the Union in writing if it elects to extend the Pilot Program for an additional six (6) months. Thereafter, the Pilot Program will be discontinued unless the parties agree to an extension under the same or different terms. Notwithstanding the time periods described above, the Employer may terminate the Pilot Program, in its entirety or as it applies to one or more pods, upon the giving of thirty (30) days’ notice to the Union, and will meet upon request of the Union to discuss the reasons for the decision, and to hear any suggestions that the Union might have for altering the program, in its entirety or as it relates to one or more pods, with the goal of preserving the program. If no agreeable alternatives are identified, then the Pilot Program or that portion thereof identified in the notice to the Union, will terminate upon the expiration of the thirty (30) days.
In the event that the Employer desires to alter the basic terms of the Pilot Program as set forth in this Side Letter, it will provide notice to the Union of the intended changes, and will meet and bargain with the Union upon request regarding those changes prior to implementing them. The Union may also notify the Employer that it wishes to discuss changes prior to the expiration of the Pilot Program, and the Employer agrees to meet and discuss the proposed changes with the Union.
Disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the provisions of this Side Letter will be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the Master Agreement between the parties, and so long as the program remains a “pilot program,” will not be subject to the Reserve Rights provision of that Agreement.

SIDE LETTER
Between Stanford Hospital And CRONA Re Resource Nurse Positions 2004
CRONA recognizes the Hospital's concerns regarding the continuity of the application of the Resource Nurse role. CRONA and the Hospital also recognize that each and every Staff Nurse who fulfills that role on any shift is deserving of acknowledgement of the role they play and should be compensated therefor. All Staff Nurses who act in the rote of Resource Nurse will receive appropriate education and training.
Any program to establish a regular designated Resource Nurse position for any unit will be discussed and details finalized in Nurse Practice Committee. Such details should include (but not limited to): the minimum number of clinical hours required to maintain clinical skills, etc., the clinical and leadership requirements, the number of permanent Resource Nurses required, and an evaluation process for the program.
The Nurse Practice Committee will address these issues during the six (6) months following ratification of the Agreement.
Upon implementation of the program, the Resource Nurse premium will be seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the Staff Nurse’s wage rate for any Nurse acting in a Resource Nurse capacity, and the new premium will go into effect at the beginning of the pay period in which the program is implemented.
All Resource Nurses will continue to remain a part of the bargaining unit.
