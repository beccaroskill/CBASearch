Grievance Procedure
4.0	Purpose
The purpose of this grievance procedure shall be to settle equitably, and informally, if possible, at the lowest administrative level, disputes which may arise from time to time with respect to specific claims of violation or misrepresentation of the terms of this Agreement or of established personnel practices.

c)	The term "days" used in this section shall be teacher attendance days (i.e., with or without students).
4.2	Structure

Procedure
The number of days indicated at each level shall be considered a maximum, and every effort shall be made to expedite the process.

b)	A written grievance shall be filed as soon as possible, but in no event later than fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of facts giving rise to the grievance or notice of such facts to the teacher, whichever is later.

A written answer shall be delivered not later than two (2) days following the meeting described in this subsection (b).
STEP 2:
If a grievance is not settled at Step one (1) (b), the Association may within five (5) days of receipt of the Step one (1) (b) answer; notify the designated Vice President in writing that it appeals a grievance. Within three (3) days, the designated Vice President shall convene a Step two (2) meeting of the Central Grievance Committee and himself, and a written answer on or attached to the grievance shall be rendered within two (2) days thereafter and delivered to the Association. Nothing herein shall preclude any representative of the Association from discussing the grievance with the appropriate supervisor of the immediate supervisor, in an attempt to resolve the matter prior to the holding of a Step two (2) meeting.
STEP 3:
4
Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the answer, the Association by notice may request that the matter be submitted for arbitration. The President/CEO and the Association will attempt to select an arbitrator within five (5) days after notice has been given.

4.4	Miscellaneous
a)	No individual teacher may institute an arbitration proceeding.
b)	In the event of mutual arbitrations, an individual arbitrator shall be limited
to one arbitration situation at a time.
c)	Any section of the above arbitration procedure may be altered when mutually agreeable to all parties.
d)	If a complaint against the teacher is not sustained, (he/she) shall be reinstated on such terms as the arbitrator may direct. If he/she shall have been found to have been improperly deprived of any professional advantage, the same shall be restored to him or its equivalent in money shall be paid to him/her.
e)	No reprisal of any kind shall be taken against any participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.
f)	The time in which to render a decision or determination may be extended for a period not to exceed five (5) days upon written request of the person authorized to make such decisions or determinations. A further extension may be made by mutual agreement of the parties.
g)	Failure to comply within the time specified above shall be deemed an acceptance of the decision rendered.

9
most senior candidate shall be given the position. A candidate must be certified to teach the subject where the vacancy exists.
2.	Required interview. If a single teacher requests a specific transfer, the Director shall interview the teacher. The School may select the teacher or select an external candidate.
3.	Rule of Two. If more than one teacher requests a specific transfer, then the School must select from those teachers according to section 5.8.1(1) above. In the event that declination and/or withdrawal results in one candidate in the transfer pool rule, section 5.8.1(2) will apply.
5.8.2
Involuntary Transfers
1.	Purpose of transfer. The School shall make every effort to avoid the use of involuntary transfers. Involuntary transfers will not be punitive or used as a disciplinary measure.
2.	If involuntary transfers can be avoided through voluntary transfers, this will be implemented when practicable.
3.	School Rights. The School shall have the right to involuntarily transfer a teacher for:
a.	Scheduling Needs, which are defined as a demonstrated academic need that cannot be resolved by reasonable scheduling changes. Volunteers will first be sought as per 5.8.1 above.
b.	Level of Instruction. An involuntary transfer may be used when a
change in assignment is necessary to improve the level of instruction of the teacher. Prior to making such a transfer, the School will attempt to provide constructive direction to assist the teacher to improve the level of their instruction. The teacher will be given the opportunity to transfer voluntarily. Constructive direction means that the administration will develop an improvement plan in consultation with the teacher.
c.	Changes in Staffing Patterns: When the number of teachers assigned to a Program exceeds the staffing needs of the unit for the next school year.
4.	Reasons for Transfer. Prior to the effective date of the transfer, the Vice President of Educational Services will meet with the teacher (if requested) to discuss the reasons for transfer.
5.	Notification of GT A. Prior to such involuntary transfers, the School shall
10
notify the GT A of its intention to implement the transfer.
5.9	Lay-Offs
In the event of a curtailment of services whereby layoffs are required, such reduction of staff will take place in the following manner:
There will be three (3) functional school units:
A.	Residential Education Program
B.	Day School/Treatment Program
C.	Therapeutic Preschool Program
Seniority shall be earned in either the Day School /Treatment Program, Therapeutic Preschool Program, Residential Education Program. Teachers who transfer from one unit to another will carry their seniority with them and teachers who teach in more than one unit shall earn seniority in each unit. No one may eam more than one (1) year’s seniority for any one (1) 10-month or 12-month school year.
The 12-month school year shall fall between July 1st through June 30th and the 10-month school year shall fall between September 1st and June 30th.
Layoff will normally occur by unit. Those members of the unit with the least seniority at Gateway in the specialty area affected by the layoff (i.e. Academic, Industrial Arts Technologies, Music, Reading Specialist, etc.) shall be separated first.
If the least senior teacher in the affected unit had taught in the unaffected unit and has more total seniority than the least senior teacher in the unaffected unit, the least senior teacher in the unaffected unit shall be separated.
In the event of a layoff and there has been no service in the other unit:
Should there be a vacancy in the other unit and the teacher involved has at least two (2) years of service at Gateway, and is otherwise qualified for the position, that teacher will be offered the vacant position for one (1) year, after which the decision to retain will be decided via regular evaluation procedures.
Should there be a vacancy in the other unit and the teacher involved has less than two (2) years of service at Gateway, that teacher will be given consideration for the vacant position over someone from outside the unit. It will be Gateway’s prerogative to fill each position with the most qualified teacher.
In the event of recall, such recall will take place in reverse order, that is, the last person separated shall be the first person recalled in the needed specialty area.
Seniority shall begin on the first day of service as a teacher at Gateway. Teachers moving from one teaching specialty area to another at Gateway will maintain their
11
seniority from date of first hire in all areas taught.
If two or more teachers commence seniority rights on the same day, layoff shall be determined by a flip of a coin by a non-involved third party.
During an approved unpaid leave of absence a teacher’s seniority shall be frozen.
Seniority shall be computed on the basis of the total number of months of active employment. Active is defined as months where a teacher is providing direct teaching service. A month is defined as having started employment on or before the fifteenth of any month. For a teacher leaving before the end of a month, a month shall mean the teacher worked through the 15th of that month.
A teacher in a ten (10) or twelve (12) month program cannot earn more than one (1) year of seniority. When a teacher in a twelve (12) month program completes ten (10) months of service, the teacher will receive one (1) year of seniority and no more.
5.10	Professional Flexibility
Teachers shall have freedom to function professionally with a high degree of flexibility, with ample opportunities for innovating techniques and participating in curriculum development, and with opportunities to incorporate personal beliefs and experiences into the teaching process. (Such freedom obviously suggests the related responsibilities of involving die respective Director(s) in planning, and in standing personally accountable, in addition to Gateway's accountability, for one’s actions or inactions.)

a)	The position of a teacher on an approved short term leave, such as personal, sick leave or jury duty, shall be filled by a per diem substitute.
b)	The position of a teacher on an approved long term leave, such as a known medical or child rearing leave or a termination for any reason, shall be filled by a regular long term temporary.

In any year that the discretionary funds are provided to an employees’ enhanced savings plan, all eligible employees (those meeting plan eligibility requirements) would receive a contribution and those funds would be subject to the vesting period schedule. Discretionary contributions would be available to all eligible employees regardless if they contribute additional elected amounts beyond the Gateway’s mandatory contribution.
10.
