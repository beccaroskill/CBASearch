PREAMBLE
AGREEMENT made this 8th day of November, 2002, by and between The Washington Post, hereinafter referred to as The Post, and the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, Local No. 32035, The Newspaper Guild-Communications Workers of America, hereinafter referred to as the Guild, acting for and on behalf of itself and all Guild bargaining unit employees of The Post.
WITNESSETH: In consideration of the mutual covenants set forth in this Agreement, The Post and the Guild agree as follows:
ARTICLE I	- BARGAINING UNIT
1.	(a) The provisions of the Agreement shall apply to all employees
employed by The Washington Post in the Accounting, Administrative Services, Advertising, Circulation, Communications, Editorial, Marketing, News and Purchasing departments; other business departments to the extent that Guild-covered positions are transferred to such other business departments; and to data processing employees of the Systems and Engineering Department; the maskers and scalers of the Production Department; the Centrex Operators, Printing Services and Mail Desk employees of the Administrative Services Department; and National Weekly and News Service employees.
(b)	The provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to employees deemed managers, supervisors, and confidential employees under the National Labor Relations Act; outside columnists whose material is syndicated by arrangement with The Post; outside circulation subscription solicitors; temporary employees as defined in the following paragraph; commission sales agents numbering no more than fifty percent of the number of Guild-covered advertising sales/outsid'e representatives (provided that, as a result of an increase in commission sales agents above the number of 22, the number of Guild-covered advertising sales/outside representatives does not fall below seventy except during temporary periods of vacancies); part-time employees who do not satisfy the continuity requirements set forth in Article VI, Section 10(b)clerical or telecommunications employees hired outside the United States for
J
2
employment in offices outside the United States; and other positions mutually agreed upon by the parties.
(c)	A temporary employee is defined as a person hired for an occasional or transient purpose,' or for a special project not to exceed twelve months in duration, which period may be extended by mutual agreement, or as a replacement for a regular full-time or regular part-time employee on a leave of absence granted under Article XIII, or on extended illness or disability provided such leave of absence does not exceed two years; The Post agrees it will continue to notify the Guild of the hiring of all temporary employees, after any such employee has been employed by The Post for a period of two months.
2.	The positions listed in Appendix A attached hereto are excluded from this Agreement. The Post shall notify the Guild of the creation of new, excluded positions, or the reclassification or alteration of current positions, The Post in its discretion judges should be excluded from the bargaining unit, based on its reasonable belief that the position is managerial, supervisory or confidential.
3.	It is understood and agreed that, consistent with other provisions of this Agreement, the Publisher- shall be the sole judge of which person, or persons, shall be- hired in any capacity for positions covered by this Agreement, including, specifically, those persons selected as News Interns.
ARTICLE II	- JURISDICTION
1.	It is mutually agreed that the jurisdiction and work assignment flexibility herein does not conflict with the basic components recognized by the parties in the Agreement of a Guild bargaining unit, and that work is to continue to be performed by Guild-covered employees in the Guild bargaining unit.
2.	The Publisher may assign or reassign work which has been previously assigned to Guild-covered employees either to such employees or to employees not covered by this Agreement, or to employees of any other employer. In addition, the Publisher may assign or reassign work to Guild-covered employees which has been previously assigned to employees not covered by this Agreement. However, such assignments shall be permitted only to the extent that they are not precluded by another collective bargaining agreement. It is the intent of the parties to construe this Agreement as fundamentally altering the nature of work assignments. Work assignments will be non-exclusive, allowing The Post to assign work previously performed by employees in other units to
7
3
Guild-covered employees, to the extent permitted by other collective bargaining agreements, as well as assigning Guild-covered work to nonGuild-covered employees on the same basis. The foregoing shall not affect the kinds of work presently or customarily performed by persons holding positions that are excluded from the bargaining unit under the
. provisions under Article I above.
3.	No employee covered by this Agreement shall be disciplined for the quality of his/her performance of work not normally or previously assigned to employees, in the bargaining unit. The Publisher agrees that no Guild unit employee shall be laid off as a direct result of such work assignments.
4.	It is understood that the Publisher shall have the sole right to determine the manner and means of operation and production, except as specifically limited by this Agreement.
5.	The Publisher will meet and confer with the Guild on changes in work assignments, jurisdiction, work processes, or technology. It is agreed that, if the parties are unable to resolve any dispute arising under this Article by discussion and mutual agreement, such dispute will not be arbitrable, except as specifically provided below:
(a)	The Publisher shall continue to have the right to assign or reassign work on a non-exclusive basis, which has in the past been assigned to data processing employees of the Systems and Engineering Department, or which has been assigned to advertising operations employees of the Advertising Department, or' which is of a similar nature to the work assigned to such employees in the past. Disputes concerning the foregoing assignments shall be grievable but not arbitrable.
(b)	Minor jurisdictional disputes, e.g., those involving infrequent or temporary work, shall be grievable but not arbitrable, without prejudice to the parties' rights to arbitrate non-jurisdictional disputes under other Articles of this Agreement.
(c)	The Publisher shall have the right to assign or reassign other work which has in the past been assigned to Guild unit employees to other Post employees based on the demonstrable operational needs of/the Publisher. It is understood and agreed that assigning work to Post employees not covered by this Agreement solely because they are lower-paid and/or have lower cost benefits than Guild-covered employees shall not constitute demonstrable operational needs unless such employees are covered by other collective bargaining agreements that permit such work assignments. However, if the Union believes that such assignment is not based on the demonstrable operational needs of the Publisher,
4
such dispute will be subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of Article XXII.
6.	With respect to the News and Editorial Departments, The Post may continue to engage outside writers on a non-staff basis, e.g., freelance, stringer, contract writer or photographer. The Post may continue to buy stories and photos from non-employees who have produced an exclusive, or an outstanding, stoiy or photo, and may continue to publish the products of syndicated writers or cartoonists or artists. The Publisher agrees that no employee shall be laid off as a direct result of such use of the contributions of outside writers, syndicated writers, photographers,' cartoonists or artists. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement for non-staff newspersons to consult on the premises with editors and others to discuss story ideas or work in progress, or to edit work submitted. In exceptional circumstances, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for non-staff newspersons to use Post equipment on or off Post premises for the purposes of creating, editing or entering materials into The Post computer system. It is understood and agreed that an individual newsperson’s staff or non-staff status shall be determined by the “right of control” test.
7.	With respect to the Advertising Department, The Post may accept any and -all copy from advertisers or advertising agencies in any form, including hard copy, facsimile copy, or computer generated copy ("remote entry" copy). Furthermore, the remote entiy of header information or billing information by non-Guild personnel shall not be a violation of this Agreement. The Publisher agrees that no Guild-unit employee shall be laid off as a direct result of such use of advertiser or advertising agency copy.
8.	With respect to any work processes in any Guild-covered departments, The Post may continue to use without restriction such data or information, produced within or outside of The Post, as it may deem appropriate in the Publisher’s sole discretion. The Publisher agrees that no Guild-unit employee shall be laid off as a direct result of such use.
ARTICLE III	- UNION ACCESS
1.	Access for Representational Purposes
The Washington Post will continue to permit access to The Post's offices for the staff representatives of the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, Local 32035, The Newspaper Guild-Communications Workers of America, for representational purposes only and subject to this Agreement. Access for Guild representatives will at all times be through The Post's 24-hour Main
5
Security Desk at 1150 15th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. This will not include organizing activities, signing-up members, distributing union literature (except through employees), union business meetings, steward training, or other institutional activities.
2.	Union elections:
The Guild agrees to hold all Guild elections at locations other than The Post's premises,
3.	Small Informal Meetings Among Unit Employees
Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to preclude small informal meetings among unit employees, without a union staff representative present, provided such meetings are held in a non-working area during the non-working time of the involved employees.
4.	Access for Union representatives to meet with Guild members in Post building:
Consistent with past practices, and with the understanding that the Guild will usually find it more convenient to meet at the Guild's offices or elsewhere outside The Post with Post stewards and employees, The Post will provide on-site meeting arrangements subject to availability only as described below:
(a)	Access for Membership Meetings.
It is understood and agreed that the Guild will not conduct membership or informational meetings for unit employees or any other group meetings with unit employees (except as provided in paragraphs 4(b) and 4(c) below) on The Post’s premises, with or without Guild staff present. However, in exceptional circumstances, the Guild may request permission for space to hold such employee meetings on The Post’s premises, which the Publisher may grant or withhold in his sole discretion.
(b)	Access for Committee Meetings.
(i)	Except as set forth in (ii) below, the Guild agrees that it has no right to conduct a committee meeting on Post premises, and cannot challenge The Post’s denial of meeting space for a Guild committee meeting.
(ii)	During the course of collective bargaining for a new contract, on days when joint sessions take place, The Post will permit
6
the Guild to use the joint meeting room for union caucuses and employee meetings related to the bargaining, subject to the joint meeting room’s availability.
(c)	Meetings with one to three employees.
(i)	When a Union representative wishes to meet with from one to three Guild members employed at The Post, the representative first must register in a log maintained by a security officer in The Post's lobby, and phone the Labor Relations office as a prerequisite to the proposed visit. Such notice may be given immediately prior to the proposed meeting, In addition to listing his or her name in the log, the Union representative shall enter the name of the person whom he or she intends to visit and The Post department to which that employee is assigned. The Union representative must comply with all Security Department procedures applicable to visitors to The Post; in an operational emergency that results in the exclusion of'visitors from Post facilities, the Guild representative will not be unreasonably denied access to The Post to conduct representational activities. The Union representative may meet either in the employee's department or in the Cafeteria, as long as no more than three employees and one Guild representative is involved. Consistent with past practice, e.g., including but not limited to, when a Guild representative is being replaced by a new Guild staff member, and with the understanding that normally only one Guild staff representative is involved in such meetings, this provision may apply to a visit by two Guild staff representatives.
(ii)	While the Union representative is. in the Department designated in the log (as described in the preceding paragraph), he or she may meet with one, two or three employees in the same department without giving notice of such additional meetings to the Labor Relations Department. Except with the permission of the employee's supervisor, the Guild representative shall meet during regularly scheduled breaks or lunch periods with any employee who does not have a flexible work schedule, e.g., most employees in the Circulation, Accounting and Classified Advertising Departments. With employees who do have flexible work schedules, e.g., most employees in News, the Guild representative shall meet with such employees without interfering with their work or departmental operations. This provision will not affect in any way the respective rights of
7
The Post and the Guild with regard to hours and scheduling of employees under the labor contract.
(iii)	If a Union representative also wishes to speak with an employee in a Department other than the one designated in the log book, he or she shall first notify the Labor Relations Department of the employee's name and Department to be visited next, as in paragraphs 4(c)(i) and (ii) above.
(iv)	As long as the procedures described in paragraphs 4(i) through (iii) are followed, management representatives will not generally question the Union representative(s) further, other than to ascertain that the visit is representational. For example, questions may not be posed about the subject matter of the visit, whether the meeting could be held in an alternate location, etc.
(v)	On rare or infrequent occasions, the Guild may request The Post to provide a meeting room for the Guild to meet with up to five or six employees who are not members of a committee. Such meetings will not be held in the employees' department(s) or the cafeteria. If the Guild gives The Post at least 48 hours' advance written notice, the Labor Relations Department 'will make a good faith effort to provide a meeting room other than the Labor Conference Room.
5.	Access Outside Normal Business Hours.
If a Guild representative seeks access to Post property, outside normal business hours (Monday to Friday, except holidays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.), he or she will make advance access arrangements through The Post's Labor Relations Department not later than 3 p.m. that same day if for an after-hours appointment that day, or not later than 3 p.m. on the last preceding regular business day if for a day other than a regular business day. However, in case of an emergency, The Post's 24-hour Main Security Desk at 1150 15th Street will grant access upon presentation to the Security Desk of a brief written explanation by the Guild representative which generally describes the basis for the after-hours request for access.	/
6.	Access for Distribution of Guild Bulletins.
A Guild staff representative may drop-off prepackaged bundles of Guild literature at either The Post’s Main Security Desk or The Post’s L Street Receiving Desk during normal business hours for pick-up by the Guild stewards to whom the pre-packaged bundles are addressed. The
8
bundles may also be delivered by the Guild representative to the Sth floor (either the elevator lobby sitting area or the newsroom telephone operators area) and to the 6th floor (the elevator lobby sitting area). Guild stewards and/or employee distributors shall place Guild literature only in non-working areas of Guild-covered departments and shall not distribute such literature in working areas at any time, except that the past practice of allowing Guild stewards and/or employee distributors, after picking up the pre-packaged bundles, to hand such literature to employees or place it on employees’ work stations in Guild-covered departments, or to place such literature in the departmental mailboxes (if any) of Guild-covered employees will be continued during the term of this Agreement so long as such distribution is conducted during the nonworking time of the steward or employee distributor and does not interfere with or disrupt employees during their working time. The parties will provide, each other with copies of bulletins and like materials, which will be delivered in the same manner as they are distributed to employees. The Guild agrees that this provision sets forth the exclusive manner of Guild distribution of literature on Post property, and further agrees that it will refrain from distributing its literature to Post employees through The Post’s internal mail distribution system or through e-mail or computer systems of The Post. This provision does not restrict the use of Post computer systems for incidental personal
“ communications.	"	-	__ ■
7.	Resolution of Disputes:
(a)	In the event that either The Post or the Guild (or any of the Guild’s officers, representatives, or agents) violates this Article, the Guild or The Post shall have the right to submit the dispute to arbitration under Article XXII.
(b)	The failure of either The Post or the Guild to enforce at any time any one or more of the terms and conditions of this Article shall not be deemed a waiver of such terms or conditions or of The Post's or the Guild's rights thereafter to enforce each and every term and condition of this Article.

9
ARTICLE IV	- UNION SECURITY
As used in this Article, the term ’’membership in the Guild" means tendering the periodic dues uniformly required by the Guild. During the period of thirty calendar days following the signing of this Agreement, employees shall be given a choice of resigning, or retaining, membership in the Guild. Those who choose to retain membership in the Guild by the close of that period shall be obligated to tender the periodic dues required by the Guild, as an obligation of employment, until the next such open period, or contract expiration, whichever occurs first. Employees hired after the effective date of the Agreement who choose to become members of the Guild shall similarly maintain membership in the Guild. There shall be a similar resignation period of thirty days on each annual anniversary of the signing of this Agreement. The provisions of this Article shall not be administered in a manner that is contrary to law.
ARTICLE V	- DUES CHECK-OFF
1.	Any employee in the bargaining unit, including covered part-time employees, may voluntarily file with The Post a written authorization and direction to deduct from his/her salary or other earnings, his/her current Guild dues, as certified to The Post by the Guild from time to time, and such authorization may be revoked by him/her at any time. The Post agrees to notify the Guild within seven days of the receipt of any such notice of revocation.
2.	The Guild will file with The Post not later than the last day of each calendar month, a schedule certified by its Treasurer showing the amount of current dues payable during the next succeeding month by employees in the various salary classifications.
3.	For the duration of this Agreement and the Union Security provision in Article IV, The Post will make deductions from the salaries or other earnings of employees in accordance with said authorizations and schedules filed hereunder by employees and the Guild, but it assumes no responsibility either to the employees or to the Guild in the event that, through inadvertence or error, it shall fail to do so in any instance. All sums so deducted shall be remitted by The Post as promptly as possible to the Guild. This provision does not preclude an agency fee payer from authorizing the payment of dues through payroll deductions. The Post agrees not to exercise its right to cease payroll deductions of dues pursuant to unrevoked dues check-off authorizations prior to termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article XXVI. The Guild agrees to indemnify The Post and hold The Post harmless in the event of any claims, charges or lawsuits made in connection with dues
10
collected consistent with the Guild’s request or in connection with dues-related information provided by the Guild to its members.
4.	Authorizations filed hereunder shall be in the following form:
”1 hereby authorize and direct The Washington Post to deduct from any salaiy or other earnings standing to my credit on its books in each payroll period following the date of this authorization the amount of current dues payable by me to the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild during such payroll period, according to the certified schedule filed by the Guild with The Post.
"I further authorize and direct The Washington Post to remit all sums so deducted to the Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild.
"This assignment and authorization shall remain in effect until revoked by me. I can revoke this authorization at any time. Such notice of revocation shall become effective for the calendar month following the calendar month in which you receive it.
"I agree to save The Washington Post harmless against any and all claims and liability for or on account of the deductions made from my salaiy or other earnings and remitted to the Washington-Baltimore “ Newspaper Guild pursuant to thishutfidrization."

Upon the Guild's request, The Post will negotiate with the Guild the appropriate classification and salary scale for the new or substantially new position for a period not to exceed the ten working days notice period (unless extended by mutual agreement), but the decision to assign a classification and salary . scale shall not be subject to arbitration.

24
employee, this section shall not apply. Schedules may be changed with less than two weeks notice with the consent of the employee affected.
5.	In computing overtime, a day on call, that is a day on which an employee is required to hold himself or herself available for a call to work, shall be considered a day worked.

Provided, however, where an employee is covered by the functional designations of work assignments specified above in this Section, or whose regular salary is at or in excess of the amounts set forth above, works more than five days during any week the employee shall be given for each such additional day worked a compensatory day
25
off within a period of eight weeks thereafter, or, at the option of The Post, paid straight-time for each such day of compensatory time off earned hereunder; provided, further, that a writer or photographer assigned to cover the training or playing trips of any professional or college teams engaged in major sports, a reporter assigned to do out-of-town survey stories, or a political writer assigned to following .speaking tours or doing a series of "political roundup" stories, whose regular salary is less than the appropriate amount in the above schedule, and who is required by his or her assignment to be away from Washington at any period during his or her normal days off which correspond to his or her normal hours of work, shall be allowed a compensatory day off for each such day within eight weeks thereafter, unless The Post elects to pay such an employee an additional day’s pay at the employee’s regular rate.
10.	Notwithstanding Sections 1 and 4 above, the Publisher, in his or her sole discretion, may schedule full-time employees to work flexible schedules of 37^ hours per week, divided into six, five, or fewer days, based on the Publisher’s operational needs and/or the employee’s request, provided that no employee will be required to work a flexible schedule consisting of six days in any one work week.

To the extent practical," before requiring full-time employees to work flexible schedules of less than five days' based on the Publisher’s operational needs, the Publisher will make reasonable efforts to fill such schedules with employees in the same classification who volunteer for such schedules.
11.	Should the Department of Labor issue new regulations exempting certain
employees covered by this Agreement from the hours and overtime requirements of the FLSA, or subjecting them to such requirements, immediately upon the issuance of such regulations by the Department of Labor, the parties shall meet for the purpose of bargaining on the impact of such regulations on employees working in such classifications under this Agreement, and to determine the extent to which such employees shall be covered by the provisions of Sections 1 through 7 above. This Agreement may in like manner be amended by mutual agreement of-the parties to comply with any Act of Congress or judicial decisions binding on the parties. Nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive either party’s rights under the National Labor Relations Act or to preclude either party or any employee covered by this Agreement from exercising their respective rights to seek judicial or administrative relief concerning such regulations, Act, or judicial decision, e.g. an action to clarify or challenge any of the foregoing.

3.	When an employee's days off have been changed during a week in. which a holiday occurs, resulting in such employee’s working five straight-time days in such week such employee shall receive an additional day off within a period of four weeks thereafter, or, at The Post's option, be paid for such additional day off at the rate of time and one-half;
4.	The Post has the right, in its discretion, to require employees to work on a holiday to meet reasonable operational needs. When an employee is required to work on a holiday, the employee shall receive additional compensation for such work at an hourly rate equal to one and seven--eighths times the employee’s regular straight-time hourly rate; provided, however, that no employee required to work any time on a holiday shall receive for such work an amount less than one and one-half times the employee's straight-time hourly rate of pay for the regular work day. An employee shall have the option of substituting a recognized holiday of the employee's choice for one of the holidays set forth in Section 1 above, provided, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor or department head, it is practicable to do so.

Such sick leave shall be accrued on an hourly basis, based on straight-time hours worked or paid up to a maximum of thirty-seven-and-one-half hours in a workweek, and such sick leave shall be used for bona fide illnesses, unless clearly arising from the employee’s own misconduct. For the purpose of this paragraph, absence during working hours due to emergency sickness, psychiatric, medical or dental care, shall be considered a bona fide illness where it is not possible for the employee to schedule such emergency care during non-working hours. Any such sick leave not exhausted by an employee during, the twelvemonth period to which it relates may, in case of bona fide illness not arising from his or her own misconduct, be accumulated to a maximum accumulation of one hundred thirty-five days. Additional sick leave may be granted at the discretion of The Post. No deductions from annual vacation shall be made on account of sick leave; an employee may not take sick leave during a vacation period, except as provided in Article XII, Section 7. Sick leave under this Section shall be construed to include sick leave due to the illness of a dependent child up to age 18 or a disabled child regardless of age. The Post may in any case require an employee to submit a certificate of a reputable physician, or may have him/her examined by a physician of its own selection, in order to determine whether such employee is entitled to sick leave hereunder.

2.	After twenty years of continuous Post employment, employees who have accumulated a sick leave balance of 100 days or more shall accumulate twelve sick leave days each year, three of which may be used as personal leave days. These personal leave days may be used for absences due to the illness of the employee or the employee’s dependent child up to age eighteen, or for a personal reason. In the event that an employee wishes to take two or more consecutive work days off for a personal reason, such days shall be scheduled in advance with the employee’s supervisor, who will not unreasonably refuse permission for the use of such accumulated personal leave. If an employee does not use all of his or her personal leave days in the one-year period during which they were accrued, the unused personal days shall convert automatically to sick leave days, which the employee may accumulate up to the one hundred thirty-five day maximum in Section 1. When an employee with twenty years of continuous Post employment drops below 100 days of accumulated sick leave,-the employee will automatically revert back to earning sick leave on the basis of fifteen sick days per year. Such an
13
32
employee who has any unused personal leave days to his or her credit will have those days converted to sick leave. Such employees will again be eligible to earn three personal days and nine sick leave days once they have accumulated 100 days.

The sum of (i) .08% of the participant’s Final Average Annual Earnings multiplied by his or her Credited Past Service, plus (ii) 1.75% of the participant’s Final Average Annual Earnings multiplied by his or her Credited Service after April 1, 1974 up to a total of 30 years (35 years for participants with 30 or more years of Credited Service as of August 2, 1989), less (iii) the appropriate Offset Allowance from the table below multiplied by the participant’s Final Average Compensation, up to the Covered Compensation limit for the year in which the participant retires, multiplied by his or her Credited Service after April 1, 1974 up to a total of 30 years (35 years for participants with 30 or more years of Credited Service as of August 2, 1989):
Birth Date	Offset Percentage
Before 1/1/1938	.62%
Between 1/1/1938 and 12/31/1954	.59%
After 12/31/1954	.56%
The amount in (iii) of the preceding sentence may not exceed .875% of the Participant's Average Annual Earnings which may not be more than the lesser of Final Average Compensation or Covered Compensation, multiplied by his Credited Service after April 1, 1974 up to a total of 30 years (35 years for Participants with 30 or more years of Credited Service as of August 2, 1989).
(b) An Employee who begins receiving benefits before his or her Normal Retirement Date shall have his or her accrued benefit adjusted by the appropriate Actuarial Equivalent Factor:
45
Participant’s Age at Benefit Commencement
Early Retirement Factor
64
63

55
96% 92%
88% 84% 80%
56
51
47
43
40
These factors will be prorated based on the Participant's age to the nearest month as of the date the Participant's benefits begin.
4.	Cash Pension Supplement:
(a)	Eligibility. Every employee who earns a benefit under The PostGuild Plan will also earn a cash pension supplement. In general, an employee becomes vested in the retirement benefit and cash pension supplement after completing five years of vesting service. _
(b)	Amount of Cash Pension Supplement. The amount of cash pension supplement is determined by the employee's years of service. Effective November 8, 2002, he/she earns $200 each full year of service. The maximum number of years of service that may count is 30. The following shows the size of the cash pension supplement that would accrue at various service levels.
Years of Service
Annual Cash Supplement

10
15

30
$1,000
2,000
3,000
4,000
5,000
6,000
In general, years of service are equal to years of participation in The Post-Guild Plan. Years of service prior to 1991 will count in determining the size of the cash pension supplement.
46
(c)	Payment of Benefits. The cash pension supplement shall be payable at the same time the employee begins to receive his/her regular pension benefits from The Post-Guild Plan. The cash pension supplement will be paid once per year each January. If the employee's retirement date is not a January 1, he/she will receive a pro rata amount for the first year at the time he/she receives the first monthly check. Future adjustments to the supplemental pension payments will be made at the discretion of the Publisher.
(d)	Form of Payment. If the employee receives pension benefits from The Post-Guild Plan in a form other than as a single life annuity, the cash pension supplement will also be payable in the same manner. For example, married retirees generally receive benefits in the form of a 50% Spouse's Benefit with reduced benefits payable for the retiree's lifetime in order that benefits will continue to the surviving spouse in an amount equal to 50% of the amount the retiree was receiving. In this case, the surviving spouse would also receive 50% of the retiree's annual cash pension supplement for life. If an employee retires early and elects to receive reduced benefit payments to start immediately, he/she shall also receive reduced payments from the cash pension supplement immediately.
5.	The Plan may be amended by The Post consistent with the terms of the plan and applicable law, without bargaining or arbitration with the Guild, provided that any such amendment will have no effect on the accrued or vested benefits or future benefit accruals of any Guild-covered employees. For administrative convenience and in accordance with applicable law, The Post may combine The Post-Guild Plan with The Post Company Plan, without bargaining or arbitration with the Guild, it being understood and agreed that such a merger of the plans will have no effect on the accrued or vested benefits or future benefit accruals of any Guild-covered employees. Before the Publisher makes any such changes, the Publisher will meet and confer with the Guild, at the Guild’s request, as to such changes.
47
ARTICLE XXI - HEALTH AND WELFARE
1.	Employees will continue to be eligible for coverage under The Washington Post Flexible Benefits Plan (the “Plan”), in accordance with its terms. Administration of the Plan, including selection of the administrator and any insurers, shall reside solely in The Post’s discretion and shall not be subject to arbitration or bargaining with the Guild during the term of this Agreement.
2.	During the term of this Agreement, full-time employees will pay the same percentage contribution toward the premium costs for this benefit coverage that is paid by exempt and managerial employees of The Post, as periodically adjusted by The Post in its discretion.
3.	(a) Part-time employees who average fifteen or more hours per week,
under the continuity procedure set forth in Section 3(c) below, shall be permitted to participate in the Washington Post Flexible Benefits Plan (the “Plan”) in accordance with its terms. Such employees who choose to participate shall pay the same percentage contribution toward the premium costs of this benefit coverage that is paid by part-time exempt and managerial employees of The Post, as periodically adjusted by The Post in its discretion. The ~ foregoing provisions to the contrary -notwithstanding, a part-time employee who, as of September 30 of any year, has been paid an average of 30 or more hours per week in the preceding 12-month period, shall be entitled to participate under the same terms as full-time employees in the medical, dental and prescription drug plans. His or her participation will begin the next following January 1 and will continue for each six months of the following year in which the employee works an average of at least 25 hours per week. Any such employee who loses eligibility for benefits because of failure to pay the requisite percentage of the premium cost shall not be eligible to participate again in the Plan until the beginning of the second six-month period following the six month period for which eligibility for benefits was lost.
(b)	Part-time employees who have been eligible and have chosen to participate in the Plan, and who cease to be eligible for the coverage under the terms defined in Section 3(a) above, may continue to be covered by the Plan, provided such employees shall pay 102% of the premium cost. The period for entitlement for coverage under this section shall be eighteen months, or the date on which the employee qualifies for coverage under Section 3(a) above, whichever occurs first; provided, however, an employee who. loses eligibility for benefits because of failure to pay the premium
48
cost shall not be eligible again for this coverage until the employee qualifies for coverage under Section 3(a) above.
(c)	The continuity procedure described in Section 3(a) above shall be as follows: every six months there shall be a review of the record of all hours worked by covered part-time employees for each of the twenty-six preceding weeks.
4.	(a) All Guild-covered employees shall be eligible to participate in the
health and hospitalization insurance program, the retiree health insurance program, the employee life insurance program, the dependent life insurance program, the long-term disability insurance program, the pre-tax dependent care program, preMedicare/early retiree health plan, catastrophic medical expense plan, the same-sex domestic partner benefit program, and adoption assistance program applicable to exempt and managerial employees of The Washington Post generally, in accordance with the terms of such programs as they may from time to time be modified by the Publisher. During the term of this Agreement, these plans are subject to change at the same time and in the same manner as for exempt and managerial employees, and such changes shall not be subject to arbitration or bargaining.
(b)	During the term of this Agreement, the'Publisher shall have the right to make plan design changes, changes in employees’ percentage contributions, and changes in the benefits offered under the Flexible Benefits Plan, including changes in coverage, deductibles and co-payments, at the same time and in the same manner as for exempt and managerial employees, and such changes shall not be subject to arbitration or bargaining. However, before any substantial change is made by the Publisher in the benefits or contributions described in this Article, The Post will meet and confer with the Guild as to such changes. In addition the parties may establish a joint committee to examine questions concerning health care benefits and insurance costs and to make recommendations to the Publisher.
(c)	Nothing in this Article precludes either party from seeking to renegotiate, during bargaining for a successor collective bargaining agreement, the terms and conditions of Guild-covered employees’ participation in the plans described in this Article to be effective under a successor agreement.
5.	The Publisher reserves the right to terminate the coverage of any employee who fails to contribute the employee’s portion of the premium as of the first day of the month following the month in which the
49
employee failed to make such contribution, provided the Publisher furnishes written notice to the employee beforehand to give the employee the opportunity to make up the payment due. If an employee is absent from work for a period of six months or more, then the Publisher shall not be required to make the Publisher’s percentage contribution on behalf of such employee after such six-month period, provided that The Post shall furnish written notice to the employee of discontinuance of paying its portion of the premium in sufficient time to enable the employee to arrange to pay the premium without loss in coverage. The Post shall honor any agreement between it and an employee for a longer period of coverage during the employee’s absence from work.
ARTICLE XXII - GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
1.	The Grievance Committee shall generally consist of three representatives of the Publisher who shall be selected by the Publisher, and three representatives of the Guild who shall be selected by the Guild. In addition to these representatives, each party shall have the right to have a reasonable number of other involved representatives or witnesses relevant to the dispute, including the grievant, attend the grievance ... meeting.	—	_
2.	Step One — Department Level: Whenever there is a disagreement involving an alleged violation of a specific provision of this Agreement, including a controversy over any form of discipline, the aggrieved party shall address the other party in writing (addressed to The Post’s Labor Relations Department or the Guild’s Administrative Officer or staff, as the case may be), within ten working days from the date that the grievant (The Post, the Guild or an employee, as the case may be) or its representatives knew or should have known of the event giving rise to the grievance, stating in full the grievance and the relevant provision(s) of the contract alleged to have been violated, and the nature of the relief sought. The Guild and The Post may discuss the grievance at the department level, but shall not be obligated to do so.
3.	Step Two — Grievance Committee: Within ten working days of the filing of a grievance in accordance with Section 2 above, the grieving party may refer the grievance to the Grievance Committee. When a controversy is referred to the Grievance Committee by the grieving party in writing, the Committee shall convene within twenty working days to hear both parties or their representatives. The responding party will provide a __ written answer to the grievance within ten working days from the date of the meeting, however, failure to meet this time period shall not be deemed a waiver under Section 5 of this Article.
50
4.	Step Three — Arbitration:
(a)	If no decision is reached at the Grievance Committee meeting, the grieving party may, within fifteen working days of the Committee's meeting, serve a written demand for arbitration (by a single arbitrator) on the other party. The grieving party's demand for arbitration shall be addressed to the other party in writing, citing the specific issues(s) and provision(s) of the Agreement to be arbitrated.
(b)	Upon receipt of a timely written demand for arbitration, The Post and the Guild will select an arbitrator. If the parties can not select an arbitrator .within ten working days by individual designation, an arbitrator will be selected within the next ten working days by alternately striking names from a standing panel of five arbitrators selected by the parties, with The Post and the Guild alternately striking the first name in each case. At the request of either party, an arbitrator not selected for a pending arbitration shall be removed from the panel, after which the parties shall meet within thirty days to select another arbitrator for the panel.
(c)	The arbitration hearing shall be conducted according to the Voluntary Labor Arbitration - Rules of the American Arbitration -Association; however, the AAA shall have no authority as to the conduct of the hearing or the arbitration unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding, it being understood and agreed, however, that neither party waives any legal rights it may have. The arbitrator shall have the authority to rule on either party's motions, including pre-hearing dispositive motions. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to amend or modify, add to or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement Matters left unrestricted by a specific provision in this Agreement, and matters left to the discretion of the Publisher throughout this Agreement, shall not be subject to arbitration.
(d)	If a discharged employee is reinstated, wages for time lost as a result of the discharge and accrued contract benefits shall be considered and decided by the arbitrator, but in no event shall such wages or benefits exceed those that the employee would have received but for his or her discharge, or accrued benefits exceed those set forth in this Agreement. Reprimands and disciplinary actions without loss of pay shall be subject to the grievance procedure but shall not be arbitrable.
51
(e)	Matters affecting relations between employees and The Post may be discussed by Guild and Post representatives, however such subjects shall not be subject to arbitration.
5.	The time periods set forth in this Section may be extended by mutual consent, but, unless such a period is extended in writing, failure to file or process a grievance, or failure to move a grievance to arbitration within such time period, shall constitute a waiver of the right to do so. The term "working days" as used in this Section does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays. If either party raises a question of arbitrability as to a grievance, such party shall be entitled to a separate, initial hearing before a separate arbitrator on arbitrability only, unless the parties agree otherwise, and a subsequent arbitration on the merits shall not be held unless the grievance is found arbitrable; provided, however, that neither party shall be deemed to have waived its right to have a court decide the issue of arbitrability instead of an arbitrator. All jointly incurred costs of arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties to this Agreement, except that neither party shall be responsible for the cancellation or postponement fees incurred by the other party’s late cancellation or postponement of an arbitration.
6.	During the term of this Agreement or any extension thereof, the grievance and arbitration procedures of the Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive means of settling any and all alleged violations of any specific provision of the Agreement, except as otherwise provided in the Agreement. While the parties favor arbitration of all disputes concerning this Agreement and the employees covered by this Agreement, this Section shall not be deemed to preclude either party or any employee from exercising their respective rights to seek judicial or administrative relief concerning equal employment opportunity, occupational safety and health, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the National Labor Relations Act or other laws governing employment relations or employment. Accordingly, the Publisher shall not engage in any lockout, nor shall either the Guild or any employees covered by this Agreement engage in any strike or sympathy strike (other than a by-line strike), work stoppage, slowdown, concerted refusal to work or other interference with or stoppage of work; however, Kto the extent provided by law. Guild-covered employees may continue to engage in legally protected, concerted activities, e.g. signing a petition or distributing leaflets.
7.	It is understood and agreed that the Publisher shall have the sole right to determine the manner and means of operation and production, except as specifically limited by this Agreement.
8.	The Publisher and the Guild agree that there are no mutually acknowledged past practices, other than interpretative ones that are not
52
inconsistent with or in conflict with any provision of this Agreement, which have any contractual or otherwise legally enforceable application between them. The Publisher may, in his or her discretion, establish, modify or rescind Post policies, standards of conduct and related procedures on topics such as sexual harassment, discrimination, electronic mail, and the like; provided that no employee covered by this Agreement shall be disciplined in connection with changes * in past practices, standards of conduct or procedures where the employee has not been given adequate notice of such changes.
9.	By agreement of The Post and the Guild, an arbitrator shall defer a hearing on the merits of an arbitration to permit the arbitrator to seek a resolution of the dispute presented for arbitration through alternative dispute resolution procedures agreed upon by the parties, e.g., mediation or fact-finding. In the event that the Guild files a demand for arbitration, in connection with which an .allegation of discrimination is made, then, at the request of either party, the arbitrator selected to hear the arbitration will conduct preliminary proceedings in an expeditious manner for the purpose of voluntary resolution of the dispute through mediation, the results of which will be non-binding, and the record of which shall not be admissible as evidence in any subsequent arbitration on the merits. In the event that the Guild or an employee elects to pursue a claim of discrimination in an administrative or judicial' forum, and such claim is also the subject of a grievance filed under this Agreement, then such grievance shall be held in abeyance pending completion of the administrative or judicial proceedings on such claim.
ARTICLE XXIII - VIDEO DISPLAY TERMINALS
1.	When Video Display Terminals were introduced in departments covered by this contract, and as new employees were hired, employees assigned to operate such terminals were trained in the functions germane to their position. The Post agrees that this policy will be continued, and such training shall be at the expense and on the time of The Post.
2.	The Post will continue to pay the reasonable cost of an annual opthalmological examination for employees who are regularly assigned to operate a VDT or similar device. If an eye examination discloses the need for corrective lenses to operate a Post VDT or similar device, The Post will reimburse the employee a designated amount for the cost of either corrective eyeglasses, including standard frames, or contact lenses, consistent with The Post’s policy on Reimbursement of Vision Care Costs for Computer Users.
53
3.	Although this article is titled "Video Display Terminals" The Post and the Guild agree that it is intended to cover similar equipment that is an evolution of equipment in current operation.
4.	The provisions of Section 2 above apply to employees who are regularly assigned to operate VDTs and similar devices, but they do not apply to employees who operate such devices only occasionally.
5.	The Post has provided employees with employee-adjustable furniture, workstations and computers, as well as appropriate workstation accessories such as telephone headsets, wristrests, footrests and task lights. The Post intends to continue to provide such items and to implement such rest breaks, training and other related measures as it may deem appropriate or as may be required by federal law.
ARTICLE XXIV - SAVINGS PLAN
1.	The Post expects to continue to maintain the "Tax Deferral and Savings Plan No. 2" for Guild-covered Employees.
2.	Administration of the Plan shall reside solely with The Post. In the event that future conditions, unanticipated and unforeseen, require termination of the Plan, The Post may do so, but not unless and until The Post terminates the existing Tax Deferral and Savings Plan for Exempt Employees or a successor plan to that one, and any other tax deferral and savings plan subsequently established or negotiated for any group of employees of The Post If the Plan is terminated, employees on the active payroll as of the date of termination shall receive an immediate weekly salary increase in the same, amount as the dollars previously diverted from the weekly scales effective with the payroll period next following the date of termination. The contract minimums, set forth in Article VI, shall be increased by the same amounts and on the same dates as described above, in the event of termination of the Plan. Employees not on the active payroll as of the date of termination by reason of being on leave of absence, sabbatical • leave, a phased retirement reduced work year, or like reasons, shall have their salaries increased, as set forth above, upon their return to the active payroll.
3.	Employee contributions under the Plan will be transferred to the Plan trustee on a biweekly basis.
4.	The Plan may be amended consistent with the terms of the plan and applicable law. During the term of this Agreement, the Publisher shall have the right to make plan design changes (e.g., loan options), changes

Re: Ratification Incentives
Dear Rick:
In an effort to settle a contract with the Guild without further delay, The Post is willing to make the following accommodations if the Comprehensive Tentative Agreement is ratified and signed no later than November 15, 2002:
1.	Ratification Bonus: In connection with the first-year lump sum payment set forth in Article VI, The Post offers to add 5% to the amount of the lump sum that each employee elects to put into his/her Tax Deferred Savings Plan account at The Post. This 5% contribution will only be applicable to amounts that the employee elects to put into his/her TDSP account; it will not be added to any portion of the lump sum that is taken as a cash payment.
2.	Night Differentials: The Post offers to increase the night differentials in Article VI(9) by 50% - from $4 and $5 per shift, respectively, to $6 and $7.50 per shift, respectively.
We hope that, with these ratification incentives, the contract can be ratified and signed no later than November 15,2002. However, if the Comprehensive Tentative Agreement is not ratified and signed by 5:00 p.m. on November 15, 2002, the accommodations set forth in this letter will be deemed automatically withdrawn, and this letter will be null and void.

Re: Vacation Conversion
Dear Rick:
This letter confirms our agreement as to the conversion to the new vacation arrangements provided in Article XII (5):
1.	On the conversion date (the first payroll period following 90 days after contract signing), we will review each Guild-covered employee’s vacation balance and, based on the employee’s leave accrual date, determine his/her current vacation accrual as of the conversion date. The current accrual will be placed in the employee’s current vacation accrual account, as described in Article XII (5)(a)- Any vacation credits in excess of the current accrual amount will be allocated as follows: First, excess vacation credits up to a maximum of one year’s worth of vacation will be put into the excess carryover account described in Article XII (5)(b); and second, only if an employee still has excess vacation credits remaining after the above allocation, such credits will be placed in the employee’s vacation deferral account described in Article XIP(5)(a). Employees who have (1) leave accrual dates within the first six months following conversion to the new vacation system, and (2) who have vacation credits in their deferred account as a result of this one-time allocation upon conversion, will not be subject to a forfeiture of their deferred balance until their next following leave accrual date.
2.	During the period provided in Article XII (5)(b) for use of excess carryover vacation credits, an employee’s combined vacation balances in all three accounts (i.e., the
cunent accrual account, the deferred account, and the excess carryover account) cannot exceed two years’ worth of vacation credits. Employees with this maximum vacation amount will not earn additional vacation credits until their total vacation balance drops below the maximum.
3.	Prior to the conversion date, The Post and the Guild will meet and confer over appropriate methods for communicating the new vacation system to employees, including the consequences for not timely using vacation credits in the deferred account.
Please sign below to confirm the Guild’s agreement to this conversion and transition arrangement
Sincerely,
Patricia A. Dunn
