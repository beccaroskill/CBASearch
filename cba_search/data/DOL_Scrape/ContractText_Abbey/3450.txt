1
0.0 GENERAL UNDERSTANDING
The parties agree that whenever the word “will” and/or “shall” is used in the Agreement, they are synonymous.
1.0	MUTUAL AGREEMENTS
1.1	MUTUAL RIGHTS & RESPONSIBILITIES
The Unions and Management agree that both have obligations and responsibilities to see that the statutory objective of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District law is attained and the public receives a rapid and efficient transit system. Management has the duty to execute the traditional responsibilities of Management to attain this goal and the Unions recognize the Management responsibilities. Management, in turn, recognizes its responsibility to treat employees fairly and equitably.
1.2	TERM OF AGREEMENT
The term of this Agreement shall be from and including the first day of July 2005 up to and including the 30th day of June 2009 or one hundred (100) days following receipt of notice of a desire to modify or terminate this Agreement, whichever occurs later. Each party shall comply with Section 1137.1, Par. B of Chapter 9, Part 3, of Division 2 of the California Labor Code, as amended. In the event either party serves notice upon the other party of a desire to modify or terminate the Agreement, the parties shall meet and make all reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the subject matters of such proposed modifications.
The parties shall respond to any requests for information reasonably necessary for intelligent negotiations and the standards and guidelines in accordance with 1137.1, Par. C, of Chapter 9, Part 3 of Division 2 of California Labor Code, as amended. Each party shall supply to the other party such reasonable data as are requested by the other party.
2
SEIU 2005-2009
To the fullest extent possible the parties shall endeavor to complete their negotiations at least seven (7) days prior to the date any lawful economic action may be taken in connection with any dispute concerning any proposed changes in any Collective Bargaining Agreement.
1.3	AGREEMENTS FURNISHED
The District will ensure that copies of this Agreement are printed within sixty (60) days of signing, will pay the full cost of printing such Agreements, and will ensure the Allied printing label appears. The Union will provide a list of Allied printing establishments in the Bay Area within three (3) days of signing.
The District will provide two hundred (200) copies of the Agreement to each of the signatory Unions for the term of this Agreement.
The District will provide a copy of the Agreement to all current employees within two (2) weeks of receipt of printed copies. New employees will be provided a copy of the Agreement upon employment.
The Agreement shall be provided on pocket size paper. Removable binders shall be replaced when worn out.
1.4	SUCCESSOR RIGHTS
In the event the operations of the District, in whole or in part, are assumed by any other entity, public or private, the successor organization or organizations shall agree, as a condition precedent of said assumption, to all terms and conditions of this Agreement as though said Agreement were more fully set forth in the assumption agreement by and between District and the assuming party or parties.
1.5	BENEFICIAL PRACTICES
SEIU 2005-2009
3
The District agrees that as a result of signing of this Agreement, rules or regulations or practices affecting employees beneficially will not be changed without mutual agreement.
1.6	NO STRIKES AND NO LOCKOUTS
A.	It is the intent of the District and the Unions to assure uninterrupted transit service to the public during the life of this Agreement. Accordingly,
1.	No employee or Unions signatory hereto shall engage in, cause or encourage any strike slowdown, picketing, concerted refusal to work, or other interruption of the District’s operations for the duration of this Agreement as a result of any labor dispute;
2.	The District shall not lockout any employee covered by this Agreement during its term as a result of any labor dispute;
3.	It shall not be a violation and shall not be cause for discipline for a District employee voluntarily to refuse to enter upon any property involved in a primary bona fide labor dispute. It shall not be a violation of this Section and shall not be cause for discipline of any employee by any party or other employee subject to this Agreement, should any employee voluntarily enter District property at a time when the District is involved in a primary labor dispute; provided, however, such employees shall not perform, nor be assigned, any work of any BART employee represented by the employee organization in such dispute.
For purposes of this Section, a primary labor dispute is defined as a dispute between BART and other BART employee organizations. (Reference R. E. Burns Arbitration Award of 7/2/74 for other specifics.)
4.	In any case where employee conduct occurs in violation of this Section, the Unions will promptly take
4
SEIU 2005-2009
all necessary action to bring about a termination of such conduct, and where so requested by the District, will give individual notification to the employees involved to cease such conduct.
B.	In the event of any alleged violation of Paragraph A of this Section, either the District or the Unions may seek immediate arbitration before one of the named arbitrators to be selected in accord with the arbitration procedures set forth in the appropriate Subunit supplemental provisions. The party seeking such arbitration shall use its best efforts to notify the other party of the referral to arbitration by means of telephone or written notice including telegraphic, delivered to the principal office of the party against whom the award is being sought. The question in such arbitration shall be whether either party or any employee covered by this Agreement has engaged or is engaging in activities in violation of this Section. The arbitrator shall have full equitable power to resolve the dispute, including the power to immediately issue an order to terminate the activities in violation of this Section. Such award shall be binding on both parties and employees. The expenses of the arbitration shall be borne by the party against whom the award is entered. Unless the parties agree that the arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction to decide the underlying dispute at the same hearing, he/she shall refer the dispute leading to or determined to be the cause of the alleged violation of Paragraph A of Section 1.6 to the appropriate grievance and arbitration procedure provided under this Agreement. If either party raises an issue of arbitrability of the dispute allegedly causing the violation of Paragraph A of Section 1.6, said preliminary issue of arbitrability shall be decided by the same arbitrator selected to hear the underlying dispute on the merits.
1.7	WAGE GUIDELINES
Both parties recognize this Agreement is the result of negotiations between the parties for represented employees and, in the event any wage increase or other benefit or condition provided in this Agreement results in any challenge
SEIU 2005-2009
5
or determination by any governmental agency, the parties agree to use their best efforts in a joint appeal to such governmental agency to uphold the validity and propriety of such provision.
Pending exhaustion of such appeal, the challenged provision shall be suspended except that, the parties may commence negotiations within thirty (30) days of such challenge to ensure that the superseded portion(s) shall be rewritten to conform legally as nearly as possible to the original intent.
In the alternative, the parties may negotiate an alternate provision not exceeding the cost of the provision challenged.
Should the parties fail to agree, the grievance procedure may be invoked in its entirety by either party.
1.8	CONTRACTING WORK *
It is in the intent of the parties that work connected with the operation and maintenance of the system be performed by the bargaining unit employees, consistent with the basic Bay Area Rapid Transit District operations and maintenance philosophy.
Should it become necessary to deviate from this practice, the Unions shall be informed of the reason work is being contracted. The District shall fax a Contract Notification Form to the President of the ATU, or the BART Chapter President, the President of the Professional Chapter, and the Chair of the SEIU Contracting Out Committee, whichever union is directly affected, prior to submitting the Contract Notification Form to the Procurement Department. The Contract Notification Form will identify the date it is faxed. The union shall have seven (7) workdays after the Contract Notification Form is faxed to provide any comments to the department manager. If comments are received within the seven (7) workday period, the Department Manager will consider the comments before making his or her final decision to contract.
It is agreed that prior to contracting work, the District will give consideration to whether adequate numbers of qualified
6
SEIU 2005-2009
employees are available to perform the necessary work within time limits available, whether sufficient and suitable equipment is available within the District to perform the work, whether shop capacity is adequate, whether the use of District employees shall involve extra cost to the District, or whether the performance of the work presents added hazards to existing employees which are not present in their normal assignments. Temporary work load, over and above normal positions, including overtime, may be contracted out. Suppliers’ personnel performing work related to their equipment and clearly not bargaining unit work will not be prohibited.
Contracts in effect at the time of this Agreement will not be voided by terms of this Agreement.
* Minute Clarification
District procedures regarding contracting out work which include prior notice to the Unions at the commencement of the contracting process shall continue during the term of this Agreement.
2.0	UNION SECURITY
2.1	UNION RECOGNITION *
Pursuant to an election conducted April 18, 1973, by the State Conciliation Service, the District recognizes United Public Employees Local 790 of the Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for employees in the Clerical and Maintenance Subunits and Local 1555 of the Amalgamated Transit Union International, AFL-CIO, as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for employees in the Transportation Subunit, as described in the Decision of the Director of the California Department of Industrial Relations, dated March 6, 1973, In the Matter of Bargaining Units of the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District, as amended.
The District recognizes Local 1555 of the Amalgamated Transit Union International, AFL-CIO, as the sole and
SEIU 2005-2009
7
exclusive bargaining agent for Emergency Procedures Assistants (EPA) employees in the Transportation Subunit, as described in the decision of the Director of California Department of Industrial Relations, dated July 11, 1980.
* Minute Clarification
The parties agree that the inclusion of the language recognizing Amalgamated Transit Union - Local 1555 as representative for the EPAs in Section 2.1 of the Agreement does not alter the agreement between the District and ATU 1555 that the only terms and conditions governing EPAs will be those set forth in the Article of the Collective Bargaining Agreement specifying such terms and conditions.
2.2	UNION MEMBERSHIP
Employees within the scope of this Agreement shall become members of the Union and remain members in good standing as a condition precedent to continued employment with the District.
Present employees who are members shall be required to continue their membership in the appropriate Union. All other employees shall be required to become members of the applicable Union to their Subunit within thirty-one (31) days of the signing of this Agreement or thirty-one (31) calendar days following employment, whichever occurs later, except those employees in classifications or positions subsequently excluded from the bargaining unit by mutual agreement. In the event of such an agreement, exclusions shall be set forth by Side Letter.
All employees covered by this Agreement, within thirty-one (31) days of the execution of this Agreement, or for new hires, within thirty-one (31) days following the date of employment, shall execute a payroll deduction authorization. The timely execution of such authorization shall be a condition precedent to continued employment with the District.
8
SEIU 2005-2009
2.3	UNION ACCESS TO WORK LOCATIONS
Non-employee business agents and employee Union officials will be permitted access to District facilities for the purpose of conducting Union business. Where reasonable and practical, they will provide notification in advance to the area supervisors as to the general purpose of said visit, the anticipated time involved, and employees to be contacted. District will provide an area for meeting purposes. Such agents or officials will be permitted entry upon presentation of acceptable identification to the supervisor in charge of the shop, whenever possible, and will be required to observe all safety and other rules and regulations of the District.
* Minute Clarification
The understanding of the parties regarding changes in Section 2.3, Union Access to Work Locations, is that outside Union officials who have contacted a shop to advise of a visit shall, upon arrival at the shop, contact the person in charge of the shop and advise of their arrival. They will then decide where the meeting is to be held, as appropriate.
2.4	DUES DEDUCTION
The District agrees to make payroll deductions as hereafter indicated from the pay of employees covered by the Agreement. Such deductions shall commence upon submission of a written authorization satisfactory to the District by the employee as forwarded by the Union. Deductions shall include monthly membership dues, assessments, insurance premiums, initiation fees, and contributions and shall be forwarded monthly to the appropriate Union. Dues and assessments shall be uniformly applicable to all employees in the same job classification or pay level in the applicable subunit.
No fines or penalty imposed on an individual by the Union shall be collected by means of payroll deduction under this Section. The Unions agree to furnish the District with written notice of changes in amounts to be deducted by the tenth of the month in which such changes are to be effected.
SEIU 2005-2009
9
The Unions shall hold the District harmless from any and all claims, and will indemnify it against any unusual costs in implementing these provisions.
2.5	BULLETIN BOARDS
Clear covered bulletin boards with locks and keys will continue to be provided in Maintenance, Transportation and office facilities for the sole use of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 and Service Employees International Union Local 790 notices of meetings or other business pertaining to the Unions. Any additional number of boards and their locations shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties.
The Unions agree that Employee Relations shall be furnished a copy of any material being displayed on any bulletin board at the time of posting. Said material shall be authenticated by the signature of the designated representative of the Union. Such Union bulletin boards shall be maintained by the Unions.
If a copy of posted material is not provided to the District within twenty-four (24) hours, it shall be removed from all bulletin boards.
2.6	VENDING MACHINES *
ATU Local 1555 and SEIU Local 790 are authorized to establish vending machines in the District employees’ work areas, and the District shall approve any reasonable plan with respect to such machines.
The Unions shall have the responsibility of contracting for the installation of such machines, along with maintenance.
Proceeds shall be deposited in a special fund under the direction and control of a representative of ATU Local 1555 and SEIU Local 790, and shall be divided on a basis established by the Unions, allocated for the exclusive benefit
10
SEIU 2005-2009
of the employee’s welfare and recreation as determined by the Unions.
The Unions will hold the District harmless from any expense or claim relating to the establishment and maintenance or distribution of such vending machines. The Unions shall indemnify the District in any contract entered into by Unions for the vending machines.
* Minute Clarification
A.	The parties have reached the following agreements with respect to vending machines in the Regional Administration Facility (RAF):
ATU Local 1555 and SEIU Local 790 are authorized to establish vending machines in the portions of the RAF Building exclusively owned and controlled by the District (District’s “condominium unit”) except for the cafeteria. The District shall approve any reasonable plan with respect to vending machines in the District’s unit other than the cafeteria.
The Unions may also establish vending machines in portions of the RAF Building which are not exclusively owned and controlled by the District if the other owners/occupiers do not object.
The District shall have complete discretion over the administration and operation of the cafeteria, including design and placement of equipment, selection of vendors, and installation of vending machines, if any. Any proceeds from the operation of the cafeteria, including vending machines located therein, shall accrue to the District.
B.	The deletion from this section the language “and shall be in accordance with the current practice for vending machines in passenger stations” in the 1985-88 Agreement, is only to reflect the current practice of not maintaining or using vending machines in stations.
SEIU 2005-2009
11
3.0 EMPLOYEE AFFAIRS
3.1	INVESTIGATION OF EMPLOYEES
Employees shall cooperate fully in any investigation of misconduct, operational difficulties, etc. made by Management, subject to the provisions of the grievance/discipline procedure. Failure on the part of employees to cooperate during such investigation may result in disciplinary action. The District shall not initiate any investigations of its employees without reasonable cause.
The District reserves the right to conduct District-wide investigations. The District shall seek the prior cooperation and assistance of the Union and the Union shall, in such cases, cooperate fully and take whatever action necessary to bring about a cessation of the activity that gave rise to the investigation.
District lockers may be periodically inspected as determined by Management, but such routine locker checks will not be initiated without prior notification to a Union representative to include an offer to be present during such inspection. Inspections deemed necessary as part of an investigation to determine a violation of criminal law shall not be subject to restriction.
The District shall not utilize or involve Police Services in the investigation of any incidents initially involving industrial relations, including accidents of an industrial nature. However, after an initial investigation of an incident involving industrial relations or such accidents, Police Services may be utilized if and when a violation of criminal law is indicated.
3.2	ACCESS TO PERSONNEL FILE
Each employee shall be provided a copy of all matters placed in their official personnel file. Upon written request of the employee, matters as referenced in the Supplemental Provision shall be removed from the file.
12
SEIU 2005-2009
An employee shall be permitted at any time during regular office hours to inspect his/her personnel file. He/she may also authorize in writing the Union Representative to also inspect his/her personnel file. Such reviews shall be made in the Employee Relations Department subject to the presence of a member of the Employee Relations staff or its designee.
Suspended or terminated employees (and their Union Representative), pending final disposition of the case, shall have similar access rights.
Material in personnel files shall be regarded as confidential and disclosed only in accordance with provisions of law.
* Minute Clarification
The parties agree that this first paragraph of this Section is intended to conform to the practice of maintaining the confidentiality of the employees’ personnel files and that the employees shall receive copies of all matters placed in their file with the exception of personnel transaction forms, medical reports and reference checks.
The District agrees that personnel transaction forms will not be accessible to supervisory personnel who review qualifications of employees for promotional consideration.
3.3	PERSONAL APPEARANCE
Employees will maintain an appropriate appearance.
3.4	CREDIT UNION
The District will continue to participate in The Golden One Credit Union, Provident Central Credit Union, and Metro 1 Credit Union. Employees may select only one of the three (3) Credit Unions for utilization of payroll deduction. The District will make brochures and application forms available to employees upon request.
SEIU 2005-2009
13
3.5	EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The District’s Educational Assistance Program will be continued during the life of this Agreement. Employees who wish to enroll in job-related and promotion oriented courses which will improve their job knowledge and performance will be compensated by the District for expenses as follows:
A.	When an employee is in the process of acquiring a sixty (60) semester unit or a ninety (90) quarter unit degree (e.g., Associate of Arts, Certificate of Achievement), or when an employee is properly authorized to enroll in a correspondence course and/or a specific course of study that may not result in a degree, said employee shall be reimbursed up to a maximum of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per fiscal year.
B.	When an employee exceeds sixty (60) semester units or ninety (90) quarter units and is enrolled in upper division course work, said employee shall be reimbursed up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per fiscal year.

discretion of the Department Manager of Training and Development.
Except for unusual circumstances, employees will not be granted time off from their regular work schedule to attend courses taken under this Section.
Approval for said courses must be granted by the department head prior to enrollment. Reimbursement shall be made upon presentation of proper receipts and upon completion of the course with at least a grade “C” or its equivalent.
At the employee’s option, an advance may be secured from the District against tuition costs by agreeing to payroll deduction of the amount of the advance if:
1.	satisfactory evidence of completion of the course taken is not provided to the District within thirty (30) days following completion of the course; or
2.	the course is not completed with at least a grade “C” or its equivalent; or
3.	the course is failed; or
4.	the employee voluntarily drops the course for any reason, including voluntary shift change or termination of employment with the District.
If the employee’s course is not completed due to a District required shift change or reduction in force, repayment of the advance will not be required.
D.	The District will periodically provide the Union with a report of Union members who have applied for District course compensation, the course subject and status of the course application.

4.1	VACATION
The District will grant three (3) weeks of vacation following one (1) year of service, four (4) weeks of vacation after eight (8) years of service, five (5) weeks vacation after fifteen (15) years of service and six (6) weeks vacation after twenty (20) years of service. Employees may carry over up to sixty (60) days (up to forty-eight [48] days for employees on a 4-10 Plan) of vacation. Employees with four (4) or more weeks of accumulated vacation will be allowed to buy back up to forty (40) hours of such vacation. The election of such buy-back shall be made in December with determination of the four (4) week eligibility threshold to be made in December the following year with payment made in the second February following the election.

This shall take effect when BAP Phase I goes live.
Employees will select their vacation in accordance with the applicable seniority provisions consistent with the scheduling ability of their department, division or section.
SEIU 2005-2009
17
In the event an employee terminates or retires, he/she shall be granted pro rata vacation compensation based upon his/her accrued credits.
Vacation allocation will be scheduled throughout the calendar year; however, to the maximum extent possible, consideration consistent with operating requirements will be given to allow employees to take their vacation during the summer months.
Should a contractual holiday fall within the employee’s vacation period, compensation will be applied consistent with holiday provisions of this Agreement.
Years of service shall be based upon the employee’s date of employment by the Bay Area Rapid Transit District or in the case of 13(c) employees, in accordance with the 13(c) Award.
Vacation accrual will not be continued beyond thirty-one (31) days in the event an employee is in a non-pay status.
4.2	BEREAVEMENT *
When a death occurs or appears imminent in the immediate family of an employee, the employee shall be granted up to a total of five (5) days for death of the employee’s current spouse or eligible domestic partner per Board Resolutions 4455 and 4757, or other members of the employee’s immediate family if the employee is on a five (5) day per week work week schedule or a nine-eighty (9/80) work schedule, four (4) days if the employee is on a four (4) day per week work week schedule. Such leave shall not be deducted from any other leave accrual. To be eligible for compensation for bereavement pay, the employee, upon his/her return, must provide written verification by the attending physician of death or imminence and indication of relationship of the member of the immediate family involved. False information given concerning the death, imminence, or relationship shall be cause for discharge. The immediate family of an employee is defined as spouse or an employee’s eligible domestic partner, child, eligible
18
SEIU 2005-2009
dependent child of an employee’s domestic partner, parent, brother, sister, grandparent; and current, mother-in-law, father-in-law, step-parent, step-child and legal guardian.
Only one (1) bereavement leave within a twelve (12) month period shall be granted an employee for each member of the immediate family.
* Minute Clarification
In agreeing to continue existing language in this Section, the parties understand that alternate forms of leave, e.g., vacation, floating holidays, leaves of absence without pay, are available to employees who may wish to extend the bereavement period and such reasonable request for said extensions have been granted in the past and shall continue to be considered and granted in the same manner.
4.3	MILITARY LEAVE
Employees of the District who are ordered to active duty with the Armed Forces for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, including travel time, will be granted a temporary military leave of absence for time required to meet military obligations as established by State and Federal law. Employees must furnish the District with a copy of the orders as early as possible prior to such leave.
During such military leave, employees with one (1) year of District service will be eligible for their existing straight time rate of pay for the first thirty (30) calendar days of any such absence during a fiscal year (July 1 - June 30).
For purposes of this Section, weekend military training sessions shall not be considered as Military Leave; however, employees who have military training sessions on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), and whose assigned work week includes Saturday or Sunday, or both, may request adjustment of their scheduled rest day or days off where work is available which they are qualified to perform in order to attend such sessions without loss of pay. Employees must request such arrangements in writing as far in advance as
SEIU 2005-2009
19
possible and provide verification of attendance upon return to work. No additional compensation, shift premiums, or other extra costs to the District shall result from such adjustments.
4.4	MATERNITY LEAVE
Maternity Leave of absence will be granted each employee covered by this Agreement who becomes pregnant. Such leave will begin no later than the date the employee’s doctor states in writing she should discontinue working.
Maternity Leave will continue until the date on which the employee’s doctor states in writing she is capable of returning to work, or until such time as an additional leave of absence granted by the District expires.
Should there be a determination that there is a pregnancy-related disability, employees may utilize unused sick leave and, to the extent possible, the Disability Insurance provided by the District.
4.5	LEAVE OF ABSENCE *
Employees may occasionally be required to request time off without pay. When such time off becomes necessary, it must be requested through the employee’s immediate supervisor.
A leave of absence, for the purposes of this Section, is defined as an absence from work requested in writing by a District employee and approved in writing by the employee’s Department Head and by the Department Manager of the Employee Relations Department. Such leaves must specify an agreed-upon period of time normally longer than two (2) days but not to exceed six (6) calendar months.
Leaves of absence generally fall into the following categories:
20
SEIU 2005-2009
A.	Emergency Leave: To assist an employee in taking care of crisis circumstances or conditions which cannot normally be handled while working full time.
B.	Vocational/Educational Leave: To assist an employee in preparation for possible upward mobility in the District. (The District makes no representation that leave for such purpose will result in promotions or transfers.)
C.	Leave for Personal Matters: To allow employees time off to attend to such matters which are not urgent and are purely personal in nature, but which are of such character as to require a short absence from work.
D.	Voluntary Service Leave: To allow employees time off who are volunteer members of a federal, state, or local certified fire department, police department, or American Red Cross.
The District will determine the length of time it will grant for such leave in each individual case.
The District reserves the right to extend a given leave if it deems it desirable to do so.
During the period of time in which an employee is on leave of absence, he/she shall accumulate service with the District.
Any employee who fails to return to work upon conclusion of the agreed-upon leave of absence shall be considered to have voluntarily terminated his/her employment with the District, subject to the terms of section 22.4 of the SEIU agreement or 39.7 of the ATU agreement for non-probationary employees.
Employees on leave of absence shall have the option to pay any costs involved into and continue to participate in Health & Welfare programs and life insurance.
* Minute Clarification
The parties agree that requests for leaves of two (2) days or less shall continue to be made through the employee’s
SEIU 2005-2009
21
immediate or appropriate supervisor without the involvement of the Employee Relations Department.
The District further agrees to continue its practice of notifying the Union on approved leaves of absence in excess of thirty (30) days. The District also agrees that in the event it considers a request for extension of a leave of absence beyond a six (6) month period, it shall advise the Union prior to approving such leave.
However, the District is not precluded from approving such extended leave in the event the Union objects.
4.6 JURY DUTY *
Pursuant to State law, an employee shall be excused from work on a workday on which he/she performs jury service, providing he/she gives prior notification to his/her supervisor. During such excused absence, an employee shall be paid up to an amount of the difference between jury fees and his/her existing shift earnings, exclusive of reimbursable travel expenses.
No such payment will be made to an employee excused for jury service unless a statement is provided to the District showing the amount of fees paid or payable and the time spent in jury service.
When an employee has served five (5) consecutive days on jury duty under the 5-8 work week plan or four (4) consecutive days under the 4-10 work week plan and that service conflicts with one or more of the employee’s RDOS, the employee has the option to reschedule their RDOs with his/her supervisor without additional cost to the District.
* Minute Clarification
The parties agree exercise of this option shall be within the work week in which the Jury Duty occurs. If the court recesses for the day without discharging the employee from jury duty or discharges the employee from jury duty, the
22
SEIU 2005-2009
employee may use a floating holiday or accumulated vacation for the next scheduled shift.
Also, if the employee’s active jury duty encompasses a portion of his or her normally scheduled (i.e. non-jury duty) days off, he or she shall receive the following Saturday and/or Sunday as a day(s) off. If the employee performs active jury duty on the first normally scheduled RDO, Saturday shall be a substitute RDO. If the employee performs active jury duty on his or her second normally scheduled RDO (or third in the case of four-ten employees) Sunday shall be a substitute RDO.
The employee shall notify his or her supervisor of his or her election to work or use holiday or vacation time as provided above in accordance with his or her department’s normal departmental reporting procedures.
*Minute Clarification
The split RDO’s will be used in the case of jury duty only on a non-precedent setting basis.
4.7 WITNESS DUTY
An employee shall be excused from work on a work day on which he/she is subpoenaed as a witness in court, before a Grand Jury or for a deposition, providing he/she gives prior notification to his/her supervisor. During such excused absence, an employee shall be paid up to an amount of the difference between the witness fees and his/her existing shift earnings, exclusive of reimbursable travel expenses.
If an employee is subpoenaed as witness in court, before a Grand Jury or for a deposition on his/her regular day off on a matter related to his/her employment with the District, the employee shall be paid up to an amount of the difference between the witness fees and his/her applicable rate exclusive of reimbursable travel expenses. In such cases, the employee must provide to his/her supervisor a copy of the subpoena and a statement of the witness fees paid or payable as a condition of being paid.
SEIU 2005-2009
23
The pay provisions of this Section shall not apply when an employee is required to appear in Court or at a deposition in any matter in which he/she is the plaintiff or as a result of any activities related to other employment.
5.0	INSURANCE BENEFITS
5.1	GROUP INSURANCE & DISTRICT SELF-FUNDED PLANS-GENERAL *
The terms, conditions and provisions of all current group insurance policies issued by insurance companies to the District, or hereafter negotiated between the parties, and of all self-funded employee benefits plans, exclusive of the Money Purchase Pension Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan, under which individual employees are to receive benefits, are incorporated by reference herein and shall be controlling in all matters pertaining to benefits hereunder.
The District agrees that it will not change, or seek to change, the benefits under the group insurance policies, or under the self-funded benefit plans or fail to provide reasonable and customary claims services under which individual employees are to receive benefits, without mutual agreement of the parties to this Agreement.
The District agrees that it will promptly notify the Unions of any proposed changes to group insurance policies or self-funded benefit plans which may be mandated by law or required by insurers, or proposed by the District.
Married employees and employees in an eligible domestic partnership who both work for the District shall receive full coverage under group insurance policies and self-funded benefit plans. They shall each receive their allotted employee and dependent coverage. In no event will these employees or their dependents be entitled to such combined coverage in excess of their actual expenses.
24
SEIU 2005-2009
Employees who are on non-job-related disability for two (2) continuous years or longer shall not be eligible for District-paid medical benefit plans while on such leave.

B.	The unmarried, a) natural born child, b) legally adopted child, c) step child, or d) child of the employee or the employee’s domestic partner for whom the covered employee or employee’s domestic partner became the legal guardian before age 19, who is under age 19 and dependent on the covered employee for their principal support and maintenance. This also includes any such child as listed above who is under age 23 (or under age 24 in accordance with the individual health plan) provided they are attending school on a continuous, full-time basis (12 units or more), at an accredited academic or vocational institution.
This also includes any such child as listed above who is incapable of sustaining employment by reason of mental retardation or physical handicap, if such was incurred prior to age 19 (or prior to age 23, or prior to age 24 in accordance with the individual health plan, if the child was attending school as a full-time student as defined above), provided the child resides in the covered employee’s household or a custodial facility.
C.	Any unmarried child (including the eligible child of an employee’s domestic partner) under age 19 (or prior to age 23, or prior to age 24 in accordance with the individual health plan, if attending school as a full-time student as previously defined) for whom the covered employee is mandated by court decree to provide health benefits.
Proof of dependency and/or incapacity must be furnished annually during the period specified by BART.
SEIU 2005-2009
25
*	Minute Clarification
The parties agree that for the purposes of the above section, an employee’s return to work would constitute a termination of the two-year disability termination of benefits as defined below:
Two or more periods of disability due to the same or a related injury or sickness shall be considered one period of disability unless separated by the person’s return to the fulltime duties of his regular occupation for a continuous period of at least ninety (90) days.
The District will notify the employee after twenty-one (21) months of continuous disability of the pending termination of benefits.
*	Minute Clarification
The parties agree that the second paragraph of this Section means that the District will not make changes to current group insurance polices which adversely affects the level of benefits without agreement of the parties.
This Section shall not apply to benefits which are provided pursuant to Section 5.2, PERS-Medical & Prescription Drug Benefits, and Section 5.8, Survivor Benefits. Section 5.2, PERS-Medical & Prescription Drug Benefits and the PERS rules, regulations and plan documents shall control on all issues concerning medical and prescription drug benefits.
*	Minute Clarification
Living Trust - An employee who is diagnosed as terminally ill and is on disability shall have the option to collect his/her life insurance benefits subject to the terms, conditions and provisions of the Principal Financial Group’s “Accelerated Benefits” plan.
5.2 PERS-MEDICAL & PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS *
26
SEIU 2005-2009
A.	PERS Medical and Prescription Drug Benefits
The District will provide group medical and prescription drug benefits, as provided below, through the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS). The PERS rules, regulations and plan documents will control on all issues concerning benefits, including the types and levels of benefits offered and eligibility for those benefits.
The Unions acknowledge that they understand these benefits may not equate to benefits previously available to employees and retirees through the various optional medical plans and the prescription drug plan. Because coverage will be provided through PERS, the District and the Unions understand that PERS may terminate or change covered expenses, benefit payments and co-payments on covered benefits, deductibles, lifetime and/or annual maximums and may implement various cost control features.
Except for Survivors Benefits, as provided for in Section 5.8, the Unions waive the right to any group medical or prescription drug benefit granted expressly or impliedly under other sections of this Agreement, or by any other agreement between the parties or by any District guideline, policy or practice if that benefit is not offered through the PERS medical plan.
B.	Employer Contributions for Health Insurance.
The District’s monthly contribution on behalf of each eligible employee or retiree toward medical insurance premiums shall equal the amount of the monthly premium charged at the applicable level of plan participation (i.e. one party, two party, or family) for the plans provided through PERS, less the employee and retiree contribution toward that premium (currently twenty-five dollars [$25.00] per month).
C.	Employee and Retiree Contributions for Health Insurance.
All employees eligible for PERS medical benefits who enroll for such benefits shall be responsible for a premium
SEIU 2005-2009
27
contribution in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per month, except as provided below.
1.	The employee’s twenty-five dollar ($25.00) monthly employee contribution toward the medical insurance premium shall increase by fifty dollars ($50) on January 1, 2006. Each January 1 thereafter, the monthly employee contribution shall increase by an escalator amount of three percent (3%). For example, the total monthly employee contribution on January 1, 2007 will be seventy-seven dollars and twenty-five cents per month. (The calculation that arrives at this number is as follows: $25 + $50 = $75 x 1.03 = $77.25.) The employee contribution amounts provided by this subsection shall be the maximum employee premium contribution through June 30, 2034. The following table illustrates:
Maximum Employee

2.	Further, effective July 1, 2013 and continuing through June 30, 2034 the District shall again retain part or all of the one and six hundred twenty-seven one-thousandths percent (1.627%) Money Purchase Plan contribution that reverts to employees July 1, 2011 pursuant to section 6.1 of this agreement. The terms of subsection D. 5 below shall govern the retention of this amount.
3.	Each eligible retiree shall pay the same premium contribution as active employees. Employees’ premium contributions will be paid for through taxexempt payroll deductions. Retiree premium contributions will be deducted from the retirement allowance paid by PERS. If a retiree’s retirement allowance is not sufficient to pay the entire contribution, the retiree must pay the balance due on such premium contribution directly to PERS. If such payment is not received by the due date, health care coverage will automatically, immediately and permanently cease. These rules are intended to comply with the premium contribution procedures established by PERS, which may be modified by PERS. The District, Unions and employees shall comply with the PERS procedures in effect from time to time.
D. Retiree Insurance Funding.
1.	Beginning July 1, 2007, the District shall contribute into its Retiree Health Benefit Trust (“RHBT”) amounts that, at minimum, reflect an eight (8) year “ramp up” to District payment of the full Government Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) compliant Annual Required Contribution (“ARC”) beginning July 1, 2013 using an
SEIU 2005-2009
29
open group valuation method with a closed 30 year amortization schedule for unfunded liability ending June 30, 2034. Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, each pay period the District shall contribute to the RHBT an amount equal to the below-listed percentages of straight time bargaining unit base pay paid to bargaining unit members in that pay period into the RHBT. (For example, if base pay in the pay period in FY 07 is one million dollars ($1,000,000), the District will contribute $34,900 into the RHBT for that pay period).
Percentage
Date
July 1, 2007 (FY 08)	3.49%
July 1, 2008 (FY 09)	3.64%
July 1, 2009 (FY 10)	3.79%
July 1, 2010 (FY 11)	3.94%
July 1, 2011 FY 12)	4.10%
July 1, 2012 (FY 13)	4.27%
2.	In addition, on or before June 30, 2009 the District shall, at minimum, contribute into the RHBT an amount equal to three and twenty-two one-hundredths percent (3.22%) of straight time bargaining unit base pay paid in FY 06 and three and thirty-six one-hundredths percent (3.36%) of straight time bargaining unit base pay paid in FY 07. These figures represent the “ramp up” percentages for those fiscal years.
3.	The District shall perform an actuarial study of the retiree medical insurance plan liabilities and funding needs (including the Annual Required Contribution -“ARC”) after the end of each calendar year but before the beginning of the next fiscal year for which the results provide guidance. For each fiscal year beginning with FY 2007, the actuaries shall adjust the
30
SEIU 2005-2009
above ramp up percentages for the fiscal year for which the study was prepared and for each remaining fiscal year in the ramp up period. The last such adjustment will be in the study performed prior to July 1, 2013 for FY 2013. The revised percentages shall be the percentages contributed by the District to the RHBT for those years, except that the District shall pay no less than the percentages specified in subsections 1 and 2 above.
4.	Beginning July 1, 2013, the District shall, at minimum, contribute to the RHBT each pay period an amount equal to the full GASB compliant Annual Required Contribution (ARC) percentage of straight time base pay paid to bargaining unit members during that pay period using an open group valuation method with a closed thirty (30) year amortization schedule for unfunded liability ending June 30, 2034. (For example, if the base pay during the pay period is one million dollars ($1,000,000) and the ARC percentage is fourteen percent (14%), the District will contribute one hundred forty thousand dollars ($140,000) to the RHBT for that pay period.)
5.	Effective July 1, 2013, the District shall retain the 1.627% MPPP contribution referred to in subsection C.2 above to the extent necessary to compensate the District for paying the difference between the actual ARC and the baseline ARC described below. The District shall retain this amount through June 30, 2034. In any year in which the actual ARC does not exceed the baseline ARC by an amount equal to the amount of the retained 1.627% MPPP contribution, the District shall pay the appropriate portion of the 1.627% into the employees’ MPPP accounts, but only to the extent that the difference between the actual ARC and the baseline ARC is less than the dollar value of the retained MPPP 1.627%.
EXAMPLE: Assume that the actual ARC is fifteen percent (15%) in the particular year, the baseline ARC is fourteen percent (14%) in the particular year, and that the difference between the two is one million
SEIU 2005-2009
31
dollars ($1,000,000). Assume further that the value of the retained 1.627% is one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000). The District would then pay a total of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) into the employees’ collective MPPP accounts. These payments would be prorated in the same manner as would result from full payment of the 1.627% into the employee accounts.
The baseline ARC is as follows:
FY Year Beginning
Baseline ARC
7/1/13	11.88%
7/1/14	11.94%
7/1/15	12.00%

F.	ALTERNATIVE PLANS.
1.	Between July 15 and November 15, 2005 the District and Union will meet to discuss possible proposals for alternative retiree health insurance plan legislation that would apply to employees hired after the effective date of the legislation. If the parties mutually agree on such proposals, they will jointly request that the state legislature and the Governor approve such legislation on an urgency basis. If the proposal becomes law the District will amend its contract with PERS to adopt the new program effective January 1, 2007 or as soon thereafter as possible for employees hired after the plan takes effect, subject to satisfaction of the following conditions. First, all other District bargaining agents must agree to amend their respective labor agreements to accommodate the change under the same overall terms as for the SEIU and ATU bargaining units. Second, District actuaries must certify that using the same actuarial assumptions, contribution assumptions and ramp up percentages set forth above:
a.	The actuarial projection of the ARC under the new program by the District’s actuaries demonstrates that it will not rise above the ARC under the existing program at any time and that the District’s unfunded liability for retiree medical insurance will not increase at any time.
b.	It will not diminish budgetary savings during the ramp up period described above.
In addition, if the new plan otherwise meets the conditions set forth above, but produces additional savings as determined by the District’s actuaries, the parties shall offset employee medical contributions to the extent of such savings at the time they occur.
SEIU 2005-2009
33
If there are remaining projected savings after the elimination of the above employee contributions, the District and Unions shall meet to discuss further distribution of the savings for employee benefit costs.
G.	Trust Review Committee.

2.	The District will direct the Trustee of the Trust to provide the Unions with quarterly reports of all RHBT operations, including audited and unaudited financial statements and investment performance reports, and other consultant reports in advance of the quarterly TRC meeting. (The parties acknowledge that audited financial statements are performed only once per year.)
3.	The Trustee will attend the TRC meeting to answer questions concerning the information provided to the TRC. However, the TRC shall in no way attempt to assist, direct, or otherwise involve itself in matters concerning the investment of Trust assets. However, the TRC may advise the Trustee on other Trust matters to the extent such advisory activity does not affect the legal status of the Trust. It shall be within the sole discretion of the Trustee whether to follow or not follow such advice.
4.	The TRC members shall be released from regularly scheduled duty with pay to attend meetings of the Human Resources Manager and Labor Relations Manager with the District’s actuaries and other professionals to discuss assumptions to be included in annual GASB valuation studies, the preliminary and final results of such studies, etc. Such studies shall

SEIU 2005-2009
include ARC projections through at least 2035. The District will provide the unions with a copy of the final version of such study on or before February 1 each year or as soon thereafter as is practicable.

Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the signing of this agreement by the parties hereto, the District shall amend the Trust Agreement to provide that:
1.	Trust assets shall be held for the sole and exclusive purpose of providing health benefits to eligible BART retirees and to defray the reasonable expenses of administering the RHBT.
2.	The only District benefit plans for which payments may be made from the RHBT shall be those retiree health benefit plans offered to eligible District retirees as a result of its collective bargaining agreements, or District policy which extends such plans to nonrepresented employees. In addition, for District personnel on a District plan that is no longer generally offered to District employees, payments may be made from the RHBT. However, the District shall ensure sufficient separate funding and the Trustee shall separately account for benefits paid for such personnel.
3.	The District may terminate the RHBT, subject to its duty to bargain in good faith to agreement or impasse over such termination with the union. If the District gives the Unions notice of the termination of the RHBT, the Trust shall not terminate until the assets then remaining are exhausted. Such assets shall be used only as provided in paragraph 1 above.
The District reserves the right to terminate or change any part or all of the health benefits program at any time with respect to active or retired employees, however, any such action will be taken only after the District has satisfied its obligations under applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements. The District’s contractual obligation to provide
SEIU 2005-2009
35
health benefits coverage to retired employees shall terminate upon the expiration of this Agreement. By providing benefits to retirees, the parties do not intend to vest retirees with such benefits.

They will be reimbursed for the difference between the amount withheld and the required fifteen dollars ($15) per monthly contribution. However, if the surviving spouse is not eligible for a PERS annuity only because he/she was married to the employee for less than a year, or only because he/she was a PERS annuitant and became ineligible for an annuity because of remarriage, the District will provide medical benefits as follows:

Benefits for such survivors shall be provided in the same manner as for eligible survivors of retirees who died before the effective date of this program as provided above. If an employee who is enrolled in this Survivor Benefits Program retires after the effective date and then dies, his or her survivors are eligible for dental and vision coverage, but medical coverage will be provided only if the survivors are receiving a PERS survivor’s allowance and having the survivor’s portion of the retiree medical premium withheld from the allowance. They will be reimbursed for the difference between the amount withheld and the required fifteen dollars ($15) per month contribution.

District prior to departure. Hotel charges will be reimbursed at actual cost. Actual costs of meals will be reimbursed when traveling outside the District. Other necessary travel expenses including, but not limited to, local transportation, telephone, laundry and cleaning, will be reimbursed on the basis of actual cost to employee.
C.	Travel Allowance: When assigned outside the District in excess of twenty-four (24) hours, employees of the District may, in lieu of receiving reimbursement for actual costs of travel, elect to receive actual receipted cost of lodging, plus an allowance as established by the District’s Management Procedure No. 20, Section II, Travel Outside The District as reimbursement for all other travel costs. This allowance will be allowed in full on the day of departure and return without regard for time of departure or arrival.
D.	Employees may choose either “B” or “C” for travel expenses. If “B” is selected, a reasonable cash or check advance in such sums as may be deemed necessary, considering the character of the expense, shall be made.
8.0	PAY PROCEDURES
8.1	PAY PERIODS *
All hourly employees shall be paid bi-weekly on every other Friday on an hourly rate basis, except that Staff Assistants shall continue to be considered salaried and shall be paid twice a month on the 15th and last day of the month, until such time as the District is able to establish and implement a bi-weekly payroll system for all District represented and non-represented employees. When that occurs, Staff Assistants shall continue to be considered salaried and shall be paid bi-weekly every other Friday.
The District shall make available an electronic direct deposit system for payroll checks. As a condition for participating in the electronic direct deposit payroll system, any correction necessary for payment made in error, other than for regular straight time hours worked, which cannot be adjusted in the
SEIU 2005-2009
53
current pay period will be adjusted in full on the next following pay period’s direct deposit subsequent to receipt of written notification to Payroll. If the correction is not made in the next following pay period’s direct deposit, the District will make the correction as set forth below.
Except for employees participating in direct deposit, employees whose regular day off/holiday falls on a payday shall receive their payroll checks prior to the end of their shifts on the preceding day. Should checks be available at the employee’s work site on the day preceding the regular payday, they shall be distributed to such employees requesting same, but in no event prior to 4:00 p.m. on the day preceding the regular payday.
Pay periods shall remain as established unless changed by mutual agreement.
There shall not be more than five (5) days’ holdback of pay for any employee.
The District shall continue the present system of itemized deductions, and all adjustments shall be clearly defined on the statement portion of the check. All shortages above fifty dollars ($50) shall be corrected within the time limits set below. The employee’s immediate or appropriate supervisor shall assure that the documentation necessary to correct the shortage has been delivered to Payroll within one (1) work day, exclusive of weekends and holidays, after he/she receives written notification of the shortage from the employee. Payroll shall correct the shortage and cause a check to be available at the employee’s normal work location within three (3) Accounting work days, exclusive of weekends and holidays, after receipt of written notification.
All other shortages shall be added to the next paycheck.
In the event an overpayment of fifty dollars ($50) or less is made in error, it shall be deducted from the employee’s first regular paycheck, following discovery of such overpayment.
Except for employees participating in direct deposit, any employee taking a scheduled vacation shall be provided an
54
SEIU 2005-2009
advance paycheck, provided such payday falls within the scheduled vacation period and provided a written request is submitted to the District no less than five (5) Accounting workdays prior to the scheduled vacation.
Final termination paychecks shall be issued to terminating employees within seventy-two (72) hours after such termination becomes effective.
The District will promptly process Public Employees’ Retirement System refund forms following an employee’s termination.
* Minute Clarification
The parties have reached the following understanding with respect to repayment of overpayments made to employees. This understanding also applies to overpayments made pursuant to the electronic direct deposit system.
Where repayment of the entire amount of the overpayment in a lump sum would work a hardship on the affected employee, the Union may request development of a reasonable repayment schedule through Human Resources. Such request will not be unreasonably denied by Human Resources.
8.2 COST OF LIVING/WAGE ADJUSTMENT
All employees covered by this Agreement shall be covered by the provisions for a cost of living increase as set forth in this Section.
The wage rates as contained in this Agreement shall not be reduced by application of this Cost of Living Provision. In addition to the wage rates contained in this Agreement, all employees shall be paid cost of living adjustments to be determined on the basis of the “Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers” Consumer Price Index (United States Average, revised base 1967 = 100), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor, in the
SEIU 2005-2009
55
manner described in this Section (hereafter referred to as the “Index”).
A.	Effective on June 30, 2009, a Cost of Living Adjustment shall be granted to the wages/salaries of all employees subject to this Agreement equal to one-cent (10) per hour for each full point four (.4) of a point change in the Consumer Price Index as measured on the basis of movement of the Index published for the month of May, 2009 over the Index published for the month of February, 2009.
B.	All Cost of Living Adjustments specified in Paragraph A of this Section for salaried employees shall be at the monthly equivalent of the hourly adjustment (the cost of living cent adjustment times two thousand eighty hours [2,080] hours divided by twelve [12] months = monthly equivalent of the hourly adjustment.)
C.	The resulting Cost of Living Allowance shall be used in the computation of pensions, straight time and overtime pay exactly as though the wage rates had been changed by the allowance. However, the allowance shall not be added to the base wage rates.
D.	The District, during the negotiations for a succeeding term after June 30, 2009, shall not assert that the Cost of Living Allowance increase effective on June 30, 2009 is included as part of any increased wage offer made by the District for the succeeding contract.
8.3 TRANSFERS WITHIN THE UMBRELLA BARGAINING UNIT
A.	Employees transferring within the umbrella bargaining unit shall not be considered as new hires.
B.	Umbrella unit employees of the District who bid and are awarded a higher paying position within the bargaining unit shall be paid no less than the base salary rate of the lower position.
56
SEIU 2005-2009
C.	All entry level and training rates of pay are eliminated effective July 1, 1997.
9.0 SICK LEAVE & DISABILITY
9.1	SICK LEAVE
A.	Accrual: Covered employees shall accrue one (1) day of sick leave for each full month of employment. Sick leave credits may be accumulated to a total of two hundred fifty (250) working days.
B.	Sick Leave Options:
1.	Retirement Buy-Back: To encourage employees to maintain maximum attendance and improve performance the following incentive is offered: employees leaving District service on a service retirement (non-disability retirement) shall be paid fifty percent (50%) of their accrued sick leave balance upon the effective date of service retirement.
2.	Retirement/Termination Bank (Option 1): Employees will be given the option each year to make an irrevocable election to “bank” a percentage of the maximum of the difference between annual sick leave earned during the accrual period, less sick leave taken during the annual accrual period, based on the following schedule. An election to “bank” must include an election as to the percentage amount which will be banked, based on the percentage increments and maximums provided below. At the end of the accrual period, such bank shall be set aside for payment upon death/retirement/termination and shall not be included in the calculation of the amount of Retirement Buy Back under Section 9.1. Employees may alternately elect to deposit up to one hundred percent (100%) of the dollar value of the “bankable” sick leave hours as set forth in option # 1 into their MPPP account on a post tax basis. Sick leave hours that have been so converted will remain in the employee’s MPPP account subject to all investment plan rules or state and federal
SEIU 2005-2009
57
law. Employees who experience an illness/injury and exhaust their existing sick leave that is available, may utilize sick leave that has been banked under this provision provided they make a written request to do so through their Department Manager at the time of the illness/injury and the circumstances qualify for sick leave under D. below.

C.	Choosing An Option: Employees who wish to select Option 1 or 2 as noted above, must so designate during the option period. Employees may select only one option (“bank” or “buy-back”) for each accrual period.
Payroll clerks shall process and transmit employee choices to Payroll during the second week of the option period.
Once an option is selected, it may not be changed until the following option period. Buy back checks will be distributed to employees no later than December 1 following the end of the accrual period.
Unless an employee elects to “bank” (Option 1), or buy-back (Option 2) during the option period, such unused sick leave hours shall be carried over the next year and will no longer be subject to the Annual options.
D.	Sick Leave Payment: Employees shall receive sick leave with pay up to the amount of sick leave accrued at the time of illness, provided the requirements of this section are met. Employees shall accrue sick leave credits during the probationary period, however, they shall not be eligible for sick leave pay until after completion of the probation period.
An employee who is absent from work for reasons that qualify for use of sick leave under section 9.1 who has no accumulated sick leave to cover such absence must use accumulated vacation, personal holiday, and compensatory time off before unpaid leave may be granted. Even though such charges are made, the
60
SEIU 2005-2009
employee’s absence remains subject to the contract provisions governing the use of sick leave. The employee must advise the employee’s appropriate absence report recipient, as designated by the District, of the category of paid leave that shall be charged for such absence. If the employee does not do so, the absence shall be charged by default against the employee’s accumulated vacation, holiday and compensatory time off in that order. Sick leave preserved under section 9.1.D last paragraph (below) will not be available for such charges. Holidays may not be charged if such charge would reduce the number of holidays in the employee’s account below the number of designated contractual holidays remaining in the fiscal year.
Employees shall be eligible for paid sick leave as follows:
1.	Illness, injury, quarantine, or similar exposure to contagious disease;
2.	Verifiable medical and/or dental appointments which cannot be scheduled outside the normal working hours, provided that a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours advance notice is given and provided subsequent confirmation that the appointment was kept is given if requested by Management.
3.	Doctor’s visits associated with pregnancy, subject to the provisions in “2.” above;
4.	Hospitalization or serious illness/accident and resulting subsequent related scheduled doctor’s visits, subject to the provisions in “2.” above;
5.	Required attendance upon a seriously ill spouse, eligible domestic partner, or child. The District may require a written statement from the attending physician that the employee’s attendance was required.
6.	Required transportation to doctor for employee’s spouse, eligible domestic partner, or child if spouse, eligible domestic partner, or child has serious accident
SEIU 2005-2009
61
or serious illness (subsequent verified and scheduled doctor’s visits resulting from initial visit are also included).
7.	Industrial injury and resulting subsequent related scheduled doctor’s visits.
Sick leave with pay shall apply to each separate sick leave incident. For purposes of this section, “sick leave with pay” means pay calculated at the straight time day shift rate for the number of hours the employee was regularly scheduled to work each day, had the illness or injury not occurred.
If an employee’s absence which qualifies for paid sick leave also qualifies as statutory family and medical leave (i.e. FMLA/CFRA), the employee may elect to preserve eligibility for participation in the annual buy-back or the retirement/ termination bank, if either was elected during the option period, by requesting to substitute vacation, floating holidays (for increments of a full day only), or compensatory leave pay, if applicable, or, if he/she has no accrued vacation, floating holidays or compensatory leave, requesting to take the leave unpaid. The request must be made before receipt of sick pay.
E.	Sick Leave Verification: The District may take reasonable means to verify the employee’s eligibility for sick leave. Upon prior written notice, an employee, at his or her expense may be required to provide a doctor’s statement which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the District, eligibility for sick leave as defined above, for any sick leave incident.
Employees shall furnish a doctor’s statement for each sick leave incident involving absences of more than three (3) working days
In instances where the District requires a doctor’s statement, either to verify sick leave or determine an employee’s fitness to return to work, that statement must include the following:
62
SEIU 2005-2009
1.	date and time of treatment;
2.	duration of illness;
3.	date cleared to return to work.
Otherwise, an employee returning to work from a sick leave incident must submit a required doctor’s statement and other documentation within seven (7) calendar days of his/ her return to work. Failure to submit required documentation within the time provided shall result in denial of sick leave pay, and may result in disciplinary action.
The District may require any employee to submit to a medical examination by a doctor designated by the District, at the District’s expense, as a condition of return to work from a sick leave incident or to verify the continuing need for sick leave.
Pattern use, misuse or abuse of sick leave will be governed by the District’s disciplinary procedures and handled on a case-by-case basis.
F.	Sick Leave Reporting: It is the responsibility of every employee absent from work because of illness or injury to report such absences to his/her immediate supervisor or the supervisor’s designated representative. This report must include information as to the expected date of return to work and where the employee can be reached during his/her normal work hours. The employee will promptly notify his/her supervisor or supervisor’s designee of any change which affects his/her ability to return to work.
9.2	INDUSTRIAL INJURY/ILLNESS
A.	Industrial Injury/Illness: Until December 31, 1988, an employee experiencing a verified industrial injury or illness will be entitled to receive no more than two (2) industrial accident leaves. Effective January 1, 1989, an employee experiencing a verified industrial injury or illness will be entitled to receive industrial accident leave
SEIU 2005-2009
63
compensation for no more than two (2) industrial accidents/illnesses during any twelve (12) month period. The employee will be compensated up to a maximum of three (3) days pay for each industrial accident leave. When an employee receives an industrial accident leave he/she shall be entitled to receive only one (1) additional industrial accident leave of up to a maximum of three (3) days during the next twelve (12) months. The twelve (12) month period shall commence on the date the employee returns to work from the absence which gave rise to the first industrial accident leave.
For the purposes of this Section, industrial accident leave shall commence only if the employee is not released to return to work by the beginning of his/her regularly scheduled shift next following the date on which the industrial accident/ illness occurred.
Industrial accident leave compensation shall be advanced to an employee, within the limits set forth above, promptly upon proper notification to the District by the employee, on the condition that it must be verified at a later date. In order to be entitled to industrial accident leave, the employee should report the illness/injury to his/her immediate supervisor by the end of the shift in which the illness/injury occurred, but in no event no later than twenty-four (24) hours from the end of the shift in which the illness/injury occurred.
If it is later determined that the industrial accident leave was improper or invalid, the District may recover the amount equal to the industrial accident leave advance by deducting the amount advanced from the employee’s existing or future sick leave, vacation or floating holiday accrual.
The employee shall be given five (5) working days to authorize such payment by payroll deduction or by designating the specific leave from which the recovery may be made. The accrual must be presently sufficient to cover the amount of the industrial accident leave advance. If the employee does not notify the District within five (5) working days, the District may deduct from
64
SEIU 2005-2009
any accrual an amount sufficient to cover the amount of the advance.
Nothing in this section shall affect the District’s right to recover any amounts owed to it through appropriate legal action.
B.	Coordination of Benefits: Industrial accident leave and Sick Leave benefits, to the extent they are available, may be coordinated, at the employee’s option, with Workers’ Compensation or other compensation to maintain the employee’s basic straight time earnings. Should an employee choose not to exercise the option of coordinating benefits, notification to the District is required in advance. No change in options will be made during an employee’s disability status until BAP Phase I is implemented, after which employees may change options.
9.3	MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS *
Any medical examinations, including periodic eye tests, required of employees by the District shall be paid for by the District, with the exception of costs incurred as a result of untimely employee cancellation of or missed examinations or appointments which shall be paid by the employee, provided the employee is given one week notice of the appointment.
In the case of any job-related illness or injury, an employee shall have the right to examination/treatment by a doctor of his/her choosing.
Medical examinations or follow-up medical appointments shall be scheduled, where possible, during non-work hours. Should this not be possible, the examination shall be scheduled at either the beginning or end of the shift so as to minimize time lost from work.
JOB RELATED ILLNESS/INJURY
SEIU 2005-2009
65
Should the employee select his/her doctor, and the District disagrees with any findings, the District may require a second medical opinion through a District-designated doctor.
Should the findings of the District-designated doctor be inconsistent with the employee-selected doctor, a doctor shall be mutually selected by the following procedure:
The District and the Union shall mutually agree upon an odd-numbered panel of doctors for such purpose. If they are unable to agree upon the names to be included on such a panel, they shall request the Industrial Accident Commission to submit the names of independent medical examiners most frequently used in the San Francisco Bay Area in the various specialties of medicine and these shall constitute the panel. The District and the Union shall select a third doctor from this panel within five (5) working days of the date the dispute is established. The conclusions of the third doctor shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the fee shall be shared 50-50 by both parties.
No employee shall suffer any loss of income or other benefits as a result of any directive to report to a physician, and the time required to report and return from such examination shall be considered as time worked unless the employee is found physically unfit to return to work.
If the findings of the District-designated and employee-selected doctors are inconsistent, no employee shall suffer loss of income or benefits during the first thirty (30) calendar days after the second doctor’s inconsistent conclusions are issued or until the conclusions of the third doctor are issued, whichever occurs first.
Should the third doctor uphold the findings of the District-designated doctor, the employee shall agree in writing to reimburse the District for any income or benefits received to which he/she was not entitled. Reimbursement to the District shall be completed within thirty (30) calendar days from the employee’s return to work.
66
SEIU 2005-2009
NON JOB-RELATED ILLNESS/INJURY
Should the District require any medical examination of an employee with a non-job-related illness/injury, the District may designate a doctor for such purpose. This doctor may be the employee’s doctor; however, if the employee’s doctor is selected, the District reserves the right to require a second medical opinion through another District-designated doctor.
If the first medical examination is not performed by the employee’s doctor, and if the employee disagrees with any medical findings of the District-designated doctor, said employee shall have the right to examination doctor of his/her choosing.
In either case, should the findings of the two doctors be inconsistent, a third doctor shall be mutually selected by the following procedure:
The District and the Union shall mutually agree upon an odd-numbered panel of doctors for such purpose. If they are unable to agree upon the names to be included on such a panel, they shall request the Industrial Accident Commission to submit the names of independent medical examiners most frequently used in the San Francisco Bay Area in the various specialties of medicine and these shall constitute the panel. The District and the Union shall select a third doctor from this panel within five (5) working days of the date the dispute is established. The conclusions of the third doctor shall be final and binding upon the parties, and the fee shall be shared 50-50 by both parties.
No employee shall suffer any loss of income or other benefits as a result of any directive to report to a physician, and the time required to report and return from such examination shall be considered as time worked unless the employee is found physically unfit to return to work.
If the findings of the District-designated and employee-selected doctors are inconsistent, no employee shall suffer loss of income or benefits during the first thirty
SEIU 2005-2009
67
(30) calendar days after the second doctor’s inconsistent conclusions are issued or until the conclusions of the third doctor are issued, whichever occurs first.
Should the third doctor uphold the findings of the District-designated doctor, the employee shall agree in writing to reimburse the District for any income or benefits received to which he/she was not entitled. Reimbursement to the District shall be completed within thirty (30) calendar days from the employee’s return to work.
* Minute Clarification
The parties agree Paragraph 2 is not intended to exempt employees from notice requirements of California State Law.
9.4	DEFINITIONS
A.	Incident: A sick absence, regardless of duration.
B.	Service Retirement: Separation from District employment, including application and eligibility for service retirement with PERS.
9.5	TEMPORARY MODIFIED ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE
The parties recognize that offering Temporary Modified Work Assignments (TMA’s) can, when properly administered, benefit the District and employees financially and in accelerating rehabilitation. Temporary modified work or temporary work assignments will be provided to permanently (who volunteer to participate) and temporarily disabled BART employees, when in the judgment of the District, work is available which can be provided without adversely affecting operations or services. Temporary modified work will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Each employee who desires a TMA shall submit a written notice of such desire simultaneously to his or her immediate supervisor and the District’s Disability Programs Office,
68
SEIU 2005-2009
Department of Human Resources. Promptly after receipt of such notice, the Disability Program Office shall provide the employee with a Return-to-Work questionnaire for completion by the employee’s physician, an instruction sheet on how to complete these forms, and a copy of section 9.5 of the Labor Agreement. The employee must simultaneously return this form completed to the Disability Program Office and the employee’s immediate supervisor. Temporary modified work may involve modification of an employee’s own job or assignment to work outside of an employee’s current position or bargaining unit, as provided herein. The Disability Programs Office, in consultation with the applicable department, will determine eligibility for participation in the temporary modified work program and will coordinate temporary work positions /assignments.
To aid in the administration of this program, the (SEIU and ATU) shall appoint two persons from their bargaining unit to serve on a TMA committee. The duties of the committee include (a) identifying potential TMA opportunities not otherwise identified by the District and recommending them to the Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office for consideration, (b) evaluating proposed TMA assignments and (c) advising the Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office on potential improvements in program administration. The Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office shall periodically train new committee members concerning the TMA program, and shall periodically offer such training to union officers, stewards, supervisors, and managers.
The Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office shall provide committee members with a quarterly report of all requests for TMA application materials, completed Return to Work questionnaires, and TMAs that have been implemented. In addition, the committee shall have access to the completed Return-to-Work questionnaires as they are submitted. The Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office may propose a TMA that crosses bargaining unit lines or that is intra-unit but not on the list described in 9.5.C.3. The committee may by unanimous vote approve assignments that cross bargaining unit lines. The representatives of the union affected by a
SEIU 2005-2009
69
proposed intra-unit TMA not on the list may unanimously approve such assignment. If the Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office, the union presidents and Labor Relations Manager agree in writing, additional TMA’s may be added to or removed from the list set forth in section 9.5.C.3.
On written notice delivered to the others within 150 and 180 days before the expiration date of this agreement, (either SEIU, ATU, or the District) may terminate further use or consideration of inter-bargaining unit TMA’s and such use or consideration as occurs during the life of this agreement shall not be deemed precedent setting. The parties further agree that the relaxation of jurisdictional boundaries or rights permitted under this section is experimental in nature, restricted exclusively to this section, and may not be relied on as a precedent in any future dealings between them or any other bargaining unit.
A. Medical Evaluation: The Benefits Analyst will review all requests for temporary modified work. The Benefits Analyst may, after obtaining all necessary authorizations to release medical information, review the employee’s medical records, confer with the employee’s doctor and/or schedule an examination with a District-selected doctor to determine what type of work accommodations are required. All proposed accommodations or temporary modified positions/ assignments will be reviewed by a District-accepted physician, which may be the employee’s physician, if said physician is selected by the District for this purpose, to determine if the job requirements/assignments are within the employee’s physical and mental abilities. Any disputes will be handled in accordance with Section 9.3 of the Agreement.
B.	Accommodation Review: The Benefits Analyst will discuss accommodation options with a Department representative to determine if accommodations can be made for the employee’s disability on a limited term basis without adversely affecting operations or services.
Accommodations may include but are not limited to:
70
SEIU 2005-2009
1.	reduced work schedules at a minimum of twenty (20) hours per week. Schedules which will result in mid-shift interruptions will not be available;
2.	reassignment of non-essential duties; and
3.	alternate temporary work assignments.
C.	Alternate Temporary Modified Positions / Assignments:
1.	The Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Office will follow the sequence outlined below in determining whether alternate temporary modified work positions/ assignments may be made:
a.	consider returning the employee to work in his/her current position in a modified capacity;
b.	when, in the District’s judgment, this is not possible, consider an alternate temporary position/ assignment in the employee’s department (Alternate placement within the employee’s department will not involve placement in a position represented by a different bargaining unit.);
c.	thereafter, consider an alternate position/ assignment outside the department (Placement outside the department will not involve placement in a position represented by a different bargaining unit.); and
d.	consider an alternate non-represented position/ assignment outside the bargaining unit. Employees placed in non-represented positions/ assignments retain the contractual protections provided for in the CBA of their respective Unions.
2.	If temporary modified work is not available within the employee’s own department, the Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Office will determine if there
SEIU 2005-2009
71
are any unfilled temporary help requests which the employee may be able to fill.
3.	A list of temporary modified positions/assignments in which employees who are temporarily disabled may be placed will be developed. Departments who have temporary modified positions/assignments with which they need assistance may submit work requests to the Benefits Office.

Where fifty percent (50%) or more of an employee's shift occurs between midnight and 8:00 a.m., a graveyard shift premium of nine and one-half percent (9-%%) will be paid for all hours worked during the shift at the existing straight time rate of pay.
An employee's shift shall be determined in accordance with applicable Shift Differential language in the labor Agreement and the following:
0001 - 0800	- Graveyard Shift
0800 - 1600	- Day Shift
1600 - 2400	- Swing Shift
If fifty percent (50%) or more of an employee's shift is worked between the hours of 0001 - 0800 the employee is working on Graveyard Shift, which is the 1st shift of the calendar day. If fifty percent (50%) or more of the employee's shift is worked between the hours of 0800 - 1600 the employee is working on Day Shift, which is the 2nd shift of the calendar day.

This Section shall be limited to a specific assignment where broken time is involved. In no event shall an employee be eligible for both stand-by and call-back compensation for the same hours.
* Minute Clarification
The understanding of the parties signing off this Section is that the change to existing language which provides that "a minimum of one-half (%) day's pay per day" shall be paid is inserted to accommodate the five-day and four-day work week.

19.0 SPECIAL PROVISIONS
19.1	STAFF ASSISTANTS, CLERICAL AND ENGINEERING AIDES *
108
SEIU 2005-2009
Staff Assistants, Clerical and Engineering Aides shall have the option of selecting one of the following alternate work schedules:
A.	Standard eight (8) hour, five (5) day work week.
B.	Flextime - The beginning and ending hours of the standard eight (8) hour, five (5) day work week may be selected to provide for an eight (8) hour work day with a forty-five (45) minute unpaid lunch. Band-time hours within which the selection may be made are 0615 and 1900. On July 1 and January 1 of each contract year, the Staff Assistants, Clerical and Engineering Aides whose work week falls within the Flextime option may, at Management's discretion, reschedule their beginning and ending work hours.
C.	4-10 Work Week - A work day shall consist of ten (10) hours of work, with a scheduled starting time, a forty-five (45) minute unpaid lunch, and three (3) fifteen (15) minute paid break periods. The assigned work week shall consist of four (4) work days within a seven (7) consecutive day period, with a minimum of two (2) consecutive days off. Vacation and Sick Leave shall be accrued and used in accordance with Section 13.2. Holidays shall be accrued and paid in accordance with Section 13.2. Overtime shall be paid in accordance with Sections 13.2 and 14.1.
D. 9/80 Work Schedule - The 9/80 work schedule shall consist of eight (8) nine-hour days and one (1) eight-hour day. A work day shall consist of nine (9) consecutive hours of work (except on alternate weeks when one (1) work day shall consist of eight (8) consecutive hours of work) set between the hours of 0615 and 1900. A work period within this plan shall consist of a total of eighty (80) hours worked. As a general rule, employees will be required to take every other Friday off as part of the three days off portion of the schedule. The Friday the employee works shall be the eight-hour day. (Depending on departmental scheduling, an alternate compressed eight-hour day off may be assigned.) Arbitrary switching of the compressed day off will not be permitted except as
SEIU 2005-2009
109
approved by the individual department on a case-by-case basis. If a holiday falls on a 9/80 employee’s normal nine (9) hour workday, the holiday shall be paid at a nine (9) hour rate of pay. Holidays falling on an employee’s RDO or eight (8) hour day shall be paid at an eight (8) hour rate of pay.
The 9/80 plan modifies an employee's workweek as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This change to the work week is not made to avoid the payment of overtime. The eight-hour day and the day off are the same day of the week, generally alternating Fridays. However this does not preclude the parties, by mutual agreement, from using other than Fridays for implementation of the program. The work week is divided midway through the eight-hour day and the day off.
Employees participating in the 9/80 Work Schedule shall be subject to departmental guidelines regarding the implementation of said schedule.
The District and/or participatory Department(s) may unilaterally terminate or suspend the 9/80 Work Schedule or an employee's participation in said schedule at any time for reasons such as an emergency or operational necessity as determined by Management, the employee’s failure to comply with this section and/or Departmental guidelines, etc.
Such selection among all of the above alternatives must be consistent with operations scheduling requirements of individual departments concerned and approved by the department manager.
* Minute Clarification
The parties agree that the various work week alternatives contained in this Section are options available to Staff Assistants, Clerical and Engineering Aides which may be pursued with their respective department supervisors/ manager. However, implementation of any of these optional work weeks are subject to the approval of the appropriate department manager.

B.	Foreworkers shall be responsible for informal counseling and, as necessary, for administering the first step of the disciplinary procedure (verbal reprimand). Further, Foreworkers shall be responsible for informing their immediate supervisors of problems that may lead to further disciplinary action. These responsibilities shall be reflected in the job descriptions.
C.	When there is a temporary Foreworker vacancy, the District may fill the position through the use of Foreworker overtime or an upgrade of the senior, qualified employee who can perform the work on the given day, shift, and at location where the vacancy exits. If overtime is required in the next lower classification, overtime will first be offered to the Foreworkers at the location before an upgrade is offered. If a Foreworker call-in is required, the District will only upgrade until the Foreworker arrives. If unable to fill as stated above, then classification seniority will apply.
1.	In the event the temporary vacancy extends beyond thirty (30) days, the procedure as described in Section 27.1 (Position Assignment) of the Agreement will apply.
2.	Foreworker duties will not be performed by non-bargaining unit employees.

Union business as far in advance as possible.

In instances where operational needs prevent the supervisor from granting the specific request, the representative and the supervisor shall immediately pick an alternate, mutually agreed upon time for the future conduct of the requested Union business. Supervisors shall make a reasonable effort to grant authorized Union business as requested or as soon as operationally possible, when the original request cannot be granted. If the supervisor fails to immediately cooperate in the effort to pick an alternate, mutually agreed upon time, the representative shall be allowed release time as originally requested.

If the Union determines there to be an abuse by the District with respect to the loss of pay and/or the imposition of discipline in this context, the Union shall resort solely to the grievance procedure and seek such remedy as it believes to be appropriate. Self-help in this area will not be countenanced.
In the event of meetings or hearings concerning non-spontaneous matters not requiring immediate resolution, there will be twenty-four (24) hours notice to the immediate supervisor of those employees who are to attend such meetings or hearings. Those employees attending such meetings or hearings must be directly concerned with the subject of the meetings or hearings. In the event the number of employees required in attendance raise operational concerns, a schedule of staggered appearances shall be worked out between the parties.
Upon formal designation, Union representatives employed by the District will not be transferred from the assignment shift or location they hold at the time of their election or appointment unless mutually agreed. They will be given the privilege of using the District's inter-office mail, e-mail, and a telephone as may reasonably be necessary in the conducting of Union business. E-mail use is permissible by stewards for corresponding with District management or

21.0 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
21.1	DEFINITION
A Grievance shall be defined as any dispute which involves the interpretation or application of this Agreement, scope of representation, and such rules, regulations and resolutions presently in force or as may from time to time be adopted by the District.
21.2	PROCEDURE *
The parties recognize that disputes should be resolved expeditiously at the lowest possible administrative level, notwithstanding the right and desirability of the employee or the Union to bypass any initial steps if the case involves decision-making at a higher administrative level.
A.	Step 1: The employee and/or his/her representative may present the grievance personally, in writing or orally, to the immediate superior within ten (10) working days of the occurrence of the dispute or ten (10) working days from such time as the employee or Union could have been aware of the occurrence;
B.	Step 2: If the grievance is not resolved within five (5) working days of the presentation under Step 1, the grievance may be submitted in writing to the department head or his/her designee. Such submittal to the department head shall be within five (5) working days of the action by the immediate superior. The department head shall respond within five (5) working days;
C.	Labor Relations & Union Meetings (Step 3): If the grievance cannot be resolved under Step 2, the Union may, within five (5) working days of the action by the department head, arrange for the convening of a meeting between representatives of Labor Relations and the
116
SEIU 2005-2009
Union to attempt to resolve the grievance on a mutually acceptable basis.
D.	Arbitration (Step 4): Should the matter remain unresolved in Step 3 above, either party may, within ten (10) working days of the determination, request arbitration of the dispute. Within ten (10) days after the request for arbitration, the parties shall strike for an arbitrator. Either party may thereafter contact the arbitrator to initiate the scheduling of a hearing date. The parties agree to exert all reasonable efforts to avoid undue delay in the scheduling process. In any arbitration forum, the decision of the Arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties. Expenses of the arbitration and/or court reporter shall be borne equally by both parties unless, by prior agreement, the parties agree the losing party shall bear all such expenses.
1. Informal Arbitration: If the issue has not been submitted to formal arbitration, the grievance will be submitted to a permanent arbitrator who shall promptly convene a hearing under the informal arbitration procedure with the understanding that there may be multiple cases in a day.
Each party will present its case orally without benefit of legal counsel, or written briefs. Witnesses may be called by the parties, as required. The permanent arbitrator shall submit the decision and the basis for his or her decision in writing to the parties within ten (10) working days of the receipt of the hearing transcript.
A permanent arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement or from the Arbitration Strike Sheet containing the names of eleven (11) neutral arbitrators utilized and mutually agreed upon by the parties. The parties shall alternately strike names from the list until one (1) remains who shall then be the arbitrator. The term of the permanent arbitrator will be one (1) year from date of his or her appointment and shall continue to serve from year to year thereafter unless either party serves written notice upon the other no less that thirty
SEIU 2005-2009
117
(30)	working days prior to the expiration of each annual term of its desire to select a new arbitrator.
In the event the permanent arbitrator is not available within thirty (30) working days from the date the moving party requests an informal arbitration, a relief arbitrator will be selected in a similar fashion as that for the permanent arbitrator identified above. The relief arbitrator will be selected on a case-by-case basis and will not have any ongoing term.
The permanent arbitrator shall have the authority to resolve any dispute or issue that is properly before him or her under this Agreement except matters that have been referred to Formal Arbitration.
Five (5) working days prior to the hearing, the respective advocates shall meet for the purpose of establishing a submission sheet. The submission sheet shall contain the following information:
1.	The issue.
2.	The remedy.
3.	The agreed upon facts.
4.	A tentative witness list.
If the parties cannot agree upon the issue and/or the remedy, then the arbitrator shall have the power to frame the issue and decide the remedy, in accordance with Section 21.2 D (4).
2.	Formal Arbitration: Either party may refer an issue unresolved at Step 3 directly to formal arbitration. In arbitration, each party shall be represented by the advocate of their choosing. Written briefs shall be filed at the discretion of the arbitrator.
If the matter is referred to formal arbitration, an impartial arbitrator shall be selected from the Arbitration Strike Sheet containing the names of eleven (11) neutral arbitrators utilized and mutually agreed upon by the parties. The parties shall alternately strike names from the list until one (1) remains who shall
118
SEIU 2005-2009
then be the arbitrator. In the event the selected arbitrator is not available within sixty (60) working days, then the next arbitrator on the list in inverse order will be selected.
3.	Immediate Arbitration: Either party may waive the time limits specified herein and proceed to immediate arbitration, either formal or informal, in any case where either party alleges the other is threatening to take an action in violation of this Agreement in so short a period of time as to disallow the other party from proceeding within said time limits. In any such case, the Arbitrator shall have full equitable powers to frame a decision, including an order to the party initiating the grievance to abide by the time limit provided in this Article, or a restraining order against the party threatening the action, or any other form of arbitration order that would resolve the matter in an equitable and just manner. In case of immediate arbitration, no briefs shall be filed by either party.
Immediate arbitration for this purpose shall be defined to mean the earliest arbitration date available after at least five (5) working days from the date of request to schedule/substitute is received by the respondent. Either party may substitute the subject grievance in lieu of the first arbitration, after the five (5) working day period, which is scheduled between the parties for another matter. Should the parties not decide to make such a substitution with the first available arbitration after the five (5) working day period, no other substitution is permitted, except by mutual agreement.
4.	Powers of the Arbitrator: In any arbitration held pursuant to the Agreement (i.e., immediate, informal or formal), the person acting as arbitrator shall act in a judicial, not legislative manner. The arbitrator shall not amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to or subtract from the provisions of the Agreement but, rather, shall interpret and apply its terms. The arbitrator shall consider and decide only the issue or issues agreed upon by the parties, including the issue of arbitrability. If the parties are unable to decide upon the issue or
SEIU 2005-2009
119
issues to be submitted to the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall decide what the issue or issues are, based upon the grievance that was filed. If the arbitrator sustains the grievance, he or she shall fashion an appropriate remedy that does not conflict with provisions contained in this Agreement.
*	Minute Clarification
Except by mutual agreement Union Stewards and District Managers shall be excluded from the meeting between representatives of Labor Relations and the Union at Step 3 of the Grievance Procedure.
*	Minute Clarification
The parties agree to meet, develop and implement a program designed to review, resolve, or terminate all outstanding grievances as of the signing date of the agreement, including the option to use state mediators, with a target date of June 30, 2003.
21.3	WITNESSES
Parties who may have direct knowledge of circumstances relating to the grievance may be present at the request of either party during any stage of the procedure. In the case of employees, they shall be compensated at their regular rate of pay for actual time spent in such meetings.
21.4	TIME LIMITS
A.	Grievance Processing: The time between the steps of the procedure may be extended by mutual agreement. Failure by the employee or Union to follow the time limits, unless extended by mutual agreement, shall cause the grievance to be considered withdrawn; failure by the District to follow the time limits, unless extended by mutual agreement, shall cause the grievance to be deemed settled in favor of the employee.
120

B.	Grievance Resolution Processing: The District shall process grievance resolutions and arbitration awards to the Accounting Division within two (2) weeks of the date that the Human Resources Department and the Union agree to the grievance resolution, or within two (2) weeks from the date the Human Resources Department receives the arbitration award.

22.4 JOB ABANDONMENT
A.	Except as provided in subsection B below, an employee who is absent from work without authorization for seven (7) or more work days shall be tentatively deemed to have abandoned his or her District employment. In that event, the District may implement the following procedure:
1.	The District will send a dated notice by certified mail (return receipt requested) to the employee’s last home address on record with the District. Such notice shall indicate the District’s intent to terminate the employee and the date, time, and location of the employee’s pretermination hearing. The District shall send a copy of the notice to the union at the same time.

122
SEIU 2005-2009

5.	If the District terminates the employee, the employee may within ten (10) working days grieve the termination directly to step 3 of the Grievance Procedure.	However, the only issues before the
arbitrator shall be whether the procedure set forth in this subsection A has been properly followed and whether the employee was absent without leave for reasons not reasonably within the employee’s control. The District shall have the burden of proof on the former issue. The employee shall have the burden of proof on the latter issue.
B.	If an employee who is absent from work without authorization provides his or her supervisor with sufficient evidence to establish that the employee’s unauthorized leave was due to reasons not reasonably within the employee’s control, subsection A5 shall apply unless the supervisor reverses or withdraws the termination process.

Within each Functional Classification of the Maintenance Subunit, all employees shall be required to have on file at all times with the District an Advance Bid Form indicating their priority preferences for shift, rest days and work location for their classification.
While there is no limit on the number of forms an employee may submit, only the most current form will be used to fill an open position, provided the most current form was filed by the employee at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the bid, the last form on file immediately preceding the twenty-four (24) hours before the bid shall be used.
A Chief Steward and Management designee (clerical) shall process the advance bid procedure.
130
SEIU 2005-2009
Position awards made as a result of the advance bid form shall be final and binding upon the employee and the District.
Should the District be unable to fill a position opening by means of the above procedure, said position shall be posted for bid in accordance with the System Bidding Procedure (Section 24.3).
Any changes in bid specifications (such as RDOs, shift, work location, hours, or newly created or vacant existing positions that are not subject to Section 24.3) must be posted at least seven (7) days prior to processing through this procedure.
The Union will be given at least seven (7) days prior notice of any District intention to redline or abolish a position.
All Advance Bid information and material shall remain confidential.
Implementation procedures are as follows:
1.	(a) A job is eliminated or
(b)	A job is eliminated and a new job is created
(c)	A vacant position is to be filled that is not subject to Section 24.3
2.	(a) Maintenance employee persons whose jobs have been eliminated will then use ABF to go to where their seniority will carry them. Example: #1 choice is checked; if a senior person is in that job then #2 choice is checked. This continues until a junior person is filling a particular choice. The person whose job was eliminated then takes this job. The process is repeated with the affected employee. This will continue through the seniority list until:
1	.) The last person fills the open slot or
2	.) The affected employee fills an open slot
SEIU 2005-2009
131
3	.) The last affected employee is assigned an open slot because their ABF did not reflect a choice held by a junior employee or
4	.) If no open slots are available then a Reduction in Force has been initiated and Section 25.2 is followed.
(b) In the case of l(b), the newly created job is bid as in the normal way of an ABF Procedure. When the bid reaches the person whose job was eliminated then this person has their #1 choice checked to see if it is occupied by a senior or junior employee. If a senior employee is holding the slot, their #2 choice is checked. This continues until a choice is held by a junior employee. This employee will then follow this same procedure. The bid continues through the entire seniority roster until:
1	.) The last person fills the open slot or
2	.) The last affected person is assigned the open slot because his ABF did not reflect a choice occupied by a junior employee.
3	.) All affected employees shall remain in their positions until the effective date of the change over.
24.6 FOREWORKER EVALUATION COMMITTEE *
A Foreworker Evaluation Committee shall be established to evaluate candidates for promotion to Foreworker. This Committee shall be composed of three (3) individuals designated by Management and three (3) by the Union. The individuals designated by the Union shall be from the Foreworker classification. The Committee shall consider all bids of qualified applicants previously screened against the Foreworker qualifications specifications as provided for in Side Letter (SEIU-1-3). The Committee shall establish
132
SEIU 2005-2009
procedures for making recommendations for promotion consistent with the District Affirmative Action Policy. The recommendations by the Committee shall not be reversed by the District except for just cause or unless it is clearly demonstrated that the Committee has abused its wide discretion to make selections among applicants. Criteria for promotion will include examination of the personnel file, attendance record, previous work experience, previous training and experience, merit, ability, leadership potential and education. Where qualifications are equal, seniority shall prevail in making recommendations and any employee who applied for promotion with a higher seniority than the employee selected will be given an interview with a Management member of the Committee explaining its decision. The Union may submit to arbitration under the arbitration terms of the Agreement any grievance of such individuals. The issue in said arbitration will be whether the Foreworker Evaluation Committee clearly abused its discretion or violated the District Affirmative Action Policy or whether the District representative making the final decision reversed the recommendation of the Committee without just cause. Pending such appeal, the selected individual or individuals shall serve in the position(s).
* Minute Clarification
The Committee may seek the aid of the Human Resources staff for assistance in the development of criteria for standard selection procedures.
In reference to the above- mentioned criteria, the Maintenance Foreworker Selection Guidelines dated March 29, 1983 shall be used as the current criteria, and if changed a copy shall be forwarded to the Union.
24.7	RELIEF SHIFT
The District may establish positions designated as Relief Shift positions.
Such positions may be utilized for job assignments involving multiple starting times and report locations which cannot be
SEIU 2005-2009
133
covered through the normal fixed work location procedures with the available personnel.
Such positions shall be filled through the normal bidding procedures.
Employees awarded such positions shall be granted a twelve percent (12%) differential above the base rate of pay for the classification for all hours worked.
There will be no reduction in the affected classification workforce as a specific result of the implementation of this Section.
24.8	ELIGIBILITY BIDDING POOLS
Employees may bid on jobs within the maintenance subunit that are “continuously open” through the Internal Eligibility Pool.
The following procedure will apply for admittance into any Internal Eligibility Pool:
A.	Employees must submit a separate short form application and resume for each position that they are interested in. Each application received by Human Resources will be date stamped.
B.	The application is then forwarded to the Human Resources Department for “paper screening” to ensure that the required Minimum Qualification are met by the applicant. Human Resources will acknowledge, in writing within ten (10) days, the receipt of the application to the employee.
C.	Human Resources will inform the applicant if they are rejected so that the applicant may submit additional information for future review and consideration.
D.	Where the employee meets the Minimum Qualifications and passes required tests, as applicable, the employee’s application will be forwarded to the hiring supervisor by
134
SEIU 2005-2009
Human Resources within two (2) weeks. Where practicable, the hiring supervisor will interview the applicant in a timely manner.
E.	It will be the hiring supervisor’s responsibility to verify the applicant’s stated experience and documentation. The hiring supervisor will then make arrangements for any interview or any additional testing, if required.
F.	Once the hiring supervisor has made the determination that the employee meets the requirements, the employee’s name will be added to the Internal Eligibility Pool.
The Human Resources Department will forward to the Union a quarterly listing of all Internal Eligibility Pools. Employees in the Internal Eligibility Pool will be listed in seniority order by District Date-of-Hire.
Job positions that come open will be filled in the following manner:
1.	The Human Resources Department will contact the senior employee by Date-of-Hire and offer the position to the employee.
2.	If the senior employee declines the position, the next senior employee will be offered the job. This will continue until the position is filled.
3.	Any employee who declines a position will still remain in the Internal Eligibility Pool.
25.0 REDUCTION IN FORCE
25.1 CLERICAL *
In the event of a reduction in force within the Clerical Subunit, classification seniority shall be first controlling, in inverse order.
SEIU 2005-2009
135
Thereafter, an employee may revert to any position or classification previously held or for which the employee is otherwise qualified by utilization of District date-of-hire seniority.
If an employee reverts to a position the employee has or has not previously held, but is qualified to hold, employee's date-of-hire seniority shall be employee's classification date in that position.
In the event a vacant position exists, or will soon be created, within the classification of an employee whose position has been abolished, said vacancy shall not be posted. The Clerical Chief Steward shall contact the employees involved in any potential reduction in force and, in seniority order, determine whether any of such employees are interested in the vacant position(s). Employees shall have no more than thirty (30) minutes in which to accept or reject said vacant position.
Thereafter, the same procedure shall apply to descending classification, as applicable.
In the event a vacant position exists and no reduction in force is in progress, the vacant position will be made available, prior to becoming available through the bidding process, to any qualified employee separated from the District through a reduction in force based on date-of-hire seniority.

SEIU 2005-2009
A.	In the event of a reduction in force within a functional classification, classification seniority shall first be controlling in inverse order.
B.	Thereafter, an employee must first revert to any position or classification previously held for which the employee is otherwise qualified by utilization of District date-of-hire seniority. The employee’s classification seniority date shall be the original date of entry into the classification.
C.	However, an employee may bump to any position or classification not previously held, or for which the employee is otherwise qualified by utilization of District date-of-hire seniority. The employee's classification seniority date shall be the date of entry into the classification.
1.	The employee must first bump into any open/unfilled position within the classification, or
2.	If no open/unfilled position exists, the employee may use his/her date-of-hire seniority to bump within the classification.
3.	The person whose job was bumped shall exercise his/her seniority to bump within the classification.
4.	Thereafter, all bumps for affected employees in lower classification shall be governed by District date-of-hire seniority.
25.3 RECALL
A.	In the event any position is reinstated or there becomes an opening, the position shall first be offered within the functional classification. Thereafter:
1.	Employees separated from the classification due to a reduction in force shall be afforded a single option to be reinstated to the classification in the inverse order in which they were removed. If the affected employee
SEIU 2005-2009
137
has subsequently bid to a new classification, he/she shall have a single option to utilize this section.
2.	The affected employee shall select any open position within the classification.
3.	Classification seniority shall be the original date of entry into the classification.
4.	Employees separated from the District shall have the option of applying for a position in a lower classification at a lower pay level. However, said employee can reject such an offer and still remain on the recall list.
B.	Employees separated from the District by reduction in force shall be recalled (reinstated) by District date-of-hire seniority based on the following formula: each employee shall have recall rights for a period of two (2) years from the date of separation. Seniority for such recalled employees shall continue up to reinstatement. In the event any position is reinstated or opened, the position shall be first put through the bid procedure within the pick unit. Thereafter:
1.	The recalled employee shall first bump into the classification by use of original classification seniority.
2.	The person whose job was bumped shall exercise his/her seniority to bump within the classification.
C.	Notices of recall (reinstatement) shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by telegram. Employees on the reinstatement list shall have ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of certified mail or telegram to accept or reject the reinstatement.

F.	It is the responsibility of the employee to remain aware of available positions for recall. Failure of the District to contact the employee or mail job posting summary sheets will not result in a claim by the employee that they were unaware of an available position. It will continue to be the responsibility of the employee to advise the District of their correct mailing address.
26.0 PROBATION
26.1	NEW HIRES
Any new or rehired District employee (other than recall from layoff) shall, for the first one hundred twenty (120) calendar days of service be considered a Probationary employee.

Each employee, upon request, shall be entitled to Union representation with regard to such evaluation. However, probationary dismissals shall not be subject to the grievance procedure except where evaluations have not been written in a timely manner or where discrimination, as defined elsewhere in this Agreement, is charged.
A probationary employee shall have no seniority rights but, upon completion of the probationary period, such rights will date back to the date of employment.
SEIU 2005-2009
139
26.2	PROMOTION WITHIN THE BARGAINING UNIT *
A.	An employee who has been promoted or has accepted a downward or lateral bid shall have the option for sixty (60) calendar days to revert to his/her former position without loss of seniority or other benefits. The first day of "reversion" period shall coincide with the commencement of the Probationary Period.
B.	The first day of the Probationary Period shall commence on the day when the successful bidder has been actually assigned to perform the duties of the awarded job. An employee who has been promoted shall be evaluated following the thirtieth (30th), sixtieth (60th) and eightieth (80th) calendar day and the evaluation shall be reviewed with each employee. Upon satisfactory completion of the Probationary Period, the employee's classification seniority date shall be the date upon which the job was awarded rather than the date on which the work of the new job was actually assigned.
C.	In the case of Maintenance, lateral bids with no change in classification, for the purposes of RDO's, shift and/or location change, the sixty (60) day option shall not apply.
D.	If an employee is rejected from the position during the probationary period, he/she shall have the option to revert to his/her former position without loss of seniority or other benefits.
E.	In the event of A or D above, if the position previously held has been eliminated, the employee shall have bumping rights to a position within the classification previously held.
F.	Employees who are rejected for promotion under this Section (Paragraph D) have the right to grieve said rejection.
* Minute Clarification
140
SEIU 2005-2009
The parties agree that they may mutually agree to extend the probationary period including reversion rights, of an employee under this Section beyond the day period up to a maximum of one hundred eighty (180) days on a case-by-case basis, in order to better evaluate the employee.
Requests by the District for such extensions will not be unreasonably denied by the Union.

27.0 TEMPORARY POSITIONS
27.1 POSITION ASSIGNMENT *
SEIU 2005-2009
141
A.	Temporary Vacancy - Clerical Subunit:
1.	For the first sixty (60) days of any temporary vacancy, the District may upgrade any employee from the next lowest classification in the Department with District date-of-hire seniority and qualifications to govern, and will not be obligated to post such opening for bid. Should the employee in the department accept the position, the resulting vacancy shall be filled by temporary agency personnel.
2.	If the employee in the next lowest classification in the department rejects the position, the District may upgrade an employee from the next lowest classification outside the department with District date-of-hire seniority and qualifications to govern.
If the employee from outside the department accepts the position, the resulting vacancy shall be filled by temporary agency personnel.
If the employee outside the department rejects the position, the original vacancy shall be filled by temporary agency personnel.
3.	If there is not an employee to upgrade in the department in the next lowest classification or the employee in the department in the next lowest classification does not qualify, the District may upgrade an employee outside the department in the next lowest classification with District date-of-hire seniority and qualifications to govern. If the employee outside the department accepts the position, the resulting vacancy shall be filled by temporary agency personnel.
If the employee outside the department rejects the position or does not qualify, the District may upgrade an employee from the next lower classification in the originating department with District date-of-hire seniority and qualifications to govern.
142
SEIU 2005-2009
If the employee in the department accepts the position the resulting vacancy shall be filled by temporary agency personnel.
If the employee in the department rejects the position or does not qualify, the original vacancy shall be filled by temporary agency personnel.
4.	In the event the temporary vacancy extends beyond the sixty (60) day period, but there is reasonable cause to believe the employee who vacated the position temporarily will soon return, the temporary assignment may be extended by mutual agreement of the District and the Union.
5.	In the event the temporary assignment extends beyond the sixty (60) day period and there is reasonable cause to believe the employee who vacated the position will continue to be absent for a significant additional period of time, the vacant position will be posted for bid consistent with the seniority provisions of this Agreement. Such posting will be carried out with the understanding the employee who secures the position via bid will hold the new position on a temporary basis for the first nine (9) months, and may be caused to return to his/her former position if the original incumbent returns within that time. If his/her former position no longer exists, he/she shall be afforded the right to utilize his/her classification seniority rights with his/her former classification and Functional Classification. (Where "Functional Classification" is used above, it is understood it could refer to "Section" or "Classification", depending on the seniority provisions of the particular subunit.)
6.	This Section shall not be utilized to circumvent the assignment of an employee to a higher classification on a permanent basis.
B.	Temporary Vacancy - Maintenance Subunit:
1.	For the first thirty (30) days of any temporary vacancy, the District may assign any employee by classification
SEIU 2005-2009
143
seniority within the Functional Classification to perform that work, and will not be obligated to post such opening for bid. If unable to fill the vacancy from within the Functional Classification, the District may select an employee from outside the Functional Classification with District date-of-hire seniority and qualifications to govern. In the event the temporary vacancy extends beyond the thirty (30) day period, but there is reasonable cause to believe the employee who vacated the position temporarily will soon return, the temporary assignment may be extended by mutual agreement of the District and the Union.
2.	In the event the temporary assignment extends beyond the thirty (30) day period and there is reasonable cause to believe the employee who vacated the position will continue to be absent for a significant additional period of time, the vacant position will be posted for bid consistent with the seniority provisions of this Agreement. Such posting will be carried out with the understanding the employee who secures the position via bid will hold the new position on a temporary basis for the first nine (9) months, and may be caused to return to his/her former position if the original incumbent returns within that time. If his/her former position no longer exists, he/she shall be afforded the right to utilize his/her classification seniority rights with his/her former classification and Functional Classification. (Where "Functional Classification" is used above, it is understood it could refer to "Section" or "Classification", depending on the seniority provisions of the particular subunit.)
3.	This Section shall not be utilized to circumvent the assignment of an employee to a higher classification on a permanent basis.
C.	Return to Work:
1.	In the event the absent incumbent does not return within those nine (9) months or, if at the time of the initial absence there is reasonable cause to believe the absence will extend in excess of nine (9) months, the
144
SEIU 2005-2009
District may fill the vacant position on a permanent basis, while only guaranteeing the absent incumbent the right to return to an open position to his/her former classification at the then-existing rate.
2.	In the event the absent incumbent returns after nine (9) months and no open position exists in his/her former classification, the employee will be offered any existing open position in a classification as near as possible to his/her original classification and qualifications. Paragraphs A2), B2) and C1) of this Section do not apply to industrial injuries.
3.	If no open position exists pursuant to C.1 or C.2 above, the employee shall be deemed on inactive layoff status eligible for recall in the same manner and for the same duration as provided under section 25 of this Agreement.
D.	Specific Project Assignments:
By mutual agreement of the employee and the Union, the employee may be assigned to report to locations other than their bid locations. This provision is only applicable to Track and Structures, Power/Mechanical and Plant Support pick-units.
Employees who are assigned away from their bid work location for two (2) consecutive work days or more may be required to report directly to, and be released from, an alternate work location for the duration of the assignment at no additional cost to the District. The duration of the assignment will not exceed thirty (30) days. The parties understand that such assignments away from the employees' normal reporting locations will be in those situations where employees are working on a specific project for the above referenced pre-determined timeframe. The Union will be given at least one week's notice to provide a list of employees who will be required to report directly to their work assignment.
The District shall provide all necessary tools and equipment to perform the job. When practical and
SEIU 2005-2009
145
feasible the District will provide restroom and clean-up facilities.
*	Minute Clarification
The District agrees that it is not the intent of this Section to create an unreasonable hardship on employees. In making such assignments, the District will consider factors such as availability of parking, availability of public transportation and geographic location.
*	Minute Clarification
The parties agree that a temporary vacancy is defined as the opening of a bid position due to a vacancy or any other temporary absence of the incumbent for any reason.
This clarification does not preclude the District from exercising its right to determine whether or not a vacant position will be filled.
27.2	TEMPORARY UPGRADE
An employee temporarily assigned by the District who performs duties in a higher classification, will receive the first entry rate of such higher classification, or five percent (5%) above their present rate of pay, whichever is greater, as acting pay while fulfilling said assignment. No reduction in pay shall occur because of any temporary assignment.
This Section shall not be utilized to circumvent the assignment of an employee to a higher classification on a permanent basis.
An employee who performs one or more of the duties in a higher classification, and who receives temporary upgrade pay, shall not be deemed qualified for the higher classification unless the employee can demonstrate that he/she can perform the full scope of the duties of the higher classification.

1* Minute Clarification
The parties agreed to the following:
Shop Scheduler:
The Shop Schedulers shall be moved into the MW III Step Progression System with the following provisos:
1)	Shop Schedulers will not be permitted to fill Foreworker or Inspector vacancies on a temporary basis.
2)	Temporary Shop Scheduler vacancies will be filled/not filled at management's discretion utilizing, but not limited to, any of the following options:
A)	Lateral transfer of Shop Schedulers
156
SEIU 2005-2009
B)	Shop Scheduler overtime
C)	Upgrade of senior qualified ET or TVM.
Foreworkers within Stores Division:
In accordance with the Classification Plan, the Foreworker positions within the Stores Division will be reclassified as Foreworker III positions and no longer be part of the SEIU Local 790 bargaining unit. The duties and responsibilities of the positions will continue as before the reclassification. No other change is associated with this move.
EDS/Shop Trainers:
Pursuant to SEIU/MOU-031-7, the EDS/Shop Trainers are placed in the Shops-Vehicle pick-unit.
Multiple Discipline Work Projects:
Management may establish work groups from more than one pick unit to perform projects that require workers from more than one job function. This work group would be formed for a specific project, for a specific duration and under the direction of a single foreworker from one of the pick units involved.
The Foreworker assigned to supervise a multiple work group will be paid five percent (5%) above their current rate of pay from the period of time assigned to a specific project.
28.3 CLASSIFICATION PLAN *
The Classification Plan (Plan) purpose is to more appropriately describe, classify, allocate, and reallocate District work for more operational effectiveness and efficiency. In order to fully implement the Plan the following procedures shall be followed, which affect employee pay, unit representation, filling of position vacancies, and progression and promotion:
1.	"Red Circling" for Reallocated Employees: In instances where an employee's work in the then
SEIU 2005-2009
157
existing classification (old classification) is reallocated by downgrade in accordance with the Plan's new classification structure, then that employee's pay will be "red circled". "Red circled" means that the employee shall continue to be paid at his/her present rate of pay, but will receive future pay increases and benefit applicable to the old classification until such time as he/she vacates the position. When the "red circled" employee vacates his/her position in the old classification for any reason, the vacant position shall be filled within the new classification structure and pay range.
2.	Non-represented Position Transfer to Bargaining Unit Under the Plan (Grandfather Clause): Under the Plan some previously existing non-represented employee positions have been identified for reallocation to bargaining unit positions as the result of the Plan implementation. In that event, the incumbent non-represented employee shall have the option of remaining non-represented or be transferred and represented by the bargaining unit. The District is responsible for establishing the appropriate procedure for the then non-represented employee to exercise this option/election.
Should the incumbent non-represented employee elect not to be included in the bargaining unit, then the incumbent employee shall remain exempt from Union representation as long as he/she remains in the position which was identified for reallocation to the bargaining unit.

28.5	Section. Business Advancement Plan - “BAP” -(Update of Electronic Data Management Systems)
A.	Evaluation of Reorganization Proposals: The District may initiate reorganizations related to the BAP (phases I and II) that would involve a redistribution of duties between classifications within the bargaining unit. The District shall send notice of such action and the tentatively assigned wage rate for modified classifications to the union no less than thirty (30) days before the proposed implementation date. In determining whether to initiate such a reorganization of duties, the District shall consider:
1.	whether the change would directly or indirectly increase productivity, efficiency or the quality of service;
2.	the impact on employee working conditions, safety and available mitigation measures; and
3.	other relevant considerations identified by the union.
The union may object to such reorganization or to the wage rate proposed by the District or both within the thirty (30) day notice period but shall specify its position on each matter in its notice. If the Union submits written notice of its objections to the District, the parties shall meet within fifteen (15) days thereafter in an effort to reach agreement on the changes in affected classification descriptions and the applicable wage rates. If they reach agreement, the reorganization may proceed. If they do not, the disputed matter shall be submitted to expedited arbitration as set forth below.
B.	Expedited Arbitration.
1.	The parties agree that the following three (3) arbitrators shall hear and resolve disputes arising under subsection A above: William Riker, David Nevins, and Alexander Cohn.
SEIU 2005-2009
173
2.	Hearings pursuant to subsection A above shall be scheduled on a bi-quarterly basis, with bi-quarterly dates selected a year into the future. Each arbitrator on the panel will hear and decide all the disputes on a given quarterly date, with the dates rotating between the above panel members. The parties may agree on substitutions within the rotation. The arbitrator will issue a bench decision within three (3) days of the close of the hearing. Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator, no court reporter will be required and no briefs will be filed. Argument may be limited at the discretion of the arbitrator. The parties shall equally share the arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
3.	The arbitrator will consider the following in determining whether the reorganization proposed by the District should go forward:
a.	Whether the proposed job description revisions increase efficiency, productivity, or the quality of service;
b.	Whether the proposed revision(s) violates the non-discrimination provision of this agreement;
c.	Whether the proposed revision adequately addresses any adverse impact of the proposed changes on employee health and safety; and,
d.	Any other relevant information the parties bring forward.
4.	In disputes over the appropriate wage rate for the revised classification, the arbitrator shall base his or her decision on rates paid in the relevant labor market for comparable jobs, internal comparisons, the financial condition of the District, and other relevant compensation factors brought forth by the parties.
5.	The process described herein shall not apply to any changes in job descriptions outside the scope of the BAP I or II.

Re: ROLE OF THE INVESTMENTS COMMITTEE
Dear Mr. Williams:
At yesterday's meeting (September 29), you are aware the Committee voted unanimously that, in the event employees vote to withdraw from Social Security coverage, Centrecorp of Oakland be designated to handle both the IRS Qualified Plan and Deferred Compensation as retirement/ investment vehicles.
In response to your earlier questions concerning our interest in maintaining a continuing role for the Committee/Employee Organizations in such eventuality, you responded as follows:
1)	The District has no objection to a 5-Party Agreement (the four organizations and BART operating as a Joint Trust) to enter into any Agreements to provide such programs; however
2)	Any such Agreements would be reviewed by your Legal department and/or approved by the Board of Directors as necessary;
3)	In the case of the Qualified Program, there appears to be no legal difficulties with the Joint Trust concept;
4)	As to Deferred Compensation, BART has no opposition to a similar Joint Trust, provided such is legally permissible (there seems to be some question concerning BART being required to hold the Contract) or, as an alternate procedure, a format could be instituted to allow the Committee to effectively exercise authority over the Plan operation and funds;
188
SEIU 2005-2009
5)	The Committee would meet at least quarterly on District time, and on such special occasions as necessary to administer the Plans, although no paid time off would be authorized for individual members of the Committee acting independently;
6)	The Committee would also function to review and approve requests for emergency withdrawal of funds due to hardship situations;
7)	Actions by the Committee, unless otherwise specified, would continue to require a 4/5 vote.
8)	Each entity (BART and the four organizations) would designate a Trustee and an alternate Trustee to serve on the Committee meetings (staff could also attend in nonvoting capacities).
9)	The 6.65% annual contribution by BART (on a maximum salary of $29,700) in behalf of each employee would not be costed as a part of the economic package in future collective bargaining between any of the Unions and BART; however, any proposals and increases in such contributions resulting from negotiations could be considered as a part of the economic package offered by BART to represented employees. If the foregoing is also your understanding, and provided the other organizations concur, I suggest that you confirm same in writing so that an appropriate Trust Agreement may be drafted and executed by the involved parties.
Sincerely Yours,
Paul Varacalli

Re: ROLE OF THE BART INVESTMENTS COMMITTEE
Dear Mr. Varacalli:
This is in response to your letter of September 30, 1980 regarding the above referenced subject, and our subsequent discussions at the Committee meetings on October 2, 1980 and October 16, 1980.
With the exception of the changes noted below, your letter accurately reflects my comments to the Committee on September 29, 1980 regarding my understanding of the continuing role of the Committee in the event BART withdraws from Social Security. The noted exceptions are as follows: (Numerical references are to paragraph numbers in your September 30, 1980 letter.)
1) Change "Joint Trust" to "Joint Administrators."
3)	Change "Joint Trust" to "Joint Agreement."
4)	Change "Joint Trust" to "Joint Agreement", and end sentence after word "operation." (In the contemplated Deferred Compensation Plan, BART will be the legal owner of the "funds;" however, I am agreeable to allowing the Committee to direct the administration of these funds subject to more detailed provisions to be included in formal documents.)
8)	Change the first "Trustee" to "Primary Representative" and change "Alternate Trustee" to "Alternate Representative." (These two Representatives would be the only recognized Representatives from each Union/Association for purposes of time off for Committee meetings. Recognized Representatives would be made whole only for time spent
190
SEIU 2005-2009
in Committee meetings which overlaps scheduled work time.)
(Last Paragraph) Change "Trust Agreement" to "Joint Agreement."
With the above noted understandings, and modifications to your September 30, 1980 letter, we are prepared to proceed to conclude the respective Agreements to effectuate a Deferred Compensation Plan, plus an IRS Qualified Plan if employees vote to withdraw from Social Security. Obviously, as you have noted, I must seek the review of our General Counsel and the approval of our Board.
By copy of this letter, all other affected labor organizations are notified accordingly. In addition, each Union/Association is requested to designate in writing its Primary and Alternate Representative to the Committee at the next meeting scheduled at 9:00 a.m. on Friday, November 7, 1980 at LMA Headquarters.
If you have further questions, please let me know.
Sincerely,
Larry Williams

When signed below by the parties, this letter will constitute a Side Letter of Agreement between the parties on the subject of retirement benefits: Employer-paid contribution of One point six hundred twenty seven percent (1.627%). The undersigned Union agrees, as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for employees of the Clerical and Maintenance Subunit that the District will, effective January 18, 1982, cease making the Employer-paid contribution to the PERS miscellaneous member account of One point six hundred twenty seven percent (1.627%) of payroll as required by the provisions of Section 29B of the current collective bargaining agreement and the undersigned agree that, in its place and stead, the District shall make such 1.627% contributions to the District's Money Purchase Pension Plan to be credited to the Individual Accounts in the same manner as other contributions to said Plan on behalf of participating employees. Effective January 18, 1982, Section 29B of the Agreement between the parties effective July 1, 1979 - June 30, 1982 is deleted in consideration of the District's agreement to make the above described 1.627% contributions to the District's Money Purchase Pension Plan from and after January 18, 1982 in the same amount and in the same payment periods and for the same duration as it would have been legally required to make such contributions pursuant to the provisions of Section 29B of the agreement in the absence of this Side Letter of Agreement.
This shall also serve as the required written authorization to amend any applicable agreement relating to the Money Purchase Pension Plan to implement the provisions of this Side Letter of Agreement.
This Side Letter of Agreement shall be deemed part of the collective bargaining agreement between the parties and any dispute regarding its interpretation or application shall be subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the agreement between the parties dated July 1, 1979 - June 30, 1982.

Dear Mr. Waalkens:
The District plans to establish an Electronic Technician (ET) and Transit Vehicle Mechanic (TVM) training program commencing on or about February 1984. The training program shall be composed of two (2) parts: basic training and BART specific training.
Prior to the start of training, the Union shall be provided an opportunity to meet with the training vendor chosen by the District, to include a visit to the vendor's training facility for the purpose of familiarization and orientation. After training has begun, the Union shall be provided copies of periodic reports regarding the status and progress of the overall training program.
Employees selected to participate in the program will be classified as trainees and governed as follows:
A.	Screening and Selection
1.	The District shall establish a screening and selection process to determine those applicants who will be eligible to participate in the training program. Selection criteria and procedures will include written testing and an interview panel evaluation. The academic prerequisites for the positions are as follows: TVM - 9th grade reading comprehension, 9th grade arithmetic; ET - 9th grade reading comprehension, 9th grade algebra. A reference check will be made of prior work performance encompassing dependability, reliability and quality of work. Applicants will be screened and selected on
SEIU 2005-2009
195
the basis of the aforementioned criteria and qualifications.
2.	The District will first review the applications received from BART employees. If the District determines that all positions cannot be filled by qualified applicants from within, it reserves the right to fill some of these positions from outside the District. The District reserves the right to solicit applications from persons outside the District at the same time as from District employees.
3.	In accordance with the District's policy of upward mobility, District employee(s) rejected from this program may request an interview with a District representative as to the specific reasons for their rejection. Such requests shall be honored by the District for the purpose of assisting those employee(s) who may want to enhance their qualifications in order to be considered for future training programs.
B.	Trainee Status
The following terms and conditions shall be applicable to trainees:
1.	Trainees shall be paid at seventy-five percent (75%) of the TVM or ET entry level Step One (1) rate. A District employee selected whose present salary is higher than the seventy-five percent (75%) entry level rate shall be "red-circled". Said trainees shall be paid their existing salary and will not receive pay increases which would otherwise be granted to a person in the employee's classification until such time as he/she successfully completes the program. Any pay increases granted at that time shall not be retroactive. Trainees will be carried in Cost Center 421 while in the training program.
2.	Vacation leave shall accrue but shall not be permitted while an employee is participating in the training program, unless specifically approved by the District's Training Division. Trainees will be permitted to
196
SEIU 2005-2009
observe fixed District holidays. However, floating holidays shall not be permitted while an employee is participating in the Training Program.
3.	Trainees are prohibited from bidding on other District positions while participating in this Training Program.
4.	As a condition of participating in this training program, all trainees must sign an agreement that upon successful completion of the program they will work for BART in the capacity in which he/she was trained (TVM or ET) for at least three (3) years, or reimburse the District on a pro rata basis for training costs incurred. (See attached Agreement).
5.	Electronic Technician trainees who successfully complete the Basic Training Program shall be given the opportunity to select the BART Specific Training area (Rolling Stock, Communications and Component Repair, Power and Way) to the extent feasible.
6.	Upon successful completion of the training, trainees will be placed in entry level Step One (1) TVM and ET positions which are available at the completion of training and the bidding process. Such trainees will be paid at the Step One (1) TVM or ET rate as applicable.
7.	Trainees shall have no seniority/bidding rights while in training. However, upon successful completion of training and placement into an available position, trainees will enter into a ninety (90) day probationary period. Upon successful completion of the ninety (90) day probationary period classification seniority will be retroactive to the initial date of entry into entry level TVM or ET classification.
8.	Trainees shall not be placed in the Maintenance subunit until such time as they successfully complete the training program.
9.	Probation for trainees starts on the date of their placement in an entry level Step One (1) position, and
SEIU 2005-2009
197
they shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the UPE Local 790 Labor Agreement.
10.	While in their probationary period, trainees may bid for shifts, locations, and RDO's using the Advance Bid Form Procedure. However, no changes in the trainees' shifts, locations, or RDOs shall be implemented until after successful completion of the probationary period.
11.	Trainees shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the UPE Local 790 Labor Agreements to the extent that those provisions are not in conflict with this Side Letter. In the event of a conflict this Side Letter shall be controlling.
12.	Should a trainee who was a BART employee prior to placement in the training program be unsuccessful in completing the training program and/or the probationary period, as determined by the District, he/she shall have reversion rights to bump back into his/her previously held classification without loss of seniority within the maintenance/clerical subunit.
13.	Should a trainee who was not a BART employee prior to placement in the training program be unsuccessful in completing the training program and/or the probationary period, as determined by the District, he/she shall be terminated from employment.
When signed below by the parties and approved by the District's Board of Directors and the membership of United Public Employees Union Local 790, this will become a Side Letter of Agreement between the District and United Public Employees Union Local 790, and will govern the terms and conditions of employment of the trainees in the training class.

In consideration for BART's acceptance of EMPLOYEE in the Electronic Technician and Transit Vehicle Training Program, EMPLOYEE agrees as follows:

Mr. M. E. Waalkens, President
United Public Employees, Local 790
522 Grand Avenue
Oakland, CA 94610
Dear Mr. Waalkens:
In August, 1990 the Board of Directors approved a step progression pay plan for professional employees represented by UPE Local 790. The pay plan was approved retroactive to January 1, 1990. The pay plan calculations include the three (3) percent contractual increase effective on July 1, 1990.
The major components of the new pay plan are:
*	the plan incorporates minimum and maximum of current Staff Assistant rates.
*	five percent intervals between grades and three percent intervals between steps.
*	flexibility in setting salaries upon appointment.
*	movement through the steps is based annually on satisfactory performance.
*	flexibility in reallocating classifications to proper grades based on labor market conditions and classification of work.
*	employees whose salaries exceed the top step of their allocated paygrade will be "red-circled" and will continue to receive contractual increases.
*	morale and labor relations problems will be minimized.
SEIU 2005-2009
203
Each employee was allocated to the next highest step immediately above their current salary in the assigned grades. Retroactive adjustments have been processed for all eligible employees covered by this new pay plan. Employees were "red-circled" if their salaries exceeded the top of the assigned grade (new employees will be appointed to the proper grade and step within the grade).
Employees will be eligible for a step increase on January 1, 1991 if the following conditions are met:
(1)	the employee was placed in the new pay plan effective January 1, 1990:
(2)	the employee's classification has not changed since January 1, 1990, and;
(3)	the employee's current salary is not at step 5 or "red-circled".
New employees who were hired after January 1, 1990 will be eligible for their next step increase one year after their hire date.
Movement between the steps is on an annual basis, on the anniversary date, based on a satisfactory written performance evaluation by the employee's supervisor and it is not automatic.
Employees will be eligible for a step increase only if their overall performance for the review period is rated "meets criteria".
The performance evaluation must be submitted to the Employee Relations Department for review and approval before they are processed.
When signed below, this Side Letter of Agreement will remain in effect for the life of the current Agreement.

In the event of a breach by the EMPLOYEE of the foregoing obligation, EMPLOYEE shall reimburse BART for the cost of training EMPLOYEE as an Elevator/Escalator Worker. EMPLOYEE shall pay BART the sum of $400.00 per month for each month remaining between the date of EMPLOYEE's voluntary termination and the end of the three (3) year period referred to above.
Such reimbursement shall be calculated by multiplying the monthly sum set forth above by the months remaining. For the purposes of the Agreement, if EMPLOYEE voluntarily terminates his/her employment between the first and fifteenth of the month, that month shall be included in the reimbursement calculation. If EMPLOYEE voluntarily terminates his/her employment on or after the sixteenth of the month, that month shall be excluded from the reimbursement calculation.
BART and EMPLOYEE both agree that the amount established hereunder as liquidated damages is reasonable at the time of execution of this Agreement and that BART may seek to enforce this Agreement in any court of
SEIU 2005-2009
215
competent jurisdiction without first exhausting any administrative remedies which may be available to BART.
If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the remaining provision shall nevertheless continue in full force without being impaired or invalidated in any way.
Executed at Oakland, California on the day and year first above written.

Subject: Addendum to SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT: SEIU/6-4
Elevator/Escalator Trainees Pay Rates
Dear Mr. Kaczor:
The current Side Letter of Agreement for Elevator/Escalator Trainees (SEIU/6-4) specifies that the rate of pay for this group of employees will be ninety percent (90%) of the Elevator/Escalator Worker entry level Step One (1) rate. Section 28.4 of the recently negotiated agreement eliminated “entry” level rates of pay and step progression effective July 1, 1997 and implemented progression rates based on longevity. The pay progression rates based on longevity are 76.5%, 79.5%, 85%, 90% and 100% based on one year intervals from the hire/anniversary date. In order to implement the newly negotiated pay progression rates, Trainees will be slotted into the Maintenance Worker lll (MWlll) rates that correspond to their longevity with the District but, as the current Side Letter of Agreement specifies, at the ninety percent (90%) rate of pay. This ninety percent (90%) rate will remain in effect until such time as the Trainee completes and passes the course as required. Further, those employees that were “red circled” will also be slotted into the corresponding rate of pay based on their longevity. No other changes to this Side Letter of Agreement are effected.
When signed below by the parties this will become an addendum to the Side Letter of Agreement SEIU/6-4 and will govern the terms of the pay adjustment of the employees in the training program.

SUBJECT: CAD DRAFTERS
Dear Mr. Kaczor:
A desk audit was conducted on the CAD Drafter positions in Drafting and Configuration Control. The desk audit determined that the positions are properly classified as CAD Drafters.
A market survey was conducted on the CAD Drafter classification. The survey determined that a salary adjustment of five percent (5%) is appropriate to bring the BART salary closer to the market 75th percentile. The five percent (5%) salary adjustment is retroactive to April 30, 1997. On April 30, 1997, the then hourly base rate of pay for CAD Drafters was $21.7837 per hour. The five percent (5%) salary adjustment will result in a new hourly base rate of pay of $22.8728 on April 30, 1997.
As a result of the five percent (5%) salary adjustment on April 30, 1997, the base rates of pay in Section 28.4 Base Wage Schedule of the 1997 - 2001 Labor Agreement for the CAD Drafter classification (Engineering Aide III pay grade) have been revised. The revised Base Wage Schedule for Engineering Aide III is reflected in the attachment.

SIDE LETTER OF AGREEMENT: FSA SEIU/SL 6-7
PART A:	Parties
The parties to this side letter are SEIU Local 790 (hereinafter “SEIU” or “Union”) and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (hereinafter “District”).
PART B:	Background
1.	The parties are signatories to a 1997-2001 collective bargaining agreement (hereinafter “1997-01 Agreement”) covering members of the certified SEIU bargaining unit.
2.	The 1997-2001 Agreement does not provide Medical Premium Conversion, Medical Spending Accounts (hereinafter “MSA’s”), or Dependent Care Accounts (hereinafter “DCA’s”). Medical Premium Conversion, MSA’s and DCA’s are hereinafter jointly referred to as the “Program.” They are mechanisms through which employee health insurance premium contributions, qualified medical expenses not covered by insurance, and qualified expenses incurred by employees to care for certain dependents may be exempted from certain taxes.
3.	The parties wish to offer the Program to members of the SEIU bargaining unit. However, to ensure efficient administration, the District is prepared to do so at this time only if all District bargaining units simultaneously agree to participate on the same terms.
4.	The District and its unions established a joint labormanagement committee to identify and recommend a vendor to provide certain administrative services related to the implementation and management of the Program.
5.	The District will perform certain administrative functions it deems reasonable and necessary related to implementation of the Program not performed by the vendor (e.g. Program communications, creation of general ledger records needed to independently validate
SEIU 2005-2009
221
enrollment, etc.). For cost estimate and fee calculation purposes, the parties have initially agreed to assume that these functions will require one and one-half full-time equivalent positions, including an SA III H1 (payroll) and a Clerk III (benefits).
6.	The District will enjoy some savings as a result of the implementation of the Program. However, the District is not a participant in the non-Medicare portion of the federal Social Security program and will, therefore, not enjoy much of the savings that employers who participate fully in Social Security enjoy when implementing the same program.
7.	The fact that the District will not enjoy reduced Social Security costs but will incur substantial expenses means that other revenues must be generated if the Program is to be implemented at no net cost to the District.
8.	The joint labor-management committee has discussed methods of funding the District’s net program related expenses.
9.	The joint labor-management committee has recommended adoption of an initial monthly fee that each District employee enrolled in its medical insurance programs will be charged to defray the District’s projected net cost of administering the Program.
10.	The Union concurs with the joint labor-management committee’s recommendation.
11.	The parties acknowledge that the monthly rate may be a mandatory subject of bargaining. However, the parties desire that employees pay the same rate on a Districtwide basis insofar as possible that will cover the actual net cost to the District of administrative functions performed in administration of the Program.
The parties agree as follows:
PART C:	Exchange of Promises and Obligations
222
SEIU 2005-2009
Section 1.	PROGRAM INITIATION AND TERMINATION. The District shall establish the details of the Program effective January 1, 2001. The “Program” consists of three parts: Medical Premium Conversion, Medical Spending Accounts and Dependent Care Accounts. The District may terminate the Program or any of its parts if, in the District’s judgment, the Program or part no longer meets the requirements of law or does not qualify for tax-exempt treatment.
Section 2.	OPEN ENROLLMENT. The District shall establish an open enrollment period for the program to occur either separately or at the same time as other District open enrollment processes. In any event, the open enrollment period shall occur prior to January 1, 2001 and once per year thereafter.
Section 3.	TERMINATION FROM THE PROGRAM. Employees who terminate from District employment (through retirement or otherwise) or who are placed on inactive status shall be permitted to continue to participate in the Program only in accordance with the terms of the Program and applicable federal and state law. Employees who are terminated from the Program during a given plan year and who are rehired during that same plan year shall be permitted to re-enroll in accordance with the terms of the Program and applicable federal and state law, but in no event later than the next following open enrollment period for the Program. Employees on inactive status include those who have exhausted their available sick leave, vacation leave, holiday leave and available compensatory time off and who are on unpaid leaves of absence or eligible for short or long-term disability or Industrial Accident payments.
Section 4.	CHARGE TO EMPLOYEES FOR DISTRICT’S NET ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. Subject to Section 5 below, each employee in the SEIU bargaining unit enrolled in a District medical insurance plan shall be charged two dollars and eighty-two cents ($2.82) each month to defray the District’s net District-wide cost for functions it performs that are reasonably necessary to administer and account for the Program. This amount shall be deducted once each month at the last pay date of the month. The
SEIU 2005-2009
223
District shall maintain a record of staff time and other expenses incurred to administer and account for the Program to provide the parties with objective data on which to base discussions conducted pursuant to section 5 below.
Section 5.	REVISIONS TO MONTHLY CHARGE.
A.	Meeting(s) To Discuss Rate. Except as provided in Section 9 below, the parties agree to meet between March 15 and April 1 of each even numbered year beginning in 2002 to discuss possible modification of the monthly charge deducted from employee paychecks pursuant to Section 4 above that will apply for the two years that ensue the following January 1. The parties may propose a modified rate to cover the ensuing two-year period, or may propose separate rates for each of the two ensuing two years. If after ten (10) days from the date of such meeting the parties are unable to reach an agreement on the amount of such charge(s) for the ensuing two year period, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration pursuant to Section 6 below. However, if the parties agree on a modified rate structure or to continue the pre-existing rate structure prior to issuance of an arbitration award, the arbitration request shall be withdrawn or, if the hearing has begun, the hearing shall be terminated and the arbitrator shall not issue an award.
B.	Access To Information. During the meeting(s) described in subsection A of this section, each party agrees to share with the other the data and assumptions that form the basis of the party’s proposed rate structure. The parties additionally agree that during the period beginning January 15 immediately preceding the first such meeting and ending with the establishment of a revised rate pursuant to this section, each shall provide the other with such information as is reasonably necessary and reasonably within their control to carry out their respective roles in the discussions and any impasse resolution proceedings carried out pursuant to section 6 below. If the parties are unable to reach agreement on a revised fee structure, the arbitrator appointed pursuant to section 6 below shall resolve all disputes concerning an alleged breach of this subsection during the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the hearing date established
224
SEIU 2005-2009
pursuant to section 6 below. The party that desires resolution of such a dispute shall petition the arbitrator by letter with a copy to the other side. The arbitrator shall consult simultaneously with the parties’ respective representatives and thereafter issue an order resolving the dispute.
Section 6.	ARBITRATION OF MONTHLY CHARGE.
A.	Scheduling the Hearing Date. On the regular business day nearest to January 10 of calendar years in which the parties will meet to discuss possible revisions to charges pursuant to Section 5 above, the parties shall select an arbitrator in the same manner as for grievance arbitration under the parties’ collective bargaining agreement. The selected arbitrator shall be immediately notified of his or her selection and requested to hold the regular business day nearest to but not before May 1 of the same calendar year open for hearing and resolving a dispute over the appropriate monthly charge pursuant to Section 5 above. The parties shall each submit their last-best offer to the arbitrator and to the other party not later than April 20 preceding the hearing date. Neither party may change their last-best offer after it is submitted unless they receive written permission from the other party.
B.	Hearing. The arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 6(A) above shall conduct a hearing on the date scheduled pursuant to subsection A above of this Section. During the hearing, the arbitrator shall permit each party to present in support of its proposed rate(s) such relevant evidence as it desires concerning the District’s past and anticipated costs and savings incurred as a result of its implementation and on-going operation of the Program. Such costs and savings may include but are not limited to:
1.	Medicare contributions that the District is not required to make because of the tax laws and rules governing the Program;
2.	Any positive and negative employee Medical Spending and Dependent Care Account balances at the end of the plan year;
SEIU 2005-2009
225
3.	Any interest the District may earn on funds in Medical Spending or Dependent Care accounts, if not already accounted for under 2 immediately above.
4.	Charges in excess of or less than actual net District costs incurred to implement and administer the Program during the two-year period to which the rate structure in effect at the time of the hearing applies. For example, for the hearing held in May, 2002 the applicable measurement period is January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2002. Charges considered shall include a reasonable projection of the total that will accrue by the end of the applicable two-year period.
5.	Vendor and consultant charges (including outside counsel) incurred by the District in connection with the implementation and operation of the Program.
Costs for work performed by District employees to implement, operate or account for the Program including, but not limited to, conducting open enrollment, change of status enrollments, and new employee enrollments, inputting enrollment data, processing terminations from the Program, inputting termination data, managing participation of retirees in the program pursuant to COBRA, responding to inquiries from employees or their representatives, preparing and disseminating written Program information to employees or their representatives, downloading data to and from the vendor, analyzing data to be downloaded or that has been downloaded, creating and maintaining transaction records independent of those maintained by the vendor to ensure existence of an independent audit trail.
C.	Arbitrator’s Decision. Within seven (7) days after the hearing, the arbitrator shall award the rate(s) contained in either the District’s or Union’s last-best offer submitted pursuant to subsection A above. Such award shall be based on the evidence produced at hearing and reflect the arbitrator’s opinion concerning the offer that most closely reflects the District’s net district-wide per employee monthly cost for implementing, operating and accounting for
226
SEIU 2005-2009
the Program in the two year period beginning the following January 1, taking into account any substantial overcharges or undercharges that are established by the evidence for the period in which the hearing occurs.
SECTION 7.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This written instrument reflects the entire agreement of the parties. There are no terms or promises related to the subject matter addressed, except as expressed in writing herein.
SECTION 8.	CHANGES TO CONFORM WITH LAW. The District may immediately implement such changes in the Program as, in the District’s judgment, are necessary to ensure that the Program and its parts conform with law and remain tax exempt. The District shall meet with the Union as soon as feasible to discuss the basis for such changes and any alternatives.
SECTION 9.	DURATION. The parties may modify or terminate this agreement at any time by mutual agreement. Otherwise, this agreement shall remain in effect through the life of the 1997-2001 collective bargaining agreement between the parties and the first successor thereto. Upon expiration of said successor agreement but prior to the signing of the next successor agreement, the continuation, modification, or discontinuation of the Side Letter shall be governed by collective bargaining.

A.	Parties
The parties to this Side Letter agreement are SEIU Local 790 ("Union") and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District ("District").
B.	Background
The parties are signatories to a 2001-05 collective bargaining agreement ("CBA"). The District's Rolling Stock and Shops Division ("RS&S") has expressed a desire to assign employees from a particular shop to work on project crews that have a limited duration reflecting the nature of the project work involved. Sections 24.5 and 27.1 of the CBA regulate the filling of work assignments in a manner that is incompatible with the in-shop filling process and the duration of project work contemplated by RS&S. The parties acknowledge that in a given circumstance employees and the District could benefit if these restrictions and other related terms of the contract were waived. The purpose of this agreement is to set forth the terms under which such a waiver could take place.
C.	Promises and Obligations
1.	The District and Union may enter into ad hoc agreements that waive application of the terms of sections 24.2, 24.3, 24.4, 24.5, 24.8 and 27.1 of the CBA when the Manager of RS&S desires to create a project crew in a particular shop within RS&S drawn from employees already working in the location at which the work is to be performed.
2.	The ad hoc agreements referred to in 1 above may be entered into by the consent of and shall be in writing and signed by the Union President, the Manager of RS&S and the Labor Relations Manager.
3.	The ad hoc agreements referred to in 1 above shall set forth the starting date for the project and an expiration date for the ad hoc agreement. An ad hoc agreement
SEIU 2005-2009
229
shall not be employed to fill a temporary vacancy as defined in the CBA.
4.	The District may terminate any ad hoc agreement made pursuant to this agreement prior to the expiration date at its discretion by written notice to the union. The parties may also extend the ad hoc agreement in writing to a date certain. Such extension must be signed as provided in 2 above.
5.	Only employees who volunteer for projects covered by an ad hoc agreement as provided herein shall participate in that project. Preference shall be given within a classification in the affected location based on classification seniority.
D. Other Terms
1.	This written document contains the entire agreement between the parties.
2.	This agreement shall be deemed a Side Letter that is part of the 2001-05 CBA.

Dear Mr. Varacalli:
The following is offered as a clarification of Milt Waalkens' letter to me dated September 13, 1976, regarding chief stewards and other Union officials exercising their super seniority rights per Section 20.2 within the UPE Collective Bargaining Agreement.
The chief steward or other Union officers will displace a worker within his/her classification who works the day shift and has Saturday and Sunday as regular days off. The displaced employee must exercise his/her seniority rights in accordance with Section 25.2A. The procedure shall continue until such time as all positions are filled.
This is given to clarify the intent of the parties during contract negotiations and is not an attempt to legally interpret the Agreement.
Please indicate your concurrence by affixing your signature in the space provided below.

Subject: Grounds Workers RDO’s
Dear Mr. Waalkens:
At the request of SEIU Local 790, Irene Borcover as Manager of OAFM, has established a verbal agreement of allowing ground workers, on a per Line basis, to have their RDO’s on Saturday and Sunday, if the work for that Line was satisfactory as determined by management. When a Line was inspected by management and it was not considered satisfactory by management the employees were placed back on RDO’s as determined by management. SEIU Local 790 has requested we place our verbal agreement in writing.
The parties agree that RDO’s for grounds workers will be scheduled according to the following procedure:
1.	The grounds workers scheduled RDO’s for each Line in the District will initially be Saturday and Sunday. Management will do an inspection for each Line in the District. If the work is not satisfactory as determined by management, for any Line, the employees on that Line will be given a two week notice and another inspection will be completed. If the work is not satisfactory as determined by management after the notice the employees on that Line will be taken off the Saturday and Sunday RDO’s.
2.	In a situation where grounds workers on a particular Line have been taken off the Saturday and Sunday RDO’s, they will only be reconsidered for Saturday and Sunday RDO’s when management has completed a subsequent
SEIU 2005-2009
253
inspection and given them a satisfactory evaluation. Inspections will be performed at least once a quarter.
3.	It is agreed by the parties that when an employee’s RDO’s are changed it does not constitute a Rebid. However, employees will be able to do one Rebid per year, during February, with vacation sign up.
4.	This Memorandum of Understanding is applicable only to grounds workers and will not be applied or utilized in any other District operation or position classification, unless mutually agreed to by the parties.
5.	This Memorandum of Understanding will become effective on the date it is signed by the parties and remain in effect until June 30, 1997.

Dear Mr. Waalkens:
The Parties agree to the following procedure in requiring Class A driver’s license of employees in Track & Structure:

It will then be the responsibility of the employee to obtain the required license.
4.	After the initial implementation, employees or applicants who are applying for designated Class A driver’s license positions will be required to have the Class A driver’s license prior to their appointment. An employee or applicant who obtains the Class A driver’s license and is appointed into a designated position will be reimbursed for the cost of the required physical examination and application fee upon submission of receipts.

Dear Mr. Kaczor:
The Bay Area Rapid Transit District (District) and SEIU Local 790 (Union) agree that holiday staffing at the Oakland NonRevenue Vehicle Shop will be scheduled as follows:
1.	Holiday staffing will include a minimum of two automotive mechanics per shift for a total of six automotive mechanics per holiday.	The maximum number of
maintenance employees that will work on a holiday will be eleven, unless management determines that more employees are needed to work on a particular holiday.
2.	Employees may volunteer to work on a particular holiday, by signing a list showing their interest. If less than two automotive mechanics for each shift volunteer, the least senior automotive mechanic(s) will be required to work that holiday. Once the District has two automotive mechanics scheduled for each shift, up to a maximum of five additional maintenance employees based on seniority, for a total of eleven employees, may work on each holiday.
3.	The Union Chief Steward will provide the Manager at Oakland Non-Revenue Vehicle Shop with a list of volunteers prior to the holiday.

Dear Mr. Kaczor:
The Bay Area Rapid Transit District (District) and Service Employees International Union, Local 790 (SEIU) agree to modify the Oakland Non-Revenue Vehicle Shop Memorandum of Understanding SEIU/MOU 045-8 Holiday Staffing as follows:
1.	Two (2) foreworkers will be added to the minimum number of employees that will be scheduled to work on holidays. The staffing will be two (2) foreworkers (one (1) per shift, four (4) mechanics (two [2] per shift), and six (6) support staff.
2.	The foreworkers will be selected from the shift where the opening occurs. If the foreworker declines to work the holiday, a vehicle mechanic from the shift of the opening will be asked to work as an upgraded foreworker. This selection will be by classification seniority and shift where the opening occurs.
3.	A pool of support staff (machinist, welder, tool room attendant, utility worker and material coordinator) will be established for six (6) positions. One each from machinist, welder, utility worker and material coordinator, and two (2) tool room attendants (one [1] from the graveyard shift and one [1] from the day shift).
4.	Any slot not taken to work will be moved to a second pool. The employees in the second pool will be

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING No. 062-1 (formerly 062-2)
Ms. Roxanne Sanchez
Ms. Sue Angeli
Dear Ms. Sanchez and Ms. Angeli:
This MOU represents the parties agreement as to how the ABF process and RIF language are harmonized within the Maintenance Subunit and the manner in which a reduction in force is otherwise to be carried out within the various subunits of the bargaining unit.
I.	MAINTENANCE SUBUNIT
The reduction in force process will be as follows for those reductions in force initiated in the Maintenance Subunit:
A.	The District will give the Union at least seven (7) days prior notice of any District intention to redline (i.e. freeze) or abolish a position. The District shall also post such notice in accordance with the Advance Bid Form procedure. The District's delivery of such posting to the Union, by fax or otherwise, shall constitute one of the acceptable forms of the notice required under this subsection A.
B.	After seven (7) days the District will conduct a bid in accordance with the ABF within the classification in which the position(s) eliminated in the RIF exist. However, the implementation of such bid may be delayed until employees displaced by the elimination of positions have been laid off or have bumped to other positions, whichever applies.
C.	After the bid is complete employees who have not successfully bid due to insufficient seniority may be given notice of layoff or potential layoff by the District. Such notice may be delivered in person to the employee or by certified mail or courier to the employee's address in the
SEIU 2005-2009
277
employee's file in the Human Resources Department. On the same day it is delivered or sent to the employee the District will deliver a copy of the notice to the Union, by fax, in-person delivery, e-mail, or by certified mail or courier.
D.	Employees who are given a notice of potential layoff will have two business days (M-F, excluding contractual holidays and regular days off) to respond to such notice as instructed in that notice. (Copy of sample notice attached hereto as attachment A).
E.	District representatives, union representatives, and employees receiving notice of potential layoff will meet jointly and promptly after expiration of the second business day referred to above. Such meeting shall be held at a reasonable time and location designated by the District. A "reasonable time and location" takes into account the number of employees affected whose bumping preferences must be simultaneously analyzed, the need to process layoffs in the most expeditious manner possible and the reasonable limitations on the Union's and District's availability. If the Union is not reasonably available, the meeting with the employee will go on without the Union's participation. (Example: if ten (10) employees in the affected subunit receive notice of potential layoff a meeting would normally be held within two (2) business days following the conclusion of the initial two (2) day response period mentioned above. If twenty (20) employees within the affected subunit are being simultaneously processed it would be reasonable to hold two meetings within four (4) business days to process these employees., etc. etc.)
F.	At the meeting(s) described in E above the following steps will occur:
•	First, the employee and/or the Union (if authorized in writing in advance by the employee) will identify those classifications for which the employee or union believes the employee is qualified to bump.
278
SEIU 2005-2009
•	Second, after making such verification inquiries as it deems necessary, the District will identify those classifications for which it believes the employee is qualified to bump.
•	Third, the employee will identify his or her prioritized preferences among the classifications into which the District has determined he or she is qualified to bump and the positions within those classifications for which he or she is eligible subject to the vacancy-first rule under section 25.2.C.1 of the labor agreement and seniority. However, disputes that remain concerning whether an employee is actually qualified to bump into a classification into which he or she or the union has asserted that the employee has the right to bump may be grieved if the employee is denied a preferred bump as a result of such determination.
G.	When the steps in F are concluded and the District is ready to implement such steps, the District may issue additional notices of potential layoff (to be processed in the manner described above), layoff notice (if the affected employee has no remaining bumping options), or a bump notice indicating the position into which the employee will bump, as appropriate.
H.	Once all employees affected by the Reduction in Force have been laid off or bumped, a rebid will be conducted in each classification subject to the ABF except classifications in which the reduction in force process was initiated where a rebid has already taken place.
II.	CLERICAL SUBUNIT (Including Professional Chapter)
The reduction in force process will be as follows for those reductions in force initiated in the Clerical Subunit and Professional Chapter:
A.	The District will give the Union at least seven (7) days prior notice of any District intention to redline (i.e. freeze) or abolish a position when it is contemplating a reduction in force. The District may deliver such notice to the Union by fax or otherwise.
SEIU 2005-2009
279
B.	After the seven (7) days the District may give a notice of layoff or potential layoff to an employee(s) whose positions is being eliminated. Such notice may be delivered in person to the employee or by certified mail or courier to the employee's address in the employee's file in the Human Resources Department. On the same day it is delivered or sent to the employee the District will also deliver a copy of the notice to the Union, by fax, inperson delivery, e-mail, or by certified mail or courier.
C.	Employees who are given a notice of potential layoff will have two business days (M-F, excluding contractual holidays and regular days off) to respond to such notice as instructed in that notice. (Copy of sample notice attached hereto as attachment A).
D. District representatives, union representatives, and employees receiving notice of potential layoff will meet jointly and promptly after expiration of the second business day referred to above. Such meeting shall be held at a reasonable time and location designated by the District. A "reasonable time and location" takes into account the of number of employees affected whose bumping preferences must be simultaneously analyzed, the need to process layoffs in the most expeditious manner possible and the reasonable limitations on the Union's and District's availability. If the Union is not reasonably available, the meeting with the employee will go on without the Union's participation. (Example: if ten (10) employees in the affected subunit receive notice of potential layoff a meeting would normally be held within two (2) business days following the conclusion of the initial two (2) day response period mentioned above. If twenty (20) employees within the affected subunit are being simultaneously processed it would be reasonable to hold two meetings within four (4) business days to process these employees., etc. etc.)
E.	At the meeting(s) described in D above the following steps will occur:
280
SEIU 2005-2009
•	First, the employee and/or the Union (if authorized in writing in advance by the employee) will identify those classifications for which the employee or union believes the employee is qualified to bump.
•	Second, after making such verification inquiries as it deems necessary, the District will identify those classifications for which it believes the employee is qualified to bump.
•	Third, the employee will identify his or her prioritized preferences among the classifications into which the District has determined he or she is qualified to bump and the positions within those classifications for which he or she is eligible in light of seniority. However, disputes that remain concerning whether an employee is actually qualified to bump into a classification into which he or she or the union has asserted that the employee has the right to bump may be grieved if the employee is denied a preferred bump as a result of such determination.
F.	When the steps in E are concluded and the District is ready to implement such steps, the District may issue additional notices of potential layoff (to be processed in the manner described above), layoff notice (if the affected employee has no remaining bumping options), or a bump notice indicating the position into which the employee will bump, as appropriate.
III.	General Provisions
1.	If a conflict arises between an interpretation of this MOU and an interpretation of the labor contract, the interpretation under this MOU shall control. However, nothing herein shall be applied or construed in a manner that impairs the protections provided in section 17.7.C of the 2005-09 agreement.
2.	This MOU represents the entire agreement between the parties regarding this subject matter and supercedes any other such previous agreements addressing this subject
SEIU 2005-2009
281
matter. Any amendments must be in writing and executed by both parties.
3.	This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the District and the Union is binding on the parties, effective September 4, 2002.

NOTICE OF POTENTIAL LAYOFF - PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND DELIVER RESPONSE BY THE STATED DEADLINE
Dear _____________(Employee):
As you know the District(general factors precipitating the layoff). For that reason, the District has no alternative but to further reduce its workforce. The District tentatively believes that your position may be eliminated or that an employee with greater seniority may bump you from it.
To evaluate your bumping options, the District needs information concerning your qualifications and preferences so that it may properly implement the coming reduction in force. The enclosed forms are intended for that purpose. You may wish to contact your union representative for assistance in understanding, evaluating, and responding to these forms and the information they contain as it may apply to you. Once the District has this information, the Human Resources Department and the Union will analyze and determine your bumping options, if any. When this is concluded, you will receive a layoff notice (if you have no bumping options) or a notice informing you of the position into which you will bump in light of your seniority and preferences.
If you are terminated, you will be advised of the effective date, payroll information, and of resources available to assist you as you prepare to search for other employment. If a bump is involved, you will be advised of your new position, hours, supervisor and report location.
A meeting has been scheduled for (time) in (location) on (date). You are directed to attend this meeting. At that time your union
SEIU 2005-2009
283
representative will assist you in evaluating the enclosed information and forms as they apply to you. While at that meeting you will complete and sign the forms, along with your Union representative. These forms will then be reviewed for seniority and MQ's by Employment representatives who will then verify the qualifications and inform the employee of the position they have bumped.
Failure to properly complete the form or to turn them into the union at the meeting will adversely affect your employment options. If you are unable to attend this meeting due to illness or other emergency, your union representative may complete the form, sign, date and return it on your behalf. They will only do this if you notify one of them in advance of your desire that this be done. However, you will be bound by the union's actions.
Thank you for your continued patience and service in this difficult time.
Sincerely,
Department Manager

Please carefully follow the instructions for filling out this form. Failure to do so, or failure to return it to your union representative as stated in the notice of reduction in force/potential layoff may adversely affect your employment opportunities at BART.
The job classifications listed on page 2 are ones for which you appear to meet the minimum qualifications, based on information contained in your personnel file maintained by the Human Resources Department. Attached are the minimum qualifications and job titles for all jobs within your sub-unit (clerical or maintenance). Please review these and add any to the below list for which you believe you are qualified. If you add to the list, you must also establish that you have the qualifications that you claim. You may do so by relying on the information already in your Human Resources Department file. You may also attach additional documentation (e.g. diplomas, certificates, names of prior employers and jobs held, etc.) to your response. However, you must submit any documentation you wish to submit by the below deadline. Diplomas, certificates and other documentation must be verifiable.
When you have added any additional classifications you wish to add to the list, please fill out the preference information on page 3 of this form. This form must be completed, signed, dated, returned to your union representative at the meeting described in the notice of reduction in force/layoff you received. You are encouraged to deliver your response in person. Mailed responses that arrive after the delivery deadline will not be accepted.
Employees who deliver their responses in time will at the time of delivery be given a copy of the response, signed as received and dated by the Human Resources Department representative in attendance at the meeting. Employees who fail to respond by the deadline or who claim to have responded but who do not have a receipt will be deemed to qualify only for those classifications listed in the letter they received from the District.
Employees are encouraged to complete this form personally. However, if you are unable to respond for some reason, the

Re: Memorandum of Understanding: SEIU/MOU 063-3 Hayward “Back Shop” Probationary Period Reversion
Dear Ms. Sanchez:
Service Employees International Union, Local 790 and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District agree that the Hayward “Back Shop” is different in the maintenance work performed than the Service and Inspection area of the Hayward Shop. To that end the Union and the District agree:
1.	Section 26.2 promotion within the bargaining unit is applicable except that an employee who bids to the Back Shop via the Advance Bid Procedure may be returned by the District to their former position during 80 day probationary period that applies to the Back Shop position (or during any extension of such probationary period agreed upon under no. 5 below) if the employee fails to qualify based on the evaluation(s) of the relevant Employee Development Specialist.
2.	This “forced” reversion in no way will disqualify the reverted employee from future Advanced Bids into the Back Shop if the employee qualifies through some form of learning that will demonstrate knowledge sufficient to complete the probationary period satisfactorily.
3.	Any provision of the 2001-2005 Master Agreement by which the terms of this MOU conflict or are inconsistent shall be deemed waived for purposes of this MOU.
290
SEIU 2005-2009
4.	This Memorandum of Understanding will remain in full force and effect for the life of the present Agreement (2001-2005).
5.	The parties may on a case by case basis and without precedent agree to extend the probationary period beyond the initial 80 days to a combined maximum of 180 days to permit a better evaluation of the employee’s ability to do the job. All agreements to extend the probationary period must be in writing and entered into in advance of the expiration of the probationary period by the Chief Steward, the Manager over the Back Shop or his/her designee, and the Labor Relations Manager and his or her designee.
6.	This written MOU is the entire MOU between the parties. There are no promises, terms or conditions between the parties not expressed herein in writing.

Memorandum of Understanding: SEIU 062-2
A. Parties
The parties to this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) are the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (“District”) and SEIU Local 790 (“Union”).
B.	Background
The parties are signatories to a 2001-05 collective bargaining agreement (“2001-05 agreement”). The District has recently experienced a reduction in force (“RIF”). A number of employees that were in the Union’s bargaining unit were laid off during the FY03 RIF. The parties have met with the State Employment Development Department (“EDD”) to discuss resources available for retraining workers who have been laid off. The EDD has identified funds available to retrain workers who have been laid off. The available funding can only be utilized to retrain currently laid off workers, and cannot be used to retrain currently employed workers. Workers who have been laid off who are placed in programs funded by such funding must be maintained in that program until the normal conclusion of their training. The parties mutually desire to mitigate the adverse effect that continued unemployment has on District employees who have been laid off. Therefore, they have adopted the following mutual understandings regarding the manner in which the 2001-05 agreement would apply to permit the placement in the elevator-escalator training program of laid off workers who have not been recalled.
C.	Mutual Understandings
The parties mutually understand that:
1.	Employees who have been laid off from District employment and remain unemployed by the District may be offered vacant and available positions in the elevatorescalator training program before such positions are offered to active District employees; provided that such
292
SEIU 2005-2009
laid off employees must pass all tests and otherwise meet the qualifications for participation in the program.
2.	If such a laid off employee declines an offer of employment in such a training position it shall not affect the employee’s continuing recall rights under the agreement. However, no further offer of entry into the elevator-escalator training program shall be made while the employee is in inactive status.
3.	If the laid off employee is offered such a training program position, and if he or she earned a wage rate higher than the 90% of Maintenance Worker III trainee rate at the time of layoff, he or she shall be paid the higher rate while in the training program rather than the 90% trainee rate. However, the employee will not be entitled to across the board wage increases that occur prior to the normal conclusion of their training. Instead, they shall move to the then current MWIII rate upon conclusion of their training.
4.	Until the normal conclusion of their training, such employees shall not be considered in any bumping process. They shall not be subject to being bumped from and shall not be permitted to bid out of the trainee position or accept an offer pursuant to listing on an eligibility pool list or other application and selection procedures.
D. Other Terms
1.	The terms of this agreement shall not establish a precedent for the manner in which the 2001-05 labor agreement applies in other circumstances.
2.	If any conflict or inconsistency arises between any term of this M.O.U. and any term of the 2001-05 agreement, the terms of this M.O.U. shall prevail. Except to the extent of such inconsistency or conflict, the terms of the 2001-05 agreement shall otherwise govern the terms of participation in and withdrawal from the elevatorescalator training program for trainees entering the program pursuant to this M.O.U.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING: SEIU/MOU 063-5=
Ms. Roxanne Sanchez
President/BART Chapter
Service Employees International Union, Local 790 100 Oak Street
Oakland, CA 94607
Subject: Holiday Staffing in Oakland Non-Revenue Vehicle Shop, replacing MOU 045-8 dated July 18, 1996 as amended by an Addendum dated February 13, 2001 that resolved Arbitration #726-94 and resolving Grievances #02-6-116 and #02-6-033
Dear Ms. Sanchez:-
A.	PARTIES
This Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter “MOU”) is between the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (hereinafter “District”) and the Service Employees International Union Local 790 (hereinafter “Union”). The parties agree as follows:
B.	BACKGROUND
The parties are signatories to a 2001-05 collective bargaining agreement. That agreement sets forth certain terms and conditions of employment applicable to employees in the bargaining unit represented by the Union.
On July 18, 1996, the District and Union reached settlement on the holiday staffing in the Oakland Non-Revenue Shop as part of arbitration #724-94. The settlement was reflected in SEIU/MOU-045-8. On February 13, 2001, the District and the Union agreed to an addendum to SEIU/MOU-045-8 on the holiday staffing.
The Union filed a grievance (LR#02-6-116) on September 10, 2002 regarding the District’s alleged violation of
SEIU 2005-2009
295
SEIU/MOU-045-8 and the addendum thereof. The dispute was scheduled for arbitration on March 9, 2005. Prior to the arbitration, the parties tentatively agreed to settle grievances LR#02-6-116 and LR#02-6-033 under conceptual terms that were to be further reduced to specific terms that are now reflected in the language of this MOU. That language reflects the parties’ agreement to combine SEIU/MOU-045-8, the addendum and the resolution of grievances LR#02-6-116 and LR#02-6-033 into one new MOU-063-5.
C.	TERMS OF AGREEMENT
The District and Union agree that holiday staffing at the Oakland Non-Revenue Vehicle Shop will be scheduled as follows:
1.	The maximum number of maintenance employees that will work on a holiday that falls on a regular workday (non-RDOs) will be twelve (12), unless management determines that more employees are needed to work on a particular holiday.
2.	If a holiday falls on an employee’s RDO, the employee will not be scheduled to work. If a holiday does not fall on an employee’s RDO, the number of maintenance employees scheduled to work will not exceed the number normally scheduled to work the holiday. For example, Saturday is currently a RDO for the day shift. If the holiday falls on a Saturday, no employee will be scheduled to work the day shift. However, three (3) employees are currently scheduled to work the graveyard shift on Saturday. No more than three (3) employees will be scheduled to work the graveyard shift.
3.	The foreworkers will first be selected from the shift where the opening occurs. If all foreworkers decline to work the holiday, a vehicle mechanic from the shift of the opening will be asked to work as an upgraded foreworker. This selection will be by classification seniority and shift where the opening occurs.
4.	A pool of support staff (machinist, welder, tool room attendant, utility worker and material coordinator) will be established: One each from machinist, welder, utility worker and material coordinator, and one (1) tool room attendant
296
SEIU 2005-2009
5.	Employees may volunteer to work on a particular holiday, by signing a list showing their interest. However, employees whose RDOs fall on a holiday may not volunteer to work on the holiday unless there is an insufficient number of volunteers who normally are scheduled to work that day.
6.	If there are an insufficient number of volunteers, the District may inversely assign employees within their functional classification to work the holiday.
7.	The Union Chief Steward will provide the Manager at Oakland Non-Revenue Vehicle Shop with a list of volunteers prior to the holiday.
8.	This MOU will stay in effect for the life of the current negotiated Agreement. It may be extended by mutual agreement of the District and the Union.
D. PAYMENT
The parties agree that three (3) Automotive and Equipment Mechanics will be paid a total of ten (10) holidays at double time at the pay rate in effect on July 1, 2002. These three (3) employees would normally have worked the Monday holiday on the graveyard shift. The three (3) employees are Ray Quan, Robert Lewis and William Gamble. This represents the full payment settlement for grievances LR#02-6-116 and LR#02-6-033.
