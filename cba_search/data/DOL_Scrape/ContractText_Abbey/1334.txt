(8)	If any Employee covered by this Agreement knowingly cooperates with any Individual Employer to defeat the payment of wages and fringe benefits as required by this Agreement, said employee will be liable for such penalties as may be determined by the Board of Adjustment as outlined in Section 5.
(9)	It Is the intent of the parties hereto that the provisions of this subcontracting clause be applied only to the extent permitted by law.
(10)	Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the provisions of this subcontracting clause shall not be enforced by strike or job action.
3
(11)	The above provisions notwithstanding, in the event an Individual Employer subcontracts work covered by this Agreement to a subcontractor who is not signatory to this Agreement or an appropriate agreement with the Union, the Individual Employer shall assume an additional responsibility as follows:
If the subcontractor shall be found in violation of the Hiring provisions of this Agreement, pursuant to Section 5 and the Union is unable to collect the liability determined to be owing for such violation from the subcontractor, the Individual Employer shall then become liable for the payment of such liability.
