This Agreement is made and entered into this day of, 2005, by and between the
State of Minnesota, hereinafter referred to as the EMPLOYER, and the Minnesota AFSCME Council 5, AFL-CIO, and its affiliated Local Unions, and unless otherwise noted in this Agreement, "UNION" hereinafter refers to the Minnesota AFSCME Council 5, AFL-CIO. This Agreement has as its purpose the promotion of harmonious relations between the parties; the establishment of an equitable and peaceful procedure for the resolution of differences; and the establishment of rates of pay, hours of work, and other conditions of employment; and to express the full and complete understanding of the parties pertaining to all terms and conditions of employment.
If the parties mutually agree during the term of this Agreement, this Agreement may be supplemented by such additional provisions relating to departmental issues as the parties to this Agreement deem appropriate. Failure of the parties to reach such supplemental agreement shall not be subject to the impasse procedures as set out in the Minnesota Public Employment Labor Relations Act.
Any agreement which is to be included as a part of this Agreement must so indicate, must be reduced to writing, and must be signed by the parties to this Agreement.

Section 2.	Disputes. The assignment of newly created classes to a bargaining unit or the reassignment of existing classes to a different bargaining unit shall be subject to the determination of the Director of the Bureau of Mediation Services in accord with the provisions of the Minnesota Public Employment Labor Relations Act.
Disputes which may occur over the inclusion or exclusion of new or changed job positions shall be referred to the Bureau of Mediation Services for expedient resolution. The decision of the Bureau of Mediation Services shall prevail during or pending any appeal(s) from such decision.
Section 3.	Union Exclusivity. The Employer will not, during the life of this Agreement, meet and confer or meet and negotiate with any individual employees or with any other employee organization with respect to the terms and conditions of employment of the employees covered by this Agreement except through the Union or its authorized representatives. The Employer will not assist or otherwise encourage any other employee organization which seeks to bargain for employees covered by this Agreement.

Section 1.	Checkoff. The Employer shall deduct the bi-weekly membership dues from the earnings of those employees who authorize such deductions in writing. The Union shall submit such authorizations and certify the amounts to be deducted at least seven (7) days prior to the end of the payroll period for which the deductions are to be effective and the deductions shall continue in effect until canceled by the employee through the Union. The aggregate deductions of all employees, together with a detailed record, shall be remitted to the Union office within ten (10) days after such deductions are made.
Section 2.	Exclusivity. No other employee organization shall be granted payroll deduction of dues for employees covered by this Agreement.
Section 3.	Employee Lists. The Employer shall report to the Union the information on all employees added to or removed from the bargaining unit(s) in the seniority unit(s). The report shall be made on a bi-weekly payroll period basis and shall be transmitted no later than one (1) week following the end of each payroll period.
Upon the request of the Union, the Employer shall provide the Union with a listing of all employees in the bargaining units represented by the Union.
Section 4.	Indemnity. The Union agrees to indemnify and hold the Employer harmless against any and all claims, suits, orders, or judgments brought or issued against the Employer as a result of any action taken or not taken as a result of a request of the Union under the provisions of this Article including fair share deductions and remittances.
Section 5.	Bargaining Unit Security. Upon the request of the Local Union, the Appointing Authority shall provide the Local Union general information on the use of non-employee labor.
ARTICLE 4	- SENIORITY

A.	State Seniority. "State Seniority" is defined as the length of employment with the State of Minnesota since the last date of hire.
B.	Classification Seniority. For employees in classes in Units 2, 3, and 7, "Classification Seniority" is defined as the length of service in a job classification with the State of Minnesota, beginning with the date an employee begins to serve a probationary appointment.

1.	Bumping, Demotions, Transfers. Classification Seniority in a class to which an employee bumps, demotes or transfers shall include Classification Seniority in all higher or equal related classes in positions represented by the Union or in confidential positions. The employee may use such related class Classification Seniority to exercise a bump, transfer or demotion in lieu of layoff.
2.	Reallocations. Classification Seniority for employees whose positions are reallocated to a lower or equal class after January 1, 1980, shall include service in the class from which they were reallocated, regardless of whether or not the higher or equal class is a "related" class in accord with "E" below.
2
3.	Trainee and Provisional Appointments. Employees on a trainee or a provisional appointment, shall have Classification Seniority credited to the date of hire at the time an employee begins to serve a probationary period in a related classification.
4.	Temporary Appointments. Effective July 23, 1985, an employee who serves a temporary appointment in a class and receives a probationary appointment to that class shall have Classification Seniority credited to the beginning of the temporary appointment provided there was no break in service between the appointments. For employees hired after November 18, 2005, seniority shall include those situations where the employee serves a temporary appointment followed by an emergency appointment in the same classification with no break in service between appointments.
5.	Trial Period and Non-certification. An employee who returns to a former class under the conditions of Article 12, Section 10 E or F shall accrue seniority as if continually employed in the former class.
C.	Forfeiture and Interruptions. Seniority shall be forfeited when an employee separates from State employment. Time on the layoff list or an approved leave of absence is not a separation. Classification Seniority shall include all service in confidential position(s) but shall exclude service in positions not represented by the Union.
D.	Seniority Units. "Seniority Unit" is defined as all employees in bargaining units represented by the Union in each agency as listed in Appendix G.
E.	Related Classes. "Related Classes" are those classes which are similar in the nature and character of the work performed and which require similar qualifications.
Section 2.	Seniority Earned Under Previous Collective Bargaining Agreements. Employees shall continue to have their seniority calculated as provided for under the 2003-2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement or Memoranda of Understanding except as specifically provided elsewhere in this Agreement.
Section 3. Seniority Rosters. No later than November 30 and May 31 of each year Appointing Authorities shall prepare and post on all employee bulletin boards seniority rosters for each seniority unit and two (2) copies shall be furnished to the Local Union. The rosters shall list each employee in the order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) and reflect each employee's date of Classification Seniority, date of State Seniority, and the date of Classification Seniority and class title for all classes in which the employee previously served. [Note: Classification Seniority dates need not be listed for classes in Units 4 and 6.]
In addition, the Appointing Authority shall list the class options (if any) for which an employee is qualified. If an employee disagrees with the class options listed, the employee shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the posting of the seniority roster to notify the Department of Employee Relations (DOER). DOER shall determine whether the employee meets the minimum qualifications for the class option.
The rosters shall also identify the type of appointment if other than full-time unlimited.
When two (2) or more employees have the same Classification Seniority dates, seniority position shall be determined by State Seniority. Should a tie still exist, seniority shall be determined by length of prior State service. Should a tie still exist, seniority shall be determined by lot.
The rosters shall also include a listing of all employees in Student Worker classifications.
3
Section 4. Appeals. Employees shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the posting or from return to work from a leave of absence of more than fourteen (14) calendar days to notify the Appointing Authority of any disagreements over the Seniority Roster. Appeals are limited to changes since the previous posting. The Appointing Authority may make corrections to the Seniority Roster during the thirty (30) calendar day appeal period. After the close of the thirty (30) calendar day appeal period, the Appointing Authority shall post an addendum of any changes to the Seniority Roster.
Between postings, the Local Union and the Appointing Authority may agree in writing to changes after the appeal period. Such changes shall be incorporated in the next Seniority Roster and be so identified.
ARTICLE 5 - HOURS OF WORK
Section 1.	General.
A.	Consecutive Hours. The regular hours of work each day shall be consecutive except that they may be interrupted by unpaid lunch periods. No split shifts will be implemented without the mutual agreement of the Local Union and the Appointing Authority. Each party may cancel such agreement with thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.
B.	Work Shift. A work shift is defined as a regularly recurring period of work with a fixed starting and ending time, exclusive of overtime work. The Appointing Authority may change the starting or ending times of an existing shift up to and including two (2) hours after providing the notice period required in Section 1(C).
C.	Schedule Posting. Work schedules showing the shifts, days, and hours of all employees shall be posted at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of their effective day. All schedule changes shall require such a fourteen (14) day notice except for the three situations referenced in Section 2B 3 and Section 3B which require a twenty-eight (28) day notice. In addition, employees being returned to work as part of a workers' compensation placement are not entitled to a fourteen (14) day notice.
Employees who are qualified and capable may mutually agree to exchange days, shifts, or hours of work with the approval of their supervisor which shall not be unreasonably denied and provided such change does not result in the payment of overtime.
If requested by the employee, the employee may change days, shifts, or hours of work with the approval of his/her supervisor provided such change does not result in the payment of overtime. A voluntary change of shifts under this section results in the payment of overtime only when it places the employee’s hours of work in excess of those permitted by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
D.	Meal Periods. Employees shall normally be granted an unpaid lunch period of no less than thirty (30) minutes nor more than sixty (60) minutes near the midpoint of each work shift. Employees who are required to remain in a duty status or who are assigned to perform work during meal periods shall be paid for such time at the appropriate rate, straight time or overtime, whichever is applicable.
4
E.	Rest Periods. All employees shall be granted a fifteen (15) minute paid rest period during each four (4) hours of regularly scheduled work. Employees who are scheduled for a shift of four (4) hours and who are scheduled to receive an unpaid meal period shall not be entitled to a rest period. Employees who work beyond their regular quitting time into the next shift shall receive a fifteen (15) minute paid rest period before they start work on the next shift whenever it is anticipated that such work shall require approximately two (2) hours. The Appointing Authority retains the right to schedule employee rest periods to fulfill the operational needs of the various work units. Rest periods may not be accumulated nor be taken at the beginning or end of the employee's shift. With the supervisor's approval, rest periods may be used to extend the meal period.
F.	Reporting Time and Pay. Unless notified otherwise at least two (2) hours in advance of the scheduled starting time (one (1) hour for employees in the Department of Transportation), any employee who is scheduled to report for work and who reports as scheduled shall be assigned to at least three (3) hours of work. If work is not available, the employee may be excused from duty and paid for three (3) hours at the employee's appropriate rate. If the employee begins work but is excused from duty before completing three (3) hours of work the employee shall be paid for three (3) hours at the employee's appropriate rate. (See Article 15, Layoff and Recall, Section 6, Limited Interruption of Employment.)
Section 2.	Non-Continuous and Non-Extended Operations.
A.	Definition. Any employee or group of employees engaged in an operation that is not continuous or extended (as defined in Section 3A) shall be known as non-continuous and nonextended operations employees.

To depart from the normal work day or work week/period, to change the normal work day between an eight (8) and ten (10) hour day, or to change the normal work week between a four (4) and five (5) day week, or to establish a shift that is not currently being used by that Appointing Authority, in the interest of efficient operations, to meet the needs of the public or an Agency, to provide for more beneficial client or student services, or to better use facilities or the working forces, no less than twenty-eight (28) calendar days notice will be given to the Local Union. Upon request, the Appointing Authority will discuss the changes with the Local Union affording it an opportunity to express its views prior to the posting period provided for in Section 1C. When schedules are changed, the new schedule shall be posted pursuant to Section 1C. Existing schedules may continue in effect.
C.	Flextime Scheduling. The Appointing Authority and the Local Union may mutually agree to a flextime scheduling plan. Existing flextime scheduling plans shall remain in effect unless the Local Union notifies the Appointing Authority of its intent to terminate the plan.

Section 3.	Continuous and Extended Operations.
A.	Definitions.
1.	Continuous Operations. Any employee or group of employees engaged in an operation for which there is regularly scheduled employment on a twenty-four (24) hour a day, seven (7) day a week basis shall be known as continuous operations employees.
2.	Extended Operations. Any employee or group of employees engaged in a work operation for which there is regularly scheduled employment for more than the normal work day and/or normal work week as defined in Article 5, Section 2B and who are not continuous operations employees, shall be known as extended operations employees.
B.	Work Day. The normal work day shall consist of eight (8) hours of work within a twenty-four (24) hour period, exclusive of a duty-free lunch period.

When schedules are changed the new schedule shall be posted pursuant to Section 1C. Existing schedules may remain in effect.
C.	Turnaround Time. The number of hours between scheduled shifts shall not be less than seven and one-half (7-1/2) hours. Violations shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half for all hours worked on the shift following the hours of rest.
D.	Work Shift. The provisions of Section 1B shall not apply to rotating shifts.
E.	Daylight Savings Time. Employees required to work more than eight (8) hours on an eight (8) hour shift or more than ten (10) hours on a ten (10) hour shift due to the change from daylight savings time to standard time shall be paid for the additional hour worked at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2). Employees required to work less than eight (8) hours on an eight (8) hour shift or less than ten (10) hours on a ten (10) hour shift due to the change from standard time to daylight savings time shall be paid for the actual hours worked. Employees may use vacation time or compensatory time to make up for the one (1) hour lost. Employees in the first six (6) months of employment who would be eligible to accrue vacation, may be advanced one (1) hour of vacation time which shall either be deducted from their vacation leave balance, or deducted from their last paycheck if the employee is separated prior to accruing vacation.
Section 4.	Part-time Hours.
A.	Reduction of Hours. If it is necessary to reduce the hours of a part-time position such that the incumbent of the position is no longer eligible to receive the full Employer's insurance contribution or is no longer eligible to participate in the Employer's insurance program, the Appointing Authority shall request volunteers for the position from among part-time employees in the same class, employment condition, and work area/principal place of employment. If one or more employees volunteer for the position, the most senior qualified volunteer shall be offered the position. If there are no volunteers, the least senior qualified employee in the same class, employment condition, and work area/principal place of employment shall be assigned to the position.
B.	Additional Hours. When the Appointing Authority assigns additional hours within the fourteen (14) day posting period to part-time employees whose established work day is less than eight
6
(8)	hours to work additional hours on a scheduled day of work, the hours shall be distributed to employees then on duty as provided in the applicable overtime distribution language.
ARTICLE 6 - OVERTIME
Section 1.	Overtime Hours. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all hours worked in excess of the established work day, before or after an employee's regular scheduled shift, or on any regularly scheduled day off, shall be considered overtime.
All paid vacation time, paid holidays, paid sick leave, compensatory time off, and paid leaves of absence shall be considered as "time worked" for purposes of this Article.
Part-time employees whose established work day is less than eight (8) hours shall not be considered to be working overtime until having completed eight (8) hours of work.
Section 2.	Overtime Rates. All overtime hours shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2).
Section 3.	Scheduled Overtime. Scheduled overtime is overtime which is assigned by the end of the employee's last worked shift prior to the overtime assignment and which does not immediately precede or immediately follow a scheduled work shift.
Unless notified otherwise in advance of the scheduled starting time of the scheduled overtime assignment, any employee who is scheduled to report for work and who reports as scheduled shall be assigned at least two (2) hours work. If work is not available, the employee may be excused from duty and paid for two (2) hours at the employee's appropriate rate. If the employee begins work but is excused from duty before completing two (2) hours of work, the employee shall be paid for two (2) hours at the employee's appropriate rate.
Section 4.	Distribution. An effort shall be made to distribute overtime work as equally as possible among employees in the same job class and in the same work area who are capable of performing the work and who desire the overtime work. When practicable and if the supervisor knows an overtime assignment is necessary, he/she shall begin the distribution process at least two (2) hours in advance of the overtime assignment.
The overtime work shall first be offered to the employee(s) then on duty, on the same shift and work area who has the least number of overtime hours to his or her credit. Should the employee choose not to accept the overtime assignment, the employee with the next fewest overtime hours to his or her credit shall be offered the assignment. Offered overtime hours not worked shall be considered as "worked" in calculating the equitable distribution of overtime.
New employees entering the bargaining units shall be credited with the number of overtime hours equal to the highest number of hours to the credit of any current employee in the same class and same work area.
The Appointing Authority shall not be required to cut in on work in progress in order to maintain an equitable balance of overtime.
7
An accumulative record of overtime hours worked or offered each employee shall be made available to the Local Union Representative upon request. The record of each employee's accumulated overtime hours worked and overtime offered but not worked shall be adjusted to zero (0) hours once per year on a date determined by the Appointing Authority. The Appointing Authority shall notify the Local Union of the date within thirty (30) calendar days of the execution of this Agreement, for the term of the Agreement.
In the event all capable employees in the same shift and work area decline overtime work, the Appointing Authority shall have the right to assign overtime based upon inverse order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) among capable employees. In Unit 3, the assignment shall be rotated each pay period beginning with the least senior capable employee based on Classification Seniority. In Unit 4, the assignment shall be rotated each pay period beginning with the least senior capable employee based on State Seniority. In all instances, the overtime work shall first be assigned to employees then on duty if such overtime is for the immediately subsequent shift.
Employees may request not to be offered voluntary overtime by means of a written waiver submitted to the local personnel officer, provided, however, that the Appointing Authority retains the right to assign overtime, in inverse order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) among capable employees in the event that all capable employees decline overtime work. Employees may rescind such waivers upon fourteen (14) calendar days written notice to the local personnel officer.
In emergencies, notwithstanding the terms of this Article, the Appointing Authority may assign someone to temporarily meet the emergency requirements regardless of the overtime distribution.
Section 5.	Liquidation.
A.	General. At the employee's option, overtime hours shall be paid in cash or assigned to a compensatory bank. Employees shall elect whether all overtime hours earned in a day shall be paid in cash or assigned to a compensatory bank. This decision shall be recorded on the timesheet each pay period. Should an employee fail to indicate on the time report, liquidation shall be in cash.
B.	Compensatory Bank.
1.	Size of Bank. The maximum amount of hours that may be in the compensatory bank at any given time is one hundred fifty (150) hours.
2.	Hours Worked in Excess of Bank. All overtime hours worked over the maximum amount of hours in B (1) shall be compensated in cash.
C.	Cash Liquidation. Overtime hours which are liquidated in cash shall be liquidated on the same or immediately following payroll abstract for the payroll period in which it is earned. Employees who choose cash liquidation may still use compensatory time within the same work week/applicable work period. In this case, all overtime hours shall be liquidated in cash except that those overtime hours worked within a work week/applicable work period may be placed in a compensatory time bank at the discretion of the Appointing Authority. If no agreement between the employee and the supervisor can be reached to take the time off, the overtime must be paid in cash.
8
D.	Compensatory Time Liquidation in Cash. At the option of the Appointing Authority, all or a portion of the compensatory bank may be liquidated in cash two (2) times a fiscal year, with thirty (30) calendar days advance written notice to the Local Union. Such liquidation shall be done in a uniform manner for all employees of the seniority unit. The Appointing Authority and the Local Union may agree in a local meet and confer to uniform liquidation on some basis other than seniority unit.
An employee transferring to the service of another Appointing Authority, accepting a position not represented by the Union, separated from State service, or placed on permanent layoff, shall have unused compensatory time paid in cash. An employee placed on seasonal layoff may have unused compensatory time paid in cash, at the option of the employee.
Any cash payment of unused compensatory time shall be at the average regular rate of pay received by the employee during the last three (3) years of the employee's employment or his/her regular rate of pay as of the date of payment, whichever is greater.
E.	Use of Compensatory Time. Employees requesting compensatory time off with fourteen (14) or more calendar days notice to the Appointing Authority shall be permitted to use such time if it does not unduly disrupt the operations of the Appointing Authority, or require payment of additional salary costs. Requests for use of compensatory time off with less than fourteen (14) calendar days notice to the Appointing Authority or for weekend shifts may be granted at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.
Employees shall not be permitted to use compensatory time or be scheduled to use compensatory time if use will result in the denial of a request to have a holiday off (Article 7, Section 8A), a denial of a vacation request (Article 8, Section 3), or a denial of a discretionary leave request in Article 10.
The Appointing Authority may schedule compensatory time off for an employee with more than fifty (50) hours in the compensatory bank by providing him/her no less than fourteen (14) calendar days notice prior to the specified scheduled time off. The employee may not be scheduled below fifty (50) hours.
Compensatory time scheduled off by the Appointing Authority shall be in increments of at least the employee's normal work day.
Overtime earned for work on a holiday shall be paid in cash except as provided in Article 7, Section 8B1.
If it is necessary to limit the number of employees in a work unit using compensatory time at the same time, conflicts shall be resolved on the basis of State Seniority within or among class(es) as determined by the Appointing Authority.
Section 6.	Call In and Call Back.
Call In. Employees called to work prior to their regularly scheduled shift shall be paid at the appropriate overtime rate until their regular shift begins provided that the employee shall receive a minimum payment equal to one (1) hour at straight time or the time worked at the appropriate overtime rate, whichever is greater. Employees shall work the balance of their regular shift at their regular rate of pay.
Call Back. Employees called back to work after their regularly scheduled shift and who were not assigned such work by the end of their last worked shift prior to the assigned work shall be paid a minimum of two (2) hours at the rate of one and one-half (114). Employees who are called back to work shall be reimbursed mileage for driving to and from their work station and their home if they use their own vehicle.
9
Section 1. On Call. An employee shall be in an on-call status if the employee's supervisor has instructed the employee, in writing, to remain available to work during an off duty period. An employee who is instructed to be in an on-call status is not required to remain in a fixed location, but must leave word where he or she may be reached by telephone or by an electronic signaling device.
An employee who is instructed to remain in an on-call status shall be compensated for such time at the rate of fifteen (15) minutes straight time for each one (1) hour of on-call status. Such compensation shall be limited to four (4) hours of straight time pay per calendar day.
An employee called to work while in on-call status shall be compensated as provided in Section 6 of this Article. An employee shall not receive on-call pay for hours actually worked. No employee shall be assigned to on-call status for a period of less than eight (8) consecutive hours. An employee shall have the choice of receiving on-call pay in cash or compensatory overtime.
An effort shall be made to distribute on-call work as equally as possible among employees in the same job class and in the same work area who are capable of performing the work and who request the on-call work. If practicable, employees shall be notified of the on-call assignment at least one (1) month in advance.
Section 8.	Release From Work. Employees who work an overtime or call in assignment which precedes or overlaps a regular shift may be excused from duty, with the approval of the supervisor, after the completion of eight (8) hours work, without loss of premium pay for the call in or overtime assignment.
An employee who works twenty-four (24) consecutive hours has the right to use vacation, compensatory time, alternate holiday, or leave without pay for his/her next scheduled shift, if that shift is contiguous to the hours worked.
Section 9.	Duplication of Payment. Overtime hours worked shall not be paid more than once for the same hours worked under any provision of this Agreement.

The Appointing Authority may limit the number of employees that may be absent on any given day subject to the operational needs of the Appointing Authority.
Any conflicts for requested holidays shall be resolved on the basis of State Seniority within the employee's work unit. The Appointing Authority shall make a reasonable effort to approve the requested holiday. Floating holidays may not be accumulated. An employee who has not requested the floating holiday by March 1 of each fiscal year or by thirty (30) calendar days prior to the end of an employee's season shall be scheduled to take a floating holiday on a day chosen by the Appointing Authority or be paid for the floating holiday in cash at the option of the Appointing Authority.

Section 6.	Holiday Pay Entitlement. To be entitled to receive a paid holiday, an employee must be in payroll status on the normal work day immediately preceding and the normal work day immediately following the holiday(s).
Any employee who dies or is mandatorily retired on a holiday or holiday weekend shall be entitled to be paid for the holiday(s).
Eligible intermittent employees shall receive a holiday if they work the day before and the day after the holiday or if they work on a holiday.

If the intermittent employee works on the holiday, holiday pay shall be paid for all hours actually worked, not to exceed eight (8) hours for a single holiday. If the intermittent employee does not work on the holiday, holiday pay shall be in accord with the schedules set forth in Appendix B1.

With the approval of the supervisor, part-time employees may be allowed to arrange their work schedules, in payroll periods that include a holiday, to avoid any reduction in salary due to a loss of hours because of the proration of holiday hours, provided such rescheduling does not result in the payment of overtime.
Section 8.	Work on a Holiday.
12
A.	Scheduling. If more employees in a work unit would normally be scheduled or are scheduled to work on a holiday than necessary, and there are conflicts in requests for the holiday off, the Appointing Authority shall grant the holiday off on the basis of State Seniority within or among class(es) as determined by the Appointing Authority, provided that the Appointing Authority retains the right to schedule employees with the ability and capacity to perform the job.
Of the employees who do not request the holiday off at least twenty-one (21) calendar days prior to the holiday, the most senior employees based on State Seniority, within or among classes as determined by the Appointing Authority, shall be assigned to work the holiday.
B.	Payment. Any employee who works on any holiday provided by this agreement shall be paid in cash at the employee's appropriate overtime rate for all hours worked, provided that if an employee has chosen compensatory time under Article 6, the payment for work on a holiday may be placed in the compensatory bank at the employee's option.

Vacation leave hours shall not be used during the payroll period in which the hours are accrued.
13
Section 2.	Length of Service Requirements/Accruals.

However, accrual dates shall not be adjusted for employees on military leave or on FMLA-qualified leave.

C.	Proration. Eligible employees being paid for less than a full eighty (80) hour pay period shall have their vacation accruals pro-rated in accord with the schedule set forth in Appendix C.
D.	Reinstatement of Accrual Rate. An eligible employee who is reinstated or reappointed to State service within four (4) years of the date of resignation in good standing or retirement shall accrue vacation leave with the same credit for Length of Service that existed at the time of such separation.
Upon request, employees of the Legislative Branch who are appointed to the Executive Branch within four (4) years of the date of resignation in good standing or retirement, shall receive credit for their length of service in the Legislative Branch that existed at the time of such transfer or separation for vacation accrual purposes provided that the employee was in an eligible status as defined in Section 1A of this Article when employed by the Legislative Branch. Such employees shall begin accruing vacation leave based on this method effective at the beginning of the first payroll period following the effective date of this Agreement.
Employees of the University of Minnesota, the Minnesota Historical Society and the Metropolitan Council who transfer or who are appointed to State service within four (4) years of the date of resignation in good standing or retirement, shall accrue vacation leave with the same credit for length of service that existed at the time of such transfer or separation.
E.	Reinstatement of Vacation Balance. Effective December 21, 2001, employees of the Legislative Branch who are appointed to the Executive Branch without a break in service may be allowed to bring any accumulated but unused vacation leave with them provided that it does not exceed two hundred and seventy-five (275) hours.

14
accumulated but unused vacation leave balance posted to their credit in the records of the Appointing Authority.
F.	Maximum Accruals. Employees may accumulate unused vacation to any amount provided that once during each fiscal year each employee's accumulation must be reduced to two hundred and seventy-five (275) hours or less. This must be accomplished on or before the last day of the fiscal year. If not, the amount of vacation shall be automatically reduced to two hundred and seventy-five (275) hours at the end of the fiscal year.
Employees on a military leave under Article 10 shall earn and accrue vacation leave as though actually employed, without regard to the maximum accumulation set forth above. Vacation earned in excess of two hundred and seventy-five (275) hours shall be taken within two (2) years of the date the employee returns from military leave.
Section 3.	Vacation Period. Every reasonable effort shall be made by the Appointing Authority to schedule employee vacations at a time agreeable to the employee insofar as adequate scheduling of the work unit permits. If it is necessary to limit the number of employees in a work unit on vacation at the same time, the Appointing Authority shall determine whether conflicts over vacation periods shall be resolved among classes or within a particular class based upon staffing needs. In either event, vacation schedules shall be established on the basis of State Seniority within the employee's work unit.
Whenever practicable, employees shall submit written requests for vacation periods at least four (4) weeks in advance of their vacation to their supervisor, on forms furnished by the Appointing Authority. When advance written requests are impractical, employees shall secure the approval of their supervisor by telephone or other means at the earliest opportunity. Supervisors shall respond to vacation requests promptly and shall answer all written requests in writing no later than ten (10) calendar days after such request is made.
Any request for a vacation of five (5) working days or more, including holidays, which is submitted five (5) calendar weeks or more in advance of the requested date of the start of the vacation shall be posted within five (5) calendar days in the work unit of the employee requesting the vacation for one (1) calendar week to allow other employees who may desire to request vacation for the same period to do so. All such requests must be submitted to the supervisor within the posting period. Conflicts involving vacation scheduling shall be resolved as provided above. Supervisors shall respond to the request(s) within one (1) calendar week of the end of the posting. No request may be submitted for a vacation period more than six (6) months in advance of the request. However, an employee may request vacation which commences more than six (6) months in advance if a posted request contains days which are within six (6) months. With the agreement of the Local Union, the Appointing Authority may establish deadlines for vacation requests within the six (6) months period.
When an employee decides, more than fourteen (14) calendar days in advance, not to use vacation time which was approved under the posting system, the Appointing Authority shall post a notice of this fact in the work unit and consider new requests for vacation.
No vacation requests shall be denied solely because of the season of the year but shall be dependent upon meeting the staffing needs of the Agency.
Section 4.	Vacation Charges. Employees who use vacation shall be charged only for the number of hours they would have been scheduled to work during the period of absence. Holidays that occur during vacation periods will be paid as a holiday and not charged as a vacation day.
Employee vacation accruals earned while on paid leave may be used by the employee with the approval of the supervisor without returning to work prior to the use of such accrued leave.

Should an employee become ill or disabled while on vacation, vacation leave shall be changed to sick leave, effective the date of the illness or disability, upon notice to the employee's supervisor. In the event of the disability or hospitalization of the employee's spouse, minor or dependent children/step-children/foster-children, or parent/step-parent living in the same household of the employee, or illness of a minor child whether or not the child lives in the same household of the employee, and the employee's attendance is necessary while the employee is on vacation, vacation leave shall be changed to sick leave, effective the date of the disability or hospitalization, upon notice to the employee's supervisor. Upon such notice, employees may be requested by the Appointing Authority to furnish a medical statement from a medical practitioner. If requested by the Appointing Authority, such statements shall be provided as soon as possible after the illness, disability or hospitalization occurs.
Section 5.	Work During Vacation Period. No employee shall be required to work during the employee's vacation once the vacation request has been approved.
Section 6.	Vacation Transfer and Liquidation. An employee transferring to the service of another Appointing Authority shall have accumulated vacation leave transferred and such leave shall not be liquidated by cash payment. However, if an employee moves to a vacation-ineligible position not covered by this Agreement, their vacation shall be liquidated. Except for employees who separate from State service prior to completion of six (6) months of continuous service, any employee separated from State service shall be compensated in cash, at the employee's then current rate of pay, for all vacation leave to the employee's credit at the time of separation. However, in no case shall payment exceed two hundred sixty (260) hours, except in the event of the death of the employee. Seasonal employees shall be allowed to liquidate all, none or a portion of their accumulated vacation balances at the time of or immediately prior to their seasonal layoff. After notice to the Local Union, and upon mutual agreement of the employee and Appointing Authority, employees facing temporary layoff shall be allowed to liquidate all, none or a portion of their accumulated vacation balances at the time of or immediately prior to their temporary layoff.

The Appointing Authority will attempt to accommodate such a request. Such reassignment shall not be subject to the provisions of Article 12, Section 4. In the event that such reassignment is not practicable, the employee shall have the right to request an unpaid leave of absence, pursuant to Article 10, Section 4F.

ARTICLE 12 - VACANCIES, FILLING OF POSITIONS
Section 1.	Vacancies.
A.	Defined. A vacancy is defined as an opening in the classified service for a non-temporary (more than six (6) months) position, the assemblage of a seasonal work crew if defined as such in Supplemental Agreements, or a shift opening in the seniority unit, which the Appointing Authority determines to fill. A vacancy may be created by death, resignation, dismissal, transfer out of the seniority unit, permanent reassignment to a new work location thirty-five (35) miles or more distant, retirement, leave of absence expected to be longer than six (6) months, permanent disability, promotions, demotions, successful bid, or the creation of a new position or shift or seasonal work crew and the Appointing Authority determines that such vacancy is to be filled.
B.	Exceptions.
1.	A vacancy is not created when State departments are merged or combined or when employees are transferred from one State department to another State department by Executive Order or Legislative Act.
2.	When an Appointing Authority becomes responsible for a function administered by another governmental agency, a quasi-public or private enterprise, employees being absorbed into the bargaining unit shall be placed in comparable positions without creating vacancies.
Section 2.	Employment Condition. "Employment condition" means any limitation on continuous employment caused by the number of hours of work assigned to an employee, and his/her appointment status. Hours of work may be full time, part time, or intermittent. Appointment status may be unlimited, temporary, emergency, or seasonal.
A.	Hours of Work.
1.	Full-time employee. "Full-time employee" means an employee who is normally scheduled to work 80 hours in a biweekly payroll period.
2.	Part-time employee. "Part-time employee" means an employee who is normally scheduled to work fewer than 80 hours in a biweekly payroll period.
3.	Intermittent employee. "Intermittent employee" means an employee who works an irregular and uncertain schedule which alternately begins, ceases, and begins again as the needs of the agency require.
B.	Appointment Status.
1.	Unlimited employee. "Unlimited employee" means an employee who is appointed with no definite ending date.
2.	Temporary employee. "Temporary employee" means an employee who is appointed with a definite ending date. A temporary employee's term of employment may not exceed a total of 12 months in any 24-month period in any one agency.
3.	Seasonal employee. "Seasonal employee" means an employee who is appointed for no more than ten months during any 12 consecutive months but who is expected to return to work year after year.
26
4.	Emergency employee. "Emergency employee" means an employee who is appointed for no more than 45 aggregate working days in any 12-month period for any single Appointing Authority.
Section 3.	Work Areas. The Appointing Authority may define and/or redefine work areas provided that such work areas are based upon reasonable staffing and/or operational needs of the Appointing Authority and do not unreasonably diminish the bidding rights of employees. Upon request, the Appointing Authority will provide to the Local Union a list of current work areas.
Section 4.	Reassignment.
A.	Within a Work Area. The Appointing Authority shall have the right to assign and reassign duties among employees in a class within a work area. This includes the right to reassign employees to an unfilled position in the same class and same employment condition and shift and work area provided such reassignment is within thirty-five (35) miles. Any reassignment under this subdivision is not a vacancy as defined in Section 1 of this Article.
B.	Between Work Areas or Shifts. If no vacancy has been created (or if a vacancy has been created or a shift opening occurs, and the Appointing Authority determines to fill the vacancy or shift opening without adding another employee) and it is necessary to reassign an employee within thirty-five (35) miles, the Appointing Authority shall request volunteers from among employees in the same class (or option) and same employment condition and work area/or shift from which the reassignment is to be made. If one or more employees volunteer for the reassignment, the most senior qualified volunteer shall be reassigned. If there are no volunteers, the least senior qualified employee in the same class (or option) and same employment condition and work area/or shift from which the reassignment is to be made shall be reassigned. In addition, and upon request, the Appointing Authority shall provide to the Local Union President the name of any employee reassigned pursuant to Section 4B.
C.	Temporary Reassignment. Notwithstanding the above, the Appointing Authority may temporarily reassign any employee to another work area and/or shift for five (5) consecutive months or less. With mutual agreement between the Local and the Appointing Authority, such reassignment may extend up to twelve (12) months. At the end of the reassignment, the reassigned employee shall return to his/her former position, unless the position has been abolished, in which case the employee shall return to his/her former work area and shift.
Section 5.	Job Posting. [Note: When posting Unit 6 positions, refer to both this Article and Appendix O for an explanation of position qualifications.] Whenever a vacancy occurs, the Appointing Authority shall post for a minimum of seven (7) calendar days, a description of the vacancy on all employee bulletin boards where employees in the seniority unit in the class in which the vacancy exists are stationed, or through such procedures as are otherwise agreed upon between the Appointing Authority and the Union. Such other procedures may include the use of electronic means of posting. When the seven (7) calendar day posting requirement would be met on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the expiration date of the posting shall be the day following the weekend or holiday. The posting description shall be dated and shall contain the name of the class (or option), a general description of the duties, the qualifications for the position (if Unit 6), the work area of the position, the shift, if applicable, the normal hours of work, and the initial days off. A copy of the posting shall be furnished to the Local Union President.
27
Vacancies in Junior/Senior Plans shall be posted at both levels of the plan. Bids shall be accepted from employees in both classes. A list of Junior/Senior Plans is attached in Appendix I.
A posted vacancy may be canceled during the posting period but may only be canceled after the posting period for lack of funds. Upon request, the Appointing Authority shall furnish the Local Union with documentation of the lack of funds. Any vacancy for which eligible bids have been received and which has not been canceled shall be filled in accord with contract procedures within four (4) calendar weeks of the posting date.
For informational purposes only, each Appointing Authority within a multi-seniority unit agency shall maintain a list of, or copies of, job postings of vacancies in other seniority units within the agency.
Section 6.	Eligibility for Bidding. Permanent non-probationary classified employees in a different employment condition or different shift from the posted vacancy or in a work area different from the posted vacancy shall be eligible to bid for any vacancy within their class (or class option or another class option within that class for which they are qualified as determined by the Appointing Authority) and seniority unit. However, for the purposes of bidding, an unlimited parttime employee who is not eligible for the full Employer insurance contribution (less than 75%) may bid to an unlimited part-time vacancy with full Employer insurance contribution (75% or above) and an unlimited part-time employee in a less than 50% position may bid on a 50% or greater unlimited part-time vacancy, including within a period of six (6) months following the date upon which an employee exercised a successful bid.
Any employee who has successfully filled a vacancy via a bid other than a seasonal work crew vacancy shall not be entitled to bid on another vacancy for a period of six (6) months following the date upon which the employee exercised the bid. However, a permanent non-probationary classified employee who is part-time unlimited, part-time seasonal or full-time seasonal may bid on a full-time unlimited vacancy at any time.
Eligible employees may bid on filling of a posted vacancy by submitting a written or electronic application to the Appointing Authority which must be received on or before the expiration date of the posting to receive consideration.
An employee who is away from his/her work location on assignment or approved vacation in excess of seven (7) calendar days, may submit an advance bid for individual vacancies posted during his/her absence. The advance bid shall indicate the division, section, classification/class option, employment condition and location of the position. Such advance bid shall be valid for the period of the absence or four (4) weeks, whichever is less. The employee shall be responsible for submitting the advance bid to the supervisor who is responsible for the posting.
Employees on seasonal layoff or permanent layoff shall be eligible to bid for any vacancy in the classification and seniority unit from which the employee was laid off. The employee is responsible to be aware of vacancies. The Appointing Authority shall not consider such a bid if acceptance would create a layoff or bumping situation or would prevent the recall of a more senior employee who was permanently laid off from the same class, employment condition and principal place of employment/location.
Section 1. Filling Positions. Vacant positions shall be filled as follows:
[Note: When filling Unit 6 positions, refer to both this Article and Appendix O for an explanation of “position qualified.”]
28
A.	Bidding. Selection of employees to fill a posted vacancy shall be made from among eligible bidders in order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6), provided the senior employee's ability and capacity to perform the job are relatively equal to that of other bidders. Bidders for Unit 6 positions must be position-qualified. [Note: for a posted vacancy in a Junior/Senior Plan, Classification Seniority is the combined Class Seniority of classes in the Junior/Senior Plan.]
Vacancies shall be filled by the posting and bidding process until there is no bid or until a maximum of three (3) such vacancies have been filled, whichever comes first. However, when a vacancy can be filled by an employee who has received notice of permanent layoff, only one (1) vacancy shall be filled by the posting and bidding process.
All bidders for a vacancy shall be notified, orally or in writing, of the acceptance or rejection of their bid in a timely manner.
When an employee returns from an approved leave of absence and there is a vacancy, the employee shall be reinstated to that vacancy, provided that no employee with more Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) has bid on the position. If a more senior employee has successfully bid on the position, the employee returning from the approved leave of absence shall be selected for the position vacated by the successful bidder. (See also Article 10, Section 6, regarding return from a leave of absence.)
Notwithstanding the above, the Appointing Authority shall not consider bids by employees for vacancies if acceptance of a bid would create a layoff or a bumping situation nor accept a bid from an employee in a different employment condition if acceptance of the bid would prevent the recall of an employee from the Seniority Unit Layoff List laid off from the same class, employment condition and location.
B.	Seniority Unit Layoff List. Selection shall next be made from the Seniority Unit Layoff List unless the vacancy is being filled by an employee with more classification seniority who has received notice of permanent layoff.
1.	Same Employment Condition. Selection shall next be made from employees (position-qualified for Unit 6) on the Seniority Unit Layoff List in order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) if such a list exists pursuant to Article 15, Section 3H. No new appointments shall be made in a seniority unit in a class (or option) and employment condition for which a Seniority Unit Layoff List exists until all employees (must be position-qualified for Unit 6) on such list have been offered the opportunity to accept the position.
2.	Different Employment Condition. Selection shall next be made from employees (position-qualified for Unit 6) on the Seniority Unit Layoff List in order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) for the class (or option) and seniority unit in which the vacancy exists who were laid off from an employment condition other than that of the vacancy to be filled. Selection shall be limited to the geographic area (within thirty-five (35) miles) of the position from which the employee was laid off.
C.	Claiming. Prior to accepting a claim, the agency has the option of filling the vacancy with a seniority unit employee (position-qualified for Unit 6) who has received notice of permanent layoff and has more state seniority than any claimer. If this option is not chosen, see Article 15, Section 3D3(g) regarding employee requests to claim positions in other seniority units to avoid layoff or bumping. However, if the agency must choose among ciaimers (position-qualified for Unit 6), seniority shall not be a consideration.
29
D.	Class (or Class Option) Layoff List. If the vacancy is not filled through the claiming process or with a seniority unit employee who has received notice of permanent layoff, selection shall next be made from among employees on the Class (or Class Option) Layoff List. Selection from employees on this list shall not be unreasonably denied. Unit 6 employees selected off a Class Layoff List must be position-qualified.
E.	Other. If the vacancy remains unfilled, the Appointing Authority shall have the option of filling the vacancy by the use of any of the following methods:
1.	Routine Service. If a promotion is to be made to a routine service position, selection shall be made from among employees within the same seniority unit in which the vacancy exists who have expressed interest in the Routine Service position in the order of State Seniority, provided the senior employee's ability and capacity to perform the job are relatively equal to that of other applicants certified from the list or referred for Routine Service appointment; or,
2.	Voluntary Demotion.
3.	Voluntary Transfer.
4.	Reinstatement.
5.	Multi-Source Recruitment and Selection System. If a promotion is to be made using the State’s multi-source recruitment and selection system, selection shall be made from among employees within the same seniority unit in which the vacancy exists, whose names are in the applicant pool in the order of State Seniority, provided the senior employee’s ability and capacity to perform the job are relatively equal to that of other applicants in the applicant pool.
6.	Workers’ Compensation Referrals. Employees who have an active workers’ compensation claim and have qualified for transfer or demotion will be referred along with qualified applicants from the agency. The Appointing Authority may appoint any of the applicants referred. If there are no qualified applicants from the agency, only the names of employees who have an active workers’ compensation claim and have qualified for transfer or demotion will be referred. The Appointing Authority may fill the vacancy by other means only after demonstrating to the Commissioner of Employee Relations that none of the workers’ compensation referrals are available, able or qualified to perform the duties of the vacancy.
7.	Other. The Appointing Authority may also use any other appointment procedure pursuant to statute.
Upon request, the Appointing Authority shall provide to the Local Union President the name of the applicant selected, the method used to select the applicant and any lists of applicants in the applicant pool used in the selection process.
When new classes (or class options) are established in the State service and in the seniority unit, employees within that seniority unit shall be afforded the opportunity to compete for appointment to vacancies in the new class through the selection process.
During the application of the posting, bidding and job filling process, the Appointing Authority may temporarily assign employees or make temporary appointments to vacancies to fulfill operational needs.
30
Section 8.	Effects of Changes in Position Allocations on the Filling of Positions. When the allocation of a position has been changed as the result of changes in the organizational structure of an agency or abrupt changes in the duties and responsibilities of the position, such positions shall be considered vacant under the provisions of this Article and filled in accord with Sections 5, 6 and 7.
Section 9.	Effects of Reallocations on the Filling of Positions. When the allocation of a position has been changed as the result of changes over a period of time in the kind, responsibility, or difficulty of the work performed in a position, such situation shall be deemed a reallocation.
A reallocated position shall not be considered a vacancy under the provisions of this Article if the action leading to the change in the allocation of the position did not clearly result from the assignment of the incumbent to work out of class in a manner so as to by-pass the selection process, assignment of the incumbent to a vacancy in a new position which had not been allocated to a class, or other action taken without regard to the appropriate selection process.
When the reallocated position is not a vacancy, the incumbent employee shall be appointed to the reallocated position provided the employee has performed satisfactorily in the position and possesses any licensure, certification, or registration which may be required.
When the reallocated position is a vacancy or when the incumbent employee has not performed satisfactorily in the position or does not possess the required licensure, certification, or registration, the position shall be filled as provided in Sections 5, 6, and 7 of this Article.
When the incumbent is ineligible to be appointed to the reallocated position as provided above, the employee shall be removed from the position within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of notification to the Appointing Authority. If the employee cannot be reassigned, transferred, promoted, or demoted, the layoff provisions of this Agreement shall apply.
Employees may submit requests for job audits directly to the Department of Employee Relations or to an agency human resource office with delegated authority. An employee who has had a formal audit request submitted on his/her position shall be notified in writing of its receipt by the appropriate agency Human Resources Office.
Except for reallocations resulting from a study of an agency or division thereof initiated by the Department of Employee Relations or an Appointing Authority, if the incumbent of a position which is reallocated upward receives a probationary appointment to a reallocated position, pay for the reallocated position shall commence fifteen (15) calendar days after the receipt in the Department of Employee Relations or an agency human resource office with delegated authority of a reallocation request determined by the Department of Employee Relations or the delegated agency to be properly documented, and it shall continue from that date until the effective date of the probationary appointment.
The decision of the Commissioner of Employee Relations or an agency with delegated authority on the reallocation of any position shall not be subject to the grievance and arbitration provision of this Agreement.
An employee who is demoted as a result of a reallocation shall have his/her name placed on the Seniority Unit and Class (or Class Option) Layoff Lists for the class from which he/she was reallocated.
The Employer shall provide the Union with information about reallocations of bargaining unit employees.
31
Section 10.	Probationary Period.
A.	Required Probationary Period. Except as provided below, all unlimited appointments to positions in the classified service shall be for probationary period specified in Section 10C.
No probationary period shall be required for a recall from a Seniority Unit Layoff List, or (for any employee laid off after October 23, 1995) for a recall from a Seniority Unit Layoff List within two (2) years of the date of layoff, or a transfer in the same class under the same Appointing Authority, or a transfer or demotion to a previously held class under the same Appointing Authority, or for those employees identified in Section 10B below where no prior written notice of the probationary period requirement was given to the employee.
B.	Discretionary Probationary Period. An Appointing Authority may, with prior written notice to the employee, require a probationary period as specified in Section 10C for transfers and demotions to a new Appointing Authority or to classes in which the employee has not previously served, reemployment, reinstatement, recall from a Class (Class Option) Layoff List, or (for any employee laid off after October 23, 1995) recall from a Seniority Unit Layoff List more than two (2) years after the date of layoff.
C.	Length of Probationary Period.
1.	50% or Greater Time Employees. All probationary periods for all unlimited and seasonal employees who work 50% or more time shall be six (6) months. Any absence in excess of a total of ten (10) consecutive working days shall be added to the duration of the probationary period.
2.	Intermittents and Less Than 50% Time Employees. All probationary periods shall be one thousand forty-four (1,044) working hours or a maximum of one (1) year. Working hours shall include hours actually worked. The probationary period under this Section shall be no less than six (6) months. Working hours shall also include paid holidays, compensatory time off taken, and paid leave taken in increments of less than the employee's normal work day.
3.	Reallocated Positions. Notwithstanding 1 and 2 above, an incumbent appointed to a reallocated position shall serve a probationary period of three (3) months.
4.	Employees placed on layoff or seasonal layoff prior to the completion of their probationary period shall be required to complete the probationary period upon return from the layoff or seasonal layoff.
5.	Time served on a temporary or a provisional appointment (up to a maximum of one-half (1/2) of the probationary period) shall be credited toward the completion of the probationary period in the same position, class and seniority unit provided there is no break in service of more than one (1) payroll period, or provided the only break in service is an emergency appointment.
6.	Employees promoted or transferred prior to the completion of their probationary period. If the employee does not successfully complete probation in the higher class, the employee shall return to the former class and resume the probationary period at the point it was interrupted.
32
For probationary periods that begin on or after the effective date of this Agreement, employees who promote or transfer prior to the completion of their probationary period and are required to serve a new probationary period, shall complete their probationary period in the previous class on the same date that they successfully complete their probationary period in the new class and/or agency. If the employee does not successfully complete probation in the new class and/or agency, the employee shall return to the former class and/or agency and resume the probationary period at the point it was interrupted.
7.	Employees demoted during or at the end of a probationary period shall have the time in the higher class count toward the probationary period in the class to which such employees are demoted, except as provided in 6 above.
D.	Probationary Evaluation. During the probationary period, the Appointing Authority shall conduct a minimum of one (1) performance counseling review of the employee's work performance at the approximate mid-point of the probationary period and furnish the employee with a written copy of the evaluation. Whenever practicable, intermittent employees shall have an initial performance review ninety (90) working days into their appointment. Employees shall be informed of areas of needed improvement.
E.	Trial Period. Employees who have been appointed to a new class or transferred and required to serve a probationary period shall have a trial period of fifteen (15) calendar days for the purpose of evaluation. During this trial period, the employee may elect to return to the former position. An employee who returns to a former class under this section shall accrue seniority as if continually employed in the former class.
F.	Non-certification. An Appointing Authority who does not certify a probationary employee shall notify the employee in writing with a copy to the Local Union of the reasons for the noncertification. The Union shall have the right to challenge such reasons through the third step of the grievance procedure. However, for any grievance other than non-certification, employees with permanent status in another class and serving a subsequent probationary period shall not be denied use of Article 17 through the arbitration process.
The employee who is non-certified shall be returned to his/her former class within the seniority unit from where the employee came, and if a vacancy exists, to the same geographic area. An employee who returns to a former class under this section shall accrue seniority as if continually employed in the former class. If there is no vacancy in the employee’s former class and seniority unit, the layoff provisions of this Agreement shall apply. An employee who is noncertified following recall from a Seniority Unit Layoff List shall be returned to the layoff list for the time remaining.
Section 11.	Performance Evaluations. See Article 18, Section 10, Performance Evaluations.
ARTICLE 13	- PROMOTIONAL RATINGS
Promotional ratings required by the Appointing Authority in conjunction with a position’s selection assessment shall be prepared for each employee who is an applicant for that position in an objective manner.

Prior to being processed by the Appointing Authority the employee's final rating shall be discussed with the employee by the supervisor who signs the rating form and a signed copy of the rating shall be furnished to the employee.
33
ARTICLE 14	- TRANSFERS BETWEEN AGENCIES
Employees may request a transfer to a position under another Appointing Authority by submitting such request in writing to the Personnel Office of the Appointing Authority to which they wish to transfer with a copy to the Personnel Office of the Appointing Authority by which they are currently employed.
If the receiving Appointing Authority does not require a new probationary period, the sending Appointing Authority shall agree to the transfer.
ARTICLE 15	- LAYOFF AND RECALL
Section 1.	Layoff. An Appointing Authority may lay off an employee by reason of abolition of the position, shortage of work or funds, or other reasons outside the employee's control which do not reflect discredit on the service of the employee.
Any reduction in hours of a less than full-time employee, except for intermittents, which would place the employee outside the bargaining unit shall constitute a layoff and shall be implemented in accord with the provisions of this Article.
Section 2.	Labor-Management Cooperation. When an Appointing Authority initiates a planning process or management study which is anticipated to result in layoff, the Appointing Authority will meet and confer with the Local Union during the decision planning phase and again during the implementation planning phase. The Appointing Authority and the Local Union shall enter into negotiations regarding a Memoranda of Understanding upon request of either party to modify this Agreement regarding the implementation plans which shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
•	Length of layoff notice;
•	Job and retraining opportunities;
•	Alternative placement methods;
•	Early retirement options pursuant to M.S. 43A.24, Subd. 2(i);
•	Bumping/vacancy options for part-time employees to preserve their insurance eligibility or contribution; and
•	Other methods of mitigating layoff or their effect on employees.
Section 3.	Permanent Layoff.
A.	Determination of Position(s). The Appointing Authority shall determine the position(s) in the class or class option, if one exists, and employment condition and work location which is to be eliminated.
34
B.	Advance Notice. In the event a permanent layoff in the classified service of seniority unit employees becomes necessary, the Appointing Authority shall notify the Union and the Local Union President of the classification(s), number of positions and the employment condition(s) to be eliminated at least thirty (30) calendar days whenever practicable, but at least twenty-one (21) calendar days prior to the effective date of the anticipated layoff. At least twenty-one (21) calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff, the Appointing Authority shall give written notice of the layoff, including the reason(s) therefor and the estimated length of the layoff period, to all affected employee(s) and to the Local Union President. The Appointing Authority may establish a date, no more than seven (7) calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff, by which employees must choose the layoff option they will exercise. This date shall be indicated in the written notice of the layoff.
The written notice of a permanent layoff shall include a list of existing and anticipated vacant positions that an employee may accept in accord with Section 3D of this Article, a statement explaining the procedure to contact the Department of Employee Relations to apply for vacant positions, and notice of the need to indicate interest in temporary work. The written notice of a permanent layoff shall also include a general reference to the employee's claiming rights. The Appointing Authority shall provide the employee with information needed to apply for unemployment insurance and forms for continuing insurance coverage and forms to indicate availability for class and seniority unit recall.
C.	Layoff Notification. The Appointing Authority shall send a layoff notice to the employee in the position to be eliminated. The layoff notice shall be provided to the employee in person whenever practicable and shall otherwise be sent by priority mail. At the Appointing Authority’s discretion, an employee under notice of permanent layoff may be granted up to one hundred and sixty (160) hours of paid leave, ending at the date of layoff. Hours of leave may be granted at any time throughout the layoff notice period and shall not be subject to the Application and Reinstatement provisions of Article 10.
Upon request, an Appointing Authority shall provide an employee on notice of layoff assistance in searching for State employment.
Provisional, temporary and emergency employees shall be terminated before any layoff of probationary or permanent employees in the same class, employment condition and geographic location/principal place of employment.
Provisional employees shall be separated in inverse order of the date of their provisional appointment.
D.	Procedure. The following provisions are all subject to the conditions for bumping or accepting vacancies which are contained in Section 3E. In all cases, the employee exercising an option is restricted to those positions within the same seniority unit (except in Option 3g, claiming). Employees may only bump within the same employment condition (except in Options 3f and h). Employees may be offered vacancies within their seniority unit in a different employment condition. However, the employee’s refusal to accept a vacancy in a different employment condition shall not result in the forfeiture of other layoff options. For layoffs related to Unit 6 positions, refer to both this Article and Appendix O for an explanation of “position-qualified.”
1.	The employee in the position to be eliminated shall either:
35
a.	Bump the least senior employee in the same class (or class option or another class option within that class for which the employee is determined by the Employer to be qualified) and the same shift within his/her work area within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6). This bumped employee shall bump the least senior employee in the work area within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location regardless of shift (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6); or
b.	Accept a vacancy in the same class (or class option or another class option within that class for which the employee is determined by the Employer to be qualified) within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6); or
c.	Accept a vacancy within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location in an equal class in which the employee previously served (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6).
2.	If options “1b” and “1c” above are not available, and the employee chooses not to accept option "1a", or option "1a" is not available, the employee shall either:
a.	Bump the least senior employee in the same class (or class option or another class option within that class for which the employee is determined by the Employer to be qualified) within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6); or,
b.	Accept a vacancy in an equal class in which the employee has not previously served and for which the employee is determined by the Employer to be qualified and within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6).
3.	If neither "2a" nor "2b" above is available or if only "2a" above is available, the employee may choose any of the following options:
a.	Layoff.
b.	Vacancy Within Thirty-Five (35) Miles. Accept a vacancy in a lower class in which the employee has previously served or for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6);
c.	Vacancy Outside Thirty-Five (35) Miles.
(1)	Same/Equal Class. Accept a vacancy in the same class (or class option or another class option within that class for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer), or in an equal class in which the employee has previously served or for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer more than thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6);
(2)	Lower Class. Accept a vacancy in a lower class in which the employee has previously served or for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer more than thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6);
36
d.	Bump Within Thirty-Five (35) Miles.
(1)	Equal Class. Bump the least senior employee in an equal class (or class option) in which the employee previously served (or another class option within the class for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer) within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6);
(2)	Lower Class. Bump the least senior employee in a lower class (or class option) in which the employee previously served (or another class option within the class for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer) within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6).
e.	Bump Outside Thirty-Five (35) Miles.
(1)	Same/Equal Class. Bump the least senior employee in the same class (or class option) or the least senior employee in an equal class (or class option) in which the employee previously served (or another class option within that class for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer) more than thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6);
(2)	Lower Class. Bump the least senior employee in a lower class (or class option) in which the employee previously served (or another class option within that class for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer) more than thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6).
f.	Bump Temporary Appointment. Bump any employee on a temporary appointment in the same class who has more than thirty (30) calendar days remaining on such appointment and is within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6). The temporary employee bumped shall be separated.
g.	Claiming. An employee may request to transfer or demote to a non-temporary classified vacancy in another seniority unit in the same, transferable, or lower class (or class option) in which the employee previously served or for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer, and the receiving Appointing Authority shall not unreasonably deny the request (for Unit 6, the employee must be position-qualified). Employees may not request a transfer or demotion to another Appointing Authority if such a vacancy is available to the employee at a pay level equal to the requested vacancy within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee's current work location which the current Appointing Authority determines to fill or if the employee has previously requested and has been offered a vacancy under this provision in the same or an equal class in the same employment condition within thirty-five (35) miles of the current position.
37
Eligibility for claiming under this provision begins on the date of the written layoff notice and continues until the actual date of layoff or forty-five (45) days, whichever is greater. If the claiming period extends beyond the date of layoff, no severance or vacation liquidation will be paid until the end of the claiming period. The employee’s name will be placed on the Seniority Unit Layoff List but will not be placed on the Class (or Class Option) Layoff List until the end of the claiming period. If the claiming period extends beyond the layoff date, employees may waive their post-layoff claiming rights and the Appointing Authority shall authorize payment of any severance and vacation liquidation and employees will be eligible for placement on appropriate layoff lists.
If the employee successfully claims but cannot be appointed until after the scheduled layoff date, the current Appointing Authority shall place the employee on unpaid leave or, upon mutual agreement, vacation leave until the new appointment begins. Vacation leave usage is not subject to Section 3 of Article 8.
For employees who transfer or demote to another seniority unit under this provision and who do not successfully complete the probationary period, the following shall apply:
(1)	If the layoff notice period has expired, the employee shall be placed on layoff from his/her original seniority unit, class, employment condition, and location. Such employees are not subject to 3A - 3G of this Article but shall become eligible to be placed on layoff lists in accord with 3H on the effective date of the non-certification.
(2)	If the layoff notice period has not expired, the employee shall be returned to his/her original seniority unit, class, employment condition, and location for the remainder of the notice period. Such employees shall not claim additional positions.
h.	Bump in Different Employment Condition Within Thirty-five (35) Miles. An unlimited full-time or unlimited part-time employee may exercise this option only if 1a and 2a above are not available. An unlimited full-time employee may bump the least senior employee in the unlimited part-time employment condition and an unlimited parttime employee may bump the least senior employee in the unlimited full-time employment condition in the same class (or class option or another option within that class for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer) within thirty-five (35) miles of the employee’s current work location (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6).
E.	Conditions for Bumping or Accepting Vacancies. The following shall govern bumping and accepting vacancies pursuant to Section 3A-D:
1.	In all cases of bumping, the employee exercising bumping rights must have greater Classification Seniority (when bumping into a position in Unit 2, 3, or 7) or State Seniority (when bumping into a position in Unit 4 or 6) in the class into which the employee is bumping than the employee who is to be bumped.
2.	An employee who does not have sufficient Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) to bump into a previously held class shall not forfeit the right to exercise Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) to bump into the next previously held class in the same seniority unit.
3.	Any employee who has the option to fill a vacancy in the same class or in a class in which the employee previously served must possess more Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) than bidders, if any, to fill the vacancy.
4.	Any employee who has the option to fill a vacancy in a class in which the employee has not previously served shall fill the vacancy only if there are no bidders.
38
5.	When a vacancy exists in a class into which the employee has a right to bump and which is in the employee’s current employment condition, the employee must accept the vacancy prior to exercising the option to bump except Option D1a.
6.	If more than one employee (must be position-qualified if Unit 6) opts to fill a vacancy or bump another employee, the employee with the greater Seniority (Classification Seniority or State Seniority whichever is applicable) shall have priority in exercising that option.
7.	When two (2) or more employees in the same class (or class option) and employment condition are being simultaneously laid off, the Union and the Appointing Authority may mutually agree to selection of layoff options among the affected employees.
8.	Employees who were reclassified from Janitor, Senior to General Maintenance Worker Lead on July 1, 1986 may bump to General Maintenance Worker.
9.	Any non-temporary employee bumped pursuant to this Section shall be laid off in accord with Section 3A - D of this Article.
The Appointing Authority need not consider bids by employees for vacancies if acceptance of a bid would create a layoff or a bumping situation nor a bid from an employee in a different employment condition if acceptance of the bid would prevent the recall of an employee from the Seniority Unit Layoff List laid off from the same class, employment condition, and location.
F.	Junior/Senior Plans. When layoffs take place in the senior class of a Junior/Senior Plan, as defined by the Employer, and the employee demotes or bumps to the junior class as provided in the layoff procedure, the junior position shall simultaneously be reallocated to the senior class, provided that the employee is qualified for the reallocation under the terms of the Junior/Senior Plan.
G.	Rights of Employees Returning to the Bargaining Unit. Employees who have accepted positions in a bargaining unit not represented by the Union or positions excluded from any bargaining unit shall have bumping rights into a position in a bargaining unit represented by the Union in a class in which the employee previously served and for which the employee is determined to be qualified by the Employer only under the following conditions:
1.	The employee may bump only into a position under the same Appointing Authority. For purposes of this Section only, Appointing Authority in the Department of Transportation is the same as seniority unit.
2.	The employee shall have exhausted all bumping rights within his/her own bargaining unit or, if not in a bargaining unit, within the applicable framework.
3.	The employee shall fill a vacancy in a class in which he/she has previously served or for which he/she is determined to be qualified by the Employer and for which there are no bidders prior to bumping any employee in a bargaining unit represented by the Union. Employees in bargaining units represented by the Union shall be able to fill a vacancy prior to the vacancy being filled by an employee from a bargaining unit not represented by the Union.
All bumps under this part are subject to the general conditions provided for in this Article.
39
H.	Layoff Lists.
1.	Seniority Unit Layoff List. The names of employees who have been laid off or have accepted a demotion or another employment condition in lieu of layoff, or been demoted as a result of a reallocation, shall be automatically placed on a Seniority Unit Layoff List for the seniority unit, class (or class option), geographic location and employment condition from which they were demoted, laid off or reallocated downward, in the order of their Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6).
Employees may also indicate on a written or electronic document provided by the Appointing Authority, other employment conditions and geographic locations for which they are available. Employees who were not able to bump, transfer, or demote to a previously held class(es) in lieu of layoff shall be placed on the Seniority Unit Layoff List for the previously held bargaining unit class(es) for which they have indicated availability. Employees shall indicate on a written or electronic document provided by the Appointing Authority, the class(es), geographic location(s) and employment condition(s) for which they are available. Employees may change their availability by notifying the Department of Employee Relations in writing. Names shall be retained on the Seniority Unit Layoff List for a minimum of one (1) year or for a period of time equal to the employee's State Seniority, to a maximum of four (4) years.
2.	Class (or Class Option) Layoff List. If employees provide the required information, the names of such employees shall also be placed on a Class (or Class Option) Layoff List for the class (or class option) from which they were demoted in lieu of layoff, laid off, or reallocated downward in order of their Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6). Employees who were not able to bump, transfer, or demote to previously held class(es) in lieu of layoff shall also be placed on the Class (or Class Option) Layoff List for the previously held bargaining unit class(es) for which they have indicated availability. Names shall be retained on the Class (or Class Option) Layoff List for a minimum of one (1) year or for a period of time equal to the employee's Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6), to a maximum of three (3) years.
In order to be placed on the Class (or Class Option) Layoff List, the employee shall indicate, in writing on a document provided by the Appointing Authority, the geographic location(s) and the employment condition(s) for which he/she would accept employment. The employee may change his/her availability by notifying the Department of Employee Relations.
I.	Seniority Unit Vacancies. For a period of ninety (90) calendar days after an employee has been permanently laid off from State service, the employee may apply for vacant positions in an equal or lower classification in their former seniority unit and if they qualify for the position, the employee's name shall be considered on the basis of State Seniority in the manner provided in Article 12, Section 7E5.
J.	Recall. Employees shall be recalled from layoff in the order in which their names appear on the Seniority Unit Layoff List as provided in Section 3H of this Article (employee must be position-qualified if Unit 6).
An employee on either the Seniority Unit or Class Layoff List shall be notified of recall by written personal notice (receipted) or certified mail (return receipt required) sent to the employee's last known address at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the reporting date. The employee shall notify the Appointing Authority by certified mail (return receipt required) within five (5) calendar days of receipt of notification, of intent to return to work and shall report for work on the reporting date unless other arrangements are made. It shall be the employee's responsibility to keep the Appointing Authority informed of the employee's current address.
40
The Appointing Authority may temporarily assign employee(s) to any vacancies or openings to fulfill operating requirements during the period while the recall process is taking place.
K.	Removal From Layoff Lists. Employees shall be removed from all layoff lists for any of the following reasons:
1.	Recall to a permanent position from either layoff list except that an employee recalled to a permanent position in a different seniority unit or a different employment condition shall remain on the Seniority Unit Layoff List for his/her former location and employment condition only. If an employee is recalled to a previously held bargaining unit class, then he/she shall remain on the Seniority Unit and Class Layoff lists for former class(es) in a higher salary range than the class to which the employee was recalled. An employee who is recalled to a different seniority unit and who does not successfully complete the probationary period, shall be restored to the Seniority Unit Layoff List for the remainder of the time period originally provided in Section 3H.
2.	Failure to accept recall to a position which meets the availabilities specified by the employee except that employees who fail to accept recall from the Class (or Class Option) Layoff List shall be removed only from that list. An employee who fails to accept recall to an employment condition for which the employee indicated availability shall remain on the Seniority Unit Layoff List for his/her former employment condition only. An employee who fails to accept recall to a previously held bargaining unit class from the Class Layoff list for which the employee indicated availability shall remain on the Seniority Unit Layoff list for that class, and the Seniority Unit and Class Layoff lists for all classes in a higher salary range.
3.	Appointment to a permanent position in a class which is equal to or higher than the one for which the employee is on layoff list(s). If the employee is non-certified in this position, the employee’s name will be placed back on the layoff list(s) for the time remaining.
4.	Resignation, retirement or termination from State service.
Section 4.	Seasonal Layoff.
A.	Determination of Position(s). The Appointing Authority shall determine the position(s) in the class or class option, if one exists, and employment condition and principal place of employment which are affected.
B.	Advance Notice. The Appointing Authority shall notify the Union and the Local Union President of the classification(s), number of positions and employment condition(s) to be seasonally laid off at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the effective date of the anticipated layoff. At least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the effective date of the layoff, the Appointing Authority shall give written notice of the seasonal layoff to all employee(s) about to be seasonally laid off and to the Local Union President. The written notice of a seasonal layoff to seasonal employees shall include the reason for the seasonal layoff, anticipated date of recall, the anticipated length of the work season subsequent to the layoff, and notice of the need to indicate interest in temporary work.
C.	Layoff Order. Seasonal employees shall be seasonally laid off in inverse order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) within the employment condition, seniority unit and principal place of employment of the affected position(s) unless waived by mutual agreement between the employee and the Appointing Authority.
D.	Record of Employees on Seasonal Layoff. Each Appointing Authority shall maintain its own record of employees on seasonal layoff for recall purposes.
41
E.	Recall from Seasonal Layoff.
Seasonal employees shall be recalled in the order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6) to the seniority unit, employment condition, and principal place of employment from which they were laid off.
An employee on seasonal layoff shall be notified of recall by written personal notice (receipted), or certified mail (return receipt required) sent to the employee's last known address, at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the reporting date. The employee shall notify the Appointing Authority by certified mail (return receipt required) within five (5) calendar days of receipt of notification, of intent to return to work and shall report for work on the reporting date unless other arrangements are made. It shall be the employee's responsibility to keep the Appointing Authority informed of the employee's current address.
F.	Removal from the Seasonal Layoff Record.
Seasonal employees shall be removed from the seasonal layoff record for any of the following reasons:
1.	Failure to accept recall to a seasonal position.
2.	Conversion of the employee to permanent layoff as defined in Section 4G.
3.	Resignation, retirement, or termination from State service.
4.	Acceptance of a full-time or part-time unlimited position.
G.	Conversion to Permanent Layoff.
A seasonal employee shall be on permanent layoff in the following circumstances:
1.	the principal place of employment is abolished;
2.	there is no anticipated date of recall;
3.	the employee is not recalled from seasonal layoff within sixty (60) calendar days of the anticipated date of recall.
A seasonal employee who is permanently laid off shall have the right to exercise all the options under Section 3D.
Section 5.	Temporary or Emergency Positions. If a position is to be filled by a temporary or emergency appointment, the appointment shall be offered to employees in the following order prior to filling the position by any other means:
A.	Employees who are permanently laid off and not employed by the State if the position is in the same class, seniority unit, and geographic area from which they were laid off in order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6);
B.	Employees who are permanently laid off and not employed by the State if the position is in the same seniority unit and geographic area from which they were laid off and the employee is determined to be qualified for the appointment by the Appointing Authority in the order of State Seniority;
C.	Seasonal employees who are seasonally laid off if the position is in the same class and principal place of employment from which they were seasonally laid off in the order of Classification Seniority (State Seniority for Units 4 and 6);
42
D.	Seasonal employees who are seasonally laid off if the position is in the same principal place of employment from which they are seasonally laid off and the employee is determined to be qualified for the appointment by the Appointing Authority in the order of State Seniority.
In order to be eligible for emergency and temporary appointments, an employee must indicate in writing an interest to the Appointing Authority at the time of layoff.
The notice provisions of Section 3C and Section 4E shall not apply for filling such positions.
Employees accepting such positions shall be eligible employees for purposes of holidays, vacation leave and sick leave, provided such employees were eligible for those benefits in their immediately preceding appointment. Employees who were eligible for and enrolled in insurance coverage in their immediately preceding appointment will be eligible for those same coverages and at the same level of Employer contribution which they were previously receiving at the time of their layoff. This section shall not supercede the provisions of Article 19, Section 2B1 and Section 3C1. Such employees shall be eligible to bid only on vacancies in the class and seniority unit from which they were permanently or seasonally laid off under the provisions of Article 12, Section 6 of this Agreement. Upon expiration of the appointment, the employee shall return to full layoff status.
Section 6.	Limited Interruptions of Employment. Any interruption in employment not in excess of seven (7) consecutive calendar days or any reduction from an employee's normal work hours which continues two (2) calendar weeks or less shall not be considered a layoff. Such limited interruption or reduction in hours may occur as a result of adverse weather conditions, shortage of material or equipment, or for other unexpected or unusual reasons.
Prior to implementing a limited interruption of employment or a reduction in hours, the Appointing Authority, whenever practicable, shall meet with the Local Union to discuss the need for such action.
When the limited interruption of work or reduction in hours does not affect all employees in a class, employment condition, shift, and work location, the least senior employee(s) affected shall have their work interrupted or hours reduced. Limited interruption of work or reduction in hours shall not be instituted for the purpose of subcontracting work normally performed by the affected bargaining unit employees.
In the event limited interruptions of employment occur, employees shall, upon request, be entitled to advance of hours up to his/her scheduled hours in order to provide the employee with up to eighty (80) hours of earnings for a pay period. Advance of hours shall be allowed up to the maximum number of hours of an employee's accumulated and unused vacation leave. If an employee elects to draw such advances, the employee shall not be permitted to reduce the employee's vacation accumulation below the total hours advanced. However, no employee after the first six (6) months of Continuous Service shall be denied the right to use vacation time during a limited interruption of employment as long as vacation hours accrued exceed the hours that the employee has been advanced under this Section. All overtime hours worked subsequent to such advances shall be credited against the employee's aggregate advance of hours until the advance is reduced to zero (0). Employees may use compensatory time in lieu of vacation to provide a full paycheck. An Appointing Authority may require employees who have accrued compensatory time to use such time before the use of vacation. Such employees may choose not to make up the lost hours.
43
On the payroll period ending closest to November 1st of each year, all employees who have received such advances and have not worked sufficient overtime hours to reduce the advances to zero (0) will have their advances reduced to zero (0) by reduction of the employee's accumulated and unused vacation leave.
Section 1. Subcontracting. In the event the Appointing Authority finds it necessary to subcontract out work now being performed by employees that may result in a displacement of employees, the Local Union shall be notified no less than ninety (90) calendar days in advance. During this ninety (90) day period, the Appointing Authority shall meet with the Local Union and discuss ways and means of minimizing any impact the subcontracting may have on the employees.
Section 8.	Voluntary Reduction in Hours. Appointing Authorities may allow employee(s) to take unpaid leaves of absence to reduce layoffs otherwise necessary. If it is necessary to limit the number of employees in a work unit on unpaid leave at the same time, the Appointing Authority shall determine whether conflicts shall be resolved among classes or within a particular class based upon staffing needs. In either event, leave shall be granted on the basis of State Seniority within the employee's work unit.
Such employees taking leaves of absence under this Section shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave and be eligible for paid holidays and insurance benefits as if the employees had been actually employed during the time of leave. If a leave of absence is for one (1) full pay period or longer, any holiday pay shall be included in the first payroll period warrant after return from the leave of absence. Upon return from leave, the employee shall return to his/her former position.
Section 9.	Exclusion. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to unclassified employees.
ARTICLE 16 - DISCIPLINE AND DISCHARGE
Section 1.	Purpose. Disciplinary action may be imposed upon an employee only for just cause.
Section 2.	Union Representation. The Appointing Authority shall not meet with an employee for the purpose of questioning, in person or by a phone interview, the employee during an investigation that may lead to discipline without first offering the employee an opportunity for union representation, and such meeting shall not take place until a Union representative is available or is released by his/her supervisor. Any employee waiving the right to such representation must do so in writing prior to the questioning, however, in the case of a phone interview, an employee may initially waive the right to representation orally. A copy of such waiver shall be promptly furnished to the Local Union President or Steward. The employee shall be advised of the nature of the allegation(s) prior to questioning. However, if any employee is being questioned during an investigation of resident/patient abuse, the employee, upon request, shall have the right to union representation. If an employee is being questioned for any other purpose, the employee shall be given a general overview of the nature of the investigation. Upon request, an employee shall be provided a copy of the transcript of his/her interview, if available, and/or be allowed to listen to a tape of his/her interview, if any.
Section 3.	Disciplinary Procedure. Disciplinary action or measures shall include only the following:
1.	oral reprimand;
2.	written reprimand;
3.	suspension;
4.	demotion; and
5.	discharge.
44
If the Appointing Authority has reason to discipline an employee, it shall be done in a manner that shall not embarrass the employee before other employees or the public. Oral reprimands shall be identified as such. Oral reprimands cannot be referenced in future disciplines provided that no further disciplinary action has been taken against an employee for two (2) years from the date of the oral reprimand.
When any disciplinary action more severe than an oral reprimand is intended, the Appointing Authority shall, before or at the time such action is taken, notify the employee in writing of the specific reason(s) for such action, and shall provide the Local Union with copies of any written notices of disciplinary action.
An employee who has been notified by his/her Appointing Authority that he/she is being investigated for possible disciplinary action shall be informed, in writing, of the status of the investigation upon its conclusion.
Section 4.	Investigatory Leave. The Appointing Authority/designee may place an employee who is the subject of a disciplinary investigation on an investigatory leave with pay provided a reasonable basis exists to warrant such leave.
Section 5.	Discharge. The Appointing Authority shall not discharge any permanent employee without just cause. If the Appointing Authority feels there is just cause for discharge, the employee and the Local Union shall be notified, in writing, that the employee is to be discharged and shall be furnished with the reason(s) therefore and the effective date of the discharge. The employee may request an opportunity to hear an explanation of the evidence against him/her, to present his/her side of the story and is entitled to union representation at such meeting, upon request. The right to such meeting shall expire at the end of the next scheduled work day of the employee after the notice of discharge is delivered to the employee unless the employee and the Appointing Authority agree otherwise. The discharge shall not become effective during the period when the meeting may occur. The employee shall remain in pay status during the time between the notice of discharge and the expiration of the meeting. However, if the employee was not in pay status at the time of the notice of discharge, for reasons other than an investigatory leave, the requirement to be in pay status shall not apply.
Section 6.	Appeal Procedures. Any disciplinary action imposed upon an employee may be processed as a grievance through the regular grievance procedure as provided in Article 17.
The Union shall have the right to take up a suspension, demotion, and/or discharge as a grievance at the third step of the grievance procedure and the matter shall be handled in accord with this procedure through the arbitration step if deemed necessary.
The termination of unclassified employees is not subject to the arbitration provisions of Article 17 (Grievance Procedure).
Section 1. Personnel Files.
A.	Materials in File. Initial minor infractions, irregularities, or deficiencies shall first be privately brought to the attention of the employee and, if corrected, shall not be entered into the employee's personnel record.
An oral reprimand shall not become a part of an employee's personnel record. Investigations which do not result in disciplinary actions shall not be entered into the employee's personnel record. A written record of all disciplinary actions other than oral reprimands shall be entered into the employee's personnel record. All disciplinary entries in the personnel office record shall state the corrective action expected of the employee.
45
Each employee shall be furnished with a copy of all evaluative and disciplinary entries into the personnel office record and shall be entitled to have the employee's written response included therein.
Documentation regarding any wage garnishment action against an employee shall not be placed in the employee's personnel file.
Only the personnel office record may be used as evidence in any disciplinary action or hearing. This does not limit, restrict, or prohibit the Appointing Authority from submitting supportive documentation or testimony, either oral or written, in any disciplinary hearing, nor does it so limit the Union.
Any disciplinary material removed from a personnel file under this section may be referenced by the Employer in a future disciplinary action for purposes of notice, but cannot be used by the Employer to demonstrate progressive discipline.
B.	Employee/Union Access to File. The contents of an employee's personnel office record shall be disclosed to the employee upon request and to the employee's Union representative upon the written request of the employee. In the event a grievance is initiated under Article 17, the Appointing Authority shall provide a copy of any items from the employee's personnel office record upon the request of the employee. Up to ten (10) copies of such material shall be without cost to the employee, Local Union, or Union. A supervisor’s file is subject to the release provisions of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.
C.	Removing Materials from File. Upon the employee's request, the following documentation shall be removed from the employee's personnel file:
1.	a written reprimand provided that no further disciplinary action has been taken against the employee for two (2) years from the date of the written reprimand;
2.	a written record of a suspension of ten (10) days or less provided that no further disciplinary action has been taken against the employee for three (3) years from the effective date of the suspension;
3.	a written requirement to provide a medical statement (and any such statements) due to suspected sick leave abuse, provided that the employee has not received such a requirement for one (1) year from the expiration of the previous requirement.
4.	a "letter of expectation" provided that the employee has performed satisfactorily for one (1) year from the date of the "letter of expectation".
5.	Formal grievances filed by the Union in accordance with the provisions of Article 17, Grievance Procedure, shall not be retained in the employee’s personnel file. This includes the grievance form and the Settlement and Release document.

The supervisor shall then attempt to resolve the matter and shall respond to the Union Representative within seven (7) calendar days.
47
STEP 2: If the grievance has not been resolved to the satisfaction of the Local Union within seven (7) calendar days after the immediate supervisor's response is due, it may be presented in writing by the designated Union Representative to the next level of supervision which has been designated by the Appointing Authority to process grievances. The written grievances shall state the nature of the grievance, the facts upon which it is based, the provision(s) of the Agreement allegedly violated, and the relief requested. The designated Appointing Authority Representative shall arrange a meeting with the Union Representative(s) to discuss the grievance within seven (7) calendar days.

Except as provided in the procedures for Section 4, expenses for the arbitrator's services and the proceedings shall be borne by the losing party, however, each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representatives and witnesses. If either party cancels an arbitration hearing or asks for a last minute postponement that leads to the arbitrator's making a charge, the canceling party or the party asking for the postponement shall pay this charge. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the parties. Except as provided in the procedures for Section 4, the arbitrator shall be requested to issue his/her decision within thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of testimony and argument. If either party desires a verbatim record of the arbitration proceedings, it may cause such a record to be made, providing it pays for the record and makes a copy available without charge to the other party and the arbitrator.
E.	The Union and the Employer agree to meet and confer to review the grievance procedure as it applies to small agencies and boards.
Section 3.	Arbitration. Except as indicated in Section 4 below, all arbitrations arising under this Agreement shall be conducted by an Arbitrator to be selected by mutual agreement of the Employer and the Union. If the parties fail to mutually agree upon the arbitrator, the parties shall request a list of five (5) arbitrators from the Bureau of Mediation Services. Both the Employer and the Union shall have the right to strike two (2) names from the list. A coin shall be flipped to determine which party shall strike the first name.

He/she shall consider and decide only the specific issue or issues submitted to him/her in writing by the parties of this Agreement, and shall have no authority to make a decision on any other matter not so submitted to him/her. The arbitrator shall be without power to make decisions contrary to, inconsistent with, or modifying or varying in any way the application of laws, rules, or regulations having the force and effect of law. The decision shall be based solely upon the arbitrator's interpretation and application of the expressed terms of this Agreement and to the facts of the grievance presented.
Section 6.	Time Limits. If a grievance is not presented within the time limits set forth above or the time limits set forth in a Supplemental Agreement, it shall be considered "waived." If a grievance is not appealed to the next step or steps within the specified time limit or any agreed extension thereof, it shall be considered settled on the basis of the Appointing Authority's last answer. If the Appointing Authority or its agents does not answer a grievance or an appeal thereof within the specified time limits, the Union or its agents may elect to treat the grievance as denied at that step and immediately appeal the grievance to the next step. The time limit in each step may be extended by mutual written agreement of the Appointing Authority or its agents and the Union or its agents in each step and such extension will not be unduly denied. By mutual agreement of the Appointing Authority and the Union, the parties may waive Steps 1, 2 and/or 3.

Should any employee who has received severance pay be subsequently reappointed to State service, eligibility for future severance pay shall be computed upon the difference between the amount of accumulated but unused sick leave restored to the employee's credit at the time the employee was reappointed and the amount of accumulated but unused sick leave at the time of the employee's subsequent eligibility for severance pay.
Such severance pay shall be excluded from retirement deductions and from any calculations in retirement benefits and shall be paid over a period not to exceed two (2) years from termination of employment.

If such employee ceases to receive workers' compensation payments for the injury or disability and is granted a medical leave under Article 10, he/she shall be eligible for an Employer contribution during that leave.
4.	Corrections Early Retirement Incentive.

57
Employees exercising this option must be eligible for insurance coverage under the provisions of this Article and shall be provided with health and dental insurance which the employee was entitled to at the time of retirement, subject to any changes in coverage in accordance with this or any subsequent Agreement. Employees eligible to receive an Employer Contribution for medical and dental coverage immediately prior to taking advantage of the early retirement incentive shall continue to receive an Employer Contribution as set forth below for themselves and their enrolled dependents until the employee attains the age of sixty-five (65). An employee who retires with no Employer Contribution for dependent coverage or who terminates dependent coverage following retirement, shall not subsequently be eligible for a contribution for dependent coverage. Receipt of early retirement insurance benefits is contingent upon completion of all the required forms and continued payment of the required premium.
b.	Any employee who attains the age of fifty (50) after the effective date and before the expiration date of the contract and who is covered by the Correctional Pre-Fifty-five (55) Early Retirement Plan may opt during any pay period between that in which his/her fiftieth (50th) birthday occurs through the pay period in which his/her fifty-fifth (55th) birthday occurs, to take advantage of the pre fifty-five (55) early retirement incentive.

D.	Maintaining Eligibility for Employer Contribution.
1.	General. An employee who receives a full or partial Employer Contribution maintains that eligibility as long as the employee meets the Employer Contribution eligibility requirements, and appears on a State payroll for at least one (1) full working day during each payroll period. This requirement does not apply to employees who receive an Employer Contribution while on layoff as described in Section 3C2, or while eligible for workers' compensation payments as described in Section 3C3.
2.	Unpaid Leave of Absence. If an employee is on an unpaid leave of absence, then vacation leave, compensatory time, or sick leave cannot be used for the purpose of maintaining eligibility for an Employer Contribution by keeping the employee on a State payroll for one (1) working day per pay period.
58
3.	School Year Employment. If an employee is employed on the basis of a school year and such employment contemplates absences from the State payroll during the summer months or vacation periods scheduled by the Appointing Authority which occur during the regular school year, the employee shall nonetheless remain eligible for an Employer Contribution, provided that the employee appears on the regular payroll for at least one (1) working day in the payroll period immediately preceding such absences.
4.	An employee who is on an approved FMI_A leave or on a Voluntary Reduction in Hours as provided elsewhere in this Agreement maintains eligibility for an Employer Contribution.

Section 5.	Coverage Changes and Effective Dates.
A.	When Coverage May Be Chosen.
1.	Newly Hired Employees. All employees hired to an insurance eligible position must make their benefit elections by their initial effective date of coverage as defined in this Article, Section 5C. Insurance eligible employees will automatically be enrolled in basic life coverage. If employees eligible for a full Employer Contribution do not choose a health plan administrator and a primary care clinic by their initial effective date, they will be enrolled in a Benefit Level Two clinic (or Level One, if available) that meets established access standards in the health plan with the largest number of Benefit Level One and Two clinics in the county of the employee’s residence at the beginning of the insurance year.
59
2.	Eligibility Changes. Employees who become eligible for a full Employer Contribution must make their benefit elections within thirty (30) calendar days of becoming eligible. If employees do not choose a health plan administrator and a primary care clinic within this thirty (30) day timeframe, they will be enrolled in a Benefit Level Two clinic (or Level One, if available) that meets established access standards in the health plan with the largest number of Benefit Level One and Two clinics in the county of the employee’s residence at the beginning of the insurance year.
If employees who become eligible for a partial Employer Contribution choose to enroll in insurance, they must do so within thirty (30) days of becoming eligible or during open enrollment.
An employee may change his/her health or dental plan if the employee changes to a new permanent work or residence location and the employee's current plan is no longer available. If the employee has family coverage and if the new residence location is outside of the current plan’s service area, the employee shall be permitted to switch to a new plan administrator and new Benefit Level within thirty (30) days of the residence location change. The election change must be due to and correspond with the change in status. An employee who receives notification of a work location change between the end of an open enrollment period and the beginning of the next insurance year, may change his/her health or dental plan within thirty (30) days of the date of the relocation under the same provisions accorded during the last open enrollment period. An employee or retiree may also change health or dental plans in any other situation in which the Employer is required by the applicable federal or state law to allow a plan change.
B.	When Coverage May be Changed or Cancelled.
1.	Changes Due to a Life Event. After the initial enrollment period and outside of any open enrollment period, an employee may elect to change health or dental coverage (including adding or canceling coverage) and any applicable employee contributions in the following situations (as long as allowed under the applicable provisions, regulations, and rules of the federal and state law in effect at the beginning of the plan year).
The request to change coverage must be consistent with a change in status that qualifies as a life event, and does not include changing health or dental plans, which may only be done under the terms of Section 5A above. Any election to add coverage must be made within thirty (30) days following the event, and any election to cancel coverage must be made within sixty (60) days following the event. (An employee and a retired employee may add dependent health or dental coverage following the birth of a child or dependent grandchild, or following the adoption of a child, without regard to the thirty (30) day limit.) These life events (for both employees and retirees) are:
a.	A change in legal marital status, including marriage, death of a spouse, divorce, legal separation and annulment.
b.	A change in number of dependents, including birth, death, adoption, and placement for adoption.
c.	A change in employment status of the employee, or the employee’s or retiree’s spouse or dependent, including termination or commencement of employment, a strike or lockout, a commencement of or return from an unpaid leave of absence, a change in worksite, and a change in working conditions (including changing between part-time and full-time or hourly and salary) of the employee, the employee’s or retiree’s spouse or dependent which results in a change in the benefits they receive under a cafeteria plan or a health or dental plan.
60
d.	A dependent ceasing to satisfy eligibility requirements for coverage due to attainment of age, student status, marital status, or other similar circumstances.
e.	A change in the place of residence of the employee, retiree or their spouse or dependent.

I.	A COBRA-qualifying event.
m.	Loss of coverage under the group health plan of a governmental or educational institution (a State’s children’s health insurance program, medical care program of an Indian tribal government, State health benefits risk pool, or foreign government group health plan).
n. Entitlement to Medicare or Medicaid.
o.	Any other situations in which the group health or dental plan is required by the applicable federal or state law to allow a change in coverage.
2.	Canceling Dependent Coverage During Open Enrollment. In addition to the above situations, dependent health or dependent dental coverage may also be cancelled for any reason during the open enrollment period that applies to each type of plan (as long as allowed under the applicable provisions, regulations and rules of the federal and state law in effect at the beginning of the plan year).
3.	Canceling Employee Coverage. A part-time employee may also cancel employee coverage within sixty (60) days of when one of the life events set forth above occurs.
4.	Effective Date of Benefit Termination. Medical, dental and life coverage termination will take effect on the first of the month following the loss of eligible employee or dependent status. Disability benefit coverage terminations will take effect on the day following loss of eligible employee status.
C.	Effective Date of Coverage.
1.	Initial Effective Date. The initial effective date of coverage under the Group Insurance Program is the thirty-fifth (35th) day following the employee's first day of employment, rehire, or reinstatement with the State. The initial effective date of coverage for an employee whose eligibility has changed is the date of the change. An employee must be actively at work on the initial effective date of coverage, except that an employee who is on paid leave on the date State-paid life insurance benefits increase is also entitled to the increased life insurance coverage. In no event shall an employee's dependent's coverage become effective before the employee's coverage.
61
If an employee is not actively at work due to employee or dependent health status or medical disability, medical and dental coverage will still take effect. (Life and disability coverage will be delayed until the employee returns to work.)
2.	Delay in Coverage Effective Date.
a.	Basic Life. If an employee is not actively at work on the initial effective date of coverage, coverage will be effective on the first day of the employee’s return to work. The effective date of a change in coverage is not delayed in the event that, on the date the coverage change would be effective, an employee is on an unpaid leave of absence or layoff.
b.	Medical and Dental. If an employee is not actively at work on the initial effective date of coverage due to a reason other than hospitalization or medical disability of the employee or dependent, medical and dental coverage will be effective on the first day of the employee’s return to work.
The effective date of a change in coverage is not delayed in the event that, on the date the coverage change would be effective, an employee is on an unpaid leave of absence or layoff.
c.	Optional Life and Disability Coverages. In order for coverage to become effective, the employee must be in active payroll status and not using sick leave on the first day following approval by the insurance company. If it is an open enrollment period, coverage may be applied for but will not become effective until the first day of the employee's return to work.
D.	Open Enrollment.
1.	Freguency and Duration. There shall be an open enrollment period for health coverage in each year of this Agreement, and for dental coverage in the first year of this Agreement. Each year of the Agreement, all employees shall have the option to complete a Health Assessment.

Subject to a timely contract settlement, the Employer shall make open enrollment materials available to employees at least fourteen (14) days prior to the start of the open enrollment period.
2.	Eligibility to Participate. An employee eligible to participate in the State Employee Group Insurance Program, as described in Sections 2A and 2B, may participate in open enrollment. In addition, a person in the following categories may, as allowed in section 5D1 above, make certain changes: (1) a former employee or dependent on continuation coverage, as described in Section 2D, may change plans or add coverage for health and/or dental plans on the same basis as active employees; and (2) an early retiree, prior to becoming eligible for Medicare, may change health and/or dental plans as agreed to for active employees, but may not add dependent coverage.
3.	Materials for Employee Choice. Each year prior to open enrollment, the Appointing Authority will give eligible employees the information necessary to make open enrollment selections. Employees will be provided a statement of their current coverage each year of the contract.
62
E.	Coverage Selection Prior to Retirement. An employee who retires and is eligible to continue insurance coverage as a retiree may change his/her health or dental plan during the sixty (60) calendar day period immediately preceding the date of retirement.

Approval for this training is at the discretion of the Appointing Authority and is contingent upon meeting staffing needs in the employee's absence and the availability of funds. Employees are eligible for release time, tuition reimbursement, or a pro rata combination of both.

Local Committees shall be composed of no more than seven (7) representatives from each State agency and the Local Union(s).
82
The purpose of such Committees shall be to improve communications between the Appointing Authority and the Local Union and to serve as a forum in which issues of mutual concern can be discussed.

B.	Employment. The State agrees to maintain the policy of attempting to place employees who have incurred a work-related disability in areas of work which would fit the employee's physical capabilities but not to create a job just to provide employment.
C.	Union Notification. When there are any special return to work accommodations for employees on Workers' Compensation, the Appointing Authority shall notify the Local Union and, upon request, shall meet with the Local Union.
D.	Article 12 Waiver. The parties may agree to waive Article 12 by mutual agreement to implement this Section.
83
Section 2.	Sick Leave/Vacation Leave Coordination. When an employee on Workers' Compensation benefits has decided to use sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time to supplement his/her Workers' Compensation benefits the following procedure applies: The employee shall notify the Appointing Authority in writing that he/she wishes to supplement his/her Workers' Compensation check through use of sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time. Sick leave must be exhausted before the vacation leave or compensatory time can be used. The Appointing Authority shall obtain from the Workers' Compensation Division the amount of the benefit check and automatically authorize a payroll check in the amount of the difference between the benefit check and the employee's regular gross pay for the employee's normal pay period. The employee's sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time balance shall be reduced by the amount of the payroll check divided by the employee's hourly rate of pay at the time the payroll check is issued.
An employee who uses sick leave or vacation leave or compensatory time while awaiting the determination of the Worker's Compensation claim shall retain the Worker's Compensation payment. The Appointing Authority shall collect the payroll overpayment by processing a prior period adjustment(s). The Appointing Authority shall credit back to the employee's sick leave, vacation leave or compensatory time the number of hours equal to the amount of the Worker's Compensation check divided by the employee's hourly rate.
Section 3.	Insurance. Benefits provided under Article 19 shall continue as long as an employee meets the eligibility requirements of Article 19 and is off the State payroll due to a work-related injury or work-related disability and is receiving or is eligible to receive Workers' Compensation payments.
When an employee has incurred an on-the-job injury or disability and has filed a claim for Workers' Compensation, medical costs connected with the injury or disability shall be paid by the Health Maintenance Organization or the Health Insurance Carrier pursuant to the provisions of M.S. 1982, 176.191, Subdivision 3 if a dispute exists as to whether an employee’s injury is compensable under Minnesota Statutes Chapter 176.
ARTICLE 33	- EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The Union and the Employer recognize that problems not directly associated with the employee's job function can affect an employee's job performance. The Union and the Employer believe it is in the interest of the employee, his/her family, and the Employer to provide a voluntary employee assistance program which offers confidential, professional help to employees and their dependents to resolve such problems. To that end, both parties hereby endorse and support the State of Minnesota's Employee Assistance Program, as established and operated by the Department of Employee Relations. A referral to EAP shall not be referenced on a performance appraisal or evaluation. The Employer and the Union agree to form a Joint Labor/Management Committee on Employee Assistance. The Committee will be composed of an equal number of representatives for the Union and the Employer. The Committee shall be chaired by the Director of the Employee Assistance Program. The Committee shall review the state EAP program, EAP provider networks, and EAP training programs for employees and supervisors. The Employer may, with the approval of the Union, add to the Committee additional employees from other exclusive representatives.
84
ARTICLE 34	- ADA/WORKERS' COMPENSATION
Section 1.	Purpose. The Union and the Employer agree that they have a joint obligation to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Union and the Employer agree that they have the obligation to consider accommodation requests from qualified ADA individuals and employees returning from workers' compensation injuries. The Employer agrees to maintain the policy of attempting to place employees who have incurred a work-related disability in areas of work which would fit the employee's physical capabilities but not to create a job just to provide employment.
The Appointing Authority shall provide these reasonable accommodations in a fair and equitable manner. Should reasonable accommodation request(s) raise the question of waiving the collective bargaining agreement, the Employer and the Union shall follow the procedures in Section 3.
Section 2.	Information. Both parties recognize their responsibility for confidentiality. The Union agrees to prepare an informational brochure which the Appointing Authority will provide to any employee who requests a reasonable accommodation. Upon request of the Local Union, the Appointing Authority shall provide a report of all accommodation requests, whether each request was approved or denied, accommodations made, and the cost of each accommodation.
Section 3.	Process. Upon request, an employee seeking an accommodation shall be entitled to union representation. The union representative and the employee shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time during working hours, without loss of pay, to discuss the request. The Appointing Authority shall review employee requests for accommodations considering ADA guidelines on equipment purchase or modification, accessibility improvement, and scheduling modifications and/or restructuring of current positions and duties allowable under the collective bargaining agreement, before considering or requesting waiver of the collective bargaining agreement.
If the Appointing Authority determines that contract waiver is necessary, it shall contact the local union to convene a meet and confer to be held within a reasonable time during normal working hours with union designee(s) on employer-paid time. At this meeting, the Appointing Authority shall inform the local union of the employee's restriction(s) subject to each party's confidentiality obligations, the specific article(s) to be waived and the manner in which the Appointing Authority proposes to modify that article(s).
At this meeting, the Appointing Authority shall also consider additional options presented by the Local Union. Between the meet and confer and notification to the Appointing Authority of the Local Union's decision, the Appointing Authority may make temporary accommodations. Any contract waiver must be agreed to by both the Appointing Authority and the Local Union or the Council 5 Executive Board.
If an employee's job duties are changed as a result of an accommodation, the employee's supervisor shall inform the employee's co-workers of any restrictions that might impact on their job duties. The supervisor shall use discretion when relaying this information.
ARTICLE 35 - DURATION

Mr. Peter Benner, Executive Director
AFSCME Council 6, AFL-CIO
300 Hardman Avenue South
South St. Paul, MN 55075
Dear Pete:
As we discussed in negotiations, the State and the Union have agreed to change the method used to calculate holiday pay proration for employees who work less than full time. This change will be effective on October 1, 1997.
The State will provide the following direction to agencies in this matter:
Part-time employees and eligible intermittent employees who are not working on the holiday shall have holiday pay calculated based on the number of hours paid in the pay period divided by the number of non-holiday hours in the pay period. For example: for pay periods containing one holiday, the employee’s hours paid would be divided by 72; for pay periods containing two holidays, the employee’s hours paid would be divided by 64; and for pay periods containing three holidays, the employee’s hours paid would be divided by 56. This ratio will then be multiplied by eight and rounded to the nearest whole hour to determine the number of holiday hours paid. See Appendix B1.
For part-time employees only, uncompensated approved leave will be counted as “hours paid,” but only for scheduled hours for which the employee requests and is granted time off as an unpaid leave of absence. Such approved leave without pay (LWOP) must be clearly marked on the timesheet and will be coded as such. A change in unscheduled days does not constitute an unpaid leave.
Overtime compensated at the rate of time and one-half shall not count as hours worked or paid. Overtime compensated at the rate of straight time (i.e. “part-time pilot” situations) shall count as hours worked or paid.
If an employee is appointed or recalled during a pay period in which a holiday(s) occurs, and the employee is eligible for holiday pay, the proration shall be based on the hours worked or paid in the next pay period which does not include a holiday. For this purpose, and for those employees on a voluntary reduction in hours, use the table in Appendix B.
If an employee is laid off or terminated during a pay period in which a holiday(s) occurs, and the employee is eligible for holiday pay, the proration shall be based on the hours worked or paid in the most recent pay period which does not include a holiday. For this purpose, use the table in Appendix B.
Sincerely,
Wayne Simoneau /s/ Deputy Commissioner

**For purposes of this Appendix, “hours worked/paid” means all hours worked, and all paid leaves of absence, paid vacation and sick leave, paid holidays and compensatory time off.

APPENDIX J - PROHIBITION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT
It is agreed by the Employer and the Union that all employees have a right to a workplace free of verbal and/or physical sexual harassment. "Sexual harassment" includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, sexually motivated physical contact or communication of a sexual nature when:
1.	Submission to that conduct or communication is made a term or condition, either explicitly or implicitly, of obtaining employment;
2.	Submission to or rejection of that conduct or communication by an individual is used as a factor in decisions affecting that individual's employment; or
3.	That conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's employment or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive employment environment.
The Employer agrees that all agency complaint procedures for sexual harassment shall be opened to Union participation at the request of the complaining employee and that each Appointing Authority/designee shall inform a complaining party of this right. Further, the Employer and Union agree that agency complaint procedures covering sexual harassment are modified to include these additional requirements:
1.	When a complaint of sexual harassment is initiated, a notice of a complaint in progress will be sent by the Appointing Authority/designee to the Union. If in filing a complaint an employee states that she/he is unable to function in the worksite from which the complaint arose, the Appointing Authority/designee shall conduct a preliminary investigation within two (2) working days. If this preliminary investigation establishes that a reasonable basis for the employee's concern about continuing in the work situation exists, the Appointing Authority/designee shall take intervening action to defuse the situation which may include temporarily reassigning either party until such time as the complaint is fully investigated, there is a finding, and corrective action, if required, is implemented.
2.	Within thirty (30) calendar days, the Appointing Authority/designee shall conduct a full investigation and prepare a report along with designated actions to be taken to remedy the complaint. If the complaining employee has requested the Union's involvement in the complaint, the Union's representative as well as the complainant shall be provided a written summary of the findings and resolution. The Union and Employer agree that all hearings and records shall be private and that reprisal against an aggrieved employee or a witness is prohibited.
3.	If the Appointing Authority fails to respond or fails to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the appealing party, then the complaint may be referred to the Equal Opportunity Division of the Department of Employee Relations for review within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the response or lack of response by the Appointing Authority. The Equal Opportunity Division shall confer within ten (10) working days with the Appointing Authority/designee involved in an attempt to resolve the complaint.
Any complaint which is not resolved by this procedure is not subject to the provisions of Article 17 of the Master Agreement between the Union and the Employer. Such unresolved complaints, if pursued, must be filed with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights within one (1) year of the occurrence of the alleged harassment.

APPENDIX K - APPOINTING AUTHORITY/DESIGNEE'S DUTY TO FURNISH INFORMATION TO EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVES REGARDING CONTRACT GRIEVANCES
I.	Purpose
To provide guidelines for State agencies regarding release of information requested by exclusive representatives as part of the grievance process so that Appointing Authorities/designees can determine what information to release and when to release it.
II.	Policy
Under the Public Employment Labor Relations Act (PELRA), exclusive representatives have rights to information which is relevant to enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement and is necessary for them to make informed decisions about processing grievances. Consequently, subject to these guidelines, Appointing Authorities/designees must furnish to the exclusive representatives requested information that is necessary for the exclusive representatives to fulfill their duty of representation. Disclosure of such information must be consistent with the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, the Minnesota Vulnerable Adults Act and any other applicable state or federal statute.
III.	What Information Should Be Disclosed To The Exclusive Representatives
A.	An Appointing Authority/designee has no duty to supply exclusive representatives with information absent a request from the exclusive representative.
B.	Non-public information that is requested must be relevant to the exclusive representative's role in representing employees in the bargaining unit. Information is relevant if it appears to be "reasonably necessary" for the exclusive representative to perform its duty to investigate and process grievances or to fulfill its collective bargaining objectives. Unless the disclosure of data is prohibited by statute (e.g., Vulnerable Adults Act, Data Practices Act) or plainly appears irrelevant, the information must be disclosed to the exclusive representative, if so requested. If the Appointing Authority/designee withholds information on the basis of a provision of the Data Practices Act, the Appointing Authority/designee is required to explain, orally and in writing, the statutory basis for the refusal to provide such information.
It should be noted that exclusive representatives have the same right to obtain "public" data as any other party. This right exists even if the data requested appears irrelevant to a grievance at hand or some other business of the exclusive representative.
C.	Information must be released to the exclusive representative in a useful and timely fashion. This does not mean that the Appointing Authority/designee must necessarily provide the information in the form requested by the exclusive representative. However, under the Data Practices Act, the Appointing Authority/designee is required, upon request, to explain the meaning of the data that is being provided.
140
D.	If the Appointing Authority/designee believes that collecting or compiling requested information is unduly burdensome, or that the exclusive representative's request for information is too broad or vague, the Appointing Authority/designee must raise this problem with the exclusive representative promptly. In this situation, the Appointing Authority/designee must attempt to work out acceptable arrangements with the exclusive representative so that the release of the information can accommodate the needs of both parties. In short, an Appointing Authority/designee cannot refuse to release information simply due to administrative hardships or solely because the request is not specific enough.
Unless there are specific contract provisions to the contrary, the Appointing Authority can require that the exclusive representative pay the actual costs of gathering the information and making and compiling the copies.
IV.	Information That May Be Protected
Certain information under the Data Practices Act is considered "private" information. This means that only the individual upon whom the information is based has access to the data, unless the individual consents to the release of the data. Therefore, if an exclusive representative requests "private" data on an individual, such information cannot be released until the exclusive representative presents to the Appointing Authority/designee a proper and appropriate consent form from the involved individual permitting the Appointing Authority/designee to release the information to the exclusive representative. If such a consent is obtained and the information is relevant, the data must be released to the exclusive representative.
Also, under the Vulnerable Adults Act, certain types of information, such as data on residents, clients, patients, and names of individuals reporting resident abuse to the DHS licensing agency under that specific section of the statute, are "private" and may not be released to the exclusive representative unless the exclusive representative presents the Appointing Authority/designee an informed consent from the involved individual or guardian.
If the exclusive representative requests information that is "confidential" under the Data Practices Act, the request must be denied. For example, during the period when the Appointing Authority/designee is in the process of conducting an investigation regarding employee misconduct, witness statements, interview notes, and formal investigatory reports are considered "civil investigative data." Such data is classified as "confidential" under the Data Practices Act. Therefore, the Appointing Authority/designee may not release any of this kind of data to the exclusive representative. However, once the investigation has been completed and disciplinary action has been taken, witness statements, interview notes, and formal investigatory reports are releasable to the exclusive representative upon request.
V.	Fear Of Retaliation Against Management's Witness
At times, the Appointing Authority/designee may have reason to believe that releasing the names of witnesses or their statements to the exclusive representative may subject witnesses to harassment. However, in general, a mere belief that witnesses may be subjected to harassment should not preclude releasing the names. Rather, there must be evidence that the witnesses are being or would be subjected to harassment if the exclusive representative were aware of the names. It is anticipated that this type of situation would occur rarely. However, if it does occur, then the Labor Relations Bureau should be notified so that appropriate arrangements can be made to safeguard the witnesses. The names will eventually be released to the exclusive representative with witness statements or summaries thereof, but under controlled conditions.
141
VI.	"When" The Requested Information Should Be Released To The Exclusive Representative
Generally, an exclusive representative should not be given data or information prior to a formal grievance being filed. However, if the Appointing Authority/designee believes that disclosing certain information to the exclusive representative could resolve a dispute thereby preventing the filing of an official grievance, the Appointing Authority/designee may decide to disclose such information. Thus, "pre-grievance" disclosure is optional with the Appointing Authority/designee, consistent with all of the above guidelines.
The Labor Relations Bureau encourages Appointing Authorities to cooperate in the release of information at an early stage in the grievance process. Often grievances can be resolved at these earlier steps if the exclusive representative has access to information upon which to base a decision as to whether or not to proceed with the grievance. Accordingly, if an exclusive representative requests relevant information at the first or second step of the grievance procedure, generally the information should be released unless the issue has not yet crystallized to the point where the Appointing Authority can determine whether or not the requested information, if non-public, is relevant. However, before disclosing such information, line supervisors and managers should be aware of the implication such information will have on the impact the final outcome of the grievance.
If the information has not been released at an earlier stage and an exclusive representative requests information at the third step of the grievance procedure, the Appointing Authority/designee must release the information, under the standards discussed in this policy, to the exclusive representative. The Appointing Authority/designee should consider meeting with the exclusive representative prior to the actual third step meeting to disclose as well as explain the information in a single setting. A third step meeting would then be held at a later time. Another option is to begin the third step meeting by providing the information to the exclusive representative, explaining it as necessary, and then proceeding with the meeting.
VII.	Exceptions
Each request for information should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The specific facts of any particular situation will determine the appropriate action. If the Appointing Authority/designee has any questions as to what information should be released and/or when it should be released, the Labor Relations Bureau should be contacted.
142
APPENDIX L - POLICY ON VDT ERGONOMICS
Prepared Jointly by AFSCME, Council 5 and the Department of Employee Relations Through A Joint Labor-Management Committee
Purpose and Scope. This policy is intended to provide guidelines to state agencies and employees addressing ergonomic considerations associated with the operation of Video Display Terminals (VDTs).
Specifically, this policy provides agencies with options they should explore to enhance the general working conditions of those employees who operate a VDT and encourages discussion with employees who will be operating new VDT hardware and/or software being purchased.
This policy is not subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions contained in Article 17 of this Agreement.
Policy. It is the policy of the State Executive Branch to provide employees who work with VDT's on a continuing and substantial basis with a consistent reference in regard to recognized workplace hazards and work station comfort which would enable state employees to perform productively.
Policy Guidelines
A.	Illumination: Effective illumination in the space housing VDTs/CRTs (Cathode Ray Tube) is an important part of insuring health and user comfort. Lighting levels for VDT/CRT work should be substantially lower than for tasks using printed materials or in traditional office work. Illumination is measured in units called lux, or footcandles. While the lighting in offices is usually 750 lux (75 footcandles) and higher, the lighting level where VDTs are used should be in a lower range (200-500 lux or 20-50 footcandles).
Lower lighting can be accomplished by simply removing bulbs or reaching an agreement with the building lessor to make arrangements for more suitable lighting conditions. Task lighting may be necessary in areas where illumination levels are particularly low. The Safety and Workers' Compensation Director's Office or your Department Safety Officer are able to provide assistance in determining appropriate lighting levels.
B.	Control of Glare and Reflection: Glare and reflection are primary problems for employees who operate VDT/CRTs. As a result of these problems, operators may incur eye discomfort or eye strain. A number of corrective actions should be taken to alleviate these problems including the use of indirect lighting, covering windows with blinds, repositioning work stations so that operators are not facing windows or bright lights, and use of hoods around screens. As a general rule, screens should not be placed with a window directly in front or behind the terminal and the screen should be positioned at a 90 degree angle to windows. Managers should review VDT/CRT work areas and act to correct glare and reflection problems.
143
C.	Work Station Design: Many musculoskeletal problems of fatigue and stress which may arise through VDT/CRT use can be reduced through proper work station design. Agencies should consider suggested ergonomic recommendations when purchasing equipment, redesigning work areas, and when employees express concerns. It is the policy of the employer to select equipment which meets industry standards in regard to character height and width, character spacing, word and line spacing, and character format. Aspects which should be considered in work station design include screen placement and color; keyboard, chair, and table height; and use of related equipment to reduce strain and maximize the comfort of the work station. Examples of such considerations include:
•	Adjustable platforms for terminals and keyboards. An operator's arms should be parallel to the floor when keying.
•	Proper distance between the eyes and the screen (suggested between 18 and 30 inches) and use of screens which are capable of tilting backwards to provide a comfortable viewing angle.
•	Keyboards that are detachable or separate from the terminal so that their placement for height and angle can be adjusted by the operator. Other keyboard factors may include size and weight of the keyboard and the keytouch.
•	Use of wrist supports. There are different kinds of equipment available for supporting wrists during keying including padded wristrests or chairs with wrist support arms.
•	Use of footrests if necessary to have the operators feet resting flat on the floor.
•	Color of screens seems to be a matter of personal preference, although some research has shown that red and blue should be avoided. Most screens in use today are called negative polarity, or light characters against a dark background. Some people appear to prefer positive polarity, or dark characters on a light background because they feel it aids in focusing, requires less adaptation by the viewer, and decreases glare and reflections on the screen.
•	Use of document holders to keep printed materials at the same height, plain and angle as the screen, thus eliminating excessive twisting and bending movements of the neck, as well as minimizing constant eye refocusing.
Assigning employees to specific work stations, as much as possible, is advisable to prevent the need for frequent readjustments. Your Department Safety Officer or the Safety and Workers' Compensation Director's Office may be called upon for assistance in designing work stations.
D.	Office Environment/Design: Extraneous factors such as noise, humidity, and heat produced by the VDT/CRT can add to operator discomfort and stress. Locating work stations away from heat and cooling vents provides for increased operator comfort. Printers are often a major source of excessive noise for VDT work. Decreased noise levels can be obtained by installing acoustic pads and covers for printers or by locating printers in another room or at a distance from workers.
E.	Maintenance of Equipment: Regular inspection of terminals and work station equipment should be conducted by the operator as part of his/her regular duties. Frequent inspections of the display screen controls should be conducted to ensure they are operating correctly, as well as chair adjustments. Screens should also be dusted regularly to provide maximum visual clarity. The manager or supervisor should periodically monitor this activity to ensure that operators are carrying out their responsibilities. In the event that service is necessary, the vendor should be contacted.
144
F.	VDT Work Routine Interruptions: Employees should periodically be given the opportunity to work on alternate tasks, enabling the operator to flex other parts of their body and adjust vision to different site conditions. Alternate tasks are particularly important when the operator spends a large amount of uninterrupted time at the terminal. Incorporating non-VDT tasks into the job whenever possible is helpful in relieving the monotony that can be caused by performance of repetitive tasks and can give the employee the opportunity to build additional job skills. In addition to the above recommendations, the collective bargaining agreement between the State of Minnesota and AFSCME, Council No. 5, provides for alternative work assignments or a rest period during each four hour period, in addition to the regular rest periods (Article 11, Section 3E).

"INCAPABLE OF SELF-CARE" 825.113
Incapable of self-care means that the individual requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily self-care in three or more of the “activities of daily living” (ADLs) or “instrumental activities of daily living” (lADLs).
"IN LOCO PARENTIS" 825.113
Persons who are “in loco parentis” include those with day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially support a child or, in the case of an employee, who had such responsibility for the employee when the employee was a child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.
"PARENT" 825.113

"SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION" 825.114
For purposes of the FMLA, serious health condition means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:
A.	Inpatient care, i.e., an overnight stay, in a hospital, hospice, or residential care facility, including any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care; or
B.	Continuing treatment by a health care provider that involves:
1.	A period of incapacity (i.e., inability to work, attend school or perform other regular daily activities due to the serious health condition, treatment therefor, or recovery therefrom) of more than three consecutive calendar days; and
2.	Any subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves:
(a)	Treatment two or more times by a health care provider, by a nurse or physician’s assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of health care services (e.g., physical therapist) under order of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or

(b)	One treatment session by a physician which results in a regimen of continuing treatment by a health care provider, or at least under the supervision of the health care provider; or
C.	Pregnancy. Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care. This absence qualifies for FMLA leave even though the employee does not receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and even if the absence does not last more than three days; or
D.	Chronic serious health condition. Any period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health care condition. This absence qualifies for FMLA leave even though the employee or immediate family member does not receive treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and even if the absence does not last more than three days.
Chronic serious health condition is defined as one which:
(a)	Requires periodic visits for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse or physician’s assistant under direct supervision of a health care provider; and
(b)	Continues over an extended period of time; and

F.	Multiple treatments by a health care provider or a provider of health care services under orders of, or on referral by, a health care provider, either for restorative surgery after an accident or other injury, or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in the absence of medical intervention such as cancer (radiation, chemotherapy, etc.), severe arthritis (physical therapy), or kidney disease (dialysis).
Specific Exclusions. Routine physical, eye, or dental examinations, cosmetic treatments, cold, flu, and earaches are excluded.
Specific Inclusions. The following conditions are included in the definition of serious health condition:
A.	Mental illness resulting from stress or allergies; and
B.	Substance abuse if the conditions of the FMLA rules are met. Leave may only be taken for treatment of substance abuse by a health care provider or by a provider of health care services on referral by a health care provider. Absence due to an employee’s use of the substance does not qualify for FMLA leave.
"SON" OR "DAUGHTER" 825.113
A biological, adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is either under age 18, or age 18 or older and "incapable of self-care" because of a mental or physical disability.

Where the health care provider finds that the employee is unable to work at all or is unable to perform any of the essential functions of the employee's position within the meaning of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Procedures and Responsibilities
I.	Eligibility
A.	Employee Eligibility
1.	The employee must have worked for the State of Minnesota for at least one year; and
2.	The employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately preceding the request. The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to count hours of work only, not paid hours such as vacation, holidays, sick pay, unpaid leave of any kind, or periods of layoff.
B.	Reasons For Taking a Qualifying Leave
1.	For the birth of the employee’s child, and to care for such child.
2.	For the placement with an employee of a child for adoption or foster care.
3.	To care for the employee's seriously ill spouse, son or daughter, or parent.
4.	Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of an employee’s job.
Circumstances may require that leave for the birth of a child, or for placement for adoption or foster care, be taken prior to actual birth or placement.
C.	Medical Certification
1.	Where FMLA qualifying leave is foreseeable and 30 days notice has been provided, an employee must provide a medical certification before leave begins.
2.	Where FMLA qualifying leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide notice to the Employer of the need for leave as soon as practicable (1 or 2 working days is expected except in extraordinary circumstances). The employee must then provide medical certification within a reasonable timeframe established by the Employer.
3.	An Appointing Authority may require medical certification to support a FMLA qualifying leave request either to care for an employee's seriously ill family member, or for leave due to a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of his or her job.
4.	The Appointing Authority may require a fitness for duty report upon the employees return.
149
D.	Designating Leave
1.	An employer may make a preliminary designation of leave as FMLA qualifying if medical certification was not provided prior to the beginning of leave, or if the employer is waiting for a second or third medical opinion.
2.	Where an employer has knowledge that an employee’s leave qualifies as FMLA leave and does not designate the leave as such, the employer may not designate leave retroactively as FMLA leave unless:
i.	The employee has been out of work and the employer does not learn of the reason for the leave until after the employee returns (in which case the employer must designate the leave upon the employee’s return to work); or
ii.	The employer has provisionally designated leave as FMLA leave and awaits receipt of a medical certification or other reasonable documentation.
If the employee gives notice of the reason of the leave later than two days after returning to work, the employee is not entitled to the protections of the FMLA.
II.	Coordination With Collective Bargaining Agreements/Plans
A.	FMLA qualifying leaves of absence will be identified as those authorized under collective bargaining agreements or plans, i.e., disability leave or personal leave, dependent on which leave is appropriate.
B.	The FMLA provides for an unpaid leave under certain circumstances. The employer shall require an employee to use sick leave for situations required by the collective bargaining agreements. The employer shall only require an employee to use vacation in specific instances allowed by the collective bargaining agreements. However, the employee may request and the employer shall grant vacation or compensatory time. All paid leave time counts toward the twelve (12) weeks of FMLA qualifying leave. However, any absences which are paid from the employee’s accrued compensatory time account shall not be counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement.
III.	Job Benefits and Protection
A.	During an FMLA qualifying leave, the employee and dependent health and dental insurance is maintained on the same basis as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the entire leave period.
B.	An eligible employee returning from a FMLA qualifying leave is entitled to be restored to the same position and shift that the employee held when the FMLA qualifying leave began, or to an equivalent position and shift with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment.
C.	Provided the employee returns to work immediately following his/her FMLA qualifying leave (i.e., does not follow the FMLA qualifying leave with additional unpaid leave), benefits must be resumed upon the employee's return to work at the same level as were provided when leave began. Any new or additional coverage or changes in health benefits must be made available to an employee while on FMLA qualifying leave.
150
IV.	General Provisions

An "eligible employee" is a State employee who:
a)	Has been employed by the State for at least 12 months, and
b)	Has worked and been compensated for at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave (this does not include vacation, sick leave, other paid leave, or compensatory time—this does include overtime worked).
2.	Are only permanent employees eligible for FMLA qualifying leave?
No, non-permanent employees are eligible if they meet the requirements stated under question number one above. If employees are not in insurance eligible status, they are only eligible for unpaid time off and not the insurance benefits.
3.	Under what circumstances are employees eligible to take a FMLA qualifying leave?
a)	For birth of the employee’s child, and to care for the newborn child;
b)	For placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care;
c)	To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition; and
d)	Because of a serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's job.
4.	How much time may an employee take as FMLA qualifying leave?
Eligible employees may take up to twelve work weeks of leave during each fiscal year with the following exceptions:
Exceptions:
If a husband and wife both work for the State, refer to Question No. 6.
If the leave is taken for the birth of a child or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, refer to Question No. 7.
5.	If an employee uses 12 weeks of FMLA qualifying leave in one fiscal year, are they allowed another 12 weeks the following fiscal year for the same condition?
Yes, provided the employee still meets all the eligibility criteria (including 1250 hours worked in the year preceding the request).
6.	If both husband and wife are State employees, are they both eligible for twelve weeks of FMLA qualifying leave during the fiscal year?
Yes. However, a husband and wife may take only a combined total of twelve weeks of FMLA qualifying leave per fiscal year under the following situations:
a)	For the birth of a son or daughter and to care for the newborn child;
b)	For placement of a child with the employee for adoption or foster care;
c)	To care for the employee’s parent (not parent-in-law) who has a serious health condition.
153
7.	If FMLA qualifying leave is taken for the birth of a child, or for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, must the leave be completed within a specific period of time?
Although it is possible that an employee could qualify for two separate FMLA qualifying leaves for the birth or placement of a child (under the condition explained in Question No. 5 above), all FMLA qualifying leaves must be completed within 12 months of the birth or placement of a child. The 12-month period begins on the date of birth or placement.
8.	Does FMLA leave have to be taken all at once, or can it be taken intermittently?
FMLA qualifying leave taken for the employee’s own serious health condition, or for the serious health condition of the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent, may be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule if “medically necessary” and if that medical need can best be accommodated by an intermittent schedule. If the need for intermittent leave or a reduced schedule is documented by the employee’s or family member’s health care provider as “medically necessary”, such leave shall be granted. Intermittent leave for the birth/placement of a child may be granted at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.
9.	Is an employee required to use paid sick leave for certain FMLA qualifying leaves?
Yes. FMLA allows an employer to require the use of paid leave for certain qualifying events as stated under the terms of the collective bargaining agreements and compensation plans. Employees must use sick leave for the reasons authorized by the bargaining agreement/plan provisions. The FMLA does not require an employer to expand the use of paid leave.
10.	Are there circumstances under which an employee may request to receive paid vacation or compensatory time in conjunction with FMLA ?
An employee may request and receive paid vacation or compensatory time. Granting of vacation or compensatory time is not subject to any other employer requirements such as seniority or staffing needs. Any absences which are paid from the employee’s accrued compensatory time account shall not, however, be counted against the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement.
However, the employee must attempt to schedule foreseeable qualifying leave so as not to unduly disrupt the employer's operation. If the employee is unable to provide sufficient documentation to determine FMLA eligibility, the employee shall be placed on unpaid leave until such documentation is made available to the employer.
11.	How do you determine the amount of FMLA qualifying leave used if an employee works a fixed part-time schedule or the employee's schedule varies from week to week?
The amount of FMLA qualifying leave is determined on a prorata basis by comparing the requested schedule with the employee's normal schedule.
Where the schedule varies from week to week, a weekly average of the hours worked over the 12 weeks prior to the beginning of the leave period is used to calculate the employee's normal workweek.
154
72.	How can an Appointing Authority determine if a request for leave is a FMLA qualifying leave?
a)	An employee requesting leave shall be asked the question, "Is the request for paid or unpaid time off for the purpose of an FMLA qualifying event (yes) (no)?"
b)	If an employee requests a leave prior to completing a request for leave slip, a supervisor may ask the reason for the leave. The supervisor will ask for this information solely for the purpose of determining whether the leave is FMLA qualifying and/or if under the terms of the State's contracts or compensation plans an employee is eligible for paid or unpaid time off.
13.	How can an employee determine if his or her request for time off qualifies under FMLA ?
a)	Notices explaining the Act's provisions and providing information concerning the procedures for filing complaints of violations of the Act shall be posted in conspicuous places at the worksite.
b)	An employee may ask his or her supervisor, contact the personnel office or their union to ask questions concerning the employee's rights and responsibilities under the FMLA.
14.	Can an FMLA qualifying leave extend an employee's period of employment?
No.
75. What are an employee's job protection rights upon return from an unpaid FMLA qualifying leave?
An eligible employee shall be restored to the same position that the employee held when the FMLA qualifying leave began, or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment such as same shift, equivalent hours, etc.
16.	How does an FMLA qualifying leave coordinate with the Statewide Sick Leave Policy?
The Act prohibits an employer from discriminating against employees who use FMLA qualifying leave. Therefore, the FMLA qualifying leave cannot be referred to in any employment actions including but not limited to discipline and selection.
17.	Can employees choose whether or not they want to use FMLA qualifying leave?
No. It is the employer’s responsibility to designate leave as qualifying under FMLA. An employee may not choose whether leave shall be counted towards FMLA qualifying leave.
18.	How can an employer verify an employee’s need for leave because of a “serious health condition’’?
The Appointing Authority’s FMLA designation decision must be based only on information received from the employee or the employee’s spokesperson.
An employer may also require an employee to obtain certification of a “serious health condition” from the employee’s health care provider. The employer can pay for a second opinion if it doubts the validity of the original certification. If the second opinion conflicts with the first, the employer may pay for a third opinion. The provider of the third opinion must be jointly approved by the employer and employee. The third opinion will be final.
If a leave request is for the serious health condition of a family member, the employer can require the employee to provide certification from a health care provider.
155
19.	Is an employee eligible to continue health insurance benefits during a FMLA qualifying leave?
During an FMLA qualifying leave, the employee and dependent health and dental insurance coverage is maintained on the same basis as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been continuously employed during the entire leave period.
Employees who receive the partial employer contribution must continue to pay their portion of the premium in order to retain this coverage. If the employee fails to make their premium payments, they will lose the coverage and may not be covered for any claims which may have occurred while on FMLA qualifying leave.
20.	What other insurance coverage may an employee continue during a FMLA qualifying leave?
An employee may continue all coverage which they had prior to going on the FMLA qualifying leave, by paying the full cost of the premium. This includes, but is not limited to, basic, optional, spouse, child life insurance and short term and long term disability insurance. If the employee takes leave due to a work-related disability, short term disability may not be continued. It may be reinstated upon the employee’s return to work.
21.	May an employee choose not to retain health and dental coverages while on a FMLA qualifying leave?
Yes, an employee may choose not to retain these coverages. The coverages will be reinstated upon the employee’s return to work.
22.	May an employee choose not to retain optional coverages while on a FMLA qualifying leave?
Yes, however, they may have the coverages reinstated upon return to work, if the return to work is within the allotted twelve weeks of FMLA qualifying leave. If the leave goes beyond twelve weeks, the employee must reapply with evidence of good health. If an employee chooses not to retain optional coverages, they will not be covered for any claims that may have occurred while they were on leave.
23.	If an employee terminates employment during the FMLA qualifying leave, may the employer recoup the costs of the premiums paid?
Yes, an employer may recover its share of premiums paid during a period of unpaid FMLA qualifying leave from an employee if the employee fails to return to work (for at least thirty (30) calendar days) after the leave unless the employee does not return due to the continuation, recurrence or onset of the serious health condition, or due to other circumstances beyond the employee’s control.
24.	What are an employee’s COBRA rights in relation to an FMLA qualifying leave?
As it relates to FMLA qualifying leave, the COBRA qualifying event is termination of employment, or the end of the leave—whichever comes first. Once the COBRA qualifying event occurs, the employee may choose to “continue” health and dental by paying the entire cost of coverage—even though the employee did not pay their share of the premium during the FMLA qualifying leave.
156
25.	What can employees do who believe that their rights under FMLA have been violated?
The employee has the choice of:
a)	Filing, or having another person file on his or her behalf, a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, or
b)	Filing a private lawsuit pursuant to section 107 of FMLA.
26.	How are employees protected who request leave or otherwise assert FMLA rights?
The FMLA prohibits an employer from interfering with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to exercise) any rights provided by the Act.
27.	Do State laws providing family and medical leave still apply?
Nothing in FMLA supersedes any provision of State law. However, if leave qualifies for FMLA and for leave under State law, the leave used counts against the employee’s entitlement under both laws.
28.	If an employee is on a non-medical leave of absence that also qualifies as an FMLA-protected leave, should that employee's leave accrual date be adjusted in accordance with Article 8, Section 2B?
No. Accrual dates shall not be adjusted for employees on FMLA-qualifying leaves whether medical or not.
29.	Do employees earn sick and vacation accruals when they are on unpaid FMLA-qualifying leaves?
No. Employees only earn sick and vacation accruals when they are in a paid status. In addition, an employee being paid less than eighty (80) hours in a pay period due to an FMLA-qualifying unpaid leave will have his/her sick/vacation accruals prorated in accordance with Appendix C and D.
30.	Are employees on FMLA-qualifying leaves allowed to earn holiday pay during their leave?
Only if they are in a paid status on the normal work day before and after the holiday, in accordance with Article 7, Section 6. Any holiday pay earned will be paid in accordance with Article 7, Section 7.

RE:	State Policy on Reimbursement for Safety Footwear
As part of the negotiations for the 2001-2003 labor contracts, the State has agreed to continue the statewide policy regarding the amount of money agencies will reimburse employees who are required to purchase safety footwear. The policy which we have agreed to implement is based upon the present procedures followed by the Department of Transportation and is described below. Two points, however, should be noted at the outset:
1.	This policy does not address which employees are required to have safety footwear as a condition of employment. That determination rests with each Appointing Authority.
2.	The policy addresses only those situations where Appointing Authorities allow affected employees to purchase safety footwear from a vendor of the employee's choice. Agencies may, at their discretion, continue to provide the safety footwear directly to the employees, rather than have such footwear purchased by the employee him/herself subject to reimbursement.
The policy regarding reimbursement, therefore, is as follows for employees required to wear safety footwear as a condition of employment:
1.	“Probationary” and “permanent” employees shall be reimbursed up to $100.00 each 24 months for the safety portion of safety footwear upon submitting to the Appointing Authority/Designee acceptable proof of purchase of safety footwear. Such reimbursement shall be limited to one per employee every 24 months. (If not already in existence, agencies should develop a procedure determining to whom the proof of purchase is to be submitted, i.e., immediate supervisor, business manager, office manager, etc. and any other procedural guidelines.)
158
Minnesota Department of Employee Relations
Page Two July 1,2001
2.	Since job tasks performed by certain employees can cause extraordinary wear to the safety footwear, the following exception will apply. Should such employee's safety footwear become damaged beyond repair or worn beyond repair due to performance of his/her assigned job tasks, the employee may be eligible for additional reimbursement for replacement safety footwear provided the immediate supervisor (or other appropriate individual) determines that the footwear is irreparable and was damaged or worn out due to performance of the employee's assigned job tasks.
Agencies should proceed to determine which employees are covered by this policy. Affected employees should then be informed of the reimbursement policy and of any agency procedures for obtaining safety footwear and receiving reimbursement.
This policy has been reviewed and endorsed by the State Advisory Safety Committee and will take precedence over existing policies/practices inconsistent with this policy.
Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in this matter. If you have any questions regarding this reimbursement policy, please contact your labor relations liaison.

RE:	Employee Involvement in Purchasing Decisions
During the recent round of negotiations between the State and AFSCME, Council No. 6, AFL-CIO, the Union expressed concerns regarding the lack of employees' participation and involvement in agency-level purchasing decisions on equipment and technologies. As a means of resolving this issue, we agreed to forward AFSCME's concerns directly to state agency heads.
Although it is understood that employees will not be making the ultimate purchasing decision, it is often helpful for supervisors and managers to consider the concerns and views of the employees before such decisions are made. In many cases, employees who currently operate the equipment or who will operate any new equipment/technology can offer valuable information, insight, and expertise regarding the various considerations that are involved in making equipment/technology purchasing decisions. For example, employees can offer suggestions concerning what type of equipment/technology to purchase, which type of equipment/technology best fits the needs of the workplace/operator, which type of equipment/technology would be most compatible with existing equipment/technology, etc.
The 1991-93 Agreement between the State of Minnesota and AFSCME, Council No. 6 agreed that purchasing would be discussed in the joint labor management committee for each state agency.
We are not implying with this memorandum that all agencies deny their employees opportunities for offering input into purchasing decisions. We do, however, want you to be aware of the perceptions which AFSCME has brought to our attention.
Please contact me should you have any questions or comments.

Dear Eliot:
In the 2005-2007 round of bargaining between the State and AFSCME, the State agreed to provide a letter explaining the process for applying for vacancies under the Multi-Source Recruitment and Selection process. All employees are encouraged to submit their resume to the State’s employment database. This may be done on-line by accessing the State Employment website at http://www.doer.state.mn.us/employment.htm, or by submitting a paper resume to the Department of Employee Relations, 200 Centennial Building, 658 Cedar Street, St. Paul, MN 55155. Applicants who have submitted a resume may also design different job search agents which will provide them with an overnight email notification whenever a position meeting their search criteria is advertised. That website also includes tips on how to create a resume and apply for state jobs.
Under the Multi-Source Recruitment and Selection process, all unlimited classified position vacancies are advertised on the Department of Employee Relations’ website and on the telephone IVR system. Applicants may apply for a specific vacancy on-line, via the telephone IVR system, or by directly contacting either the Department of Employee Relations or the agency with the vacancy. Agencies with vacancies also search that employment database for applicants who best meet the advertised minimum qualifications.
Applicants are evaluated to determine whether or not they meet the advertised minimum qualifications. This evaluation may consist of a variety of job-related selection assessment tools, dependent upon the requirements of the position. As agencies proceed to fill their vacancy, they honor all contractual requirements related to vacancy-filling.
Questions about the application process should be directed to the Department of Employee Relations Job Information Line at (651) 296-2616 or outside the metro area, 1-800-657-3974. Questions about specific vacancies should be directed to the Human Resources Office of the agency with the vacancy.

Dear Mr. Benner:
During the 1995-1997 negotiations between the State and AFSCME, the State agreed to provide a letter explaining our understanding of employees’ rights to access and contest information in personnel and supervisor files under the statutes. This letter is not grievable or arbitrable and is subject to future changes under the law. Under the provisions of the Minnesota Data Practices Act, an employee has the right to access personnel data and to authorize release of such data to representatives, provided that the data is specific to the individual making the request and provided that the data have not been designated as confidential or protected non-public. In State agencies, personnel data on employees is maintained by Human Resource offices and management/supervisory staff. The contents of these personnel files, other than any data designated as confidential or protected non-public, shall be disclosed to the employee upon request and in accordance with agency procedures. Questions pertaining to the contents of these files should be brought to the attention of the person responsible for maintaining the data.
Additionally, an employee has the right to formally contest the accuracy or completeness of this data. To exercise this right the employee is required to notify the responsible authority in writing describing the nature of the disagreement. Within 30 days the responsible authority must either 1) correct the data found to be inaccurate or incomplete or 2) notify the individual that they believe the data to be correct. This determination may then be appealed pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act relating to contested cases. Further details are set forth in Minn. Stat., Section 13.04, subd. 4, and Minn. Rules, Chapter 1205 and are subject to future changes in the law or rule. Employees do not have any unilateral right to decide what materials should be place in their personnel file - only to contest whether the data placed there by the responsible authority is complete and accurate.

Dear Mr. Benner:
During 1996, the Joint Labor/Management Committee on Employee Assistance developed the following parameters and guidelines on leave time for EAP appointments.
EAP Parameters:
•	The EAP acts primarily as an assessment, short-term counseling and referral agency.
•	Counseling sessions in state EAP offices are usually one hour in length.
•	The majority of EAP clients are provided one or two counseling sessions. Occasionally, EAP clients will be seen up to four sessions, but these are usually spaced out over several weeks.
Guidelines on leave time for EAP Appointments:
•	State time should be allowed for all supervisory - suggested referrals to EAP.
•	Self-initiated use of EAP could be granted state time, vacation or sick leave.
•	Vacation leave or sick leave may be used if an employee does not want to request the use of State time through his/her supervisor.
•	On occasions when EAP refers the employee to community resources, the employee would be expected to use sick leave for health related issues covered under insurance plans and vacation leave for all other concerns, i.e., financial, career, and marriage counseling.
Sincerely,
Paul Larson .

RE:	Employee Performance Reviews
As part of the negotiations with AFSCME for the 1997-1999 labor contract, we had extensive discussions regarding the appropriateness of AFSCME leadworkers attending the performance evaluations of other AFSCME employees.
It is our recommendation that AFSCME leadworkers not be included in the actual evaluation meeting of a fellow bargaining unit member. It is, however, appropriate for a leadworker to provide input for such evaluation.

RE:	Duration of Probationary Periods
Many of the State’s labor agreements, including the AFSCME agreement, define the length of probation in terms of months rather than a specified number of days or worked hours. Because the term “six months” can be defined and administered in a number of different ways, inconsistencies in determining the exact day the probationary period ends have been found in the practices of agencies. In at least one case, differing interpretations of probationary period length have led to a disagreement among agencies concerning an employee’s non-certification following a transfer. After reviewing and discussing this matter with agency human resources representatives, the Department of Employee Relations has determined that the last day of a six month probationary period is the day before the six month anniversary of the date the probationary period began, provided that day is a business day. For this purpose, a “business day” is defined as Monday through Friday, exclusive of holidays. In the event that the anniversary date does not fall on a business day, the last day of the probationary period is the first business day following the anniversary date. Because not all employees work Monday through Friday, the last day of the probationary period might not be a work day for the employee.
This same definition of “business day” also applies in 7-day per week operations. Even though every day is a work day in such agencies, DOER has determined that a common definition will help to ensure consistent treatment of employees and avoid confusion.
165
Minnesota Department of Employee Relations
July 31, 2003 Page 2
The examples set forth below illustrate a variety of situations that can occur.
Example #1
The employee begins work on Wednesday, February 5, 1997. The last day of the probationary period would therefore be Monday, August 4.
Example #2
The employee starts on Monday, February 3, 1997. Because the day before the 6-month anniversary, August 2, is a Saturday (not a “business day”) the probationary period would end on the next business day, Monday, August 4.
Example #3
The employee starts on Wednesday, May 28, 1997. Because Thursday and Friday, November 27 and 28, are holidays, the last day of the probationary period is Monday, December 1.
An exceptional situation occurs when an employee begins work on August 30 or 31. Because there is no February 30 and usually no February 29, the last day of a probationary period beginning on August 30 or 31 is the last day of February.
For intermittents and less than 50% employees whose probationary period is 1,044 working hours pursuant to Article 12, Section 10C2, “working hours” means hours the employee actually worked. All hours worked will be calculated at the straight time rate regardless of whether the employee is compensated at straight time or time and one-half. For example, an employee who is scheduled for 8 hours but works 11 would have 11 hours credited towards the probationary period. The probationary period under Article 12, Section 10C2 must be at least 6 months but cannot exceed 1 year.
If you have any questions concerning this matter or would like to discuss it further, please contact me or your agency Labor Relations representative.

Pursuant to the State’s agreement with AFSCME, please instruct your supervisors of the following:
1.	When the criteria for removal of filed material under Article 16 - Discipline and Discharge, Section 7C are met, the material shall be removed from both the official personnel file and from any supervisory files and offered to the employee before being destroyed.
2.	Upon request from the Union or the employee, the Human Resource Office shall remove any undated document or item in the employee’s personnel file and offer it to the employee before being destroyed.
3.	In filling a vacancy under Article 12 - Vacancies, Filling of Positions, Section 7E, structured interview questions shall be prepared and scoring weights determined prior to the interview.

7.	The State will explore, through the request for proposal (RFP) process, the possibility of utilizing a single pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) for the Advantage Plan.
8.	The parties agreed to hold a Meet and Confer on the subject of seasonal appointments and insurance eligibility.
9.	Finally, there will be an open enrollment for employees and spouses who currently have optional life insurance, based on the amount the individual currently has in force, as follows:

RE:	Master Negotiations Committee members' schedules
During the 2003-2005 negotiations between the State and AFSCME Council 6, the Union expressed concerns regarding the scheduling of employees who serve on the Union Master Negotiating Team and who work at agencies with continuous operations. To address the Union's concerns, the State agreed that during the 2007-2009 negotiations agencies are encouraged to schedule these employees Monday through Friday. This scheduling accommodation only applies:
•	If the employee is scheduled to work on Saturday and/or Sunday;
•	When the request is initiated by the employee 28 days prior to the posting of the involved schedule(s);
•	If the change in the employee's existing schedule does not result in overtime per FLSA or a violation of Article 5 (Hours of Work); and
•	During Master Committee bargaining and ratification week.
Agencies should make every effort to avoid changing another employee's existing schedule to make these scheduling accommodations. In addition, the provisions of Article 10 Section 4 H (Union Leave) continue to apply.
The State and AFSCME agree to discuss its experiences with these adjusted schedules.

RE:	Job Audits
During the course of 2003-2005 AFSCME contract negotiations, concerns were raised by the Union regarding the length of time it takes to complete a job audit, specifically the amount of time it takes to complete a position description once an employee has requested an audit. I would like to remind agencies that in order for a job audit to be completed, the following documentation is required:
1.	Cover sheet completed by the agency’s Human Resource Office indicating employee identification number, position control number, current class and code, proposed class and code;
2.	current position description signed by supervisor and the employee;
3.	organization chart showing complete work unit;
4.	explanation of how and when changes in the position have occurred.
In some cases comparisons to other positions in the proposed class may also be needed.
While back pay provisions of the contract may provide relief to employees when the decision to a properly documented audit is delayed, often times the audit is not properly documented for an inordinate amount of time. Obtaining a current position description is often the key step which stalls the process when there is disagreement between the employee and supervisor on its contents. I strongly recommend that employees and supervisors work together to ensure that an up-to-date, accurate position description is prepared in a timely manner. If disputes cannot be settled between the employee and their supervisor, they should discuss the matter with their manager and the agency Human Resources Office in order to reach an appropriate conclusion and proceed with the audit.

APPENDIX O - UNIT 6 POSITION QUALIFICATIONS
This section applies to all of Unit 6, except as noted.
A.	Definition
For the purpose of position qualifications, “qualified” means the employee has the job related knowledge, skills and abilities required for initial appointment to the position and necessary for satisfactory performance of the job.
A standard menu of position qualifications shall be developed by a meet and confer consisting of an undetermined number of employer and seven (7) to ten (10) union representatives.
B.	Review Process
If an Appointing Authority decides to require any non-menu position qualifications, they shall notify the Local Union President. The Local Union will have three (3) working days to review the notice and bring any concerns regarding the validity of the new position qualification to the attention of the agency human resource office. Following the response of the Appointing Authority, the Local Union may request a review and final determination by the Department of Employee Relations Staffing Division.
When a change in qualifications for a position results in the denial of an employee’s desired layoff option, the employee may request a review by the agency human resource office. Following the response of the Appointing Authority, the employee may request a review and final determination by the Department of Employee Relations Staffing Division.
The final determinations by the Department of Employee Relations Staffing Division shall not be grievable or arbitrable. However, if the final determination of the above review process requires payment for time not worked, the parties may enter into a grievance settlement in order to process the payment.
C.	Application
Position qualifications will be used in place of class options, but the Employer reserves the right to establish exam options.
An employee who cannot bump the least senior employee in a class may bump the next least senior and so on, until he/she is able to bump or there is no less senior employee. Employees laid off from a consolidated class shall be permitted to bump into lower levels in the same class series, even if they have no previous service at that level.
Employees who are laid off out of seniority order because they do not meet the minimum qualifications for available layoff options shall be permitted the following layoff benefits:
1.	The employee may opt for extended claiming for thirty (30) calendar days from the date of permanent layoff. During this extended claiming period, no severance or vacation liquidation shall be paid to the employee and the employee’s name shall not be placed on any layoff lists. However, employees may apply for seniority unit vacancies in previously held classes during the extended claiming period. Employees may waive extended claiming and the Appointing Authority shall authorize payment of any severance or vacation liquidation and the employee will be eligible for placement on appropriate layoff lists.
2.	Employees retain the right to consideration for seniority unit vacancies as provided in the Master Agreement.

APPENDIX Q - DRUG TESTING
1.	INTRODUCTION
This drug and alcohol testing policy is the exclusive policy for AFSCME Council 5, AFL-CIO Bargaining Unit employees including the craft, maintenance and labor unit; service unit; health care non-professional unit; clerical and office unit; technical unit; and correctional officer unit; is intended to conform to state law as set forth in Minnesota Statutes 181.950 to 181.957; and is limited to drug and alcohol testing required by the U.S. Department of Transportation to implement the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 and relevant U. S. Department of Transportation regulations.
2.	PERSONS SUBJECT TO TESTING
All employees who are required to hold a Commercial Driver's License and a Class A or Class B License as a condition of employment are subject to testing under applicable sections of this policy. These employees are subject to random, pre-employment, pre-placement, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, return-to-duty, and follow-up testing. The specific requirements for testing are governed by regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
New employees and current employees who are appointed to CDL covered positions shall receive a copy of the Testing Plan within fourteen (14) days of appointment to a CDL covered position.
All time spent administering an alcohol or controlled substance test, including travel time, will be paid at the employee's regular rate of pay, or at the appropriate overtime rate, whichever is applicable. An employee may be removed from work following a positive test result through the provisions of Article 16 - Discipline and Discharge. The employer shall pay all costs associated with the administration of alcohol and controlled substance tests. The cost of testing the "split specimen" at a federally certified laboratory if so requested by the employee shall be borne by the Employer if such test result is negative. The employee will be responsible for the cost of testing the "split specimen" if such test result is positive.
3.	CIRCUMSTANCES FOR REASONABLE SUSPICION DRUG OR ALCOHOL TESTING
The Appointing Authority shall request or require an employee to undergo drug and alcohol testing if the Appointing Authority has reasonable suspicion that an employee has violated the provisions of law and regulation governing alcohol concentration, alcohol possession, on-duty use, pre-duty use, use following an accident, refusal to submit to a required alcohol or controlled substance test, controlled substance use, and controlled substance testing. Reasonable suspicion must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the driver. The observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. Observations for alcohol testing must be made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that the driver is required to be in compliance with the regulations. A driver can be directed to undergo reasonable suspicion alcohol testing only while the driver is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the driver is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the driver is to perform safety-sensitive functions.
A written record shall be made of the observations leading to an alcohol reasonable suspicion test and shall be signed by the supervisor making the observation.
179
A supervisor requesting a drug or alcohol test must have successfully completed training developed or approved by the Department of Employee Relations on drug and alcohol abuse, on how to recognize impairment on the job, on how to make a reasonable suspicion determination, and on the Employer's and/or Appointing Authority's written work rules. The Joint Oversight Committee shall review all reasonable suspicion determinations with negative test results. The Employer agrees to allow the Union to review the training prior to implementation.
4.	REFUSAL TO UNDERGO TESTING
Employees do not have the right to refuse to undergo drug and alcohol testing. If an employee refuses to undergo drug or alcohol testing required by the Appointing Authority, or who is found to have adulterated the sample, the employee shall be deemed to have violated the relevant prohibitions in the regulations. The employee must follow the process of Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) referral, treatment, return to duty testing and follow-up testing as if the test were positive in order to be eligible to return to safety-sensitive duties.
5.	RIGHT TO UNION REPRESENTATION
An employee is entitled to Union representation pursuant to Article 16, Section 2 prior to any reasonable suspicion test. When the physical presence of a union representative is not practicable, the employee shall be allowed to confer with a union representative by telephone. Local Unions shall provide Appointing Authorities with the names and phone numbers of representatives who can be called to provide representation in such cases.
6.	RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES
An employee, for whom a positive test result on a confirmation test was the first such result on a drug or alcohol test required by the Appointing Authority shall not be discharged if:
1.	The Appointing Authority has first given the employee an opportunity to participate in either a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program, whichever is more appropriate, as determined by the substance abuse professional trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency; or
2.	If a determination has been made by the substance abuse professional trained in the diagnosis and treatment of chemical dependency that no counseling or rehabilitation program is necessary. However, an employee who has either refused the offer to participate in the counseling or rehabilitation program, or has failed to successfully complete the program has no such protection against discharge.
Expenses for the above stated rehabilitation or counseling program shall be pursuant to coverage under a state employee benefit plan or any other insurance plan the employee is covered under.
In addition, employees have the following rights:
1.	The right not to be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or requested or required to undergo rehabilitation on the basis of a positive test result from an initial screening test that has not been verified by a confirmation test;
2.	The right not to be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or required to undergo rehabilitation on the basis of medical history information revealed to the Medical Review Officer concerning the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result;
180
3.	The right to access information in the subject's personnel file relating to positive test result reports and other information acquired in the drug and alcohol testing process, and conclusions drawn from and actions taken based on the reports or acquired information. An employee who is the subject of a drug and alcohol test shall, upon written request to the Medical Review Officer, have access to any records relating to his or her drug or alcohol test;
4.	The right of an employee who has made a timely request for a confirmation retest to suffer no adverse personnel action if the confirmation retest does not confirm the result of the original confirmation test, using the same drug or alcohol threshold detection levels as used in the original confirmation test.
7.	DATA PRIVACY
The purpose of collecting urine or breath is to test that sample for the presence of drugs or alcohol. A sample provided for drug or alcohol testing will not be tested for any other purpose. The name, initials, and employee identification number of the person providing the sample are requested so that the sample can be identified accurately but confidentially. Information about medications and other information relevant to the reliability of, or explanation for, a positive test result is requested to ensure that the test is reliable and to determine whether there is a valid medical reason for any drug or alcohol in the sample. The Appointing Authority will not disclose the test result reports and other information acquired in the drug or alcohol testing process to another Appointing Authority or employer or to a third party individual, government agency, or private organization without the written consent of the person tested, unless permitted by law or court order. An Appointing Authority will not disclose the test result reports and other information acquired in the drug or alcohol testing process to other Appointing Authorities unless the information is requested in connection with another drug test, or unless disclosure is necessary to permit follow-up testing or return to work testing. All data on the request for a test, the testing, and test results shall be kept separate from the regular personnel files, in locked file cabinets, accessible only by those supervisors, managers or confidential employees directly involved in the case.
8.	RANDOM TESTING POOL
The employer shall establish a single pool of employees for random drug and alcohol testing. This pool may include non-state employees.
9.	SELECTION OF CONTRACTORS TO ADMINISTER POLICY
The employer may contract with appropriate firms to administer alcohol and controlled substance tests. Requests for proposals shall be reviewed with the Union prior to issuance. Employees shall be referred to substance abuse professionals under the State Drug and Alcohol Testing Plan. If the employer does decide to administer alcohol or controlled substance testing with state employees, no law enforcement personnel shall be used.
10.	JOINT LABOR-MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE
The Union and the Employer agree to form a Joint Labor-Management Oversight Committee to review the implementation of alcohol and controlled substance testing. The committee shall be composed of eight representatives of the union and eight representatives of the employer. It shall meet upon request.

APPENDIX R - SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS
DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION
Article 1
Hours of Work
Article 5 of the Master Agreement shall be modified as follows:
Plant Management:
Schedule changes for General Maintenance Workers in Building Services which result in employees reporting to work earlier than their usual shift; e.g., employees who are scheduled to work second shift coming in during day shift hours, shall require a three (3) day notice only.
Employees shall be selected for such schedule changes on the basis of most senior qualified within the work area.
The Appointing Authority and Local Union may mutually agree to flextime scheduling plans where appropriate.
Summer Schedules:
On an annual basis, the Appointing Authority may decide to establish a summer schedule for Grounds Services. The schedule shall be posted at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the effective date.
Fixed Night Shift:
Article 5 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
In InterTech, the night shift schedule shall be fixed.
Article 2
Overtime Distribution
Article 6, Section 4 of the Master Agreement shall be modified as follows:
Plant Management:
When it is necessary for Groundskeepers to be trained on snow removal equipment, overtime may be assigned out of order.
Overtime distribution for General Maintenance Workers assigned to building services shall be as follows:
1.	An effort shall be made to distribute overtime work as equally as possible among all General Maintenance Worker building services employees in all work areas within the Capitol Complex who are capable of performing the work and who desire the overtime work. The employee's shift and supervisor shall not be taken into consideration in the equal distribution of overtime.
182
2.	This overtime distribution does not apply to extensions of the same shift, except as noted in 3 below or emergency situations. Extension of shift(s) shall be offered to the most Senior General Maintenance Worker assigned to the work area. If no General Maintenance Worker accepts the extension of shift, the Appointing Authority shall assign the overtime based upon inverse order of seniority. For emergency situations, the Appointing Authority shall make a reasonable effort to distribute the overtime the same as the shift extension. Overtime earned as an extension of the same shift or emergency situations shall not be counted as overtime worked for the purposes of equal distribution.
3.	The extension of shift(s) for those employees assigned the Capitol work unit shall be done by equal distribution during the session. All overtime hours offered and/or worked shall be credited to the Capitol work unit distribution. This equal distribution of overtime hours shall be in effect while the Legislature is in session. In between sessions, these employees shall be under the seniority distribution of extension of shift overtime hours according to 2 above.

SUBJECT: Work Areas and Postings at Plant Management Division of the Department of
Administration
Dear Kurt:
At the recently concluded supplement bargaining on the Department of Administration Supplement, extensive discussion occurred surrounding the work areas and job postings for the Plant Management Division, especially for vacancies in the classification of Plant Maintenance Engineer. You expressed concern that the employees be able to retain their existing bidding rights.
Postings will continue to list only one work area; there will also be a statement on the posting that the successful bidder will occasionally be assigned to other work locations both within and outside the work area. There is no intent to have the successful bidder assigned to more than one work area or to have him/her regularly assigned outside of the work area.
Thank you for making us aware of these concerns.
Sincerely,
Tony Brown

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
Article 1
The provisions of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
Flextime Plan
Schedule Requests
The flextime plan shall allow an employee to request modification of his/her current work schedule to any schedule which includes forty (40) hours per work week. The normal work week is considered to run Wednesday through Tuesday; however, this period may be adjusted to a different seven- (7)-consecutive-day period by the placement of a memorandum in the employee’s personnel file. Consecutive hours of work shall exclude a thirty or sixty minute unpaid lunch period. A schedule must begin no earlier than 6:30 a.m. and end no later than 6:30 p.m. The employee shall request a modification in writing to his/her immediate supervisor no later than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the date the requested schedule would go into effect, if approved. Changes in approved flextime schedules shall be made by management only in accord with the provisions of Article 5 of the Master Agreement. Employees may request changes in their approved work schedules by giving the Appointing Authority the notice contained above. Upon mutual agreement by the employee and Employer, the fourteen (14) day notice may be waived.
Review of Requests
The immediate supervisor shall determine to approve or deny the request of the employee within his/her work unit based upon job-related considerations. If there are conflicting requests from employees and the needs of the supervisor require that not all requests may be approved, the supervisor shall approve (if all other considerations indicate approval) the request submitted by the employee with the most state seniority. Should conflicts still exist, they shall be resolved by lot.
The immediate supervisor shall provide the employee with written notice and explanation of the decision within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of the request. If an employee's request is denied, a copy of the written notice and explanation of the decision shall be available to the Union. No request shall be unreasonably denied.
Altered Schedules
Upon assignment of an employee to attend training sessions or other meetings, or upon mutual agreement of the immediate supervisor and the employee, an employee's schedule may be temporarily altered for a duration of no more than fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days at a time without regard to the above provisions, provided that it doesn't result in payment of overtime.
If requested by the employee, the employee may change days, shifts, or hours of work with the approval of his/her supervisor, provided such change does not result in the payment of overtime.
Appeals
An employee may appeal the decision of the immediate supervisor to deny or revoke a flextime schedule to the appropriate division director who shall respond in writing and, if not resolved at that level, to the Commissioner's designee who shall respond in writing. The decision of the Commissioner or his/her designee is final and shall not be subject to Article 17 of the Master Agreement.
189
Article 2 Noon Meals
Article 20, Section 5, (B) of the Master Agreement shall be amended and/or modified as follows:
1.	Whereas, the Minnesota Department of Agriculture is unique in that it has many employees assigned to field inspector positions who work out of their homes and who drive either their own personal vehicle or state vehicle on assigned business throughout the course of their normal work day and who are always away from their home station over the normal noon meal period. Therefore, the interpretation of noon meal reimbursement shall be modified as follows:
Employees shall be reimbursed for the actual cost (not to exceed contract amount) of the noon meal if the employee has traveled more than 35 actual road miles before lunch after leaving his/her permanent work station (excluding employee's hometown).
Article 3
Home Work Station
Article 20 Section 7 of the Master Agreement shall be modified as follows:
The Appointing Authority will provide the employees who are assigned to use their residences as their office or work station either:
1.	Payment of the employee's monthly basic service charge on their present telephone (touchtone rate); or
2.	Payment of the employee's monthly basic service charge for a second telephone line, including the installation fee (monthly charge would be attached to the employee's expense report).
When an employee is required to have an answering machine/voice mail as a part of the employment, the employer will provide the machine/ voice mail at no cost to the employee.
Article 4
Part-Time/Unscheduled Employees
The Minnesota Department of Agriculture hereby agrees to change the employment conditions of not more than seven (7) intermittent Grain Sampler I's and five (5) intermittent Plant Industry Inspectors to Part-time/llnscheduled. In order to be included in this employment condition, the present intermittent Grain Sampler I's and Plant Industry Inspectors must have averaged a minimum of 1250 actual hours worked during his/her last calendar year of employment. “Actual hours worked” shall include all scheduled, unscheduled and overtime hours actually worked. The Department of Agriculture further agrees that this change in employment condition to Part-time/llnscheduled will make these employees eligible for insurance benefits under the part-time coverage provisions of Article 19, Insurance, of the Agreement between AFSCME Council No. 5, AFL-CIO and the State of Minnesota. This agreement would have the employer providing the employer's contribution for part-time coverage as noted above. For the purposes of moving intermittent employees into the PT/llnscheduled employment condition, each service point (identified as work location in the seniority roster) will be considered a work area. This employment condition will be offered to the most senior intermittent grain sampler or Plant Industry Inspector in the service point; if declined, the next most senior intermittent sampler or inspector will be offered the change. The offer will progress from most senior intermittent sampler or inspector to least senior intermittent sampler until it is accepted.
Hours will be offered to intermittents by seniority whenever reasonably practicable.
It is further understood that the Department of Agriculture can remove an employee from the PT/llnscheduled employment condition back to intermittent if the employee's annual average
190
number of actual hours worked drops below 900 hours. In removing an employee from PT/llnscheduled to intermittent, the Department of Agriculture will move the least senior PT/llnscheduled Sampler or Inspector in that service point to the employment condition of intermittent.
It is further understood that in consideration of the above, the Union and Employer agree that, with the exception of the provision of the part-time insurance coverage described above, all other provisions of the contract remain in effect as they pertain to the employment condition of the intermittents.
It is further understood that the Department of Agriculture will not convert more than seven (7) Grain Sampler I or five (5) Plant Industry Inspector positions to the PT/Unscheduled status without consultation with the Union.
The employer agrees to review hours worked for employees who receive coverage under this Agreement prior to the end of the calendar year so that employees who may be in danger of losing their coverage at the end of the calendar year may receive a non-binding advisory. This would be done around November 15th, allowing employees in danger of losing coverage to make alternate plans.
All changes will occur on a calendar year basis.
The parties agree that this article is non-precedential and shall not be referred to by either party in the context of collective bargaining or with other Appointing Authorities.
Article 5
Hours of Work
Article 5, Section 1B and C of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
The Director of the Grain Inspection Division may change the starting and ending times of an existing shift up to and including two (2) hours for Grain Samplers and non-metro Grain Inspectors with ten (10) hours notice if the work needs dictate. This change shall not result in overtime or penalty pay.

Article 1
Summer Program
The provisions of the Master Agreement are supplemented as follows:
An employee may agree to voluntarily remain on layoff in the event of a recall by requesting such action through a written waiver mutually agreed to and signed by the Appointing Authority and the employee. Once the employee elects to sign the waiver of recall, such employee shall not be able to exercise his/her seniority rights for recall for the duration of the summer program. The Appointing Authority agrees to provide a signed copy of any waiver of recall to both the Local Union and the employee. Any waiver of recall by an employee is not to be considered a refusal to return to work and shall not be considered to be a break in continuous service.
This Section does not, in any way, constitute a forfeiture of the Appointing Authority's right to recall laid off employees, wherever necessary, to carry out the functions and needs of the summer school programs.
Any work which becomes available on an emergency or temporary basis shall first be offered to current employees in lay-off status, in order of Classification Seniority (as defined in point #8 of this Article) for Units #2 and #3 or State Seniority for Units #4 and #6 in the related classifications.
Notification of intent to return to work may be made in writing and hand delivered provided however that a written receipt of such notification is given.
Article 12 of the Master Agreement (Vacancies and Filling of Positions) and Article 15 of the Master Agreement (Layoff and Recall) shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
1.	Summer Program: Twenty-five (25) days prior to the end of the academic year, the Appointing Authority shall post lists of all positions including the class, the general description of the duties, the shift and the normal hours of work, which will be available for summer program.
2.	Employees then have five (5) working days to submit bids indicating all positions for which they desire recall ranked in order of preference. Employees will also indicate if they desire to be recalled to a class in which they previously served in the event they are unable to obtain a position in their present classification.
3.	On the fifth working day following the close of bidding, the Appointing Authority will notify employees of the date which they will be laid off and the date of recall for the beginning of the next academic year. Employees who have secured a summer program position shall receive notification which includes the summer program position they have obtained, the duties of summer program, and the date of recall for the beginning of the next academic year. Layoffs shall be treated as seasonal layoffs unless the notice received by the employee indicates otherwise.
205
4.	Summer program bids will be awarded and vacant positions in the Human Services Technician (HST), Special Education Program Assistant (SEPA), Residential Program Lead (RPL) or Recreation Program Assistant (RPA) classification shall be filled by recall of laid off employees, in State Seniority order, from the school where the vacancy exists, who are currently appointed or have previously served in such classifications. An employee must accept recall to his/her currently appointed class before accepting recall to a previously served in class.
5.	In the event a summer program position in the class HST, SEPA, RPL or RPA becomes vacant at either the Academy for the Deaf or the Academy for the Blind, the Appointing Authority will first offer the position to employees who are on layoff from the Academy where the vacancy exists as outlined in this Section.
6.	If all eligible employees from the Academy where the vacancy exist have obtained summer program positions or have waived their right of recall, the summer program position shall next be offered to employees from the other Academy who were either: a) unable to obtain a summer program position; b) obtained a position in a lower classification because no position in their classification was available; or c) obtained a less than full-time position.
Such positions shall be posted for three (3) working days and employees listed in a, b, or c, who desire to bid on these positions must submit such bids within these three (3) working days. On the second working day following the close of bidding, employees who have secured a summer program position shall receive notification which includes the summer program position they have obtained, the duties of summer program, and the date of recall for the beginning of the next academic year.
If vacancies again become open at an Academy because employees have exercised rights above, these newly opened positions shall be posted for three (3) working days and employees in a, b or c above, who desire to bid on the newly-opened positions must submit such bids within these three (3) working days. On the second working day following the close of bidding, employees who have secured a summer program position shall receive notification which includes the summer program position they have obtained, the duties of summer program, and the date of recall for the beginning of the next academic year.
In all cases the position shall be offered to employees in order of Classification Seniority for Units #2 and #3 and State Seniority for Units #4 and #6, provided the senior employee's ability and capacity to perform the job are relatively equal to that of the other bidders.
When it is necessary to reduce numbers of staff, the reductions shall first be made from the employees who bid from the other Academy. Such employees shall return to their respective Academy and resume their previously awarded bid.
7.	Summer program bids will be awarded and vacant positions shall be filled by recall of laid off employees in Classification Seniority order for the classifications of Food Service Worker, Cook or Cook Coordinator and Dining Hall Coordinator, and in State Seniority order for the classifications of Licensed Practical Nurse I (LPN I) and Licensed Practical Nurse II (LPN II), who are currently appointed to or who have previously served in such classification. An employee must accept recall to his/her currently appointed class before accepting recall to a previously served in class.
8.	For purposes of this Supplemental Agreement only, Classification Seniority, upon recall, shall include Classification Seniority in all higher related or equally related paid classes in which the employee has served with the State of Minnesota.
9.	Employees accepting recall to classes in which they have previously served shall retain their present salary unless that salary exceeds the maximum rate of pay for the new position, in which case the employee's salary shall be adjusted to the new maximum.
206
10.	Vacation leave hours used by employees covered by this Supplemental Agreement to extend their work season shall be paid at the rate at which they are earned.
11.	Employees who bid on summer program positions and intend to use leave for periods of three (3) days or more, during the summer program session, are expected to request the use of leave at the time they submit their bids.
12.	An employee who does not make a successful bid shall indicate his/her interest (in writing) in picking up hours which become available.
Article 2
Hours of Work
Article 5 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
If the work schedule to be worked upon recall from layoff at the beginning of an academic year is the same as was worked in the preceding academic year, the fourteen (14) calendar day posting requirement of Article 5 shall not apply. The Appointing Authority, at the time of notification of recall, shall notify those employees recalled from layoff status of any changes from that anticipated work schedule.

2.	Bump the least senior employee in a different insurance eligibility status within the work area or the seniority unit.
207

Seasonal Layoff
Article 15, Section 4B of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
Employees shall be permitted to extend their work season beyond the specified date of their layoff by the use of accumulated vacation and such extension of time shall not be considered a violation of the inverse seniority provisions of the layoff.
Employees engaged on an academic year who are not working summer school, shall, within one week of the completion of all summer school bidding, designate the amount of vacation leave hours to be used during the fiscal year. Employees engaged in summer school shall, prior to July 1 of each year, designate the amount of vacation leave hours to be used. Such employees shall indicate the vacation hours they intend to use, pay period by pay period, through the beginning of the next academic year. Employees may use any amount of vacation time available to them, up to a total of eighty (80) hours per pay period. The amount of vacation time used need not be the same for each pay period. Use of such accumulated vacation leave shall not entitle employees for holiday pay eligibility or conversion of vacation leave to sick leave. Such vacation shall be paid at the rate at which it was earned.
Limited Interruptions of Employment
Article 15, Section 6 shall be modified as follows:
Limited interruptions of work shall not exceed ten (10) consecutive working days. All other provisions of Article 15, Section 6 shall apply.

Should the senior employee choose not to accept the work, the next most senior capable employee shall be offered the work. In the event all capable employees decline the work, the Appointing Authority shall have the right to assign the work based upon inverse order of Classification Seniority for positions in Units #2 and #3 or State Seniority for positions in Units #4 and #6 among capable employees.
If a more senior employee must be rescheduled to work the above available work, the Appointing Authority is not liable for overtime pay.
Employees scheduled to work a midnight to 8:00 a.m. shift on the day following the students' return shall not be required to work an afternoon shift during the day of the students' return.
208
Article 8 Overtime
Article 6, Section 4 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
In the event all capable employees in the same shift and work area decline overtime work, the Appointing Authority shall have the right to assign overtime based upon inverse order of Classification Seniority for positions in Units #2 and #3 or State Seniority for positions in Units #4 and #6 among capable employees. In all instances, the overtime work shall first be assigned to employees on the shift immediately preceding or any shift ending within three hours of the overtime assignment.
Employees returning from leaves of absence shall be credited with the number of overtime hours equal to the highest number credited to any current employee in the same class and same work area.

Article 9
Attendance at Union Meetings
The provisions of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
Local Union officers and stewards shall be allowed to adjust their work schedules to attend Local Union and Local Executive Board meetings.
Employees who desire to make these adjustments must request prior approval from their supervisor or other Appointing Authority designee five (5) calendar days in advance of the meeting date. If adjustment includes release time in the middle of the shift, the request shall include an indication of the length of the release time. Approval of these requests will not be unreasonably withheld. The Appointing Authority reserves the right to rescind this approval in the event of emergency or other unusual conditions, or to maintain adequate staffing during the time of the meeting. Employees shall receive no compensation for time spent at Union meetings, but may utilize vacation leave or work extra hours, within five (5) working days, if work is available, to prevent a loss of earnings.
In the event work is available and an employee elects to work extra hours to offset time spent at Union meetings, the Appointing Authority shall have no liability for overtime hours of pay until the employee has worked an amount of time outside his/her regular shift which is equal to the amount of time spent at a Union meeting.

The Appointing Authority and Local Union agree to meet and confer to discuss training needed by employees and other training issues. This meet and confer shall be scheduled near the beginning of the academic year.
Article 14
Part-Time Hours Procedures
In accordance with current practice, part-time or full-time employees will first be allowed to work additional available hours to make up for hours lost due to a reduction in the employee’s schedule.
If additional hours are still available, part-time employees in the food service area and part-time employees in the HST and SEPA classifications may work additional hours within the fourteen (14) day posting period at the straight time rate in accordance with the following procedure:
If additional work is needed within the fourteen (14) day posting period, and the work cannot be performed by previously scheduled employees (i.e., temporary reassignment), the Appointing Authority shall first offer this work to part-time employees in order of state seniority in the work area. If a part-time employee accepts the offered work, the part-time employee shall not be eligible for “penalty pay.”
A part-time employee would not be eligible to be offered such work if the additional hours would result in the payment of overtime pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
210
If no eligible part-time employee accepts the work, the Appointing Authority is not required to assign the work to a part-time employee. For example, the Appointing Authority may use one of the following methods of securing resources (this list is not inclusive):
e^« use of an intermittent employee;
use of a non-bargaining unit employee; overtime.
Any hours assigned to part-time staff beyond the fourteen (14) day posting period are not subject to the provisions of this agreement.
If a part-time employee is assigned the work as overtime, the part-time employee shall be eligible for overtime pay pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.
Any additional hours worked by a part-time employee under this provision shall not be considered in a part-time employee’s eligibility for health insurance.
Temporary employees are not covered by this agreement.
When an employee works sixteen (16) hours or fewer in a pay period, the employee may assign these straight-time hours to the compensatory bank provided for in Article 6 of the Master Agreement.
Either party may terminate this procedure in whole or for a specified work area within thirty (30) days written notice to the other party. In the event this procedure is terminated by either party, the normal overtime provisions of the agreement shall apply.
Article 15
Extracurricular Assignments
Payment to employees who are offered and accept extracurricular assignments shall be paid the same rates specified in the 2005-2007 State Residential Schools Education Association Agreement.
Article 16
Alternate and Substitute Holidays
An employee may assign straight-time hours earned as substitute holidays designated under Article 7, Section 3, of the Master Agreement, and alternate holidays earned under Article 7, Section 8, of the Master Agreement, to the compensatory bank provided for in Article 6 of the Master Agreement. Such assignment must be made at the time the substitute or alternate holiday is earned.
Article 17

During the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of this Agreement, the parties agree that the starting times of the Local Labor/Management Committee meetings will be rotated, with every other meeting starting at 4:00 p.m. After the twelve (12) months, the parties agree to meet and evaluate this arrangement to determine if it is desirable to extend it, and it shall be extended upon the parties’ mutual written agreement.

2.	The Appointing Authority shall notify the exclusive representatives of the classification(s) and number of positions to be eliminated within the time frame and manner specified in the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	Provisional and emergency employees shall be terminated before the elimination of positions of probationary or permanent employees in the same class and employment condition within the facility.
4.	The Appointing Authority shall post the position(s) by class (or class option), employment condition, seniority unit, and work location that are to be eliminated for a minimum of seven (7) calendar days electronically and/or on all employee bulletin boards where employees in the facility in the class are stationed. When the seven (7) calendar day posting requirement would be met on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the expiration date of the posting shall be the day following the weekend or holiday.
5.	Simultaneously with the above posting, the Appointing Authority shall post the list of available jobs. During the seven (7) day posting period, employees may express a willingness to be at risk. At the end of the seven (7) day period employees for whom a desired option still exists shall be placed at risk and the employees shall indicate their desire to select either mitigation to layoff options 1, 2, or 3. If the employee picks mitigation to layoff option 1, the employee shall also notify the Personnel Office/Job Center in writing of his/her specific job and training opportunity option/position. If the employee picks mitigation to layoff option 2, the employee shall also notify the Personnel Office/Job Center in writing of his/her choice of retirement with Employer contribution to insurance, one-time enhanced payment, or educational payment. Designation of at-risk employees and the awarding of available job and retraining opportunities shall be made in seniority order within the affected classifications.
For employees represented by MAPE and MMA, "seniority" shall be defined as Classification Seniority; for employees represented by MNA, "seniority" shall be defined as Bargaining Unit Seniority; for employees represented by AFSCME, Council No. 5, AFL-CIO, "seniority" shall be defined as State Seniority; and for employees represented by SRSEA "seniority" shall be defined pursuant to Collective Bargaining Agreement between the parties.
It is further understood that classifications which are recognized as part of a junior/senior plan shall be treated as one classification for purposes of this Agreement.
216
6.	At the end of the seven (7) day posting period, if no employee(s) has indicated his/her desire to be declared "at-risk", the least senior employee(s) (as defined in #5 above) shall be notified in writing by the Appointing Authority that he/she is declared to be "at-risk." The employee shall provide written receipt of this notice to the Appointing Authority.

An employee on leave at the time his/her position is declared "at-risk" shall be given the opportunity to select option 1, 2, or 3. If he/she selects option 1, the employee shall be able to choose from available job and retraining options at the time his/her leave expires. It is understood this does not prevent an employee from terminating his/her leave and selecting a job and retraining option at the time he/she is declared "at-risk."
8.	The Appointing Authority may, with the agreement of the Union/Local Union/Association office, designate individual employees at risk out of order seniority.

Employees may be asked to rank their order of preference of available jobs and retraining options. The employee with the most seniority (as defined in #5 above) shall receive his/her first preference. Subsequent job and retraining options shall be made on the basis of seniority (as defined in #5 above).
11.	Once an employee selects a particular job and retraining opportunity option, the employee is precluded from exercising another job and retraining opportunity option at a later time, unless the employee's position is subsequently eliminated as a result of the Department's restructuring plan (e.g. an employee from one Regional Treatment Center accepts a position at another Regional Treatment Center and the employee's position at the RTC is subsequently eliminated because of the Department's restructuring plan).
12.	An employee who refuses a job and retraining opportunity option that is within a reasonable commuting distance shall not be eligible to an enhanced separation package option.

3.	All positions shall first be posted pursuant to the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement. If, at the time the position is posted there is a qualified “at risk” employee in the same employment condition, bidding will be limited to employees in the same employment condition and insurance|[Pi] contribution level. However, the parties may negotiate at a later time changes in the procedures for filling positions in State operated community based residential or day habilitation services or positions in the technical support group for these services.
4.	Positions to be offered will be:

An employee who is promoted is entitled to a salary adjustment as defined in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
7.	The Department shall supply the exclusive representatives with a list of possible positions for which an employee could qualify with up to 160 hours training. Upon the request of an exclusive representative the Department shall meet with the exclusive representative to discuss the determinations.

Article 1 Meal Periods
Article 5, Section 1D of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Unless you work the night shift, you will normally be given your meal period between 11:00 A.M. and 1:00 P.M. or between 5:00 P.M. and 7:00 P.M. However, if there is a scheduled special event or activity, your meal period may vary by up to one-half (14) hour. You may ask your supervisor for a different meal period.
The Local Union and Management agree to meet and confer on meal times.
Article 2 Work Schedules
Article 5, Section 3C of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Definitions:
Weekend: Saturday and Sunday are the weekend unless defined otherwise.
222
1.	Work Period.
Full-Time Employees. Your supervisor may use any of the following scheduling patterns:
a.	No more than six (6) consecutive work days; no fewer than three (3) consecutive work days; consecutive days off; or,
b.	No more than seven (7) consecutive work days; no fewer than three (3) consecutive work days; two (2) or more weekends off out of every eight (8) weekends , consecutive days off; or,
c.	No more than seven (7) consecutive work days; two (2) weekends off out of every four (4) weekends, days off may not be consecutive.
The scheduling pattern/practice for full-time employees in use on the effective date of the Master Agreement will continue.
Your schedule may temporarily change for activities like training, staff development, informational meetings, team meetings, and special projects.
There are several reasons that Management can permanently change the normal work period of a unit/program or begin using a shift not currently used. These reasons are:
Efficiency.
The needs of the public, D.H.S., or the Nursing Center.
Better consumer services.
Better use of the facility and/or you and other staff.
Management must give at least thirty (30) days notice to the Local Union before changing the normal work period or shift. The Local Union and Management will meet and confer to develop a reasonable scheduling pattern for that unit/program before the new schedules are posted.
If you work on a rotating line system in the Nursing Department, you can only be moved to a different line number for a reasonable purpose. The reason for the move will be explained to the employee who is being moved.
If you work in the Nursing Department and you need to request leave but vacation or sick leave is not an option, your supervisor may approve leave without pay if you can exchange your scheduled hours of work for another employee’s day off. You must get the exchange approved before it takes place and the exchange cannot cause penalty pay or overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Part-Time Employees. Your schedule must include:
At least four (4) days off in a two (2) week pay period.
At least two (2) of the days off must be consecutive.
No more than seven (7) consecutive work days.
If your supervisor must extend your shift, he/she will tell you as soon as possible.
2.	Schedule Posting.
Article 5, Section 1C of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Your posted schedule may be changed with less than fourteen (14) day notice without penalty pay for a job opportunity. The Local Union and Management may consider waiving penalty pay for an employee filling behind on a case by case basis.
223
For the Relief Stationary Engineer, Management will try to use the posting requirement in Article 5, Section 1C of the Master Agreement. The supervisor may change the work schedule for the Relief Stationary Engineer in the case of sick leave, workers’ compensation, or an emergency without paying overtime if the employee is told at least eight (8) hours before the beginning of the shift.
3.	Fixed Night Shift (for all units except Units 2 and 7). Where continuous operations require a night shift, such shift shall be fixed and vacancies in such fixed shifts shall be posted. However, in situations where Management is not adding a position, a part-time employee shall not be eligible to bid on the vacancy if the acceptance of the bid would increase his/her employment condition. If there are no eligible bidders for fixed night shift vacancies, Management may recruit and hire applicants for the vacancy or assign the capable and qualified employee not on fixed nights with the least Classification Seniority to the vacancy.
If you work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to a different shift for the following reasons:
Training or other staff development.
Informational meetings.
Jury duty.
If you do not work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily reschedule you to the night shift for the following reasons:
•	To cover vacant night shift positions during the process of filling a vacancy.
•	To cover for days off of night shift employees.
•	To cover for leave (paid or unpaid) of six (6) months or less of a night shift employee.
•	To cover for night shift staff temporarily scheduled to other shifts.
•	To meet a temporary need for more staff on the night shift.
•	Emergencies.
If Management decides to temporarily schedule to the night shift, he/she will decide:
•	Which classification(s) are needed.
•	Which work area(s) employee(s) will be rescheduled from.
The employee(s) in the selected class(es) and work area with the least State Seniority who is capable and qualified will work the night shift. If that employee has been scheduled for a holiday off, the next least senior employee will work the night shift.
To no longer be permanently assigned to the fixed shift, you have the following options:
•	Successfully bid on a vacancy in another shift. However, if you are still the capable and qualified employee with the least Classification Seniority for the night shift position, your bid will be rejected; or,
224
•	Submit a request in writing to your human resources office to remove you from the night shift after at least three (3) months assignment to the night shift. If there are other employees not on the night shift with less Classification Seniority who are capable and qualified, the employee with the least Classification Seniority will be assigned to the night shift and you will fill the position that person leaves. You must be capable and qualified to fill the position of the person filling your night shift position. Your request will remain open until you withdraw it or you are replaced by another employee; or,
•	Exchange shifts with an employee who does not work the night shift. You must both be in the same class and option, and you must both be capable and qualified for the other’s position.
4.	Shifts Between Days Off. Your supervisor will not schedule you to work more than two (2) shifts and/or two (2) shift changes between scheduled days off.
For this section only, a scheduled shift with a starting time within two (2) hours of the starting time of the first scheduled shift after scheduled days off is considered the same shift. When there is a scheduled shift rotation, a change no more than two (2) hours from the starting time of the scheduled shift is not considered a change in shift.
The Local Union and Management may agree to change the terms of Article 2, Work Schedule section.
Article 3 Holiday Pay
If you are scheduled to work and are in pay status for any part of the early or afternoon shift the day before a holiday and any part of the night shift that begins on that holiday, the holiday will be treated as if it falls on your regularly scheduled day off.
Article 4
Flex-Time Scheduling
The Local Union and Management may agree to a flex-time scheduling plan.
Article 5 Overtime
Article 6, Section 4 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Assignment
If you are currently working an overtime assignment, you cannot be forced to work the next shift even if you are the least senior person.
Distribution
For employees in the Nursing Department:
If your supervisor needs someone to work the overtime shift, (s)he will:
1.	Decide which class(es) will perform the overtime work.
225
2.	Offer the overtime work to all capable and qualified employees in the selected class(es) (most seniority to least) until the work is accepted. Overtime for the next (immediately subsequent) shift will first be offered to those who are on duty. If the work requiring overtime is already in progress, the employee(s) performing the work will be assigned the overtime.
3.	If no one accepts the overtime, have the right to assign the mandatory overtime to the employee with the least Classification Seniority from the same pool of people. If the least senior employee assigned the overtime work is working the evening shift before his/her scheduled days off and the overtime is for the night shift, the next least senior employee from the evening shift networking before his/her scheduled days off will be assigned the overtime. If there is no one else to assign, your supervisor will assign the overtime regardless of scheduled days off.
This assignment will rotate within each pay period starting with the employee with the least Classification Seniority. In all instances, overtime for the next shift will first be offered to those on duty. If you are on duty and have been assigned an overtime shift, you may make arrangements for another employee to work the overtime for you. Your supervisor will not assign additional overtime to you for the same shift. The employee who agrees to work for you will not receive callback pay.
For all other employees:
If your supervisor needs someone to work the overtime shift, (s)he will:
1.	Decide which class(es) will perform the overtime work.
2.	Offer the overtime work to all capable and qualified employees in the selected class(es) in the same work unit (most State Seniority to least) until the work is accepted. Overtime for the next (immediately subsequent) shift will first be offered to those on duty. If the work requiring overtime is already in progress, the employees already performing the work will be assigned the overtime.
3.	If no one accepts the overtime, have the right to assign the mandatory overtime to the employee with the least State Seniority from the same pool of people offered the overtime.
For all employees:
You may request not to be offered voluntary overtime by giving written notice to your human resources office. However, you may still be assigned to work mandatory overtime.
You can withdraw your request by giving written notice to your human resources office. Your request is effective after fourteen (14) days.
If there is an emergency, Management may assign someone to deal with the situation regardless of the overtime distribution.
For Power Plant Operations:
Your supervisor will post opportunities for planned overtime on the Union bulletin boards in the Maintenance Shop and the Powerhouse. The volunteer with the most State Seniority will get the overtime work. If no one volunteers, the Engineer on the shift immediately before the overtime will be assigned the overtime.
226
Article 6
Overnight Activities
If you are assigned to supervise residents in activities that last for twenty four (24) hours, you will be paid eight (8) hours straight time, eight (8) hours at your overtime rate and eight (8) hours at the on-call rate.
Article 7
Staffing Information
If the Local Union asks, Management will provide the staff complement for each work area once every six (6) months.
Article 8
Vacation Leave
Article 8, Section 3 of the Master Agreement shall be amended as follows:
There will be quarterly postings requesting submissions of requests for vacations of five (5) days or more, including holidays. These postings will be opened three (3) months prior to the beginning of the first full month of the quarter at issue. The posting will remain open for fifteen (15) days and all requests will be answered ten (10) calendar days from the end of the posting. Vacation requests will be sorted by pay periods and seniority. Conflicts over vacation requests will be resolved as provided in the Master Agreement. Employees may submit more than one request. If there is additional vacation time available, employees may request vacation time after the posting, however, such requests will not be reposted.
In addition to the quarterly postings, every August 1 through August 15 there will be a posting for guaranteed vacation. This posting will cover the period from the first full pay period in January through the last full pay period in December, excluding the pay period that includes Christmas. Each year staff will receive a letter explaining their options for a guaranteed vacation. Employees must rank their options because only one of their options will be granted. Full-time employees will be granted nine (9) to eleven (11) days of guaranteed vacation, including days off, depending on their line system. Part-time employees with ten (10) years or less services will be granted seven (7) days of guaranteed vacation. Part-time employees with eleven (11) or more years of service will be granted ten (10) days of guaranteed vacation, including days off. Guaranteed vacation approvals will be based on seniority.
Employees may include days off to meet the five (5) or more day requirement. It is recommended that employees include days off to guarantee blocks of time, in case their days off are changed.
Floating holiday time on the books may be exchanged for already granted vacation time as long as it is used within the contract guidelines.
The Local Union and Management may agree on a number of days of compensatory time that an employee may use in place of already granted vacation during a six (6) month period. The six (6) month period shall be defined as January through June, and July through December. Written requests to use compensatory time in lieu of already granted vacation must be submitted in the pay period it will be used. Employees must have vacation time to cover the days of compensatory time they are requesting.
A list will be created of employees who have been denied requested vacation time. This list will contain the employee’s name and date of the request. If all of an employee’s options were denied, the denied list will only reflect the employee’s first choice. If additional time becomes available, vacation will be granted based on the date of the request (first come, first serve). Conflicts will be determined by State Seniority.
227
Employees who have been granted vacation time of five (5) days or more will not be permitted to give back a portion of the granted vacation, but must give back the granted vacation in its entirety.
If an employee does not have the vacation time to cover their granted vacation, either on the books or the ability to earn such vacation time, they will be required to return the entire vacation period. Leave without pay will not be granted to cover the additional days.
Labor and Management agree to meet and confer on conflicts over the use of vacation or compensatory time.
Article 9 Education Leaves

Management will not change the scheduling pattern of the MIPA positions listed above for the Timberland Mental Health Program unless they choose not to fill a vacancy in the position or they decide to change that vacancy to a different job class.
Management can change any other position’s scheduling pattern/practice when filling a vacancy. The posting for a vacancy will indicate the pattern was changed.
If you are a full-time Unit 4 night shift employee who is not assigned to the Chemical Dependency Program, the scheduling patterns/practices in use on the effective date of the Master Agreement will continue.
Your schedule may temporarily change for activities like training, staff development, informational meetings, team meetings, and special projects.

2.	Fixed Night Shift (for all Units except Units 2 and 7). All night shifts are fixed. When a night shift position becomes vacant, Management must post it for bids. If you are a part-time employee, you cannot bid on a position that would make you a full-time employee if management is not adding a position. If no one successfully bids on the position, Management may recruit and hire to fill the vacancy or reassign the person with the least State Seniority who is capable and qualified but not on a fixed night schedule.
If you work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to a different shift for the following reasons:
Training or other staff development.

Emergencies.
If your supervisor decides to temporarily reschedule to the night shift, (s)he will decide:
Which class(es) are needed.
Which work area(s) employee(s) will be rescheduled from.
The employee(s) in the selected class(es) and work area with the least State Seniority who is capable and qualified will work the night shift. If that employee has been scheduled for a holiday off, the least senior employee not off for the holiday will work the night shift.
If you have been permanently assigned to the night shift and want to work a different shift, you have the following options:
1.	Successfully bid on a vacancy in another shift. If you are still the capable and qualified employee with the least State Seniority for the night shift, your bid will be rejected; or,
2.	Ask your human resources director to remove you from the night shift after at least three (3) months assignment to the night shift. If there are other employees not on the night shift with less State Seniority who are capable and qualified, the employee with the least State Seniority will be assigned to the night shift and you will fill the position that person leaves. You must be capable and qualified to fill the position of the person filling your night shift position. Your request will remain open until you withdraw it or you are replaced by another employee; or,
3.	Exchange shifts with an employee who does not work the night shift. You must both be in the same class and option, and you must both be capable and qualified for the other’s position. Exchanges with an employee in a different class may occur if the supervisor approves.
3.	Shifts Between Davs Off. Your supervisor will not schedule you to work more than two (2) shifts and/or two (2) shift changes between scheduled days off.
For this section only, a scheduled shift with a starting time within two (2) hours of the starting time of the first scheduled shift after scheduled days off is considered the same shift. When
238
there is a scheduled shift rotation, a change of no more than two (2) hours from the starting time of the scheduled shift is not considered a change in shift.
The Local Union and Management may agree to change the terms of Article 2, Work Schedules.
4.	Variable Schedule Positions. Variable schedule positions may be established for the purpose of alleviating overtime costs and for the granting of vacation for employees in the AFSCME Bargaining Unit. The number of positions may be increased or decreased with the written agreement of the local union and management. Postings will list job duties, schedule variability and insurance eligibility conditions.
If you are a variable schedule employee, you will:
1.	Be offered at least one thousand forty four (1044) hours per year;
2.	Have your hours worked reviewed annually by management to find out if you maintain insurance eligibility;
3.	Be notified thirty (30) days before the end of the twelve (12) consecutive months used to determine insurance eligibility so that you can make alternate plans if you lose coverage. DHS or Master Agreement layoff language does not apply to the loss of insurance coverage.
Management will review and adjust your insurance contributions between full and partial levels quarterly. Management will inform you directly of changes in your contribution level or eligibility.
If you are a variable schedule employee, you will be scheduled a portion of your time and:
1.	Your remaining hours will be assigned within the posting period.
2.	Additional hours will be treated as if posted.
3.	Additional hours will be offered before using intermittents unless the hours would create overtime.
Schedule changes within the posting period will not result in penalty pay. You can refuse additional hours offered within the posted schedule period three (3) times per quarter.
Every effort will be made by the supervisor to schedule and assign work to variable schedule employees on an equal distribution basis.
Status reports will be given at quarterly Labor/Management meetings.
Either the Local Union or Management may cancel this section of the Supplement by giving the other a ninety (90) day written notice. If canceled, Management will have ninety (90) days to return the affected employees to their previous employment condition using Article 12, Section 7 of the Master Agreement.

Schedule Posting. Your supervisor must post your work schedule at least fourteen (14) days before the effective date. The posting must include the following information:
Days
Shifts
Hours
There are four (4) reasons your posted schedule can be changed without penalty:
1.	You may exchange days, shifts or hours on the posted schedule if:
You are capable and qualified to perform each other’s duties.
Your supervisor (may not unreasonably deny) approves the exchange.
The exchange does not result in either of you becoming eligible for overtime.
2.	You may change your own days, shifts or hours on the posted schedule if:
Your supervisor approves the request.
Your request does not make you eligible for overtime.
3.	If you work in the DT&H, your supervisor may change your posted schedule with three (3) working days notice if it is necessary to obtain or maintain a job opportunity for a client. This schedule change will not result in the payment of overtime.
243
Your qualifications will be the primary consideration
Your supervisor will consider State Seniority
You may flex your schedule to obtain or maintain a job for a client if it does not create overtime. Your supervisor must approve.
4.	If you are assigned to provide crisis services, your supervisor may change your posted schedule with three (3) working days notice if it is necessary to respond to a client crisis need. This schedule change will not result in the payment of overtime. Your supervisor will make the assignment based upon the State Seniority of the capable and qualified employees.
If the service where you work is temporarily closed or is underutilized, you may choose to:
Work on site catching up on duties,
Take a temporary reassignment, Use paid or unpaid leave.
Variable Schedule HST and General Repair Worker Positions. There will be a variable schedule Human Services Technician (HST) pool of no more than twenty-nine (29) positions and one (1) General Repair Worker position. The maximum number of positions may be increased or decreased with the written approval of the local union and the Appointing Authority. No more than six (6) of these positions will have the Pine Street, N Street, or Forestview home as a primary work site. This pool is a work area for bidding and layoff purposes, and postings will list job duties, schedule variability, and insurance eligibility conditions.
If you are a Variable Schedule HST or General Repair Worker, you will:
1.	Be offered at least one thousand forty four (1044) hours per year;
2.	Have your hours worked reviewed annually by Management to find out if you maintain insurance eligibility;
3.	Be notified thirty (30) days before the end of the twelve (12) consecutive months used to determine insurance eligibility so that you can make alternate plans if you lose coverage. DHS or Master Agreement layoff language does not apply to the loss of insurance coverage.
Management will review and adjust your insurance contributions between full and partial levels quarterly. Management will inform you directly of changes in your contribution level or eligibility.
If you are a Variable Schedule HST or General Repair Worker, you will be scheduled a portion of your time and:
1.	Your remaining hours will be assigned within the posting period.
2.	Additional hours will be treated as if posted.
3.	Additional hours will be offered before using intermittents unless the hours would create overtime.
Schedule changes within the posting period will not result in penalty pay.
You can refuse additional hours offered within the posted schedule period three (3) times per quarter.
Every effort will be made by the supervisor to schedule and assign work to Variable Schedule employees on an equal distribution basis.
244
You will be reimbursed for mileage and travel time only if you are required to change work sites in the course of a work day or work a subsequent shift at a different work site.
Management will decrease the use of intermittent employees in direct proportion to the use of Variable Schedule HSTs. Status reports will be given at quarterly Labor/Management meetings.
This section of the Supplement will be included in subsequent Agreements only if it is mutually agreed to. If it is not included, Management will have ninety (90) days to return the affected employees to their previous employment condition using Article 12, Section 7 of the Master Agreement.
Article 5, Section 1(D) of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Meal Periods. You will normally have an unpaid meal break of between thirty (30) and sixty (60) minutes. If you are scheduled for an unpaid meal break, it will only be after you have worked for at least three (3) hours but no more than five (5) hours. You will be paid at the appropriate rate, straight time or overtime, for any time you are required to remain in duty status or are assigned to perform work during your meal period.
Article 5, Section 3(B) of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Work Day. The normal work day is either eight (8) or ten (10) hours of work in a twenty-four (24) hour period, not including a duty free, unpaid meal period.
There are several reasons Management can depart from the normal work day, change the normal work day between an eight (8) and ten (10) hour day, or establish a shift not currently used. These reasons are:
Efficiency
The needs of the public, D.H.S., or the SOCS
Better consumer services
Better use of the facilities and/or you and other staff.
Management must do the following things before changing the normal work day or establishing a new shift:
Give the Local Union at least thirty (30) days notice.
If the Local Union requests it, discuss the changes before they are posted.
Article 5 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Definitions
Weekends: Saturday and Sunday are the weekend unless defined otherwise.
Work Period. The Local Union and Management will meet and confer to develop a reasonable scheduling pattern before the schedules must be posted. If no scheduling patterns are developed through this process, your supervisor may use any of the following scheduling patterns for full-time employees:
A 6-2-3 rotation.
A 6-2 rotation with four (4) consecutive days off every sixth week.
A 7-5-3 or 3-5-7 rotation with every third weekend off.
No more than seven (7) consecutive work days with two (2) weekends off out of every four (4) weekends. Scheduled days off may not be consecutive.

Five (5) consecutive work days with two (2) consecutive days off. The days off must be fixed. You must bid for fixed days off and bids will be awarded by seniority.
Changes in the operation of a unit/program may force Management to permanently change your scheduling pattern. This can happen for the following reasons:
Efficiency
The needs of the public, D.H.S., or the SOCS
Better consumer services
Better use of the facilities and or you and other staff.
Management must do the following things before changing your scheduling pattern:

Article 5 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Fixed Night Shift. All night shifts are fixed. When a night shift position becomes vacant, the Management must post it for bids. If no one successfully bids on the position, Management can fill the vacancy by:
Using Article 12, Section 7 of the Master Agreement, or
Reassigning the capable and qualified volunteer with the most State Seniority not on nights from the work area that a reassignment would come from; if there are no volunteers,
Reassigning the person with the least State Seniority from same pool asked for volunteers. If that person is reassigned from a Regional Treatment Center to a State Operated Community Service, The Regional Treatment Center will be considered the work area.
If you work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to a different shift for the following reasons:
Training.
Staff development.
Informational meetings.
Jury duty.
If you do not work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily reschedule you to the night shift for the following reasons:

•	To cover for leave (paid or unpaid) of six (6) months or less of a night shift employee.
•	To cover for night shift staff temporarily scheduled to other shifts.
•	Temporarily assign more staff to the night shift.
•	Emergencies.
If your supervisor decides to temporarily reschedule to the night shift, (s)he will decide:
Which class(es) are needed.
Which work area(s) employee(s) will be reassigned from.
Your supervisor will then:
Schedule the volunteer with the most State Seniority who is capable and qualified; If there are no volunteers,
Reassign the employee with the least State Seniority from the same group asked for volunteers.
If you have been permanently assigned to the night shift and want to work a different shift, you have the following options:
1.	Successfully bid on a vacancy in another shift. If you are still the capable and qualified employee with the least State Seniority for the night shift, your bid will be rejected; or,
2.	Ask your supervisor to remove you from the night shift after at least three (3) months assignment to the night shift. If there are other employees not on the night shift with less State Seniority who are capable and qualified, the employee with the least State Seniority will be assigned to the night shift and you will fill the position that person leaves. You must be capable and qualified to fill the position of the person filling your night shift position. Your request will remain open until you withdraw it or you are replaced by another employee; or,
3.	Exchange shifts with an employee who does not work the night shift. You must both be in the same class and option, and you must both be capable and qualified for the other’s position.

3.	Offer the overtime work to capable employees in the selected class(es) and in the same work area who are off-duty (most State Seniority to least) until the work is accepted. If you use sick leave, personal leave or leave without pay for personal illness on the preceding shift, you will not be eligible for overtime work. If no one accepts the overtime,
247
4.	Have the right to assign mandatory overtime work to the capable employee(s) with the least State Seniority in the work unit who is on duty. This assignment will rotate within each pay period starting with the capable employee who has the least State Seniority.

1.	Decide which class(es) will perform the work.
2.	Offer the overtime work to employees in the selected class(es) and in the same work unit who are capable of performing the work (most State seniority to least) until the work is accepted. If no one accepts the overtime,
3.	Have the right to assign mandatory overtime work to the capable employee from the same pool offered the overtime with the least State Seniority who is scheduled for the shift before (immediately preceding) the overtime assignment. If no one is scheduled for that shift, the capable employee with the least State Seniority in the work unit will be assigned. This assignment will rotate within each pay period starting with the capable employee who has least State Seniority.
In an emergency, Management may assign some one to deal with the situation regardless of the overtime distribution.
Your supervisor will assign overtime work as soon as practicable once the need is known.

If you initiate a move to a different work location and you have approved vacation leave that occurs less than six (6) months from the date of the move, your new supervisor may honor the request if it does not cause overtime and staffing needs are met.

Part-time Hours Procedure. If you are a part-time, but not a temporary or emergency, Unit 4 employee, you may work additional hours within the posting period at straight time in accordance with the following. If additional hours need to be worked within the fourteen (14) day posting period and the work cannot be performed by previously scheduled employees, your supervisor will:
1.	Offer the additional hours to the capable part-time employee who has put in writing a desire for the work (most senior to least). If no one accepts the hours,
2.	Have the right to assign the hours to other employees (e.g., intermittent, non-bargaining unit, or overtime) to accomplish the work.
If you are assigned the work as overtime, you are eligible for overtime pay.
If you have indicated a desire for additional hours in writing and you decline those hours as straight time, you will not be eligible for voluntary overtime for those hours.
Additional hours needed on a holiday will be distributed according to the overtime provisions of Supplemental Agreement between FFRTC and Local 735, AFSCME Council 5.
If you request leave time from your regular shift, you will not be offered additional hours that day. If you accept additional hours, you will not be granted leave time from your regular shift.
If you accept extra hours, you are expected to keep your commitment for those hours as if they were part of your normally scheduled shift.
You will not be offered additional hours using this procedure if they would result in payment of overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Any hours you are assigned beyond the fourteen (14) day posting period are not covered by these provisions.
Intermittent Employees. If you are an intermittent employee, your supervisor may schedule you to cover vacation, sick leave, leaves of absence, staff training and development, jury duty, informational meetings and workers’ compensation situations. Your supervisor will offer all of the additional hours to part-time employees first, if the hours do not result in the payment of overtime.
Your supervisor will notify the Local AFSCME president in writing if you are an intermittent and will be scheduled more than five (5) working days. The notice will include your name, the name of the employee you are replacing and the dates.
Either Management or the Local Union may end this agreement with thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.
Fixed Night Shift (for all Units except Units 2 and 7). All night shifts are fixed. When a night shift position becomes vacant, Management must post it for bids. If your employment condition is part-time or intermittent, you cannot bid on a position that would change your employment condition unless it is a new position. If no one successfully bids on the position, Management may recruit and hire to fill the vacancy or reassign the person with the least State Seniority (Units 4 & 6) who is capable and qualified but not on a fixed night schedule.
If you work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to a different shift for the following reasons:
262
Training or other staff development.
Informational meetings.
Jury duty.
If you do not work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to the night shift for the following reasons:
•	To cover vacant night shift positions during the process of filling a vacancy.

•	To cover for leave (paid or unpaid) of six (6) months or less of a night shift employee.
•	To cover for night shift staff temporarily scheduled to other shifts.
•	Temporarily assign more staff to nights.
•	Emergencies.
If your supervisor decides to temporarily reschedule to the night shift, (s)he will decide:
•	Which class(es) are needed.
•	Which work area employee(s) will be rescheduled from.
The employee(s) in the selected class(es) and work area with the least State Seniority who is capable and qualified will work the night shift.
If you have been permanently assigned to the night shift and want to work a different shift, you have the following options:
1.	Successfully bid on a vacancy in another shift. If you are still the capable and qualified employee with the least State Seniority (Units 4 & 6) for the night shift, your bid will be rejected; or,
2.	Ask your human resources director to remove you from the night shift after at least three (3) months assignment to the night shift. If there are other employees not on the night shift with less State Seniority (Units 4 & 6) who are capable and qualified, the employee with the least State Seniority (Units 4 & 6) will be assigned to the night shift and you will fill the position that person leaves. You must be capable and qualified to fill the position of the person filling your night shift position. Your request will remain open until you withdraw it or you are replaced by another employee; or
3.	Exchange shifts with an employee who does not work the night shift. You must both be in the same class(es) and option, and you must both be capable and qualified for the other’s position.
Shifts Between Days Off. Your supervisor will not schedule you to work more than two (2) shifts and/or two (2) shift changes between scheduled days off.
If you want an on-going schedule with more than two (2) shifts and/or two shift changes between days off, you must give your supervisor a written request at least seven (7) days before your schedule must be posted. The request must be for more than one scheduling period and include the beginning and ending dates for the modified schedule. Your supervisor will not unreasonably deny your request. To change back before the requested ending date, you must give your supervisor written notice at least seven (7) days before your schedule must be posted.
263
For this section only, a scheduled shift with a starting time within two (2) hours of the starting time of the first scheduled shift after scheduled days off is considered the same shift. When there is a scheduled shift rotation, a change no more than two (2) hours from the starting time of the scheduled shift is not considered a change in shift.
Reduction to Part-time. Management may permanently reduce your employment condition from full-time to part-time only by a written agreement between you, Management and the Local Union. Management will provide you with a list of your affected benefits before the reduction.
The Local Union and Management may agree to change the terms of Article 3, Work Schedules.
Article 4 Holiday Pay
If you are scheduled and in pay status for any part of the early or afternoon shift the day before the holiday and any part of the night shift which begins on the holiday, the holiday will be treated as falling on your regularly scheduled day off.

B.	Seniority Unit Layoff List. Selection will next be made from the Seniority Unit Layoff List unless the vacancy is being filled by an employee with more State Seniority (Units 4 & 6) who has received a permanent layoff notice.
1.	Same Employment Condition. Selection will next be made from employees on the Seniority Unit Layoff list, if there is one, in order of State Seniority (Units 4 & 6).

C.	Claiming. Before accepting a claim, Management has the option of filling the vacancy with a seniority unit employee with more State Seniority than any claimer who has received a permanent layoff notice. If this option is not used, see Article 15, Section 3 (D) 3 (g) regarding employee requests to claim positions in other seniority units to avoid layoff or bumping. If Management must choose between ciaimers, seniority will not be a consideration.
D.	Class (or Class Option) Layoff List.

Selection from these employees will not be unreasonably denied.
If Sections B, C, and/or D apply, selection will be next made from bidders not receiving full Employer insurance contribution. If Sections B, C, and/or D do not apply, bidders not receiving full Employer insurance contribution will be considered as provided in Section E (1) below.
E.	Other. If the vacancy remains unfilled, Management will have the option of filling it using one of the following methods:
1.	Eligible List. If a promotion is made from an eligible list or to a Routine Service position, selection will be from bidders who are not receiving full Employer insurance contribution as well as employees in the same seniority unit whose names appear on the eligible list certified by the Department of Employee Relations or who have expressed interest in the Routine Service position in order of State Seniority, provided the most senior employee’s ability and capacity to perform the job are relatively equal to other’s eligible under this section; or
2.	Voluntary Demotion. If voluntary demotion is used, selection will be made by accepting the application of an employee who is willing to demote; or
3.	Voluntary Transfer. If voluntary transfer is used, selection will be made by accepting the application of an employee who is willing to accept a transfer; or
4.	Reinstatement. If reinstatement is used, selection will be made by reinstating a former employee; or
268

•	The exchange does not result in either of you becoming eligible for overtime.
3.	You may change your own days, shifts or hours on the posted schedule if:
•	Your supervisor approves the request.
•	Your request does not make you eligible for overtime.
Article 5, Section 1 (D) of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Meal Periods. You will normally be scheduled to work a straight shift without an unpaid meal period. If you are scheduled for an unpaid meal period, it will be between thirty (30) and sixty (60) minutes long.

Part-time employees may not be scheduled for an unpaid meal period.
Article 5, Section 3(B) of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Work Day. The normal work day is either eight (8) or ten (10) hours of work in a twenty-four (24) hour period.
There are several reasons Management can change the normal work day or begin using a shift not currently used. These reasons are:
•	Efficiency
•	The needs of the public, D.H.S., or the SOCS
•	Better consumer services
•	Better use of the facilities and/or you and other staff.
Management must do the following things before changing the normal work day or establishing a new shift:
•	Give the Local Union at least thirty (30) days notice.
•	If the Local Union requests it, discuss the changes before they are posted.
Article 5 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Definitions.
Weekends: Saturday and Sunday are the weekend unless otherwise defined.
Work Period. The Local Union and Management will meet and confer to develop a reasonable scheduling pattern before the schedules must be posted. If no scheduling patterns are developed through this process, your supervisor may use any of the following scheduling patterns for full-time employees:
•	A 6-2-3 rotation.
•	A 6-2 rotation with four (4) consecutive days off every sixth week.
•	A 7-5-3 or 3-5-7 rotation with every third weekend off.
•	No more than seven (7) consecutive work days with two (2) weekends off out of every four (4) weekends. Scheduled days off may not be consecutive.
270

•	Scheduled days off may not be consecutive.
•	Five (5) consecutive work days with two (2) consecutive days off. Days off must be fixed and bid by seniority.
Changes in the operation of a unit/program may force Management to permanently change your scheduling pattern. This can happen for the following reasons:
•	Efficiency.
•	The needs of the public, D.H.S., or the SOCS.
•	Better consumer services.
•	Better use of the facilities and/or you and other staff.
Management must do the following things before changing your scheduling pattern:
•	Give the Local Union at least thirty (30) days notice.
•	Meet and confer with the Local Union to develop a reasonable scheduling pattern for your unit/program before the new schedules are posted.
If you are a part-time employee, your schedule must include:
•	At least four (4) days off in a two (2) week period.
•	At least two (2) of the days off must be consecutive.
•	No more than seven (7) consecutive work days.
Part-time Hours Procedure. If you are a part-time but not a temporary or emergency Unit 4 employee, you may work additional hours within the posting period at straight time in accordance with the following. If additional hours need to be worked within the fourteen (14) day posting period and the work cannot be performed by previously scheduled employees, your supervisor will:
1.	Offer the additional hours to the capable part-time employee whose has put in writing a desire for the work (most senior to least). If no one accepts the hours,
2.	Have the right to assign the hours to other employees (e.g., intermittent, non-bargaining unit, or overtime) to accomplish the work.
If you are assigned the work as overtime, you are eligible for overtime pay.
If you have indicated a desire for additional hours in writing and you decline those hours as straight time, you will not be eligible for voluntary overtime for those hours.
Additional hours needed on a holiday will be distributed according to the overtime provisions of Supplemental Agreement between FFRTC and Local 735, AFSCME Council 5.
If you request leave time from your regular shift, you will not be offered additional hours that day. If you accept additional hours, you will not be granted leave time from your regular shift.
If you accept extra hours, you are expected to keep your commitment for those hours as if they were part of your normally scheduled shift.
You will not be offered additional hours using this procedure if they would result in payment of overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Any hours you are assigned beyond the fourteen (14) day posting period are not covered by these provisions.
271
Intermittent Employees. If you are an intermittent employee, your supervisor may schedule you to cover vacation, sick leave, leaves of absence, staff training and development, jury duty, informational meetings and workers’ compensation situations. Your supervisor will offer all of the additional hours to part-time employees first, if the hours do not result in the payment of overtime.
Your supervisor will notify the Local AFSCME president in writing if you are an intermittent and will be scheduled more than five (5) working days. The notice will include your name, the name of the employee you are replacing and the dates.
Either Management or the Local Union may end this agreement with thirty (30) days written notice to the other party.
Article 5 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Fixed Night Shift. All night shifts are fixed. When a night shift position becomes vacant, the Management must post it for bids. If no one successfully bids on the position, Management can fill the vacancy by:
•	Using Article 12, Section 7 of the Master Agreement, or
•	Reassigning the capable and qualified volunteer with the most State Seniority who is not on nights from the work area that a reassignment would come from; if there are no volunteers,
•	Reassign the person with the least State Seniority from same work area asked for volunteers. If that person is reassigned from a Regional Treatment Center to a State Operated Community Service, the Regional Treatment Center will be considered the work area.
If you work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to a different shift for the following reasons:
•	Training.
•	Staff development.
•	Informational meetings.
•	Jury duty.
If you do not work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to the night shift for the following reasons:
•	To cover vacant night shift positions during the process of filling a vacancy.
•	To cover for night shift employees’ days off.
•	To cover for leave (paid or unpaid) of six (6) months or less of a night shift employee.
•	To cover for night shift staff temporarily scheduled to other shifts.
•	Temporarily assign more staff to the night shift
•	Emergencies.
If your supervisor decides to temporarily reschedule to the night shift, (s)he will decide:
•	Which class(es) are needed.
•	Which work area employee(s) will be rescheduled from.
272
Your supervisor will then:
•	Schedule the volunteer from the selected class(es) and work area with the most State Seniority who is capable and qualified; If there are no volunteers,
•	Reschedule the employee with the least State Seniority from the same group asked for volunteers.
If you have been permanently assigned to the night shift and want to work a different shift, you have the following options:
1.	Successfully bid on a vacancy in another shift. If you are still the capable and qualified employee with the least State Seniority for the night shift, your bid will be rejected; or
2.	Ask your supervisor to remove you from the night shift after at least three (3) months assignment to the night shift. If there are other employees not on the night shift with less State Seniority who are capable and qualified, the employee with the least State Seniority will be assigned to the night shift and you will fill the position that person leaves. You must be capable and qualified to fill the position of the person filling your night shift position. Your request will remain open until you withdraw it or you are replaced by another employee; or
3.	Exchange shifts with an employee who does not work the night shift. You must both be in the same class and option, and you must both be capable and qualified for the other’s position.
If you have successfully bid on a night shift position, this section does not apply.
Reduction to Part-time. Management may permanently reduce your employment condition from full-time to part-time only by a written agreement between you, Management and the Local Union. Management will provide you with a list of your affected benefits before the reduction.
Section 2. Overtime.
Article 6, Section 4 of the Master Agreement is changes as follows:
If you want to be offered voluntary overtime, you must put in writing the days and shifts of each pay period you are willing to work overtime before the beginning of that pay period.
Overtime Distribution. If your supervisor needs someone to work overtime for the next (immediately subsequent) shift, (s)he will:
1.	Decide which class(es) will perform the work.
2.	Prior to offering the hours to someone on the overtime sign up sheet, offer the overtime work to capable employees in the selected class(es) and in the same work unit who are on-duty (most State Seniority (Units 4 & 6) to least) until the work is accepted. If no one accepts the overtime,
3.	Offer the overtime work to capable employees in the selected class(es) and in the same work area who have indicated in writing his/her interest in the shift (most State Seniority (Units 4& 6) to least) until the work is accepted. If no one accepts the overtime,
4.	Have the right to assign mandatory overtime work to the capable employee(s) with the least State Seniority in the work unit who is on duty. This assignment will rotate within each pay period starting with the capable employee who has the least State Seniority (Units 4 & 6).
If your supervisor needs someone to work overtime for other than the next (immediately subsequent) shift, they will:
273
1.	Decide which class(es) will perform the work.
2.	Offer the overtime work to employees in the selected class(es) and in the same work unit who are capable of performing the work, and have indicated in writing her/his interest in the shift (most State Seniority (Units 4 & 6) to least) until the work is accepted. If no one accepts the overtime,
3.	Have the right to assign mandatory overtime to the capable employee with the least State Seniority (Units 4& 6) in the selected class(es) in the same work unit who is scheduled for the shift before (immediately preceding) the overtime assignment. If no one is scheduled for that shift, the least senior capable employee in the work unit will be assigned. This assignment will rotate within each pay period starting with the capable employee who has least State Seniority (Units 4 & 6).
4.	Employees who are scheduled only four (4) days in the pay period will not be mandated overtime on those identified days off.
In an emergency, Management may assign some one to deal with the situation regardless of the overtime distribution.
Your supervisor will assign overtime work as soon as practicable once the need is known.

If there is more than one (1) exclusive representative in the department or principal place of employment, the Union will try to work out an arrangement with the other exclusive representative(s) to ensure their input to the Committee. Management’s designated Occupational Health and Safety Officer will chair the Safety Committee and schedule its meetings. The Committee will meet at least quarterly or as often as is legally required. Additional meetings may be called by the Safety Officer, the Local Union or Management as needed.

The Safety Committee will review reports of personal injury accidents, property damage, and allegedly hazardous working conditions, provide support for a strong safety program, and review and recommend safety policies to Management. Normally, the Committee will acknowledge reports of allegedly hazardous working conditions in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt. The individual filing the report and the Management will receive a copy of the Committee’s recommendations, if any, for handling of the report. In addition the Committee will give the individual filing a copy of Management’s response and/or proposed actions, if any.
The Local Safety Committee in any facility with a laundry and/or kitchen will perform a routine survey to check temperature, humidity, exhaust systems, and fan systems in the laundries and kitchens. Management will coordinate technical assistance to the Local Safety Committee if asked.

You must be capable and qualified to perform the duties of the other position.

You and your supervisor may agree to change the scheduling pattern/practice. Management retains the right to permanently change the scheduling pattern using the provisions of this Supplemental Agreement.
The scheduling pattern/practice for full-time employees in use on the effective date of the Master Agreement will continue.
Your supervisor can change the starting or ending times of a shift by no more than two (2) hours with fourteen (14) days notice.
Your supervisor may temporarily change your schedule for training, staff development, informational meetings, team meetings, and special projects.
Management must do the following before permanently changing the scheduling option(s) of a unit/program:

•	Meet and confer with the Local Union to develop a reasonable scheduling pattern before the new schedule(s) must be posted.

A. Part-time Hours Procedure. This procedure applies to all Unit 4 Security Counselors and Food Service Workers at the Minnesota Sex Offender Program:
If additional coverage is needed within the posting period and that work cannot be performed by previously scheduled employees (i.e., temporary reassignment), your supervisor will first offer the work to part-time employees using the voluntary overtime distribution procedure. If you accept the hours, you are not eligible for “penalty pay”.
You are not eligible for the work if it would cause overtime according to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
If no one eligible accepts the work, your supervisor may assign the hours to other employees (e.g., intermittent, non-bargaining unit, or overtime. This list is not inclusive).
Any hours you are assigned beyond the fourteen (14) day posting period are not covered by these provisions.
If you are assigned work as overtime, you are eligible for overtime pay.
Additional hours worked under this procedure will not affect your eligibility for health insurance.
4.	Fixed Night Shift (for all Units except Units 2 and 7). All night shifts are fixed. When a night shift position becomes vacant, Management must post it for bids. If no one successfully bids on the position, Management may recruit and hire to fill the vacancy or reassign the person with the least State Seniority who is capable and qualified but not on a fixed night schedule.
If you work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to a different shift for the following reasons:
•	Training or other staff development.
•	Informational meetings.
•	Jury duty.
If you do not work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily schedule you to the night shift for the following reasons:
•	To cover vacant night shift positions during the posting, bidding and hiring process.
•	To cover days off of night shift employees.
•	To cover for leave (paid or unpaid) of six (6) months or less of a night shift employee.
•	To cover for night shift staff temporarily scheduled to other shifts.
•	Temporarily assign more staff to nights.
•	Emergency situations.
287
If your supervisor decides to temporarily reschedule to the night shift, (s)he will decide:
•	Which class(es) are needed.
•	Which work area(s) employee(s) will be reassigned from.
The capable and qualified employee(s) in the appropriate class(es) and work area with the most State seniority who requests will work the night shift. You must submit in writing to your supervisor your preference to work the night shift. Your written preference will be kept on file and assignments to nights will be made by seniority. If no one requests the reassignment, the capable and qualified employee(s) in the appropriate class(es) and work area with the least State seniority will work the night shift. If that employee has been scheduled for a holiday off, the least senior employee not off for the holiday will work the night shift.
If you have been permanently assigned to the night shift and want to work a different shift, you have the following options:
1	. Successfully bid on a vacancy in another shift. If you are still the capable and qualified employee with the least State Seniority for the night shift, your bid will be rejected; or
2	. Ask your Human Resources Director to remove you from the night shift after at least three (3) months assignment to the night shift. If there are other employees not on the night shift with less State Seniority who are capable and qualified, the employee with the least State Seniority will be assigned to the night shift and you will fill the position that person leaves. You must be capable and qualified to fill the position of the person filling your night shift position. Your request will remain open until you withdraw it or you are replaced by another employee; or
3	. Exchange shifts with an employee who does not work the night shift. You must both be in the same class(es) and option selected by Management, and you must both be capable and qualified for the other’s position.
5.	Shifts Between Davs Off. Your supervisor will not schedule you to work more than two (2) shifts and/or two (2) shift changes between scheduled days off.
For this section only, a scheduled shift with a starting time within two (2) hours of the starting time of the first scheduled shift after scheduled days off is considered the same shift. When there is a scheduled shift rotation, a change no more than two (2) hours from the starting time of the scheduled shift is not considered a change in shift. (MSOP has security counselor shifts that start and end with-in thirty (30) minutes and are considered the same shift.)

Loss of eligibility and/or changes in contribution levels shall apply to the individual directly affected by such change.
Variable schedule employees will be scheduled for a portion of their time; however, additional hours may be assigned within the posting period.

Article 2 Work Schedules
Article 5, Section 3 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
Definitions
Weekend: Saturday and Sunday are the weekend unless defined otherwise. If you work the night shift, your weekend is Friday and Saturday.
1.	Work Period. If you are a full-time employee, your supervisor will use one of the following schedule patterns:
309
a.	No more than six (6) consecutive work days; no less than three (3) consecutive work days; consecutive days off; or,
b.	No more than seven (7) consecutive work days, no less than three (3) consecutive work days, two (2) or more weekends off out of every eight (8) weekends, consecutive days off; or,
c.	No more than seven (7) consecutive work days, two (2) weekends off out of every four (4) weekends, days off may not be consecutive.
d.	Security Counselors and Security Counselor Leads will be scheduled five (5) consecutive work days, two (2) consecutive days off. Days off will be determined by Class Seniority.
Part-time Employees. Your schedule must include:
•	At least four (4) days off in a two (2) week pay period.
•	At least two (2) of the days off must be consecutive.
•	No more than seven (7) consecutive work days.
You may be scheduled eight (8) consecutive work days with six (6) days off if you request and your supervisor approves it.
When full-time and part-time employees cannot be scheduled to cover for medical and childrearing leaves, your supervisor can schedule an intermittent employee.
Additional Part-time Hours: (not applicable to work that becomes available for the next subsequent shift)
If additional Security Counselor coverage is needed within the fourteen (14)-day posting period and that work cannot be performed by previously scheduled employees, the supervisor will first offer the work to part-time employees using a voluntary additional hours distribution procedure. The work will be offered division-wide by Classification Seniority. The additional hours will be paid at straight time. You are not eligible for the work if it would cause overtime according to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
2.	Fixed Night Shift (for all units except Units 2 and 7). All night shifts are fixed. When a night shift position becomes vacant, Management must post it for bids. If no one successfully bids on the position, Management may recruit and hire for the vacancy or assign the person with the least Class Seniority who is capable and qualified but not on a fixed night schedule.
If you work the night shift, your supervisor may schedule you to a different shift for the following reasons:
•	Training or other staff development.
•	Informational meetings.
•	Jury duty.
If you are a part-time employee permanently assigned to a night shift, you may volunteer for other shifts to cover for paid and unpaid leaves of six (6) months or less or to cover the time it takes to fill a position during the posting and bidding process. The volunteer with the most State Seniority (Class Seniority for Security Counselors and Security Counselor Leads) will be selected. Either the Local Union or Management can cancel this agreement by giving sixty (60) days written notice.
310
If you do not work the night shift, your supervisor may temporarily assign you to the night shift for the following reasons:
•	To cover vacant night shift positions during the process of filling a vacancy.
•	To cover for night shift employees’ days off.
•	To cover for leave (paid or unpaid) of six (6) months or less of a night shift employee.
•	To cover for night shift staff temporarily scheduled to other shifts.
•	To temporarily assign more staff to the night shift.
•	Emergency situations.
If management decides to reschedule to the night shift, (s)he will decide:
•	which class(es) are needed.
•	which work area(s) employee(s) will be reassigned from.
If you have the least State Seniority (Class Seniority for Security Counselors and Security Counselor Leads), are in the appropriate class(es) and work area, and are capable and qualified, and there are no volunteers, you are rescheduled to work the night shift.
If you have been permanently assigned to the night shift and want to work a different shift, you have the following options:
1	. Successfully bid on a vacancy in another shift. However, if you are still the capable and qualified employee with the least Class Seniority for the night shift position, your bid will be rejected; or,
2	. Ask your human resources director to remove you from the night shift after at least three (3) months assignment to the night shift. If there are other employees not on the night shift with less Class Seniority who are capable and qualified, the employee with the least Class Seniority will be assigned to the night shift and you will fill the position that person leaves. You must be capable and qualified to fill the position of the person filling your night shift position. Your request will be in effect for a maximum of twelve (12) months and, during this time, will remain open until you withdraw it or you are replaced by another employee.
3	. Exchange shifts with an employee who does not work the night shift. You must both be in the same class and option, and you must both be capable and qualified for the other’s position. For Security Counselors and Security Counselor Leads, each of your supervisors must approve the mutual exchange. Your supervisors will not unreasonably deny the request. For purposes of this subsection, your days off will be assigned by Class Seniority on the unit/work area that you mutually exchange to.
4	. Established Shifts. The established shifts for Licensed Practical Nurses working in MSH/MSOP, Security Control Clerks, Security Counselors, and Security Counselor, Leads are as follows:
6:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m.
2:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m.
10:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m.
3.	Shifts Between Days Off. Your supervisor will not schedule you to work more than two (2) shifts and/or two (2) shift changes between scheduled days off.
For this subsection only, a scheduled shift with a starting time within two (2) hours of the starting time of the first scheduled shift after scheduled days off is considered the same shift. When there is a scheduled shift rotation, a change of no more than two (2) hours from the starting time of the scheduled shift is not considered a change in shift.
311
Reduction to Part-time. Management may permanently reduce your employment condition from full-time to part-time only by a written agreement between you, Management, and the Local Union. Management will provide a worksheet to explain the effect of the change on your leave accruals, insurance eligibility and Employer insurance contribution.
The Local Union and Management may agree to change the terms of Article 2, Work Schedules.
Article 3
Holiday Pay
Article 7, Section 5 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
If you are scheduled and in pay status for any part of the early or afternoon shift the day before the holiday and any part of the night shift which begins on the holiday, the holiday will be treated as your regularly scheduled day off.
Article 7, Section 8 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
When you work on a holiday, you will be paid at the rate of time and one-half for your regularly scheduled shift. The portion that is premium pay will be paid to you in cash, compensatory time or vacation time, at your option. You will also receive holiday pay as defined in Article 7, Section 7 of the Master Agreement that will be paid in cash, compensatory time, or vacation time, at your option.
Article 4
Flextime Scheduling
The Local Union and Management may agree to a flextime scheduling plan.
Article 5
Overtime Assignment
Article 6, Section 4 of the Master Agreement is changed as follows:
If you are currently working an overtime assignment, you cannot be forced to work the next shift even if you are the least senior person.
If you work seventy five percent (75%) time or more, you cannot be assigned mandatory overtime between the last scheduled shift before your days off and your next scheduled shift unless there is an emergency. Part-time employees working less than seventy-five percent (75%) time will not be assigned mandatory overtime before scheduled vacation days or weekends off.
All Classifications (Excluding Security Counselors, Security Counselor Leads, and Security Control Clerks):
You cannot be assigned mandatory overtime on the night shift if you are currently working a late shift, and are scheduled for a late shift the next day with an early shift the day after that.
When patient transportation provided by the Mental Health Program only under contract to a county is requested and overtime may be needed, the driver from the list of trained AFSCME staff on duty with the most State Seniority will be used. AFSCME staff at SPRTC will be offered the opportunity to volunteer for the list of trained drivers. The Employer will make driving assignments so that each volunteer has the opportunity to remain on the list.
312
Any additional staff needed to accompany the driver in these situations will be selected from AFSCME staff at the Mental Health Program only according to the overtime distribution procedure of this Supplemental Agreement. Any overtime needed to fill a shift vacated by patient transportation will be distributed according to this Supplemental Agreement.
In an emergency, Management may assign someone temporarily to deal with the situation regardless of the overtime distribution.
Definition of Overtime Assignment. Overtime required by a supervisor of at least seven and one-half (7 1/2) minutes.
Involuntary Overtime Assignment. An involuntary overtime assignment is counted when the least senior eligible employee is required by a supervisor to stay beyond the end of their regularly scheduled shift for any length of time.

a.	Decide which class(es) will perform the work.
b.	Offer the overtime work to employee(s) in the selected class(es) who are capable and permanently assigned to the same work unit (most State Seniority to least) until the work is accepted. Overtime for the next (immediately subsequent) shift is first offered to those employees on duty. If no one accepts the overtime and time permits,
c.	Offer the overtime work to on duty employees in the selected class(es) who are capable (most State Seniority to least). If no one accepts the overtime and time permits,
d.	Offer the overtime work to off duty employees on the “call list” who are capable and qualified (most State Seniority to least). If no one accepts the overtime and time permits,
e.	Offer the overtime work to employees on the pool “call list” who are capable and qualified (most State Seniority to least).
You are placed on the “call list” by indicating in writing that you want voluntary overtime by, at your option:

313
If you are prohibited from working mandatory overtime because of medical restrictions, you may not volunteer for extra hours contrary to those restrictions. For employees in Units 3 and 4, this assignment will rotate within each pay period starting with the capable employee who has the least State Seniority, mandatory overtime will be assigned to on-duty employees for overtime on the next (immediately subsequent) shift.
If the work requiring overtime is already in progress, the employees performing the work will be assigned the overtime.
You cannot be assigned overtime for more than twenty-four (24) hours within a forty-eight (48) hour period unless there is an emergency.
You cannot be assigned more than one (1) mandatory overtime per pay period unless all capable employees have already worked mandatory overtime that pay period.
If all employees on duty in the work unit are ineligible for mandatory overtime, the overtime will be assigned to the least senior capable employee in the Mental Health Program.
Once the overtime is assigned/granted to an employee, it cannot be canceled so that an intermittent employee can work unless the employee originally assigned/granted the overtime agrees.
Distribution of Overtime Assignment for Security Counselors, Security Counselor Leads, Security Control Clerks, and Work Therapy Assistants.
a.	Overtime will be distributed as equally as possible among employees in the same job class(es) and work area who are capable of performing the work and the overtime. For overtime distribution the work area is the entire MSH/MSOP including all shifts.
b.	If the work requiring overtime is in progress, the employees performing the work will be assigned the overtime.
c.	Overtime work will be offered to the on duty employee who has the least number of overtime hours worked to his/her credit. If more than one employee has the same number of overtime hours to his/her credit, the overtime will be offered to the employee with the most Class Seniority. If the employee refuses the overtime, the employee with the next fewest overtime hours worked to his/her credit will be offered the overtime. Overtime hours offered but refused will be credited as worked for calculating equal distribution.
d.	If all capable employees on the same shift and work area decline the overtime, your supervisor has the right to assign mandatory overtime to the capable employee with the least Class Seniority. For employees in Units 3 and 4, this assignment will rotate within each pay period starting with the capable employee who has the least Class Seniority. Mandatory overtime will be assigned to on-duty employees for overtime on the next (immediately subsequent) shift.
You may request not to be offered voluntary overtime by giving written notice to the Personnel Officer. However, you may still be assigned mandatory overtime. You can withdraw your request by giving written notice to the Personnel Officer. Your request is effective after fourteen (14) days.
New employees to the bargaining unit will be credited with overtime hours equal to the highest number credited to any employee in the same job class and work area.
If the Local Union representative asks, Management will provide the cumulative record of overtime hours credited as worked for each employee. The record of each employee’s accumulated

•	For employees who were permanently assigned to the fixed night shift, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 12, notify the local personnel director after at least three (3) months assignment to the fixed night shift that he/she requests to be removed from the fixed night shift. If another employee not on the fixed night shift with less Classification Seniority is capable and qualified for the fixed night shift that employee shall be assigned to the fixed night position, and the employee on the fixed night shift to that employee's position provided the employee on the fixed night shift is capable and qualified for that position. If there is more than one capable and qualified employee with less Classification Seniority than the employee requesting to be removed from the fixed night shift, the capable and qualified employee with the least Classification Seniority shall be assigned to the fixed night position, provided the employee on the fixed night shift is capable and qualified for that position. The request shall remain open until the employee withdraws it, or is replaced by another employee. However, this provision shall not be applicable to employees who bid on and were awarded a fixed night shift vacancy; or,
•	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 12, an employee working other than the fixed night shift agrees to exchange with the employee assigned to the fixed night shift. Such exchange requires that both employees are in the same classification and option and each employee is capable and qualified for the position to which he/she is moving.
3.	Shifts Between Days Off. No employee shall be scheduled for a combination of more than two (2) shifts and/or two (2) shift changes during work periods between scheduled days off.
For this subsection only, a scheduled shift with a starting time within two (2) hours of the starting time of the first scheduled shift after scheduled days off shall be considered the same shift. When there is a scheduled shift rotation, a change in starting time of not more than two (2) hours from the starting time of the scheduled rotated shift shall not be considered a change in shift.
4.	Requests for Shift Changes. The Local Union and the Appointing Authority agree to meet and confer regarding the process for requesting shift changes prior to the 14-day posting period.
The Local Union and the Appointing Authority may mutually agree to alter the terms of the section Work Schedules.

Employees whose holiday pay is prorated shall also be compensated in the above manner for work on a holiday.
Employees Assigned to a Schedule Containing Twelve (12) Hour Shifts. If such an employee does not work on a designated holiday, pay shall be computed at the employee’s normal day’s pay (i.e., hourly rate of pay multiplied by the hours in the normal work day).

Employees permanently assigned to a fixed night shift may be temporarily scheduled to work other shifts for the purpose of training, staff development, informational meetings, or jury duty.
Employees working other than fixed night shifts may be temporarily rescheduled to work the night shift. The Appointing Authority shall determine the work area from which an employee is to be assigned to the night shift. If it is necessary to make such a reassignment, the Appointing Authority shall request volunteers from among employees who are working other than fixed nights. If one or more employees volunteer for the reassignment, the most senior capable and qualified volunteer based on State Seniority, within or among classes, as determined by the Appointing Authority, shall be scheduled to work the night shift.

327
•	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 12, notify his/her supervisor after at least three (3) months assignment to the fixed night shift that he/she requests to be removed from the fixed night shift. If another employee not on the fixed night shift within the work area with less State Seniority is capable and qualified for the fixed night shift that employee shall be assigned to the fixed night position and the employee on the fixed night shift to that employee's position, provided the employee on the fixed night shift is capable and qualified for that position. If there is more than one capable and qualified employee with less State Seniority than the employee requesting to be removed from the fixed night shift, the capable and qualified employee with the least State Seniority shall be assigned to the fixed night position, provided the employee on the fixed night shift is capable and qualified for that position. The request shall remain open until the employee withdraws it, or is replaced by another employee; or,
•	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 12, an employee working other than the fixed night shift agrees to exchange with the employee assigned to the fixed night shift.

B.	Between Work Areas or Shifts. If a vacancy has been created or a shift opening occurs, and the Appointing Authority determines to fill the vacancy or shift opening without adding another employee, the Appointing Authority may reassign to the position within forty (40) miles. The Appointing Authority shall request volunteers from among employees in the same class (or option) and work area/or shift from which the reassignment is to be made.

Upon request, the Appointing Authority shall furnish the Local Union with documentation of the lack of funds. Any vacancy for which eligible bids have been received and which has not been canceled shall be filled in accord with contract procedures within four (4) calendar weeks of the posting date. However, when a SOCS is initially established and it is anticipated that the position in the new Service cannot be filled within the four (4) weeks, the posting shall state the date it is expected the position will be filled. In addition, for positions in previously established SOCS, the vacancy shall be filled by the successful bidder within fourteen (14) days after the bidder has completed all required training.

Article 6
Pay Differentials
If a Department employee's total actual hours of operation for a particular piece of equipment equals or exceeds the minimum number of hours of training required to qualify for the piece of equipment and if the employee's operation of the equipment is determined by the Regional Supervisor to be satisfactory, such employee need no further certification for the types of equipment for which he/she has met the above requirements. However, such employee must complete the minimum number of hours of training required to operate other types of equipment before he/she can qualify for differential pay.
When the Appointing Authority determines that additional employee(s) should be trained for certification on any equipment at any principal place of work, the opportunity for such training shall be provided employees on the basis of Department Seniority within the principal place of work.
Employee(s) may be decertified for a) not meeting performance standards set by the Appointing Authority; b) equipment abuse as determined by the supervisor of the IRR Maintenance Shop in Eveleth; c) negligence in safety practices; d) deferral of offered equipment on the same piece of equipment three (3) consecutive times. When an employee defers an equipment assignment, the supervisor shall document such deferral by listing the date, place, and shift of deferral, and piece of equipment deferred. Such documentation shall be provided to the employee. Decertification shall be grievable under Article 17 of the Master Agreement.
335
Once decertified, the employee must complete the full training and operation schedule as required for certification on that piece of equipment again. Selection for recertification by the Appointing Authority shall be in accordance with the process above, at the next available training opportunity.
Intermittent Heavy Equipment Operator assignments shall be made on the basis of Departmental Seniority from among certified available employees capable of performing the work and assigned to the same principal place of work. For purposes of this Section, "Departmental Seniority" is defined as the length of continuous service within the I RR since the last day of entry into the I RR.
When more than one (1) certified employee is available for Heavy Equipment Operator assignment, the more senior certified operator of needed equipment shall have the right to defer an assignment to a less senior certified and available employee.
When heavy equipment moves into another principal place of work, the equipment will be operated by the most senior certified operator from the principal place of work where the equipment had been stationed.
Building demolition assignments shall be made to the most senior certified employee who is assigned to the I RR Administration building. If additional certified employees are necessary, the most senior certified employee in the Department and/or principal place of work closest to the actual work assignment shall be assigned to perform the work.
Whenever heavy equipment operator work assignments are made involving Class 3 heavy equipment, to perform building demolition work of any kind, the regular heavy equipment operator differential rate in effect, at that time, for that equipment shall be increased fifty percent (50%) of the rate difference, between Class 3 and Class 4 pay differentials. This differential rate shall be applied and payable for the actual hours involved (rounded to the nearest one-half hour) for the demolition type work but shall not include subsequent operations such as clean-up, filling, clearing, loading, etc. The immediate supervisor shall determine the starting and ending times of demolition work for payment purposes.

DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY
Article 1 Flextime
The provisions of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
Section 1.	Flextime Schedule Request. The purpose of this Article is to establish a voluntary flextime program for employees of the work units within the Department of Labor and Industry.
First shift schedules must begin no earlier than 6:00 a.m. and end no later than 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. Second shift schedules must begin no earlier than 12:30 p.m. and end no later than 12:00 a.m., Monday through Friday.
336
The flextime schedule is based upon a Wednesday through Tuesday, forty (40) hour work week over an eighty (80) hour payroll period unless otherwise specified. Within the above-prescribed parameters, the flextime program shall allow an employee to request a modification of his/her current work schedule according to the following schedule:
1.	Eight (8) consecutive hours of work for each day of the work week.
2.	Eight (8) consecutive hours of work for one (1) work week of the payroll period and nine (9) consecutive hours of work for four (4) days and four (4) consecutive hours of work for one (1) day of the remaining work week in the payroll period.
3.	Eight and one-half (8-1/2) consecutive hours of work for four (4) days of the work week and six (6) consecutive hours of work on one (1) day of the work week with two (2) consecutive hours off on that same day.
4.	Nine (9) consecutive hours of work for four (4) days of the work week and four (4) consecutive hours of work combined with four (4) consecutive hours off on one (1) work day during each work week.
5.	Ten (10) consecutive hours of work four (4) days of five (5) each work week.
6.	Nine (9) consecutive hours of work for eight (8) days of the work week, eight (8) hours of work for one (1) day of the work week, eight (8) consecutive hours off on one (1) work day during each payroll period, provided that the eight (8) hour work day and the eight (8) hour day off occur on the same day of the week. (For example, if the eight (8) hour work day is Friday, the eight (8) hour day off must be on the other Friday in the payroll period. The work week for employees on this schedule begins four (4) hours into the shift on the eight (8) hour work day and ends exactly one calendar week later.)
Consecutive hours of work shall exclude the normal unpaid lunch period during the workweek.
An employee shall make his/her request in writing to his/her immediate supervisor no later than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the desired implementation date. Upon supervisor approval, the schedule shall be effective at the beginning of the next payroll period after approval.
Section 2.	Review of Requests. Each Unit Manager may establish a beginning and ending time between the Bandwidth hours during which all scheduled work shifts must occur. Management retains the responsibility for denying or terminating individual flextime schedules where they adversely affect the operation of the unit. Flextime must not interfere with unit operations during regular business hours. Further, management may exclude any employee or group of employees if flextime would cause the Department of Labor and Industry to incur additional costs, be disruptive to the operation of the unit or result in reduced service to the public.
The immediate supervisor shall determine to approve or deny the flextime request of an employee based on the job-related considerations, including, but not limited to, the operations of the unit and the provisions of service to the public. If there are conflicting requests from employees and the needs of the supervisor require that not all requests may be approved, the supervisor shall approve (if all other considerations indicate approval) the request submitted by the employee with the most State Seniority among all unit employees not on a team or specific function, or by State Seniority among all unit employees. Management shall define “team” and “function” for the purposes of this Agreement. Should conflicts still exist, they shall be resolved by lot.
337
The immediate supervisor shall note his/her approval on the request memo and give a copy to the employee. If an employee’s request is altered or denied, a written notice of the decision shall be provided to the employee within seven (7) calendar days of request receipt and shall be available to the Union. No request shall be unreasonably denied.
Section 3.	Altered Schedules. If requested by the employee, the employee may change days, shifts or hours of work with the approval of his/her supervisor provided such change is temporary for a duration of not more than fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days at a time and it does not result in payment of overtime or cause a change in the seven (7) day period. Any such alteration must be scheduled so as not to require any full-time employee to work less than eighty (80) hours in a pay period, including paid leave time.
Section 4.	Holidays and Paid Leave Time. When a holiday falls on a day the employee normally works, the employee shall be paid holiday pay for the number of hours he/she would have worked that day if there had been no holiday.
When a holiday falls on a flex day off, the employee shall take another work day off per Master language.
Should an employee be on paid or unpaid leave from work on a day they are scheduled to work, the time changed to the paid leave or taken as unpaid leave shall be for the total hours (or fraction thereof) they would have otherwise been in attendance at work that day.
Section 5.	Hours of Work. The execution of this Agreement amends Section 2, Subdivision B.1. (Work Day) and Subdivision B.2. (Work Week/Period) of Article 5 of the Master Agreement so as to recognize the legitimacy of work days other than eight (8) or ten (10) consecutive hours.
It is agreed that no additional paid rest period shall be provided to an employee working on a flextime schedule.
Section 6.	Appeals. An employee may appeal in writing the decision of the immediate supervisor to deny or revoke a flextime schedule to the Unit Manager who shall respond in writing within seven (7) days. If not resolved at that level, the decision may be appealed in writing to the Assistant or Deputy Commissioner, as appropriate, who shall respond in writing. The decision of the Assistant or Deputy Commissioner is final and shall not be subject to Article 17 of the Master Agreement unless the action giving rise to the appeal is a violation of a specific provision of that Agreement.
Duration. Should problems occur with this Agreement after its effective implementation date, the parties agree to meet and confer in an effort to resolve the issues. If they meet and confer and cannot resolve the issues, the Department of Labor and Industry reserves the right to terminate the flextime program with fourteen (14) calendar days written notice to the Union.
Article 2

4.	Postings will be received like all other e-mail messages. The subject will be clearly labeled and will look the same each time.
5.	Employees may bid on posted vacancies electronically by replying to the message. The employee needs to reference the requisition number or position number. Employees may also submit paper (hard copy) bids. All bids (electronic or paper) must be received by the close of business (4:30 p.m.) by the last day of the posting period.

DLI will extend the posting period beyond seven (7) calendar day minimum period if documented technological problems delay the electronic delivery and/or access of postings for more than one (1) full business day. In such case, DLI will extend the posting period by one (1) business day for each day the electronic delivery is delayed beyond one (1) full business day.
9.	Employees are to report technological problems that prevent the receipt and/or access of electronic postings. Such problems are to be reported to DLI Technology Services. More specifically, an e-mail message can be sent to “help” and/or call 651-284-5555. Such malfunctions are to be immediately reported.
10.	If documented technological problems cause excessive delays in receipt and/or access of electronic postings, DLI will post vacancies on paper (hard copy) on employee bulletin boards where employees in the seniority unit in the class in which the vacancy exists are stationed. In such cases:
a)	DLI will notify the Local President.
b)	The posting period for affected posting(s) will be adjusted to begin the date of the paper (hard copy) posting and will run for a duration of a minimum of seven (7) calendar days from the date of the paper (hard copy) posting.
(c	) DLI will notify the Local President and all employees when the technological problems are fixed and electronic postings can be resumed.
11.	The Union may bring concerns or issues with electronic posting at anytime to DLI.
Article 3 Probation
Article 12, Section 10C of the Master Agreement is modified as follows:
If Management or the Local Union believes that extending an employee’s probationary period could result in a successful completion, Management and the Local Union may agree to a limited extension of up to three (3) months (or the equivalent number of hours if the employee is intermittent or less than half-time), provided that the employee was given a written mid-probationary review and provided that a written notice of the extension is given to the employee and the Union prior to the end of the fifth (5th) month of the probationary period.
Upon completion of the probationary period, the letter extending the probation will be removed from the employee’s personnel/supervisory file.

MINNESOTA STATE LOTTERY
Article 1 Flex-Time
The purpose of this article is to establish a voluntary flex-time program for employees of the work units within the Minnesota State Lottery.
Section 1.	Flex-Time Schedule Request - EDP Operations Technician Series. This section is specifically designed for the EDP Operations Technician series and is unavailable for any other Lottery employees outside of that series. All other sections in this article, except Section 2 are applicable.
The flex-time schedule is based on a Wednesday through Tuesday forty (40) hour work week over a two (2) week eighty (80) hour payroll period.
Within the above prescribed parameters, the flex-time program shall allow an employee to request modification of his/her current work schedule according to the following schedule:
Eight (8) consecutive hours of work for each day of the Wednesday through Tuesday work week.
Twelve (12) consecutive hours of work for three (3) work days, and four (4) consecutive hours of work for one (1) day per week.

Section 2.	Flex-Time Schedule Request: Other Work Units. This section is for all other work units in the Minnesota State Lottery except those defined in Article 2. All other sections in this article are applicable.

Eight (8) consecutive hours of work for each day of the Wednesday through Tuesday work week.
Ten (10) consecutive hours of work four (4) days out of five (5) each Wednesday through Tuesday work week.

If necessary, the work week shall be adjusted in order to be in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Section 3.	Review of Requests. Management retains the responsibility for denying or terminating individual flex-time schedules where they adversely affect the operation of the unit. Flex-time must not interfere with unit operations during the normal office hours of Monday through Friday. Further, management may exclude any employee or group of employees if flex-time would cause the Minnesota State Lottery to incur additional costs, be disruptive to the operation of the unit or result in reduced service to the public.
The immediate supervisor shall determine to approve or deny the flex-time request of an employee based upon job-related consideration including, but not limited to, the operation of the unit and the provision of service to the public. If there are conflicting requests from employees, and the needs of the supervisor require that not all requests may be approved, the supervisor shall approve (if all other considerations indicate approval) the request submitted by the employee with most state seniority within a team function, or by state seniority among all unit employees not on a team or in a specific function, or by state seniority among all unit employees. Management shall define "team" and "function" for the purposes of this article. Should conflicts still exist, they shall be resolved by lot.
The immediate supervisor shall provide the employee with written notice and explanation of the decision within seven (7) calendar days of request receipt. If an employee's request is denied, a copy of the written notice and explanation of the decision shall be available to the Union. No request may be unreasonably denied.
Section 4.	Altered Schedules. Upon mutual agreement of the immediate supervisor and the employee, an employee's schedule may be temporarily altered for a duration of not more than fourteen (14) consecutive days at a time without regard to the above provisions provided that it does not result in payment of overtime. Any such alteration must also be scheduled so as not to require any full-time employee to work less than eighty (80) hours in a pay period, including paid leave time.
Section 5.	Holidays and Paid Leave Hours. When the holiday falls on a day the employee normally works eight (8), nine (9), ten (10) or twelve (12) hours, the employee shall be paid holiday pay for the number of hours s/he would have worked that day had there been no holiday.
When the holiday falls on a day the employee normally works less than eight (8) hours, the schedule shall be changed with the closest holiday that still falls within the same Wednesday through Tuesday work week.
This article serves as the fourteen (14) days notice of these schedule changes during holidays as required under Article 5 of the Master Agreement.
341
Should an employee be on paid or unpaid leave from work on a day they are scheduled to work, the time charged to the paid leave or taken as unpaid leave shall be for the total hours (or fraction thereof), they would have otherwise been in attendance at work that day.
Section 6.	Hours of Work. The execution of this Supplemental Agreement hereby amends Section 2, Subdivision B (Work Day), and Subdivision C (Work Week, Work Period), of Article 5 of the Master Agreement so as to recognize the legitimacy of a twelve (12) hour work day and four (4) hour work day.
It is further agreed that no additional paid rest period shall be provided to an employee working on a flex-time schedule.

If not resolved at that level, the decision may be appealed in writing to the Assistant Director or Director as appropriate who shall respond in writing. The decision of the Assistant Director or Director is final and shall not be subject to Article 17 of the Master Agreement unless the action giving rise to the appeal is a violation of a specific provision of that Agreement.

Minnesota State Colleges and Universities - AFSCME Council 5 Joint Task Force Professional Development Recommendations and Suggestions
1.	In order to ensure AFSCME participation and input, it is recommended that each campus have a planning process or committee for professional/staff development activities that includes representation from all bargaining units, particularly AFSCME.
2.	If a campus has a planning process/committee for professional/staff development activities, it is suggested that this group provide an annual report to the President of its activities.
3.	If a campus has a planning committee for professional development activities, it is recommended that the campus administration inform the committee of the amount of money budgeted for professional development, if any.
4.	It is recommended that each institution provide at least one campus-wide professional/staff development activity or event per academic year.
Some examples of campus-wide professional development activities include:
campus-wide staff meeting including sessions on FERPA, safety training, "who are our students?";
diversity sessions with local theater groups and guest speakers; and other topics, such as CPR for adults, nutrition, and personal finance.
5.	Consider using evaluation forms/surveys developed in conjunction with AFSCME employees to ensure activities are meeting employees' needs and interests.
6.	Utilize on-campus personnel and all other system personnel for events/training sessions.
7.	It is suggested that an intra-campus "clearinghouse" system be developed in order to share
events/training sessions with other campuses.
8.	It is recommended that regional training sessions or events be developed (e.g., Metro area, Northwest, Southeast).
9.	Engage various media, e.g., ITV, computer software programs, to broadcast/distribute training/staff development options across the system

361
Each of the considered employees shall be scored individually by each supervisor and the scores of each of the three supervisors shall be totaled. The employee(s) with the highest total score shall be selected for the training. When additional certified operators are needed, over and above the number indicated by the posting, the entire process shall be repeated. The Local Union shall be provided fourteen (14) days written notice of the interview date. By mutual agreement of the Field Services Supervisor and the Local Union, the fourteen (14) day written notice of the interview date may be reduced or waived. During the selection process, a Union Representative shall be afforded the opportunity to be present for the purpose of observing the impartiality and fairness of the scoring process.

After certification, for good and sufficient reasons, the immediate supervisor and the Regional Field Services Supervisor may re-review the capabilities of the employee to operate and maintain the equipment for continued certification.
After certification, the immediate supervisor and Regional Field Services Supervisor reserves the right to decertify Intermittent Heavy Equipment Operators whose performance deteriorates and who fail to meet the standards established by the supervisor for operating heavy equipment or who fail to maintain the equipment properly, or who abuse the equipment. Decertification shall be grievable under Article 17 of the Master Agreement.
C.	Assignment to Heavy Equipment Operator (Intermittent). Intermittent Heavy Equipment Operating assignments shall be made on the basis of State Seniority from among certified employees who are available and capable of performing the work in the same discipline and assigned to the same principal place of employment.

NR Forest Fire Response Lead & NR Forest Support Dispatcher Positions
The appointment condition of employees hired as NR Forest Fire Response Lead and NR Forest Support Dispatcher classifications shall be “seasonal.” However, the Appointing Authority may utilize emergency or temporary employees during the process of filling a vacant position.

Recall from seasonal layoff shall be made according to Article 15 Layoff and Recall, Section 4E Recall from Seasonal Layoff, wherever feasible. However, the written advance recall notice and response requirements may be waived without penalty by mutual agreement between the employee and Appointing Authority with notice to the Local Union of the waiver; where more than one employee is to be recalled, it shall be in seniority order. Employees returned from seasonal layoff under this provision will be returned to their seasonal employment condition and be eligible for all appropriate benefits.
363
The Appointing Authority shall be able to change the starting and ending times of employees in these classifications up to two (2) hours without penalty pay for the schedule change. In addition, the supervisor and the employee may mutually agree to an additional two (2) hours (up to a total of four (4) hours) without penalty pay for the schedule change.
Employees shall be subject to overtime for all hours worked after forty (40) hours in the established work week.
Paid time off shall be calculated as time worked for purposes of this Article.
After the end of the spring fire season and before commencing the fall fire season, employees in these classifications will be called first for any extra shift(s) related to fire suppression available during this period of time. In the event that the employee in that work area is unavailable and/or cannot be reached, the Appointing Authority can fill the additional shift(s) by any available means.
Article 15

[Note: Classification Seniority dates need not be listed for classes in Units 4 and 6.]
In addition, the DNR shall list the class options (if any) for which an employee is qualified. If an employee disagrees with the class options listed, the employee shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the posting of the seniority roster to notify the Department of Employee Relations (DOER). DOER shall determine whether the employee is qualified for the class option, and, if not, s/he shall be offered the opportunity to qualify through the examination procedure.
The rosters shall also identify the type of appointment if other than full-time unlimited.
When two (2) or more employees have the same Classification Seniority dates, seniority position shall be determined by State Seniority. Should a tie still exist, seniority shall be determined by length of prior State service. Should a tie still exist, seniority shall be determined by lot.
The rosters shall also include a listing of all employees in Student Worker classifications.

Assistant Commissioner, Administration
SUBJECT:	Alternative Work Schedules - AFSCME Employees
The Collective Bargaining Agreement between the State of Minnesota and AFSCME, Council 6 (Article 5 - Hours of Work) states that supervisory initiated work schedules, or schedule changes, must be posted for fourteen (14) days before their effective date. In addition, Article 5, Section 1C of the Agreement also states: “If requested by the employee, the employee may change days, shifts or hours of work with the approval of his/her supervisor provided such change does not result in payment of overtime.”
The following language applies to employee initiated work schedule changes. These changes would be considered and approved/denied by a work unit, provided they met the above standard AND the following:
1. Work Week/Period: The normal work week/period for full-time employees shall consist of forty (40) scheduled hours of work in a seven (7) day period. The normal work week for employees is Wednesday through Tuesday. Any proposed changes in work schedules requiring a change in work week shall be approved by the Human Resources Bureau and with notification to the Local Union.
Situational or short-term requests for changing work schedules could change starting and ending times of the consecutive hours and would be different than the normal posted work schedule. Certain circumstances may provide for employee-requested work schedule changes to become the normal or posted work schedule for the requesting employee. Supervisors shall determine whether to approve/deny employees such requests, based upon job-related considerations (i.e., customer service needs, staffing requirements, etc.).
The above process allows for changes in employee work schedules, promotes a flexible work environment, and balances organizational needs, customer service demands, and employee’s need for flexibility in managing their personal life. It promotes employee well-being and is a critical part of the Department of Natural Resources’ Strategic Directions for Human Resources.
If supervisors/managers receive an oral request from an employee for a change in work schedule, they will advise the employee to place such a request in writing, addressed to them. After receipt of such a written request, the supervisor/manager will consider it in terms of the above job-related requirements and provide a written response to the individual employee, with a copy to the Human Resources Bureau in St. Paul. If the request is denied, the written reply to the employee from the supervisor/manager shall provide the reasons for such denial.

Subject: Safety Glasses
Dear Bob:
During the 1999-2001 negotiations, the issue of DNR employees access to a vendor for required safety glasses was discussed. To clarify and resolve this matter, the following is a section contained in the DNR policy on eye and face protection:
Eye and Face Protection
1.	General Requirements
a.	Employees shall use appropriate eye or face protection, as required by the OSHA standard, when exposed to hazards from flying particles, molten metal, liquid chemicals, acids or caustic liquids, chemical gases or vapors, or potentially light radiation.
b.	Employees shall use eye protection that provides side protection when there is a hazard from flying objects. Detachable side protectors (e.g., clip-on or slide-on shields) are acceptable.
c.	Employees who wear prescription lenses, while engaged in operations that involve eye hazards, shall wear eye protection that incorporates the prescription in its design, or shall wear eye protection that can be worn over the prescription lenses without disturbing the proper position of the prescription lenses or the protective lenses.
d.	Employees shall use equipment with filter lenses during welding or cutting operations that have a shade number appropriate for the work being performed for protection from injurious light radiation. The appropriate shade numbers for various welding and cutting operations are listed in the OSHA standard, welding books and from welding supply companies.
366
Bob Buckingham April 12, 1999 Page 2
2.	Equipment
a.	All eye and face protective equipment shall be supplied or paid for by the DNR for its employees. The Safety Administrator determines the type of eye protection to be provided.
b.	If prescription glasses are provided, prescription safety glasses will be obtained from the current State of Minnesota contract provider. Employees shall be required to furnish a copy of their current prescription from their own doctor. The DNR will only pay for clear protective lenses, standard frames including side shields, carrying case and dispensing fees. Other additional items, such as photo gray lenses, spring loaded hinge, an upgrade in frames and lens coatings, are the responsibility of the employee unless approved by the employee’s supervisor. The employee will coordinate the purchase and the fitting of new glasses with their supervisor.
Therefore, the supervisor will coordinate the purchase and fitting of prescription glasses. This may include an on-site visit from the safety glass vendor or if necessary the employee may be sent offsite to the vendor’s location, which may be in conjunction with other work assignments.
Sincerely,
Terrance L. Lahti /s/ DNR Safety Administrator

With fourteen (14) calendar days notice employees shall be permitted to adjust their hours of work, up to two (2) hours, in order to attend the regular monthly meetings of AFSCME Local 3141, provided such adjustments shall not unduly disrupt the operations of the department. Such adjustments shall not result in the payment of overtime.
Section 8
Overtime Distribution
Article 6, Section 4, Overtime Distribution, for all employees except the Telephone Taxpayer Assistance Unit, is replaced in its entirety as follows:
Overtime shall be offered to all employees in the work area, section or principal place of employment who are in active work status who are qualified, as determined by the Appointing Authority, to perform the required work. If there are more qualified volunteers than required, the overtime work shall be assigned to the most senior qualified employees based on State Seniority. If there are insufficient volunteers to perform the required overtime work, the employees in the work area, section or principal place of employment with the least State Seniority qualified to perform the work may be assigned to the overtime work. If necessary due to an insufficient number of employees from the work area, section or principal place of employment, the Appointing Authority may request volunteers from one (1) or more other work areas, sections or principal places of employment, determined by the Appointing Authority, to perform the overtime work. In no case shall a qualified volunteer from within the work area, section or principal place of employment, be denied overtime work in order to allow a qualified volunteer from a different work area, section or principal place of employment, to perform the overtime work. Whenever possible, all such qualified employees within the designated work area, section or principal place of employment shall be offered the overtime work prior to mandatory assignment of overtime. If there is insufficient time to request volunteers, the Appointing Authority may assign employees then on duty to the overtime work according to inverse State Seniority among those qualified to perform the overtime work.
Article 6, Section 4 of the Master Agreement, shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows for the employees in the Telephone Taxpayer Assistance Unit:
When two or more employees have worked the same amount of overtime hours, overtime assignments shall be offered first to the most senior employee, based upon State Seniority.
383
Overtime hours actually worked shall be considered in calculating the equitable distribution of overtime.
In the event all employees decline overtime work, the Appointing Authority shall have the right to assign overtime based upon inverse order of State Seniority among capable employees.
Section 9
Waiver of Position Qualifications and New Probationary Period
The following provisions apply to layoff of full-time or part-time permanent employees.
A.	In the event of layoff, if a vacancy (or bumping option) exists in the same classification as the employee facing layoff, or an equal or lower class in which the employee previously served, and the employee has previously served and successfully completed the probationary period in a position in the class with the same or substantially the same job responsibilities, the employee shall be determined to be qualified for the vacancy (or bumping option) and shall be placed in the vacancy (or bumping option). The employee facing layoff will not be required to take and pass position qualifying tests except that the employee must pass all physical requirements of the job. The employee will not be required to serve a new probationary period.
B.	In the event of layoff, if a vacancy (or bumping option) exists in the same classification as the employee facing layoff, or an equal or lower class in which the employee previously served, and the employee has successfully completed the probationary period in a position in the class but has not performed the same or substantially the same job responsibilities in a current or previously held position, the employee will be placed in the vacancy (or bumping option) and will be required to serve a six (6) month probationary period provided the following conditions are met:
1.	The employee meets all physical requirements of the position.
2.	The employee takes any required written or performance test (typing, data entry, math, or grammar/punctuation) and achieves a score of at least 75% of the normal passing score.
3.	The employee must accept any training offered by the Employer during the six (6) month probationary period.
If the employee fully meets the position qualifications (100% of the normal passing score), no probationary period will be required.
If the employee does not meet the physical requirements of the position and/or does not achieve a score of at least 75% of the normal passing score on the performance test (typing, data entry), the employee will be considered not qualified for the vacancy (or bumping option), and other layoff options will apply.
An employee who is on probation under the provisions of Section 9B above, shall be eligible to bid. In order for the bid to be given further consideration, the employee must fully meet all the position qualifications for the vacancy. If the employee is offered and accepts the vacancy, the probationary period, as described above, will end at the time of appointment.
C.	Persons facing layoff, who have the option to transfer or demote to an equal or lower class in which they have not previously served, will be required to take and pass all required advisory tests as well as position qualifications (including written and performance tests), at 100% of the normal passing score, and will be required to serve a new probationary period of six (6) months. An employee who is on probation under this provision shall not be eligible to bid while on probation.
If the employee who is required to serve a new probationary period as described in Section 9B above does not successfully complete the probationary period, layoff options shall be limited to the following:
384
1.	the employee shall accept a vacancy for which it is determined that they fully meet all the position qualifications, or
2.	the employee may claim a vacancy in another state agency for a period of forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of non-certification, or
3.	the employee shall be laid off.
MINNESOTA STATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM
Article 1
Purpose
The purpose of this Supplemental Agreement is to establish a voluntary flex-time program for employees of the work units within MSRS.
Article 2
Flex-Time Schedule Request
The flex-time schedule is based on forty (40) hour work week over a two (2) week eighty (80) hour payroll period.
Within the above prescribed parameters, the flex-time program shall allow an employee to request modification of his/her current work schedule according to any one of the following schedules:
A.	Eight (8) consecutive hours of work for each of five days in a work week.
B.	Eight and one-half (8 1/2) consecutive hours of work for four (4) work days and six (6) consecutive hours of work on any day each work week, with two (2) consecutive hours off on the same day as the six (6) consecutive hours of work day during each forty (40) hour work week consistent with the pay period of Wednesday through Tuesday.
C.	Nine (9) consecutive hours of work for eight (8) days, one (1) day of eight (8) consecutive hours of work, plus one (1) day off during eighty (80) hour payroll period.
Consecutive hours of work shall exclude the normal unpaid lunch period during the workweek.
For employees choosing schedule "C", the "work week" is defined to begin four (4) hours into the shift on the eight (8) hour work day and end exactly one calendar week later. Employees choosing this schedule must take the same day of the week off that they work the eight hours the previous week. For employees choosing schedule "A" or "B", the work week runs from Wednesday through Tuesday.
An employee may request to change his/her flex-time schedule by providing a fourteen (14) calendar day written notice to the immediate supervisor. Approved changes in schedule will take place on the first day of the pay period following the fourteen (14) day notice period as long as the change is approved by the supervisor. A supervisor may waive the fourteen (14) day notice at the request of the employee, provided that the employee waives the right to any overtime compensation not required by federal law.
385
Article 3
Review of Requests
Management retains the responsibility for denying or terminating individual flex-time schedules where they adversely affect the operation of the unit. Flex-time must not interfere with the unit operations during the normal office hours of Monday through Friday. Further, management may exclude any employee or group of employees if flex-time would cause MSRS to incur additional costs, be disruptive to the operation of the unit or result in reduced service to the public.
The immediate supervisor shall determine to approve or deny the flex-time request of an employee based upon job-related consideration including, but not limited to, the operation of the unit and the provision of service to the public. If there are conflicting requests from employees, and the needs of the supervisor require that not all requests may be approved, the supervisor shall approve (if all other considerations indicate approval) the request submitted by the employee with the most state seniority within a team function, or by state seniority among all unit employees not on a team or in a specific functions, or by state seniority among all unit employees. Management shall define "team" and "function" for the purposes of this Supplemental Agreement. Should conflicts still exist, they shall be resolved by lot.
The immediate supervisor shall provide the employee with written notice and explanation of the decision within seven (7) calendar days of request receipt. If an employee's request is denied, a copy of the written notice and explanation of the decision shall be available to the Union. No request may be unreasonably denied.
Article 4
Altered Schedules
Upon mutual agreement of the immediate supervisor and the employee, an employee's schedule may be temporarily altered for a duration of not more than fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days at a time without regard to the above provisions provided that it does not result in payment of overtime. Any such alteration must also be scheduled so as not to require any full-time employee to work less than eighty (80) hours in a pay period or forty (40) hours in a "work week", including paid leave time.
Article 5
Holidays and Paid Leave Hours
When the holiday falls on a day the employee normally works eight (8), eight and one-half (8 1/2) hours or nine (9) hours, the employee shall be paid holiday pay for eight (8) hours.
Employees normally working eight and one-half (8 1/2) hour days will work the additional one-half (1/2) hour during the same work week as mutually agreed upon by his/her immediate supervisor. Employees working nine (9) hour days will work an additional hour on the normally scheduled eight (8) hour day [which is divided into two (2) four (4) hour periods for "work week" determination] with the additional hour added to the four (4) hours associated with the "work week" in which the holiday falls.
When the holiday falls on a day the employee normally works less than eight (8) hours, the schedule shall be exchanged with the closest eight (8), eight and one-half (8 1/2) hour day to the holiday that still falls within the same Wednesday through Tuesday work week. If the holiday falls on an employee's scheduled weekday off, the holiday shall be observed on the same day a week earlier or later, whichever fits into the normal pay period.
This Supplemental Agreement serves as the fourteen (14) days notice of these schedule changes during holidays as required under Article 5 of the Master Agreement.
386
Should an employee be on paid or unpaid leave from work on a day they are scheduled to work, the time charged to the paid leave or taken as unpaid leave shall be for the total hours (or fraction thereof), they would have otherwise been in attendance at work that day.
Article 6
Hours of Work
The execution of this Supplemental Agreement hereby amends Section 2, Subdivision B (Work Day), and Subdivision C (Work Week, Work Period), of Article 5 of the Master Agreement so as to recognize the legitimacy of an eight and one-half (8 1/2) or nine (9) hour work day.
It is further agreed that no additional paid rest period shall be provided to an employee working on a flex-time schedule.
Article 7
Appeals
An employee may appeal in writing the decision of the immediate supervisor to deny or revoke a flex-time schedule to the Unit Manager who shall respond in writing. If not resolved at that level, the decision may be appealed in writing to the appropriate Assistant Director who shall respond in writing. The decision of the Assistant Director is final and shall not be subject to Article 17 of the Master Agreement unless the action giving rise to the appeal is a violation of a specific provision of that Agreement.
Article 8
Duration
This Supplemental Agreement shall be in effect for an indefinite period beginning the effective date of the Agreement. Should problems occur with this Agreement after its effective implementation date, the parties agree to meet and confer in an effort to resolve the issues. If they meet and confer and cannot resolve the issues, MSRS reserves the right to terminate the program with fourteen (14) calendar days written notice to the Union.
Article 9
Modification
Any modification to this Supplemental Agreement must be agreed to in writing by the parties.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
Article 1 Meet and Confer
Section 1.	Department-wide Joint Labor Management Committee. The Appointing Authority and the Union shall meet and confer annually to discuss issues of mutual concern including new directions and/or changes being planned by the Appointing Authority. The Committee may meet as frequently as quarterly upon mutual agreement and as agenda items warrant. The Committee shall be comprised of seven (7) members each from the Appointing Authority and the Union.

The Committee will be responsible for reviewing all grievances (excluding Article 16 - Discipline grievances and Article 12 Section 10F Non-certification) involving employees in the Transportation Specialist Series job classifications that are not resolved by the second step of the grievance process. The Committee will attempt to reach consensus on a resolution to the grievances and respond back to the location generating the grievance within ten (10) days or as agreed upon by the Committee. When consensus by the Committee is reached, the grievance will be considered resolved. The Committee will provide information on the resolution of grievances to all Mn/DOT locations to provide guidance and consistency in handling similar issues. Grievances not resolved at the Committee level will be considered denied at the third step of the grievance process and will be subject to the terms of Article 17 of the Master Agreement.
The Committee will also be responsible for considering and responding to issues surrounding the Transportation Specialist Series that are not subject to the grievance procedure, and are unresolved or unanswered at the local level. The Committee may respond to these issues and/or refer them to the Joint Labor Management Committee. Job classification issues shall not be subject to the grievance procedure or the review committee.
Article 2
Seniority
Class seniority for each of the Transportation Specialist Series classes will include all time served in any Transportation Specialist Series class including: Highway Maintenance Worker, Highway Maintenance Worker Senior, Bridge Worker, Highway Technician, Highway Technician Intermediate, Highway Technician Senior, and Highway Helper (provided that any employee currently in this classification has also previously served in one of the above listed classes). Also included are any employees who have served in previous related classes, including but not limited to: Freeway Maintenance Man, Engineering Aide, Traffic Recorder, Transportation Sign Fabricator, Permanent HEO Operator, Highway Field Assistant and Transportation Aide.
Article 3
Position-Qualified
The provisions of Article 12 and Article 15 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
An employee must meet the required qualifications for the specific position/vacancy to be considered for the position/vacancy in the Transportation Specialist Series or to exercise layoff options or recall rights to any position in the Transportation Specialist Series.
Qualifications will be based on the work elements identified by the Department. If during the term of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Department chooses to add any new work elements to the Transportation Specialist Series, they will be discussed by the Department-wide Joint Labor Management Committee prior to implementation.
Article 4 Hours of Work
Article 5 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
1.	Work Schedules. In the Department of Transportation, the Appointing Authority may change the daily starting and quitting time of Unit 2 and Unit 7 employees for the entire week up to two (2) hours either way providing a notice is posted a minimum of three (3) working days in advance of the proposed change. Notification prior to the start of any shift shall constitute the
388
first day's notice. Employees may be returned to their previously established schedule upon reasonable notice by the Appointing Authority.
2.	Changed Work Schedules. Employees whose schedules are changed without a five (5) day notice and who are not required to work their original (posted) schedule or assigned available work, may use accrued vacation or compensatory time to fill in the remainder of their original (posted) schedule. This provision does not apply to winter maintenance schedules or contractors’ operations.
3.	Emergency Work Schedule. Employees whose hours of work are controlled by the contractor may have their schedule changed due to the contractor's operations. In the event a change in schedule is necessary, as much advance notice as possible must be given the employee through the Appointing Authority's project supervisor. Such change shall not be considered a split shift.
Any schedule changes made pursuant to the above shall not result in the payment of overtime.
The supervisor shall give due consideration to any employee who requests not to work beyond sixteen (16) hours in a day. Normally, an employee shall not be required to work beyond fourteen (14) consecutive days. In this situation, the employee may request time off with three (3) days notice to the supervisor.
4.	Winter Maintenance Schedules. The Appointing Authority may establish a winter maintenance schedule to be used in severe or extreme road conditions for snow and ice control operations. The schedule shall be posted at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the effective date each fall. The posted schedule shall also cite the date each spring when winter maintenance schedules shall no longer be in effect.
Under the winter maintenance schedule, the Appointing Authority may split the available employees into more than one (1) shift. Such shift shall be periodically rotated or established by internal bid after taking into consideration the desires of the Local Union. The posting shall name which employees are assigned to each shift.
It is specifically understood by the parties that winter maintenance schedules may be declared to be in effect only when severe or extreme road or weather conditions exist or are forecast. When severe or extreme road or weather conditions do not exist or are not forecast, and an employee is called outside of the established work schedule for operations such as spot sanding or plowing isolated patches of snow and ice, such assignment must be made on an overtime basis.
On any day on which a change from a regular work schedule to a winter maintenance schedule, or from a winter maintenance schedule to a regular work schedule takes place, no employee shall be scheduled to work less than the number of hours in the employee's established schedule before the winter maintenance schedule was activated. When such maintenance schedule is in effect, overtime rates shall be paid only for those hours worked in excess of the number of hours in the employee's established schedule before the winter maintenance schedule was activated except that when the consecutive hours of any employee's work day must be interrupted, such employee shall be compensated at the appropriate overtime rate for all hours worked outside the employee's previously scheduled work period. In no case shall an employee be paid for those intervening hours not worked.
During the period when snow and ice control operations can be required to be performed, callouts for snow and ice control shall be made by class seniority based on shift or strict seniority by class.
5.	Road Patrol. Under those circumstances where the Appointing Authority must reduce hazardous driving conditions by the use of employees outside of their established work
389
schedule for operations such as spot sanding or plowing isolated patches of snow and ice, such conditions may be met either by the establishment of a night patrol, or a dawn patrol, or by calling in an employee on an overtime basis, when such conditions exist, or may exist.
The Appointing Authority may establish a weather watch, dawn patrol, night patrol, or road patrol whose purpose is to patrol the roads and respond to or warn of hazardous driving conditions. After taking into consideration the desires of the Local Union, the shift(s) shall either be posted for bid or rotated. If posted, the shift(s) shall be posted only in the truck station(s) where such shift change(s) will be made and if there are qualified bidders, the change of shift shall be assigned on the basis of Classification Seniority on a non-rotating basis. If there are no qualified bidders, the Appointing Authority may assign the least senior qualified employee(s) on a non-rotating basis, or may assign the employee(s) of the truck station on a rotating basis.
6.	Fire Season Schedules. The Appointing Authority may establish fire seasons schedules to be used in severe or extreme fire conditions. The schedule shall be posted at least fourteen (14) calendar days in advance of the effective date each spring. The posted schedule shall also cite the date each fall when fire seasons schedules shall no longer be in effect.
Under the fire seasons schedule, the Appointing Authority may split the available employees into more than one (1) shift. Such shift shall be periodically rotated or established by internal bid after taking into consideration the desire of the Local Union. The posting shall name which employees are assigned to each shift.
It is specifically understood by the parties that fire seasons schedules may be declared to be in effect only when severe or extreme fire conditions exist or are forecast. When severe or extreme fire conditions do not exist or are not forecast, and an employee is called outside of the established work schedule, such assignment must be made on an overtime basis.
On any day on which a change from a regular work schedule to a fire seasons schedule, or from a fire seasons schedule to a regular work schedule takes place, no employee shall be scheduled to work less than the number of hours in the employee's established schedule before the fire seasons schedule was activated. When such fire seasons schedule is in effect, overtime rates shall be paid only for those hours worked in excess of the number of hours in the employee's established schedule before the fire seasons schedule was activated except that when the consecutive hours of any employee's work day must be interrupted, such employee shall be compensated at the appropriate overtime rate for all hours worked outside the employee's previously scheduled work period. In no case shall an employee be paid for those intervening hours not worked.
7.	Turnaround Time. After working for sixteen (16) consecutive hours, the employee should be given a minimum of seven and one half (7 1/2) hours of rest before returning to work.
Article 5
Overtime Distribution
Article 6, Section 4 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
Overtime work shall first be offered to the most senior qualified employee(s) by job class and from the work area. The overtime work shall first be offered to employees then on duty if such overtime is for the immediately subsequent shift. Should the senior employee choose not to accept the overtime assignment, the next most senior qualified employee shall be offered the overtime assignment. The Appointing Authority shall not be required to cut in on work in progress in order to comply with the requirements of this Section. Work in progress refers to work to which an employee has been assigned during their normal work day/week and where the individual employee possesses knowledge, relationships, and/or skills that are unique and important to accomplishing the work. Assignments to projects (e.g., contract administration and program
390
delivery) are treated as work assignments and any associated overtime shall be considered work in progress. In the event all qualified employees decline overtime work, the Appointing Authority shall have the right to assign overtime based upon inverse order of Classification Seniority among qualified employees.
Employees may request not to be offered voluntary overtime by means of a written waiver submitted to the employee’s supervisor, provided, however, that the Appointing Authority retains the right to assign overtime, in inverse order of Classification Seniority among qualified employees in the event that all qualified employees decline overtime work.
Employees may rescind such waivers upon fourteen (14) calendar days written notice to the employee’s supervisor.
In emergencies, notwithstanding the terms of this Article, the Appointing Authority may assign someone to temporarily meet the emergency requirements.
Article 6
Reassignment
Article 12, Section 4C of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
Temporary reassignments shall be for six (6) months or less. Such assignments may be extended up to six (6) months upon agreement of the Local Union and the Appointing Authority.
Article 12, Section 4B of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
In Mn/DOT districts, the Appointing Authority has the right to reassign employees within a headquarters or within a resident office.
Article 7
Tools and Equipment Loss
The provisions of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented as follows:
The Appointing Authority will provide tool boxes or tool cabinets for Heavy Equipment Mechanic, Heavy Equipment Field Mechanic and Welder to store their tools. While tools are in the care, custody, and control of the Appointing Authority, the Appointing Authority shall indemnify each employee for tool losses caused by fire, wind, or theft by forcible entry at their full replacement value provided the tools are listed in the most recent previously filed inventory approved by the supervisor.
Employees in Unit 2 and Unit 7 who are required by the Appointing Authority to furnish basic hand tools and/or equipment, shall be indemnified by the Appointing Authority for tools and/or equipment losses caused by fire, wind, or theft by forcible entry while the tools and/or equipment are secured on the Appointing Authority's premises or are in a locked vehicle which use is authorized by the Appointing Authority or when they are in a field office on a construction project provided the tools are listed in a previously filed inventory approved by the supervisor.
Article 8
Maintenance Seasonal Work Crews
The provisions of Article 12, Sections 1 through 6 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
Metropolitan District Maintenance. Seasonal work crew assignments within the District region and/or within each truck station shall be posted for a minimum of seven (7) calendar days. In the
391
event that no employee applies for the vacancy(s), the Appointing Authority shall fill the opening(s) by assignment on the basis of employee qualifications and inverse seniority. Employees selected for such assignments shall be given seven (7) calendar days notice prior to such assignments.
Seasonal work crew assignments are assignments to those maintenance operations which are District-wide, region-wide or truck station-wide in scope and where it is necessary, to retain the same employee on the assignment for the duration of the operation.
The posted notice announcing the formation of a seasonal work crew will indicate the approximate duration of the assignment by citing: a) the approximate starting and ending dates; or, b) where appropriate, by stating that the duration is until the project is completed. Where such seasonal work crew assignment involves a change in work hours or a change in the work week, an additional notice returning the employees to their previous schedule will not be required as long as the original posted notice indicated the approximate duration of the project.
When the need arises to change the number or composition of crews, the District Management and the Local Union will meet and confer prior to implementing the change.
District Maintenance. Openings on seasonal work crews shall be filled after posting for a minimum of seven (7) calendar days.
Assignment to these seasonal work crew openings shall be made on the basis of Classification Seniority from those employees applying from the maintenance area, sub-area, or truck station from which such a crew is being formed. If an insufficient number of employees apply for the openings, the openings will be filled in inverse order of Classification Seniority among employees from the maintenance area, sub-area, or truck station from which such a crew is being formed. During the period while the selection process is taking place, the Appointing Authority may temporarily assign employee(s) to seasonal work crew openings to fulfill operating requirements.
Should it become necessary to supplement the basic crew, the Appointing Authority may supplement such basic crew by assignment from the area where the work is being performed.
Seasonal work crew assignments are assignments to those maintenance operations which are area-wide in scope and where it is necessary, to retain the same employee on the assignment for the duration of the operation.
The posted notice announcing the formation of a seasonal work crew will indicate the approximate duration of the assignment by citing: a) the approximate starting and ending dates; or, b) where appropriate, by stating that the duration is until the project is completed. Where such seasonal work crew assignment involves a change in work hours or a change in the work week, an additional notice returning the employees to their previous schedule will not be required as long as the original posted notice indicated the approximate duration of the project.
Regional/Department-wide Maintenance. When it is determined that for business reasons regional/department-wide seasonal work crews are to be established, department management will meet and confer with the Union prior to implementing.
Article 9
Limited Interruptions of Employment
The provisions of Article 15, Section 6 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
When the limited interruption of work or reduction in hours does not affect all employees in a class, employment condition, shift and work location, the least senior employee(s) affected shall have their work interrupted or hours reduced. When it is necessary for an employee to hold certification on heavy equipment, the most senior employee who is certified on the required equipment will be
392
retained. Limited interruption of work or reduction in hours shall not be instituted for the purpose of subcontracting work normally performed by the affected bargaining unit employees.
Article 10
Safety Inspections
Due to the unique circumstances in the Minnesota Department of Transportation where full-time safety professionals are employed, it is agreed that where a Local Union representative is not available to accompany the safety professional on the Annual Building Inspection, the safety professional will provide a copy of the inspection report to the Local Union President. Where a Local Union Representative is present for the inspection, that person will be given a copy of the report, it will include all pertinent information concerning findings and recommendations.
Article 11
Work Out of Class
The provisions of Article 18, Section 9 of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
When an employee is assigned to Work Out of Class, the employee shall be paid at a rate within the higher range which is at least one (1) step higher than the employee's current salary and which can be higher at the discretion of the Appointing Authority.
Article 12
Probationary Period
The provisions of Article 12, Section 10C of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
The initial six (6) months probationary period of a new Mn/DOT employee may be extended for a period not to exceed three (3) months, provided that the employee was given a written mid-probationary review and provided that a written notice of the extension is given to the employee and the union prior to the end of the fifth (5th) month of the probationary period.
For the Transportation Associate classification only, the probationary period shall be twelve (12) months and may be extended up to six (6) additional months. Upon successful completion of the probationary period, the employee will be reallocated to the Transportation Generalist classification.
Article 13
Training Opportunities
When the Appointing Authority determines a business need for additional employee training in order to develop new skills for an ongoing need, such training opportunities shall be offered to employees in the work area/truck station where such training opportunity is to be made available.
Employees shall be provided an opportunity to participate in such training based on classification seniority from among those employees within the work area/truck station who: desire such training, have completed any pre-requisites, possess the appropriate individual competencies identified by the department and can reasonably be expected to satisfactorily complete the training and subsequently utilize the skills gained.
Training to enhance skills within an employee’s current position responsibilities are not considered training opportunities and will be assigned as needed.
Article 14
393
Attendance at Union Meetings
The provisions of the Master Agreement shall be supplemented and/or modified as follows:
Employees may be permitted to adjust their hours of work to permit their attendance at regular monthly meetings of the local union. Such adjustments shall be of reasonable duration, not to exceed two (2) hours.
Employees who desire to make these adjustments must require prior approval from their immediate supervisor twenty one (21) calendar days in advance of the meeting date. Requests shall include an indication of the length of release time requested. Approval of these requests will not be unreasonably withheld. Requests may be denied if approval would result in the payment of overtime. The Employer reserves the right to rescind this approval in the event of emergency or other unusual conditions, or to maintain adequate staffing during the time of the meeting. Employees shall receive no compensation for time spent at union meetings, but may utilize vacation leave or work extra hours, within the same work week, if work is available, to prevent a loss of earnings.
In the event work is available and an employee elects to work extra hours to offset time spent at union meetings, the Employer shall have no liability for overtime hours of pay until the employee has worked an amount of time outside his/her regular shift which is equal to the amount of time spent at a union meeting.
Article 15
Lump Sum Payments
The provisions of the Master Agreement Appendix F shall be replaced by the following:
Each year, employees who had previously received HEO or Intermittent Supervisor differential pay will be paid in a lump sum amount the full first payroll period following October 1. This lump sum amount shall be calculated according to the highest HEO and/or Intermittent Supervisor earnings of each individual employee, based on the actual HEO and/or Intermittent Supervisor earnings from any one of the Fiscal Years 1999, 2000 and 2001.
Payment of such lump sum amounts will cease if an employee is promoted to a position with a pay range higher than Transportation Generalist or leaves the Transportation Specialist Series.
Employees in the Transportation Generalist classification who are promoted to a higher classification in the Transportation Specialist Series shall have their annual lump sum (if any) divided into an hourly rate and added to the employee’s current hourly salary. If the calculated hourly rate does not fall on step, the employee shall receive the amount necessary to round the hourly rate calculation to the next higher step plus a minimum of one step on promotion.

Subject: Winter Maintenance Schedules
Dear Bob:
At our recently concluded supplemental agreement negotiations we spent a considerable amount of time discussing concerns over Mn/DOT's use of Winter Maintenance Schedules. We agreed that most of the issues could be best addressed at the local levels.
Further, we agreed that the local union and local Mn/DOT management would discuss Winter Maintenance Schedule issues each year at the division, district or maintenance area level. Issues not resolved through this local meet and confer process could be further addressed by a meeting of the AFSCME, Council 6, Liaison, the Mn/DOT Labor Relations Manager and the Area Maintenance Engineer. The Area Maintenance Engineer's decision will be final.
Sincerely,
Jim McKane /s/

Dear Mr. Hilliker:
This letter confirms Mn/DOT’s commitment to assign work and training in a manner to be effective and efficient in delivery of our products and services.
Given this goal, we will not support assigning work and training based on favoritism. This effort is supported through the modifications made this year in the Transportation Supplement to the Agreement.
Concerns regarding this issue should be brought to the Local Labor Management Meet and Confer for discussion and resolution.
Sincerely,
James Swanson

If additional work is needed within the required posting period, the Administrator may offer this work to part-time employees. If a part-time employee accepts the work, the part-time employee shall not be eligible for “penalty pay.”
A part-time employee would not be eligible to be offered such work if the additional hours would result in the payment of overtime pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act.
If no eligible part-time employee accepts the work, the Administrator is not required to assign the work to a part-time employee.
If a part-time employee is assigned to work as overtime, the part-time employee shall be eligible for overtime pay pursuant to Article 6.

If no employee in the same class or classes as determined by the Administrator in the work area who are capable of performing the work accepts the overtime assignment, the overtime shall next be offered campus-wide to all employees then on duty in the same class or classes as determined by the Administrator who are capable of performing the work available, by State seniority.
If no employee then on duty in the same class or classes accepts the overtime assignment, the overtime assignment shall next be offered to employees in the same class or classes as determined by the Administrator who are capable of performing the work who are then off duty by State seniority, and when feasible, who have indicated a desire in writing to work overtime.

The most senior qualified volunteer shall be given the overtime assignment.
In the event all capable employees in the same class or classes as determined by the Administrator decline the overtime work, the Administrator shall assign the overtime based upon inverse order of State seniority, within or among class(es) as determined by the Administrator, to employees capable of performing the work and assigned to the work area who are then on duty. The assignment shall be rotated within each pay period beginning with the least senior capable employee based on State seniority.
Those employees working as a "float" shall be considered to be in the work area to which they are assigned to work at the time overtime is offered or assigned.
3.	Distribution of overtime work for other than the immediately subsequent shift shall be as follows:
