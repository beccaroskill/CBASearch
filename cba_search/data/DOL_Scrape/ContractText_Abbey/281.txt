employees in that seniority division and such bids will remain listed for a period not less than 24 consecutive work hours.
29.1	Available job shall mean: a quit, discharge, leave-of-absence, voluntary transfer, military service, death of employee, retiree or an increase in the total manpower of the seniority division and/or an increase in the total manpower of any classification. If an employee on leave of absence or military service never returns to the job the Company has no obligation to re-bid the job he/she vacated.
29.1.1	Available jobs will be bid down to entry-level jobs one time. Afterwards, any resulting vacancy will be filled by Paragraph 29.9 and 34.
29.2	Bids will be accepted only from employees in the seniority division where the vacancy exists. There will be no limit on the number of bids to jobs paying higher day work rate except
29.3	An employee will be limited to four (4) bids within a calendar year to jobs paying the same or lower day work rate and may not bid again to a higher day work rate for a period of ten (10) days.

29.4.1	An employee who signs a listing of multiple jobs within the same job classification may indicate the specific job he or she is bidding for and will not be considered for any other job within that classification on that listing.
29.4.2	Employees who qualify for two or more available jobs at the same time may have their choice of the jobs.

20
29.6	The Supervisor will advise the Steward of the successful bidder in writing within two (2) working days after the effective date.
29.7	Available jobs will be filled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph before employees with less seniority are placed on available jobs in accordance with Paragraph 37 and 38.
29.8	If there are no bids filed or qualified bidders on upgrade jobs, such vacancies shall be filled by the junior entrylevel employee in the division. If there are no qualified bidders in the entry level job such vacancy shall be filled by the junior excess entry level employee in the division, except jobs being filled under Paragraph 34.
29.8.1	If a job is not posted for bid, that vacancy will be offered by seniority to excess employees in that specific job classification on that shift, before the junior excess entry level employee in the division is assigned.

29.9	The provisions of this paragraph will not apply if there are unassigried or excess employees in the specific job classification.
30.	An employee who is promoted or transferred to an available job in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 29 and after a reasonable training period fails to satisfactorily perform the requirements of the job will be removed from that job and reassigned, seniority permitting, to the job classification from which he or she was transferred or promoted. In the event he or she does not have seniority to be reassigned in this
21
classification he or she will be placed in accordance with the provisions of Paragraphs 37, 38and 40.
30.1	In the event the employee is removed before the end of his or her third (3rd) day on the job, he or she will be placed back on the job he or she vacated.
31.	Temporary promotions shall be limited to five (5) working days each and will be offered by seniority to employees capable of doing the job without training time. In Seniority Division 12 such temporary promotions will be filled first from the supervisor’s area of responsibility before other division seniority employees are considered. In the event a senior employee is bypassed for lack of qualifications, he or she will be notified in a reasonable amount of time.
31.1	In the event no capable employee accepts the temporary promotion, such promotion will be offered by seniority to all division employees. In Seniority Division 12 such temporary promotions will first be offered by seniority to employees in the supervisors area of responsibility before other division seniority employees are considered. In the event no employee accepts the temporary promotion then the least senior entry-level employee among those capable will be assigned to the job.
31.2	A temporary promotion for over five (5) working days each will be handled in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 29.
31.3	The time limits of this paragraph shall not apply to temporary assignment or promotions for replacements for vacations or military service of less than one month. In these cases the employee who is promoted or assigned shall be considered for the entire term of the

When so transferred he or she shall commence work as an hourly-rated employee in line with his or her then seniority ranking and in accordance with Paragraph 37 excluding Paragraph 40.1.

In order to make the Evansville Division as safe and healthy a place to work as possible, Whirlpool may utilize safety studies to identify jobs that could lead to musculoskeletal disorder (heavy lifting, awkward posture, repetitive motion). Studies may be conducted on jobs that have resulted in injury or illness, that produce high turnover, or those that receive complaints by employees or the union. The safety department will be responsible for approving the studies and determining what if any actions are necessary to change the jobs. Possible actions to be taken include adding people, modifying work stations, replacing the job with automation, modifying parts, requesting the affected employee to bid to another job or to voluntarily transfer to another seniority division to prevent personal injury, and/or rotating jobs. If the employee moves by bid or by transfer, this “safety move” will not count against the normal bid and transfer limitations.
If the studies show that the only reasonable option is to rotate a job or group of jobs, the following procedure would be followed before rotation would begin:
• The jobs to be included in the rotation would be identified by the safety department.
66
o The union representative(s) and affected employee would be notified of the jobs to be rotated.
® If there are employees in the identified jobs, they will have two weeks to bid off the jobs. This bid would not count against the normal bids per year allowed to employees.
®	If employees bid off these jobs, the jobs
would be re-bid per the normal bid procedure.
• Jobs posted in the future that are part of a rotation group will be posted as such so that the bidding employees know all the jobs they will be required to do.
All disagreements regarding any of the above-mentioned actions, if any, shall only be subject to the grievance procedure.
