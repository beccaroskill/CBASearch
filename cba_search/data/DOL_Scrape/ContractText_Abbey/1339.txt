(b)	The EMPLOYER retains the right to reject applicants referred by the UNION.
(c)	The foregoing provisions shall be posted in places where notices to Employees and applicants for employment are customarily posted. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the EMPLOYER parties hereto, by their designated agents, from inspecting and examining the hiring hall procedures,
(d)	The EMPLOYER shall give the UNION at least twenty-four (24) hours notice if possible when ordering men.
Paragraph 2. Recognized Employers In accordance with the foregoing provisions, the UNION agrees to refer without charge applicants for work covered by this Agreement to EMPLOYERS who have made requests for such Employees. For the protection of the Employees covered by this Agreement, the EMPLOYERS shall file with and furnish to the UNION, on blanks prepared and furnished by the UNION, a statement containing the following information:
Name of business, name of owner, business and residential address, business and residential telephone number, experience and length of time in cement construction work, either as an EMPLOYER or Employee, name and address of bank and bank reference, Social Security Number or Federal EMPLOYER Identification Number of business, State of Illinois Unemployment Account Number, copy of Workmen's Compensation Insurance Policy or Certificate of the insurance company certifying the existence of the same.
It is further agreed that the EMPLOYER will pay all Employees covered by this contract on any hourly basis only. Piece rates, square footage arrangements, or any other devices by an EMPLOYER to avoid the intent of this provision are expressly prohibited.
