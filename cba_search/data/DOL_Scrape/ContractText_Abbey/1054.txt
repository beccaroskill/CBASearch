Applicability of Agreement
Section 1.	All work in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island covered by this Agreement shall be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the area agreement of the Carpenters Local Union in the area where the work is performed.
Section 2.	This Agreement shall be binding upon the employer, their successors and assignees. Except for filed sub-bids, the Employer agrees he will not subcontract any work covered by this Agreement, which is to be performed on the job site except to contractors who are parties to a collective bargaining agreement with the Union, or to a contractor who is willing to sign a collective bargaining agreement with the Union. The Union, with good cause may reject any contractor. Good cause shall include, but not be limited to any contractor who has been delinquent in the payment of fringe benefit contributions, who has operated an unlawful double-breasted company, who has been previously terminated by the Union, or who does not employ carpenters while performing work covered by this agreement. Said subcontractor must have entered into the collective bargaining agreement with the Union before starting any carpentry work.
Section 3.	For work covered by this Agreement in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont it is understood that there may be instances where suitable competitive union sub-contractors may not be available for certain subcontracts. In such instances, the Employer will notify the Union in a timely manner prior to the bid or the award of the subcontract, and the Union will endeavor to locate suitable, competitive Union subcontractors to bid for the work. If the Employer and the Union are unable to locate such suitable, competitive sub-contractors, it is understood and agreed that the Employer will be relieved of the subcontracting clause for such subcontracts; provided, however, that the sub-contractor selected by the Employer must be a responsible sub-contractor. A responsible sub-contractor provides workers’ compensation insurance for all of its employees on the project, does not misclassify any employees as “independent contractors,” and provides and pays a substantial majority of full-coverage health insurance premiums for all carpenter employees on the project and their families. When coverage is not immediately available to newly enrolled employees, the employer will make payments equivalent to the employer paid premium as wages, until such time as coverage begins and premiums are paid on behalf of the employee. Any disputes under this section as to whether a subcontractor is responsible and complies with the standards set forth in this section are to be resolved by expedited arbitration. A hearing will be held within seven days of submission, and if necessary, the parties will make themselves available for an evening hearing. The hearing shall not take more than one (1) day; no briefs are to be filed, and a decision shall be issued within twenty-four (24) hours of the close of the hearing.

The parties recognize the threat of unfair competition in certain areas and types of work from contractors who do not conform to the standards provided in this collective bargaining agreement. In order to address that problem, the Employer may request relief from certain provisions of this collective bargaining agreement, only after trying to recruit union subcontractor bids. The Employer shall contact the Executive Secretary-Treasurer of the Council or his designee to discuss the relief being requested. If an agreement on relief is granted, it will be reduced to writing, and reasonable efforts will be made to advise other signatory contractors who are bidding on the project of the relief. It is expressly understood that no modification or deviation may be made from the existing collective bargaining agreement except by mutual agreement of the parties. It is further understood that failure to reach an agreement under this provision shall not be subject to arbitration. It is the intent of the parties that this procedure will be utilized where circumstances warrant and that the Employer will not abuse this procedure. Relief granted under this section shall not constitute a violation of the favored nation’s provisions of Section 7 of this Article.
Procedures shall be established to notify all contractors of the changes, which have been decided by the committee for that particular job.

The Union further agrees that it will not enter into any project labor agreements or side letter agreements that contain more favorable terms than those contained in this agreement without offering those same terms to the parties to this Agreement. If any project labor agreement or agreement to grant relief on a particular project contains more favorable terms, the offering of those terms to other contractors will be limited to that particular project.
