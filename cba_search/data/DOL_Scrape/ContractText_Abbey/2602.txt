ARTICLE 4
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
4.1	DEFINITIONS
4.101	A grievance is a claim by an employee or an employee's organization, that there has been a violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of this contract.
4.102	An aggrieved person is the person or persons, including the organization, or representatives thereof, making the claim.
4.103	A "party in interest" is any person who might be required to take action, or against whom action might be taken, in order to resolve the claim.
4.2	PURPOSE
4.201	The purpose of this procedure is to secure, at the lowest possible administrative level, a resolution to the grievance caused from the interpretation and application of this contract which may affect wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment. The proceedings will be kept confidential and as informal as may be appropriate at any level of the procedure.
4.202	Any employee may at any time present grievances to his employer, and have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the exclusive representative, as long as the adjustment is reached prior to arbitration and the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a written agreement then in effect; provided that the public school employer shall not agree to a resolution of the grievance until the exclusive representative has received a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and has been given the opportunity to file a response.
4.203	Since it is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible, the time limits specified should be considered maximum and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits may, however, be extended by mutual agreement.
4.204	In the event a grievance is filed when it cannot be processed through all the steps by the end of the school year, and if left unresolved until the beginning of the following school year, could result in harm to an aggrieved person, the time limits set forth herein will be adjusted so that resolution is complete prior to the opening of school.
4.3	PROCEDURE
4.301	Pre-grievance requirements: Any person with a problem requiring resolution will first discuss the problem with the appropriate immediate superior or representative of employee organization, either directly or through a representative with the objective of resolving the matter informally. If resolution is not effected, a grievance may be filed within six (6) calendar weeks of the event or circumstances occasioning the alleged grievance.
15
4.302	An employee may file a grievance in writing simultaneously with the president of -AFSCME Human Resources for routing to the appropriate administrator.
4.303	Within ten (10) work days after receipt of the written grievance, Human Resources or the president of the employee organization will meet with the aggrieved person and a representative of the employee organization or the Board, in an effort to resolve it.
4.304	If the originator of the grievance is not satisfied with the disposition above, or if no written decision has been rendered within ten (10) work days of the meeting specified in 4.303, AFSCME may request that the matter be submitted to mediation. If the District agrees, then the matter shall be mediated with the State Mediation and Conciliation Service as soon as a date may be set.
4.305	If the originator of the grievance is not satisfied with the disposition above, or if no written decision has been rendered within ten (10) work days of the meeting specified in Section 4.303, he/she may within twenty (20) work days of the meeting specified in Section 4.303 above, request in writing that the grievance be submitted to an arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set forth to all parties his findings of fact, reasoning and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator will be without power or authority to make any decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by law or which is in violation of the terms of this agreement. The arbitrator will have no power to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of this agreement, or the written policies, rules, regulations, and procedures of the District. Should it become necessary to decide an issue, an arbitrator is required to review issues of “external law.” Provided that the arbitrator abides by his or her jurisdictional mandates, doesn’t commit fraud, or have a conflict of interest, the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding. Discipline of employees is not subject to binding arbitration. All appeals of discipline shall be subject to District policy and Education Code §45113.
a. The employee organization alone, as opposed to the individual unit member grieved, by written notice to Human Resources within fifteen (15) work days of receipt of the request, may submit a grievance to binding arbitration.
4.306	After a grievance has been submitted for arbitration, the moving party shall request from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service a list of five (5) arbitrators experienced in resolving grievances in the public schools.
From the list of five (5) arbitrators from the, State Mediation and Conciliation Service names will be struck by the parties until one remains. The flip of a coin will be used to determine who strikes first.
a.	The parties shall develop a written description of the grievance and steps through which it has moved. The exact question or issue which must be answered or solved, is to be specified in writing. The document, when agreed to and signed by both parties, will become the charge for the arbitrator.
b.	In all instances, the arbitrator's recommendation or resolution of the grievance will be in writing and will set forth the finding of fact, the conclusions reached, and the logic underlying those conclusions. This document will be submitted by the
16
arbitrator to the parties affected.
c.	Within ten (10) work days of receipt of the arbitrator's conclusions and recommendations, a final decision will be made and that decision will be communicated in writing to the affected parties.
4.307	All costs for the direct services of the arbitrator will be borne equally by the Board of Education and AFSCME. Other costs will be borne by the party incurring them. Costs of a transcript, if used by a party, shall be borne equally.
4.4	RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES TO REPRESENTATION
4.401	No reprisals of any kind will be taken by any person against any aggrieved person, any party in interest, any member of an employee organization, or any other participant in the grievance procedure by reason of such participation.
4.402	Grievants may be represented at all stages of the grievance procedure by themselves or, at their option, by a representative. If a grievant does not choose to be represented, the employee organization shall be given a copy of the grievance and the proposed resolution and have the opportunity to file a response within five (5) work days.
4.5	MISCELLANEOUS
4.501	AFSCME may on their own behalf and on the behalf of the affected employee, initiate a grievance which affects more than one employee at one location.
4.502	If a grievance arises from action or inaction of a person at a level above the school or department, the aggrieved person shall submit such grievance in writing to the Superintendent or his/her designee and the employee organization.
4.503	Decisions rendered in Section 4.303 of the procedure will be in writing specifying the decision and the reasons and will be transmitted promptly to those parties in interest. Time limits for appeal shall begin the day following receipt of written decision by the parties in interest.
4.504	When it is necessary for a grievant and his/her representative, or an employee requested to appear to attend a grievance meeting or hearing during the working day, such parties shall be released without loss of pay. A reasonable effort will be made to hold grievance hearings during the grieving employee's workday.
4.505	All documents, communications, and records resulting from the processing of a grievance shall be filed separately from the personnel file of any participant.
4.506	Appropriate forms for the filing and processing of grievances will be developed jointly by the Superintendent or his/her designee and employee organizations and provided by the District, as necessary, at the cost of the District.

5.304	Maintenance classifications were developed to identify specialized trades for Glazier, Locksmith, Plumber, Shop Carpenter and Electronic Technician. The District agrees that growth will allow more specialization within the trades but wants to insure that job descriptions guarantee that no employee will be unable to perform useful work if no work is immediately available within the specialization. The District also feels that other less specialized trades persons should not feel that tasks within the specialization are solely reserved for a specialist to perform.

5.701	A uniform allocation will be provided for custodial, maintenance, grounds, purchasing warehouse, food & nutrition services warehouse, and security services employees for wear while on duty.

5.708	Employees must begin each work day clean, neat and attired in properly fitting prescribed uniforms. Uniform items, optional wear items, and pants with visible areas of wear or disrepair will not be worn.
22
5.709	The District agrees to stock back braces in the warehouse for those employees whose job regularly and routinely requires heavy lifting.

2.2	Criterion for Layoff. Length of service (seniority) shall be the only criterion used to effect layoffs. Length of service shall be calculated on date of hire within the classification worked. If two (2) or more employees within a classification have the same hire date, the longevity base date will be used to determine as to who shall be laid off first and if that date is the same then the first day of paid service with the District will be used, and if that is the same, then the determination will be made by lot.

2.4.5	An employee who meets the qualifications may elect retirement under the Public Employees Retirement System and shall be placed on an appropriate reemployment list. If an employee subsequently accepts, in writing, an appropriate vacant position within the period of thirty-nine (39) months, the District shall maintain the position until PERS has processed the request for reinstatement from retirement.
33
2.4.6	Those entitled to bump may bump into a position of greater, same, or fewer hours.
2.5	Demotions in Lieu of Layoff.
2.5.1	In lieu of being laid off, an employee may elect demotion to a classification
with a lower salary status in which the employee had previously served under permanent status provided that the employee has a greater hire date seniority in the classification than the incumbent employee. The employee shall be allowed to bump the employee with the least hire date seniority in the lower classification.
2.5.2	Any employee will be automatically considered for demotion in lieu of layoff unless he or she indicates otherwise. The employee must notify the District in writing within five (5) working days after receiving layoff notice and rights to demotion.

3.2	Laid off employees who, at the time of layoff, took voluntary demotions or voluntary reductions in assigned time shall be, at the employee's option, returned to a position in their former classification or to a position which increases assigned time as vacancies become available for an additional period of twenty-four (24) months provided that the same tests of fitness under which they qualified for appointment to the classification still applies. Such employees shall be ranked in accordance with their hire date seniority on the reemployment lists.
3.3	When a vacancy occurs in a classification for which a layoff reemployment list has been established, the senior employee will be notified and given the opportunity to accept the vacancy. The laid off employee may decline the offer of employment and retain their position on the list. The offer will then be made to the next person on the list. The laid off employee will only be eligible for the position the employee held when laid off. A laid off employee may refuse the first offer, but the rejection of the second will constitute a waiver of the employee's statutory right to be on the reemployment list.

3.4	An employee who has been laid off for lack of work or lack of funds, and who is on a layoff reemployment list, may be employed as a substitute or short-term employee in his original classification or any other classification for which qualified, and such employment shall in no manner jeopardize or otherwise affect the employee's status or eligibility for reemployment.
OTHER LAYOFF CONSIDERATIONS
Employees who are subject to layoff will be offered vacant positions at an equal or lower classification within the unit job family from which the employee was displaced.
The District will notify AFSCME of pending layoff actions which affect employees within the bargaining unit.
A Job Family is a group of classifications whose essential functions are closely related but require progressively more complex skills to perform successfully as you progress up the job family ladder.
The employee who is placed in a vacant position within the job family must meet the minimum qualifications of that position and will be required to serve a six (6)-month probationary period. Should the employee not successfully complete the probationary period, the employee would be placed on the thirty-nine (39) month reemployment list for which the employee would otherwise have been qualified.
On notification of layoff, employees may file with the District a list of classifications in which the employee is interested. Except for closed promotional positions, the District will interview the employee for positions where the employee meets the minimum qualifications.
The definition of "job family" is intended to be narrowly defined (i.e., Office Assistant I, II and III), and not to be more broadly defined (i.e., Office Assistant III and Staff Secretary); however, the District will continue to attempt to accommodate employees to be laid off to other vacant positions within other classifications provided no law prevents that accommodation.
6.11	DRUG TESTING FOR SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITIONS
a.	The District-encourages employees in safety sensitive positions to indicate as early as possible if a drug or alcohol problem exists. By establishing a standard of rehabilitation which says that if you come forward voluntarily (prior to a positive result in a random drug or alcohol screening), it will encourage employees to confront their needs as early as possible (because if they wait, they will be terminated if found positive). The District and AFSCME are beneficiaries of the public trust which says that those performing public service in safety sensitive positions should be held accountable for strict standards to insure public safety. We believe that it would be inappropriate to allow those testing positive to continue in the public service.
b.	Unit members employed in safety sensitive positions are required to adhere to the District's Drug and Alcohol Testing Program, Policy and Reference Guide which is incorporated by reference as if fully set out herein.

The twelve (12)-month period is measured backward from the date of leave use. All leave usage which qualifies under the terms of the , leave shall be counted towards the available twelve (12) work weeks within a twelve (12)-month period, including intermittent and reduced workload leaves.
Reduced workload leave entitlement is calculated on cumulative hours of leave taken, up to the number of hours equivalent to twelve (12) times the number of hours normally worked weekly.
7.317.02 LENGTH OF EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY: Any employee who has been employed for a least twelve (12) months AND who has been in a paid status for at least 1,250 hours during the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave is eligible for Family and Medical Leave.
7.317.03 ELIGIBLE PURPOSES: Leaves for any of the following purposes qualify for Family and Medical Leave.
46
1.	The birth of a child of an employee, and to care for a newborn;
2.	The placement of a child with an employee in connection with adoption of
foster care of a child by an employee;
3.	Leave to care for a child, parent or spouse who has a serious health condition; or
4.	Leave because of serious health condition that makes the employee unable
to perform the essential functions of his/her position.
Both father and mother may take leave for the birth, or placement for adoption or foster care, of a child. In addition, an expectant mother may be entitled to leave prior to the birth of a child for prenatal care purposes if her condition makes her unable to work. Circumstances may also require leave prior to the actual placement of a child for adoption or foster care. For example, the attend counseling sessions, appear in court or consult with his/her attorney in connection with the placement of child.
If both the husband and wife are employed by the District, the aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both are entitled is limited to twelve (12) work weeks during any one (1) fiscal year for the birth or placement for adoption or foster care of the employees' child, or to care for a parent with a serious health condition. This limitation does not apply to leave taken by either spouse to care for the other who is seriously ill and unable to work, to care for a child with a serious health condition, or for his or her own serious illness.
Leave to care for a family member includes both physical and psychological care, including providing comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a seriously ill child or parent receiving inpatient care; or, making arrangements for third-party care of a family member.
A "serious health condition" includes an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:
1.	Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or in consequent to a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility.
2.	Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school or regular daily activities of more than three calendar days, that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider; or
3.	Continuing treatment by a health care provider for a chronic or long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three calendar days or for prenatal care.
4.	Continuing supervision by a health care provider when the parent, child,
47
spouse or employee are severely ill buy may not be receiving continuing active care or treatment (e.g., when suffering from Alzheimer's, late states of cancer or a severe stroke).
"Continuing treatments" include:
1.	Two (2) or more visits to a health care provider;
2.	Two or more treatments by a health care practitioner (e.g., physical therapist) on referral from, or under the direction of a health care provider; or
3.	A single visit to a health care provider that results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider (e.g., medication therapy).
Intermittent leave or reduced work schedule leaves may be allowed when the absence required is not due to a condition that is incapacitating at that point in time (e.g., appointments for cancer treatments, physical therapy, prenatal care). When leave is taken because of the birth or the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, intermittent leave or reduced workload schedule will not be approved if the intermittent leave or reduced workload schedule will adversely impact the office or department of the employee.
If an employee requests intermittent leave or reduced workload leave to care for a spouse, child or parent or for the employee's own serious health condition, the employee may be required to temporarily transfer to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that:
a)	has equivalent pay and benefits; and
b)	better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the regular position of the employee.
Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are no medically necessary are not "serious health conditions," unless inpatient hospital care is required.
Absence because of an employee's substance abuse, without treatment, does not qualify for leave.
7.317	.04 PAID/UNPAID LEAVE: Leave provided by in excess of available accrued paid leave shall be unpaid. Any available paid accrued leave shall be used prior to unpaid leave (e.g., vacation, comp time or sick leave) for the employee.
7.317	.05 HEALTH AND DENTAL INSURANCE BENEFITS: Health care and dental benefits coverage shall be continued during the twelve (12) weeks FMLA leave period under the same terms and conditions as applicable to all other employees. Upon expiration of FMLA leave entitlement, if additional unpaid leave is authorized, continuation of health care and dental benefits coverage shall be allowed with the employee paying all costs of coverage or as may be allowed in other
48
applicable policies.
49
7 317 06 FAILURE TO RETURN FROM FMLA LEAVE: If an employee indicates his/her intent not to return from leave (including at the start of the leave), or if the employee fails to return from leave, paid health and dental coverage will cease unless the employee does not return because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would entitle the employee to FMLA leave, or other circumstances beyond the employee's control, (such as where an employee's spouse is unexpectedly transferred to a new job location, someone other than an immediate family member has a serious health condition which the employee needs to care for, or the employee is laid off while on leave The employee's desire to stay with a family member even though the family member no longer requires the employee's care, or a mother's decision to stay home with a newborn child and not return to work, do not qualify as "other circumstances beyond the employee's control"
Except as provided above, if an employee fails to return after expiration for eligibility for FMLA leave, the employee shall pay the full cost of coverage for health and dental benefits during the entire period of unpaid FMLA leave Any amounts due under this section may be deducted from any sums due the employee (e g , unpaid wages, vacation pay, etc ) Failure to reimburse the District for the cost of coverage during the period of the unpaid leave shall result in termination of coverage
If an employee is unable to return to work because of the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition, the employee shall provide medical certification of such claim The certification shall be issued by the health care provider of the employee or by health care provider of the employee's child, spouse or parent if the employee is unable to return to work because of the need to take care of one of these individuals The certification shall indicate that the employee is prevented from performing the functions of the position or is needed to care for the family member on the date the leave expired If a requested certification is not provided within thirty (30) days, the cost of coverage provided during the period of unpaid FMLA leave shall be due and payable
7 317 07 EMPLOYEE STATUS WHILE ON LEAVE: FMLA leave does not constitute a break in service for purposes of longevity and/or seniority Seniority shall not be earned for any period of time on unpaid leave Employees returning from leave shall return with no less seniority for purposes of layoff, recall, vacation accrual or other seniority
7 317 08 MEDICAL CERTIFICATION/RECERTIFICATION: Medical certification from the health care provider of the individual requiring care shall be provided initially upon request for FMLA leave The certification shall indicate the estimated duration of the need for leave Periodic updates or recertification may be required upon expiration of the period of leave originally estimated or every thirty (30) days, if requested by the Human Resources Department
The employer may, at its own expense, require the eligible employee obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved by the employer When the second opinion differs from the first, the employer may require, at its own
50
7 317 09
7 317 10
7 317 11
expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated and approved jointly by the employer and employee The opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered final and binding on the employer and employee
If leave is foreseeable, medical certification must be provided within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the employee's request for leave If the employee fails to provide certification, the leave may be denied until certification is provided If the leave is not foreseeable, the certification shall be provided within fifteen (15) days, or as soon as is practicable under the circumstances Failure to provide certification within a reasonable time under the pertinent circumstances may result in denial of continuation of the leave
ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIRED: If the event necessitating the leave becomes known to the employee more than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the need for a leave, the employee shall provide notice as soon as he/she learns of the need for a leave -- at a minimum, thirty (30) days written, advance notice

RECLASSIFICATION PROCEDURE
PETITION

Petitions shall be submitted by January 10. Any changes in the Request for Reclassification Review form shall be mutually agreed upon between Human Resources and AFSCME Local 258.
BOARD OF REVIEW
Properly completed Request for Reclassification Review forms will be screened by the Board of Review composed of:
•	two classified unit members (when possible from the requesting individual's classification or occupational group and the classification or occupational group to which the individual is requesting reclassification). These members shall be appointed by AFSCME Local 258;
•	one supervisor or management employee;
•	one additional individual selected by the Board of Review; and
•	the Director for Classified Personnel or his/her designee.
The Board of Review shall be responsible for determining if there exists justification to conduct a full study of the position. Decisions shall be made by majority vote. In evaluating the request for review, the panel shall consider the following:
a.	The level and nature of the duties and responsibilities the employee is regularly required to perform which are not covered by his/her job description.
b.	How the employee came to be assigned duties and responsibilities not covered by his/her job description (i.e., expansion in the functions of the school or office, or possession by the employee of special skills or abilities.)
c.	Comparison of the employee's actual duties as shown on the Request for Reclassification Review with the duties shown on the job description.
d.	Internal relationships (i.e., classified salary schedule).
e.	Information given by the employee and the employee's supervisor to the Board of Review upon request.
Decisions of the Board of Review shall be communicated by the Chairperson to the petitioner with the reasons for its decision. Decisions of the Board of Review to accept or deny the petition for study shall be
86
final. However, an employee may re-petition for consideration the next year.
RECLASSIFICATION STUDY
Upon acceptance of a request for study, the Board of Review shall conduct a reclassification study as follows:
a.	Interviews with the individual, their supervisor and may include persons serving in similar positions.
b.	Review of the individual's Request for Reclassification Review and Request for Reclassification Reviews prepared by individuals serving in similar positions.
c.	Review of the official job description.
d.	May include on-the-job audit(s).
e.	May include comparisons of salary survey data from other districts.
Upon analysis of the results of this study, the Board of Review by majority vote approves or denies the request. Recommendations of the Board of Review are then forwarded through Human Resources to the Superintendent's Cabinet for final approval. Recommendations will be completed no later than May 1 and will be recommended to the Board of Education with an effective date of July 1.
87
APPENDIX C
E-MAIL POLICY
By using the email system, the employee expressly consents to the District’s email policy. The user agrees not to misuse or abuse the email system, agrees to comply with all limitations on the use of the email system and understands that the email system is not a private communication medium.
The email system is a business tool owned and paid for by the District; therefore, the email system is the District’s property. All email messages are the property of the District and are subject to office policy, procedures, and control. As such, the District has the right to view them at any time. The District respects the individual privacy of its employees. However, that privacy does not extend to the employee’s work-related conduct or to the use of District provided technical resources or supplies. Therefore, employees have no right of privacy as to any information transmitted or stored through the District’s email system. To ensure proper use, the District may monitor its technological resources at any time without advance notice or consent.
Employees shall use the email system for purposes related to their employment with the District. Use of the email system that promotes unethical practices, or any activity prohibited by law, the Education Code and/or any other statutes, or District policy is strictly prohibited. Except as otherwise indicated in this policy, Commercial or political use of the email system is also strictly prohibited. Messages related to or in support of illegal activities are strictly prohibited and will be reported to District authorities and may be reported to legal authorities.
Employees should be aware that computer files and communications over electronic networks, including email are not private. This technology should not be used to conduct personal commercial business.
The transmission of information about students or District affairs shall adhere to the following:
•	Confidential information should never be sent or forwarded to outside individuals or outside agencies not authorized to receive that information.
•	Confidential messages and information should never be sent or forwarded to others, including faculty, staff and students who do not need to know the information.
•	Confidential information should not be forwarded to multiple parties unless there is a clear and legitimate need to do so.
•	Confidential email should not be retained in an employee’s personal mailbox, but should be deleted as soon as possible.
•	Confidential messages from or to legal counsel should not be forwarded to others without counsel’s authorization, since such messages may constitute privileged communications between the District and its attorney.
Users shall not use email in ways that violate any copyright laws. This includes but is not limited to copyrighted information, graphics and software.
The email system is not provided as a public, student, or employee forum. Sending unnecessary messages to a large number of people (chair mail) is prohibited. Appropriate work-related email may be sent to a group of District users, such as Education Center or All Elementary Secretaries. The sender should select the appropriate group. Since email is not provided as a public forum, it should not be used
88
to broadcast personal opinion or personal information.
Email shall not include the transmission of the type of material that is threatening, disruptive, sexually explicit, obscene, or that could reasonably be perceived as harassment or disparagement of others based on their race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, or political belief, or which is otherwise inconsistent with District policies, regulations or procedures, or which is contrary to law.
Email shall not be used to produce, distribute, access, use or store information which would subject the District or the individual to criminal, civil or administrative liability for its use, production, distribution, access or storage. Electronic communication on District computers could reflect upon the District since all messages sent from the District include the name of the District in the electronic address.
For District employees provided with email, the email is considered a primary avenue of communication and should be checked by employees frequently.
Guests may receive an individual account with the approval of a District administrator if there is a specific, District-related purpose requiring such access. Use of the system by a guest must be limited specifically to the District-related purpose. Guest accounts will not be included in any email groups or distribution lists without authorization from Technology Services.
Users must comply with the provisions of Education Code section 7054, which includes email when it states that, “no school district . . . funds, services, supplies, or equipment shall be used for the purpose of urging the support or defeat of any ballot measure of candidate including, but not limited to, any candidate for election to the governing board of the district.” This does not preclude the district from sharing accurate, factual information on these topics. Any email sent or received using the District system or resources may be inadvertently viewed, printed, forwarded, and/or saved. Users are advised that information and communication deleted by the user may be restored and retrieved form the computer by the District or a legal authority.
Security on the network is a high priority. The person in whose name an account is issued is responsible at all times for its proper use. Employees are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to the email system by:
•	Logging off or taking other measures when they are away from their workstation.
•	Ensuring that email windows are not left open on the screen when the workstation is unattended.
•	Keeping account passwords confidential and not allowing others to use them.
No employee shall send email that either masks the employee’s identify or indicates that the email was sent by someone else. No employee shall access the email system using another employee’s password.
Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
The District does not consider conduct in violation of this policy to be within the course and scope of employment or the direct consequence of the discharge of one’s duties. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by law, the District reserves the right not to provide a defense or pay damages assessed employees for conduct in violation of this policy.
