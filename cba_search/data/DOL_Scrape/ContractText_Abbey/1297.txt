The Union recognizes that the Association, because of its size and the nature of its membership in the painting and related industries of New York City, Westchester, Putnam, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, is the principal bargaining representative for all employers working in the industries with whom the Union negotiates collective bargaining agreements, and any extensions or renewals thereof.
The Union shall give principal recognition to any successor association to the Association during the life of this Trade Agreement which (i) may be established; (ii) is affiliated with a national association whose members employ union employees only; and (iii) represents employers in the same industries for which the Union negotiates collective bargaining agreements for work performed in the territorial jurisdiction defined in Art.

Art. m. Sec. 8(C) — Amount of Allowance: The amount of the cost-of-living adjustment shall be computed as follows: April 1, 2001, April 1, 2002, April 1, 2003 and April 1, 2004, the most recent and available (i.e., March) index number shall be compared to the Index number 12 months prior and that a percent change shall be applied to all wage rates on May 1, 2001, May 1, 2002, May 1, 2003, and May 1, 2004. The percent change shall be compared to the Index number 12 months prior and the percent change computed minus 6.5% shall be applied to all wage rates on May 1, 2001, on all wage rates in the Schedule A classification of Art. III. Sec. 1; and on May 1, 2002, the percent change as arrived at by Index number 12 month prior minus 6.5% shall be applied to all wage rates in the schedule A classification of Art. III. Sect. 1; and on May 1, 2003, the percent change as arrived at by Index number 12 month prior minus 6.5% shall be applied to all wage rates in the schedule A classification of Art. III. Sect. 1; and on May 1, 2004, the percent change as arrived at by Index number 12 month prior minus 6.5% shall be applied to all wage rates in the schedule A classification of Art. III. Sect. 1.
EXAMPLE: On July 1, 1975, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish their May index number on or about June 20, 1975. This May index number for New York City will be compared with the May index number for 1974 itvhich was 152.5. Assuming that the index number of May, 1975 is 164.7. A percentage change ii calculated by dividing the 164.7. by 152.5, which yields
9
an 8.0 percent increase. According to the attached cost of living clause, Section. C above, 6.5% would be deducted from this, and the 1.5% percentage increase remaining would apply to the wage rate section of the agreement and increase the rate accordingly.

BONDS, DAMAGES, FEES AND INTEREST
Art. XXII. Sec. 1 — Bonds.
(a)	Security — The Signatory Employer shall provide security to the Trustees for the faithful performance by it of the requirements under this Trade Agreement for the the payment of Signatory Employer Benefit Contributions, liquidated damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, costs of collection and other monetary obligations under this Trade Agreement. The Trustees shall be entitled to retain any interest that accrues on such security during the time such security is deposited with the Trustees.

(e)	The Trustees shall not accept any surety bond or other non-cash collateral from any Signatory Employer who shall have failed in the past to make payment of any sums found by the Trustees or National Trustees to be due under this Trade Agreement or under any prior Trade Agreement. In such cases, compliance with the security requirements hereof shall be by cash deposit only.
(f)	Additional Security — In the event the Trustees determine that a Signatory Employer is guilty of violating any provision of this Trade Agreement, and is assessed a fine or penalty by the Trustees, or in the event the Trustees bring suit against a Signatory Employer to collect unpaid Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions or interest, liquidated damages or fees related thereto, the Signatory Employer shall provide additional security in such form and amount as the Trustees shall determine. In no event shall such additional security be less than the amount of the Signatory Employer's potential liability to the Trustees. Any additional security required pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited with the Trustees who are authorized to pay out of such security any sums found by the Trustees to be due for unpaid Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions, liquidated damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, or other costs of collection.
Art. XXII. Sec. 2. — Damages, Interest and Fees.
(a)	Liquidated Damages — Time is of the essence for the payment of Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions. The parties recognize and acknowledge that the regular and prompt payment of Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions by Signatory Employers is essential, and that it would be extremely difficult, if not impractical, to fix the actual expense and damages which will result from a failure of a Signatory Employer to make the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions in full within the time provided, and without becoming delinquent.
Therefore, the parties agree that if the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions shall become delinquent, the amount of damage resulting from any such delinquency shall be, by way of liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, a sum equivalent to 20% of the total Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions required pursuant to this Trade Agreement, for each failure to pay in full within the time provided in Art. XX, Sec. 1(g), for each pay period for which payments are required to be made. The liquidated damages, so fixed and computed, shall be added to and become a part of the Signatory Employer's required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contribution due to any of the Trustees.
(b)	Interest — If the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions of a Signatory Employer become delinquent, in addition to the amount assessed as liquidated damages, interest shall be added to the obligation of the delinquent Signatory Employer, calculated monthly at the annual rate of the prime rate plus 2.0%, which shall be calculated based upon ihe sum of all Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions due for the period for which the Signatory Employer is.delinquent, starting with the first day of delinquency (i.e., the ninth day).	/ \
51
(c)	Attorneys’ Fees and Cost of Collection — If the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions become delinquent, in addition to the amount due as liquidated damages and interest as provided for in the preceding subsections (a) and (b), there shall be added to the obligation of the delinquent Signatory Employer, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Trustees in the collection of any delinquency, liquidated damages and interest, including but not limited to (i) reasonable attorneys* fees; (ii) accountant's fees; (iii) cost of attachment and execution; (iv) bond; (v) receivers; and (vi) court costs.
(d)	All liquidated damages, interest, and any other costs and assessments due and received from a delinquent Signatory Employer shall be paid to and received by the Trustees.
Art. XXII. Sec. 3 —Trust Fund Hearing.
(a)	Signatory Employer Request — Should an Signatory Employer, after an audit held by the Trustees, be subject to an assessment of additional Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions, the Signatory Employer shall be entitled, on request, to a hearing before the Trustees or a properly appointed subcommittee thereof. At such hearing, the Signatory Employer shall be given an opportunity to present all available facts, and shall be subject to open examination thereon, so that the Signatory Employer may establish an actual lower direct labor cost such that a readjustment of the basis for the calculation of the Signatory Employer's Fringe Benefit Contributions due to the Trustees is warranted. At such hearing, the Trustees shall consider the recommendation of the Funds' auditors and any proof that the Signatory Employer may offer. If the Signatory Employer's right to a readjustment is proven, the Trustees shall remit any excess Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions to the Signatory Employer. The decision of the Trustees, after such hearing, shall be final and binding.
(b)	Failure to Request Hearing — If, after an audit and a final assessment of further contributions due, the Signatory Employer fails, within ten (10) days after written notice thereof given by the Trustees, to request in writing a hearing before them as provided in the preceding sub-section (a), the Signatory Employer shall be deemed conclusively to have consented thereto, with no further recourse.
