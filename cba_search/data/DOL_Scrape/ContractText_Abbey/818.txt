Section 12.	Adjustments to Wage Increases
The amounts of increases effective on or after May 1, 2005 for employees working in Areas 1 and 2, as set forth in Appendix “D”, shall be subject to modification, based on the cost of maintaining the insurance benefits provided for in Article XVIII. The Start Rates for employees working in Areas 1 and 2, as set forth in Appendix “D”, shall not be affected by any modifications to wage increases scheduled for such employees.
Method for Adjusting Wage Increases
The basis for increasing or decreasing the amount of the increases scheduled for employees working in Areas 1 and 2 during the third, fourth and fifth anniversary years of this Agreement is set forth below:
458132.3
21
Effective from and after May 1,2005, the scheduled increases referred to in Appendix “D” for employees in Areas 1 and 2 shall be subject to modification based on the cost of maintaining insurance benefits as set forth in Section 3 of Article XVIII. Said cost is referred to hereinafter as the “Maintenance of Benefits Costs” or “MOBC”. The Employer and Union have agreed on an anticipated range of the MOBC, and have assigned values to the MOBC which are designated as follows:
The designated amount at the upper range of the MOBC for a contract anniversary year is defined as the “Penalty Break Point”. The value at the lower end of the MOBC range for such anniversary year is designated as the “Incentive Break Point”. Any amounts falling between the Incentive Break Point and the Penalty Break Point in any anniversary year of this Agreement shall not affect the wage increases which become effective at the beginning of such anniversary year. The ranges between the Penalty Break Points and the Incentive Break Points are set forth below:
Areas 1 and 2		
Effective Date		Penalty	 Break Point	Incentive Break Point
May 1, 2005	$644.00	$632.80
May 1, 2006	$701.96	$689.75
May 1,2007	$765.13	$751.83
Commencing with the contract anniversary year which begins on May 1,2005, and for each contract anniversary year thereafter during the term of this Agreement, if the actual MOBC is lower than the Incentive Break Point designated during that anniversary year, then 100% of the difference between the Incentive Break Point and the actual MOBC shall be converted into an increase in wages to be paid to employees in Areas 1 and 2, commencing on May 1 st of the anniversary year in which such incentive payment is payable pursuant to this Section 12. For example, should the MOBC adopted on or before February 2005 be $590 per employee per month, then the following calculation
458132.3
22
would be applied to establish the base wage adjustment which would become effective on May 1,2005 :
$632.80 - $590.00 = $42.80 x 12 months = $513.60 + 2,080 yearly work hours ~ $0,246 per hour.
Effective May 1, 2005, employees in Areas 1 and 2 would, in addition to the increase otherwise provided for them effective on May 1,2005 in Appendix “D”, receive an additional hourly wage increase of 250. Such increase would remain in effect for the balance of such contract anniversary year, unless there is a change in the MOBC during such contract anniversary year which requires a new calculation.
Commencing with the contract anniversary year which begins on May 1, 2005, and for each contract anniversary year thereafter during the term of this Agreement, if the MOBC is higher than the Penalty Break Point designated for such contract anniversary year, then 50% of the difference between the Penalty Break Point and the actual MOBC shall become the amount by which the increase in wages otherwise provided for on such May 1 is reduced. For example, should the MOBC established on May 1, 2005 be $660 per employee per month, then the following calculation would be applied to reduce the wage increase which would otherwise be applicable on May 1, 2005:
$660.00 - $644.00 = $16.00 x 12 months = $192.00
-s- 2,080 yearly work hours “ $0,092 per hour x 50% - $0,046 per hour.
Based on said calculation, any increases which would otherwise become effective on May 1, 2005 for employees working in Areas 1 and 2 would thereafter be reduced by a sum equal to 50 per hour. Such decrease would remain in effect for the balance of such contract anniversary year, unless there is a change in the MOBC during such contract anniversary year which requires a new calculation.
All calculations performed pursuant to this Section 12, whether resulting in increases or decreases in contractual wage increases, shall be carried out to the third decimal point, and shall be rounded up or down to the nearest cent. In no event shall
458132.3
23
such calculations result in a reduction in the Starting Rates or Minimum Wage Rates provided for in Appendix “D” for employees in Areas 1 and 2, or any overscale rates then being received by them.
Section 13.	Resolution of Disputes With Respect to Modifications of Wage Increases.
Commencing in 2005, the Union shall, during the term of this Agreement, provide the Employer with not less than sixty (60) calendar days prior written notice of any adjustments in the increases provided for in Appendix “D” for employees working in Areas 1 and 2 based on the formula set forth in Section 12 above. Any disputes as to the modifications of increases resulting from the application of said formula shall be submitted to expedited binding arbitration pursuant to Article XXIII of this Agreement. In the event that the calculation provided herein is submitted to expedited arbitration pursuant to Article XXIII, neither party shall have the right to invoke paragraph I. of Article XXIII.
