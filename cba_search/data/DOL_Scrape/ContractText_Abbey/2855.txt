ARTICLE XVII	- INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS
Preamble.
It is the policy of the Fire Department of the City of New York to secure for all employees their rights and privileges as citizens in a democratic society, consistent with their duties and obligations as employees of the Fire Department and the City of New York. To further the administration of this policy, the following guidelines are established:
Section 1.
Interrogations, interviews, trials and hearings conducted by duly authorized representatives of the Fire Department shall be conducted during reasonable hours, preferably when an employee is on duty. If an interrogation, interview, or hearing takes place when an employee is not on duty, that employee shall be compensated by cash payment for the time spent, including two hours of travel time, at the rate of time and one-half. If a trial takes place when an employee who is a witness is not on duty, that employee shall be compensated by cash payment for the time spent including two hours of travel time, at the rate of time and one-half. If a trial takes place when an employee who is an accused is not on duty, that employee shall be compensated by cash payment for the time spent, including two hours of travel time, at the rate of straight time, unless the trial was postponed by the accused for that employee’s convenience or for the convenience of that employee’s counsel and/or that employee's union representative, in which case the accused shall receive no compensation.
Section 2.
At the time an employee is notified to appear for interrogation, interview, trial or hearing at Department headquarters, the Fire Department shall advise that employee either in writing, when practicable, or orally to be later confirmed in writing of (1) the specific subject matter of such interrogation, interview, trial or hearing; and (2) whether that employee is a suspect or non-suspect. If notified orally, the employee shall be given a written notice before the interrogation, interview, trial or hearing.
Section 3.
Notice of trial shall be in writing at least ten (10) days in advance of such trial, unless the employee waives such notice or unless that employee applies or has applied for a service retirement.
Section 4,
The employee who is the subject of interrogation, interview, trial or hearing shall be advised of the name, rank, and unit of the officer in charge of the interrogation, interview, trial or hearing and of the name, rank and unit or other identification of all persons present connected with the interrogation, interview or hearing. The questioning of employees shall be of reasonable
2000-2002 Firefighters
21

duration and the employee shall be allowed time for personal needs, meals and necessary telephone calls. Offensive or profane language shall not be used, nor shall the employee be threatened for failure to answer questions nor promised anything if the member does answer questions.
Section 5.
When an employee is a suspect in a departmental investigation or trial, the officer in charge of the investigation shall give the employee the following warning before the member is questioned:
I wish to advise you that you have all the rights and privileges guaranteed by the Laws of the State of New York and the Constitution of this State and the United States, including the right not to be compelled to incriminate yourself. You have the right to an attorney present if you wish. I wish to further advise you that if you refuse to answer any questions relating to the performance of your duties, you will be subject to dismissal from your employment with the City. However, if you do answer questions, neither your answers nor any information or evidence which is gained by reason of such answers can be used against you in any criminal proceeding. You are advised, however, that if you knowingly make any false answers or deceptive statements, you may be subject to criminal prosecution and disciplinary action by reason thereof.
Such employee shall be advised of the right to union representation. When the interrogating officer is advised by the employee that the member desires the aid of counsel and/or a union representative, the interrogation shall be suspended and the employee shall be granted a reasonable time to obtain counsel and/or a union representative, which time shall not be less than twenty-four (24) hours.
If it appears that the investigation may result in a disciplinary proceeding based on the employee’s answer to questions or on the employee’s refusal to answer, a stenographic or electronic record of the questioning of the employee shall be made unless the exigencies of the situation prevent such recording.
In the event that an employee is subject to charges by the Department, any such record shall be made available to the employee or the employee’s representative. The cost of the recording shall be shared equally by the parties.
Section 6.
A.	An employee shall not be questioned by the Fire Department on personal behavior while off-duty and out of uniform except that the Department shall continue to have the right to question an employee about personal behavior while off-duty and out of uniform in the following areas:

To exercise this right, the employee must request such determination at the time when an Official of the Department asks questiohs in an area which is disputed under subdivision A of this section.

If an employee is found not guilty in a disciplinary hearing, the record of the proceedings shall not become part of that employee’s personal record. An employee who is found not guilty shall have the right to examine that employee's personal record in the presence of an official of the Department after written request to the Department to ascertain compliance.

Re: 2000-2002 UFA Agreement
Dear Mr. Cassidy:
All overtime worked shall be paid no later than sixty days after the end of the month in which the overtime is worked. Any errors will be paid within fourteen days of the payday on which the overtime was to have been paid.
040 0 7
ATTACHMENT B
Based upon the July 28, 1978 Report of the Fire Department Medical Practices Review Committee ("Committee") the parties agree as follows:
1.	The underlined portions of the annexed Recommendations of the Committee shall be implemented immediately, and all legal steps and administrative orders and directives necessary for such implementation shall be effectuated forthwith.
2.	To the extent the remaining recommendations require further study, consultations, or contact with other institutions or persons, such actions shall be undertaken as soon as possible, pursued vigorously and the recommendations implemented in accordance with the result of such actions as expeditiously as possible.
3.	The Ongoing Panel recommended by the Committee shall be the original Committee.
(1)	Finding:
The Fire Department Medical Division in general is performing its required functions as prescribed by the Department and has the interest of the health of the members of the Department as its overall objective. Our evidence indicates that many members of the Department are in favor of retaining this service. However, the Committee finds that certain problems exist which need prompt resolution.
Recommendation:
The Fire Department Medical Division should be maintained and specific changes made as recommended below.
(2)	Finding:
Some members of the Department and their Union leadership believe that the Medical Division has acted more as an arm of management’s absence control efforts rather than in the interest of the health and well being of the Firefighters. This negative opinion tends to be based on a series of incidents occurring over a period of time, although it is suggested that it became accentuated in the years just prior to this administration. This negative perception is not directed against all of the medical officers, staff, or practices of the Medical Division, but tends to focus on rather specific recurrent types of incidents.
Recommendation:
It is clear to the Committee that so long as the Medical Division remains part of the
40
04007
Department and is responsible for fitness for duty evaluations, inevitably a conflict of interest will be perceived by some. The leadership of the Department should reinforce the need for concrete actions to reverse the negative perceptions voiced by a number of patients. Patients at all times must be addressed and treated with respect. Inappropriate professional behavior must be effectively dealt with administratively. The Department should give high priority to minimizing this perception by positive and ongoing actions. This report hopefully points to some beginning directions but cannot be the end of a new Departmental effort.
(3)	Finding:
Physicians reporting to fires are sometimes delayed for a variety of reasons. Furthermore, fire calls during the day when the clinic is in session, depletes the clinic’s medical staff. In addition, the areas of medical subspecialization of some of the medical officers appear not to be those urgently required at the scene of a fire.
Recommendations:
(a)	Medical officers on call, particularly during the day time hours, and at times of heavy traffic congestion should not be relied upon for prompt responses to the scene of a fire or to fire houses. Their later response and night time coverage may still be desirable as a back-up resource or during a transition to the arrangements recommended below (b).
(b)	Specific, preselected hospitals, preferably those with relevant tertiary care capabilities, should respond to the fire scene with physician(s); either a senior level resident or attending physician specially trained and oriented in fire injuries. A physician in internal medicine trained in cardiopulmonary problems, smoke inhalation, etc., and/or one trained to deal with trauma such as fractures, sprains, bums, etc., should respond. Consideration should be given to the possible use of the City's MERV ANS, and the Emergency Medical Service should participate in planning this response system.
(c)	If possible, standardized criteria should be developed to assist in more uniform medical evaluation and treatment planning.
(d)	It is desirable that for every tour of duty, at each fire house a trained EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) be on duty. The member should be specifically trained in assisting at the scene of a fire in the emergency treatment and triage of common fire fighter injuries and illnesses.
(4)	Finding:
On occasion Firefighters injured in line of duty have been taken to hospitals not appropriate for the specialty care they require.
41
040 0 7
Recommendation:
Specific pre-selected institutions with appropriate specialized tertiary care resources should be identified and used promptly for particular injuries - (e.g. eye injuries). If a Firefighter is initially brought to another institution and the determination made that a specialty service is required, after stabilization, the member should be promptly moved to the appropriate institution. A list of these specialty services should be made and updated annually. If the Emergency Medical Services can be of assistance in this effort they should be so involved.
(5)	Finding:
On occasion there appears to be undue delay in authorizing or arranging for appropriate specialty consultation for sick or injured Firefighters.
Recommendation:
Procedures and policies should be established to assure prompt referral of any individual for specialty consultation. A relationship should be established with a number of institutions and individuals expert in their fields and capable of in depth evaluation and treatment. Where possible the consultants should be located in each borough.
(6)	Finding:
The medical officers' visits to hospitals is reportedly sporadic and on occasion the patient is disturbed rather than helped.
Recommendation:
A standard procedure should be established and followed with regard to prompt and regular visits to hospitalized Firefighters. The medical officer should, in consultation with the responsible physician, review the medical records and history and make suggestions with regard to the patient’s treatment, discharge or other disposition. If transfer to another facility is deemed necessary, it should be expedited. In the event of a disagreement between the responsible physician and the medical officer, the Firefighters should be advised of this and counseled as to the reason for the medical officer's recommendation. If necessary a third party specialist should be called promptly. In no event should a patient be subjected to harsh physical or mental treatment. Problem cases should be seen by the Chief Medical Officer whenever necessary.
(7)	Finding:
There are certain routine policies and practices of the Medical Division and the Department that appear to be unnecessary and potentially counter-productive.
42
040 0 7
Recommendations:
(a)	There do not seem to be compelling reasons for the medical officers to see Firefighters who have themselves determined that they are sufficiently recovered from an acute short term illness to return to duty. This procedure should be eliminated and replaced by self declaration by the Firefighters with the concurrence of his commanding officer.
(b)	A procedure should be established to avoid frequent visits to clinic for routine check-ups in the case of intermediate term illness or injuries such as fractures or coronaries. An initial evaluation of each case and consultation with the private physician should enable the establishment of a reasonable recovety period. Toward the end of this pre-determined period a re-evaluation, if necessary in person, should be performed. A weekly desk audit of these patients should be formed and appropriate appointments and consultations scheduled. Specialists selected by the Department and located in each borough could be delegated the responsibility to review and recommend duty status in their field of expertise.
(c)	Uniformity requiring that a non-bedded sick or disabled Firefighter remain at home while on sick leave should be discontinued, particularly in instances of illness or injuries with prolonged recuperation periods.
(d)	Surprise visits by physicians for the purpose of determining whether a Firefighter is at home should be discontinued. This "truancy" function is not an appropriate medical responsibility.
(e)	The elimination of physician visits at home for purpose of retum-to-duty status determination should be evaluated in a pilot study to ascertain whether this procedure in fact results in a significantly more rapid return to duty.
(8)	Finding:
The Medical Division’s function in review of health status and duty fitness evaluation is necessary but should not be its sole objective. The Medical Division should also provide services of primary care treatment for minor illnesses as well as certain other evaluation, treatment, rehabilitation and preventative services. These health services, if available, would result in more rapid recovery or actual avoidance of illness, injury or disability both short and long term. They would undoubtedly result in an improved perception of the Department’s Medical Services. In the Committee’s opinion, some of these services will be reimbursable by third party insurance.
Recommendations:
(a)	Minor illness and injuries should be evaluated and treatment initiated by the medical
43
040 07
staff Full-time seven days a week primary care physicians and nurse practitioners or physician assistants, trained and experienced in primary care, should be selectively recruited. The current mix of subspecialists in the Department seems somewhat inappropriate and should be re-evaluated.
(b)	Back ailments and other musculoskeletal problems are of high incidence in the Department. A special group of physicians and support staff (including physio-therapists) should be developed to diagnose, treat and provide rehabilitation programs. This program should be designed in consultation with individuals expert in this area. Appropriate members of the current medical staff may be suitable for assignment to this program but it will require additional expert medical and auxiliary staff. A special site will be required which could be in the clinic building. Establishing this program at another site may be considered, including the possibility of a health care institution based facility. Eventually, depending on workload, additional decentralized sites may be needed.
(c)	A hypertension screening and treatment program should be developed and implemented for members of the Department, in consulting with individuals familiar with such programs. It should be staffed by appropriately trained and experienced physicians and nurse practitioners. This program could initially be situated in the clinic area, and ultimately depending on workload, may be decentralized.
(d)	A cardiac evaluation and rehabilitation program modeled after existing programs should be developed. This program should be made available to members of the Department with cardiac illnesses.
(e)	The physical re-examination program initiated by the Department is a commendable first step towards health maintenance. This program should be expanded to provide complete examinations and appropriate laboratory studies and should be integrated with the programs noted above.
(9)	Finding:
The clinic area is physically uncomfortable and impersonal. Waiting time is often prolonged. For some members, visits to the clinic are made more difficult because of lack of nearby parking.
Recommendations:
(a)	Prompt action should be given towards improving the environmental qualities of the clinic and related facilities. The waiting area should be redesigned to create a more comfortable and warm atmosphere. Some of the modem health institutions can provide suitable models.
44
040 0 7
(b)	Individual scheduled or block scheduled appointments at the clinic should be implemented to avoid prolonged waiting times.
(c)	If possible arrangements should be made to provide parking facilities for Firefighters when they must visit the clinic.
(10)	Finding:
The organization, structure and staff utilization of the Medical Division are not optimal for the Division to accomplish its goals.
< ।
Recommendations:
(a)	Serious consideration should be given to reorganizing the Medical Division consistent with the findings and recommendations of this Committee. The recruitment of an Administrator, preferably a physician, with practical experience in primary ambulatory care should be aggressively pursued. The Committee believes this would assist in the implementation of these recommendations.
(b)	Nurse practitioners and/or physician assistants should be employed to serve in the clinic to assist in the work-up and examination of all patients and the staffing of the programs recommended above. Recruitment of these individuals should focus not only on their professional skills and experience but also on their ability to help create a more positive atmosphere. The current nurse utilization does not appear to provide critically needed services. The maintenance of this staff may not be essential unless they can be effectively integrated into the proposed structure.
(11)	Finding:
There is need for the development of a process by which the quality of medical care provided to the members of the Department can be evaluated on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations:
(a)	A systematic Departmental recording and analysis of patients' complaints should be established to evaluate progress and to permit prompt corrective action. A patient satisfaction questionnaire of the Medical Division's performance should be developed to enable regular measurement of the Medical Division's performance and to assist in making necessary changes. To the degree that expectations and practical realities do not coincide, effective communication and education must be provided.
(b)	An ongoing medical care review panel independent of the Medical Division should be established to assist the Department in monitoring the quality and nature of its medical services.
45
04 0 0 7
This panel, which should be of the nature of a medical advisory board to the Commissioner, will help assist him in evaluating the quality of medical services, recommend changes to improve these services, and help assess their implementation. The panel should meet on a regular basis (at least quarterly), and receive relevant reports and information as to the medical services provided, and make appropriate recommendations to the Commissioner. While it is not within the scope of this Committee's mandate, it is not unreasonable to suggest that some mechanism be established to assist other agencies in the ongoing evaluation of the medical services they provide to their employees.

Dear Mr. Cassidy:
The City and the UFA agree that all fire companies adjacent to police stations shall have access to heating and cooling controls located in police stations or that such companies shall have separate heating and cooling controls. To accomplish this goal, the City agrees to make every effort to resolve this problem by communications with the Police Commissioner and any other relevant City officials to establish procedures and programs for resolving this problem.
The City and the UFA further agree that all fire companies should be provided with adequate ventilation. The Fire Department intends to continue installation of apparatus floor ventilation systems according to the schedule that has been furnished to the Union, to consult and discuss with the Union any problem which might delay the scheduled completion of such installation, and to continue to maintain in good order those ventilation systems which have been or shall be installed.

Dear Mr. Cassidy:
The City and the UFA recognize that pursuant to Administrative Code section 12-127, the City is obligated to pay for the cost of line of duty injury prescription drugs for UFA members. The parties further recognize that a significant number of UFA members have utilized the UFA Health and Welfare Fund to pay for these prescription drugs without reimbursement by the City. The UFA agrees to waive any and all claims for the reimbursement of the cost of line of duty injury prescription drugs.
If the above conforms to your understanding, please execute the signature line below.

TO:	All Officers
FROM:	Chief of Department
RE:	Use of Department Vans	and Spare Chiefs' Cars
In order to clarify existing policies regarding assignments of firefighters to operate Department Vans and Spare Chiefs’ Cars whereby manning is reduced below minimum manning levels your attention is called to the following guidelines set forth in Cases Nos. A-830-79 and A-840-79.
Minimum manning may not be reduced in the following situations:
1.	Messenger Duty
Department Vans and Spare Chiefs’ Cars may not be used for messenger duty between command locations and firehouses when it reduces minimum manning. Nonemergency messages, including Department orders and directives, may not be carried between divisional headquarters and divisional headquarters and command headquarters by Department Vans and Spare Chiefs’ Cars in a manner that reduces minimum manning.
2.	Transportation of Non-Firefighting Equipment
Department Vans and Spare Chiefs’ Cars may not be used to transport nonfirefighting equipment between locations, including firehouses, borough and divisional headquarters and repair shops when it reduces minimum manning and no emergency requires such use.
3.	Transportation of Apparatus and Equipment
Department Vans and Spare Chiefs’ Cars may not be used to transport firefighting apparatus or equipment when it reduces minimum manning and no emergency exists except that firefighting equipment requiring immediate repair or replacement as a result of loss or damage during a tour are not included. Scheduled inspection, maintenance, repair or replacement on a regular basis, particularly when items are accumulated until a number of items are available or until a particular date is reached, is prohibited. Examples of this category are movement of spare apparatus to and from Department shops and accumulation of radios for repair on a regular scheduled basis.
A company that is out of service may use Department Vans and Spare Chiefs’ Cars to obtain spare apparatus. However, the movement of broken down apparatus, the “jockeying” of vehicles from one location to another until the repair shop is capable of receiving those vehicles, and the return of the apparatus from the repair shop in a manner that reduces minimum manning when there is no emergency is not permissible. A company may use Department Vans and Spare Chiefs’ Cars to obtain vital and unique tools essential to firefighting duties which require immediate replacement, e.g., power saws, generators and Hurst tools.
62
4.	Delivery of Department Forms, Records, or Regular Payroll
Delivery of Department records, forms and regular payrolls among command headquarters or to firehouses which reduces minimum manning is prohibited when no emergency exists.
5.	Transportation of Personnel
Department personnel and other persons may not be transported in a manner which reduces minimum manning when no emergency exists.
Routine movement of uniformed personnel for foreseeable or planned reasons, such as interviews, the transportation of firefighters from fires with non-serious injuries, when ambulances should be used, and the transportation of non-departmental personnel such as official visitors (e.g. picked-up at the airport) is not permissible. Emergency transportation of a firefighter who has suffered a serious injury at a fire for treatment even though it reduces minimum manning is permissible, but every effort should be made to transport such a firefighter by ambulance or other emergency vehicle.
Accordingly, all assignments shall be made in accordance with the foregoing.
