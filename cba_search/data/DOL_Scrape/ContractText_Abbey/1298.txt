The Union recognizes that the Association, because of its size and the nature of its membership in the painting and related industries of New York City, Westchester, Putnam, Nassau and Suffolk Counties, is the principal bargaining representative for all employers working in the industries with whom the Union negotiates collective bargaining agreements, and any extensions or renewals thereof.
The Union shall give principal recognition to any successor association to the Association during the life of this Trade Agreement which (i) may be established; (ii) is affiliated with a national association whose members employ union employees only; and (iii) represents employers in the same industries for which the Union negotiates collective bargaining agreements for work performed in the territorial jurisdiction defined in Art.

Art. III. Sec. 8(A) — Effective Dates: Cost of Living wage adjustments shall be made effective at 12 month anniversary date intervals from the effective date of this Agreement until the expiration date of this Agreement.
Art. HI. Sec. 8(B) — Basis for Adjustment: The amount of the cost-of-living adjustment shall be determined and redetermined as provided in (C) below on the basis of the official New York City Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (including single workers) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor (1967-100) and referred to herein as the index.

The percent change shall be compared to. the Index number 12 months prior and the percent change computed minus 6.5% shall be applied to all wage rates on May 1, 2006, on all wage rates in the Schedule A classification of Art.

(f)	Additional Security — In the event the Trustees determine that a Signatory Employer is guilty of violating any provision of this Trade Agreement or in the event the Trustees bring suit against a Signatory Employer to collect unpaid Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions or interest, liquidated damages or fees related thereto, the Signatory Employer shall provide additional security in such form and amount, as the Trustees shall determine. The Trustees may, but are not required to, assess such additional security in an amount no less than the amount of
42 3824/12169-010 NYLIB1/4Wl84vl------------------------------------913732v1
42
the Signatory Employer's potential, existing or future liability to the Trustees. Any additional security required pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited with tire Trustees who are authorized to pay out of such security any sums found by the Trustees to be due for unpaid Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions, liquidated damages, interest, attorneys’ fees, or other costs of collection.
Art. XXII. Sec. 2. - Damages, Interest and Fees.
(a)	Liquidated Damages - Time is of the essence for the payment of Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions. The parties recognize and acknowledge that the regular and prompt payment of Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions by Signatory Employers is essential, and that it would be extremely difficult, if not impractical, to fix the actual expense and damages which will result from a failure of a Signatory Employer to make the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions in full within the time provided, and without becoming delinquent. Therefore, the parties agree that if the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions shall become delinquent, the amount of damage resulting from any such delinquency shall be, by way of liquidated damages, and not as a penalty, a sum equivalent to 10% of the total Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions required pursuant to this Trade Agreement, for each failure to pay in full within the time provided in Art. XX, Sec. 1 (g), for each pay period for which payments are required to be made; unless a lawsuit is commenced to recover such contributions, in which case the liquidated damages shall be 20% of the required contributions. The liquidated damages, so fixed and computed, shall be added to and become a part of the Signatory Employer's required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contribution due to any of the Trustees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Signatory Employer shall be assessed liquidated damages if a delinquency is cured within 29 days from the date from which contributions were due.
(b)	Interest - If the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions of a Signatory Employer
become delinquent, in addition to the amount assessed as liquidated damages, interest shall be added to the obligation of the delinquent Signatory Employer, calculated monthly at the annual rate of the prime rate plus 2.0%, which shall be calculated based upon the sum of all Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions due for the period for which the Signatory Employer is delinquent, starting with the first day of delinquency. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Signatory Employer will be charged interest if a delinquency is cured within 8 days from the date from which contributions were due.
(c)	Attorneys’ Fees and Cost of Collection - If the required Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions become delinquent, in addition to the amount due as liquidated damages and interest as provided for in the preceding subsections (a) and (b), there shall be added to the obligation of the delinquent Signatory Employer, all reasonable expenses incurred by the Trustees in the collection of any delinquency, liquidated damages and interest, including but not limited to (i) reasonable attorneys’ fees; (ii) accountant's fees; (iii) cost of attachment and execution; (iv) bond; (v) receivers; and (vi) court costs.
(d)	All liquidated damages, interest, and any other costs and assessments due and received from a delinquent Signatory Employer shall be paid to and received by the Trustees.

Art. XXII. Sec. 3 —Trust Fund Hearing.
(a)	Signatory Employer Request - Should a Signatory Employer, after an audit held by the Trustees, be subject to an assessment of additional Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions, the Signatory Employer shall be entitled, on request, to a hearing before the Trustees or a properly appointed subcommittee thereof. At such hearing, the Signatory Employer shall be given an opportunity to present all available facts, and shall be subject to open examination thereon, so that the Signatory Employer may establish an actual lower direct labor cost such that a readjustment of the basis for tlie calculation of the Signatory Employer's Fringe Benefit Contributions due to tlie Trustees is warranted. At such hearing, the Trustees shall consider the recommendation of the Funds' auditors and any proof that the Signatory Employer may offer. If the Signatory Employer's right to a readjustment is proven, tlie Trustees shall remit any excess Art. XX Fringe Benefit Contributions to the Signatory Employer. The decision of the Trustees, after such hearing, shall be final and binding.
(b)	Failure to Request Hearing — If, after an audit and a final assessment of further contributions due, the Signatory Employer fails, within twenty (20) days after written notice thereof given by the Trustees, to request in writing a hearing before them as provided in the preceding sub-section (a), the Signatory Employer shall be deemed conclusively to have consented thereto, with no further recourse.
