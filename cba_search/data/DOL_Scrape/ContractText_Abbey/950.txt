Paragraph 3. All other persons, firms, partnerships and corporations, who are not members of the Association, or signatories hereto who engage in work which comes within the trade and territorial jurisdiction of the Union shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

TERRITORIAL SCOPE OF AGREEMENT The area in which this Agreement shall apply shall cover all work in the Counties of Cook, Lake, DuPage, Will, Grundy, Kendall, Kane, McHenry and Boone Counties, Illinois, (certain local unions covering Counties outside Cook and Lake County may have local agreements which differ from this area-specimen agreement. In these cases, local area agreements shall prevail for work performed in the respective areas; however, nothing herein shall limit the geographic jurisdiction of this Agreement to less than the geographic area covered by the Laborers’ District Council of Chicago and Vicinity), or within such other area as the Union may later establish lawful jurisdiction during the period of this Agreement.
Paragraph 2.1 SUBCONTRACTING On work covered by this Agreement, the contractor or subcontractor agrees to see that all subcontractors on work within the Union's jurisdiction on this job site adhere to the wages and fringes contained in this Agreement when the subcontract is let by the contractor or subcontractor.

The Employer shall not be liable for the wages and fringe benefits owed by a subcontractor.
d)	Under Paragraph 2.2, if the subcontractor does not sign an agreement with the Union, then the Employer upon receipt of a written notice from the Union sent by hand, mail or facsimile shall remove the subcontractor within forty-eight (48) hours. Notices received on Friday in any work week shall require the subcontractor to be removed not later than the close of business on the following Monday.

PENSION: Beginning June 1, 2001 the Employer agrees to make a pension contribution of $2.65 per hour for each hour worked by all Employees covered by this Agreement in addition to the wages and welfare payments herein stipulated. This $2.65 per hour shall be paid to the Laborers' Pension Fund or to a designated appointee at the end of each month.
That for the periods June 1, 2002 to May 31,2003; June 1, 2003 to May 31. 2004; June 1, 2004 to May 31, 2005; June 1, 2005 to May 31, 2006; that on May 1 of each year, if able, but not later than June 1, the Union in its sole discretion, shall determine the amount of additional contributions to Welfare and/or Pension and Training to be allocated from the economic package for that year. (See Article V, Paragraph 1)
The Employer agrees to be bound by the Agreements and Declarations of Trust establishing the Laborers’ Pension Fund, as well as any amendments thereto.
The parties agree that the Employer shall make lump sum contributions to employee fringe benefit accounts, administered by the Trustees on behalf of each employee. It is further agreed that such contribution shall be accompanied by a breakdown of payment according to appropriate benefits.
The Trustees of the Welfare Fund and the Trustees of the Pension Fund shall, among other things, have authority to determine the type and amount of benefits to be provided in each of said funds, the eligibility rules governing entitlement to benefits, and whether and to what extent benefits are to be provided for covered Employees.
The failure of the Employer to contribute to the said Welfare or Pension Funds when the same is established, as provided herein, shall for the purposes of the remedies the Union may pursue, be deemed the same as the failure of the Employer to pay wages, and the Union shall be permitted to remove workers whom they represent for non-payment of such contributions, anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding.
A grace period of thirty days (30) shall be granted for Employers to submit reports and contributions as provided. Said reports and contributions not received during this-grace period shall be assessed liquidated damages amounting to ten (10%) percent of the amount of the contributions which are owed. The Employer acknowledges that the liquidated damages shall be used to defer administrative costs arising by said delinquency and acknowledges the costs to be actual and substantial, though difficult to ascertain. However, the Employer acknowledges these costs to be at a minimum of ten (10%) percent, waiving the necessity of any additional proof thereof. In addition, the delinquent contributions shall bear interest at the maximum legal rate of interest per annum from the due date until they are paid.
Further, in the event the Trustees refer the account to legal counsel for collection, the delinquent Employer shall be liable for reasonable attorneys' fees, and for all reasonable costs incurred in the collection process, including court fees, audit fees, etc.
Reasonable attorneys' fees shall mean: All reasonable attorneys' fees in the amounts for which the Trustees become legally bound to pay, including recovery of liquidated damages, interests, audit costs, filing fees, and any other expenses incurred by the Trustees.
The Trustees of the aforementioned Welfare and Pension Funds and the Union shall have the authority to audit the books and records of a participating Employer, either directly or through their authorized representative, whenever such examination is deemed necessary for the purpose of compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, including the obligation to remit Union Dues under Article IV.
Each participating Employer shall make its books and records available to the Trustees for such purpose. In the event the audit discloses that the Employer, during the period of the audit, has underpaid its contributions and/or wages, the Employer shall be liable for the costs of the examination, including but not limited to, audit fees and reasonable attorneys' fees. The Trustees' authority to waive any costs shall be governed by the terms of the Trust Agreement.
Section 415 Excess Benefit Fund. A Section 415 Excess Benefit Fund shall be established for the purpose of providing alternative benefit to any employees of the Employer who become unable to receive the entire amount of the accrued pension benefits to which they would be entitled under one or more of the pension plans sponsored by their Employer because of limitations established by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Employer may be required and directed by the Board of Trustees of the Excess Benefit Fund to contribute a portion of its agreed-upon “pension” contribution to the Section 415 Excess Benefit Fund and shall not increase the Employer’s cost beyond the amount that the Employer is obligated to contribute to the Laborers’ Pension Fund and that the funding of the Section 415 Excess Benefit Fund shall be fully tax deductible to the Employer for Federal Income Tax purposes. The

Employer hereby agrees that the Board of Trustees of any such Section 415 Excess Benefit Fund shall be authorized to determine each year the amount that will be contributed by the Employer and the amount to be credited to the account of any eligible retiree for payment in lieu of accrued benefits that would exceed the limits set by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Paragraph 9. SUPERVISORS: To the extent permissible by the Internal Revenue Service or any Federal Act, and for the purposes of Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Article V of this Agreement only, the bargaining unit shall also include those persons in the employ of an Employer who are supervisors, as defined in the Labor Management Relations Act, as amended; and who at one time were Employee members of the bargaining unit herein on whose behalf contributions were required to be made to the trust funds described in the aforesaid Paragraph 7 and 8 of Article V hereof.
Article VI BONDING TO GUARANTEE WAGE PAYMENTS AND WELFARE AND PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS
Paragraph 1. All Employers shall procure, carry and maintain a surety bond in form and amount satisfactory to the Union, but not less than in the principal sum of $5,000.00, to guarantee payment of wages, Pension and Welfare Trust contributions, during the term of this Agreement.
Paragraph 2. If the Employer employs between seven (7) and ten (10) Laborers the surety bond shall be increased to $15,000.

b.	A test may be administered in the event a supervisor has a reasonable cause to believe that the employee has reported to work under the influence, or is or has been under the influence while on the job; or has violated this drug policy. During the process of establishing reasonable cause for testing, the employee has the right to request his on-site representative to be present;
c.	Testing may be required if an employee is involved in a workplace accident/incident or if there is a workplace injury;
d.	Testing may be required as apart of a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for substance abuse, for up to a one (1) year period.
Each employee will be required to sign a consent and chain of custody form, assuring proper documentation and accuracy. If an employee refuses to sign a consent form authorizing the test, ongoing employment by the company will be terminated.
Drug testing will be conducted by an independent accredited laboratory (National Institute on Drug Abuse and/or College of American Pathology), and may consist of either blood or urine tests, or both as required. Blood tests will be utilized for post accident investigation only.
The company will bear the costs of all testing procedures.
VI.	Rehabilitation and Employee Assistance Program
Employees are encouraged to seek help for a drug or alcohol problem before it deteriorates into a disciplinary matter. If an employee voluntarily notifies supervision that he or she may have a substance abuse problem, the company will assist in locating a suitable employee assistance program for treatment, and will counsel the employee regarding medical benefits available under the company or union health and welfare/insurance program.
If treatment necessitates time &*way from work, the company shall provide for the employee an unpaid leave of absence for purposes of participation in an agreed upon treatment program. An employee who successfully completes a rehabilitation program shall be reinstated to his/her former employment status, if work for which he/she is qualified exists.
Employees returning to work after successfully completing the rehabilitation program will be subject to drug tests without prior notice for a period of one year. A positive test will then result in disciplinary action as previously outlined in this policy and program.
