Dear Sir/Madam:
I am writing to formally request a copy of the current labor agreement between your company, N.C.A, U.B.C.A, P.D.C.A, and W.W.C.C.A (Plasterers) and OPCM. The agreement will be placed in the collective bargaining agreements public file at the U.S. Department of Labor, in Washington, D.C. The collective bargaining agreements public file is a library of union contracts covering 1,000 or more employees
The collective bargaining agreements are now available at www.unionreports.gov along with copies of reports filed by labor organizations, employers, labor relations consultants, and labor organization officers and employees and copies of labor organizations’ constitutions and bylaws. If you do not want your agreement to be viewed by the general public on the website, we can place the agreement in our confidential files.
The latest copy we currently have on file for N.C.A, U.B.C.A, P.D.C.A, and W.W.C.C.A (Plasterers) expired on 06/30/2010. We are requesting a copy of your most recent contract, preferably in an electronic format, if at all possible. Hard copies can be sent to the following:
