2004 DEPARTMENTAL AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT is made as of April 4, 2004, and effective as of April 4, 2004, by and between COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA (hereinafter called the “Union”), and SOUTHWESTERN BELL TELEPHONE, L.P., a Texas limited partnership, SBC ADVANCED SOLUTIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation, SBC DATACOMM, INC., a Delaware corporation, SBC OPERATIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation, SBC SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation, and SBC TELECOM, INC., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter collectively called the “Company” or “Management”). The Union and the Company agree, subject to any applicable provisions of the 2004 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, as follows:
ARTICLE I
RECOGNITION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNIT
Section 1.	The Company hereby continues to recognize the Union as sole collective bargaining agent for those employees of the Company with the job titles and job classifications listed in Appendices A, B, C, D, H. and I, of this Agreement and as subsequently established under Article III of this Agreement, excluding confidential and professional employees, guards, and supervisors as defined in Section 2.(11) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.
Section 2.	Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing the inclusion of any employee or employees not properly includible in the above-described Bargaining Unit, nur shall be construed as a waiver or forbearance on the part of the Union of any right to represent any employee or employees properly includible in such Bargaining Unit as contemplated under the National Labor Relations Act as now or hereafter amended or superseded.
Section 3.	The provisions contained in Articles I through XXVII of this Agreement apply to all Bargaining Unit employees, except as indicated to the contrary.
1
ARTICLE H
CLASSIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES
Section 1.	For the purpose of this Agreement, all employees are classified into one of the classifications as defined in Section 2.
Section 2.
a.	Regular Employees. A regular employee is one who is engaged for the usual activities of the business and whose employment is reasonably expected to continue for longer than eighteen (18) months, although it may be terminated earlier by action on the part of the Company or the employee.
b.	Temporary Employees. A temporary employee is one who is engaged for a specific project or a limited period, with the definite understanding that his or her employment is to terminate upon completion of the project or at the end of the period, and whose employment is expected to continue for more than three (3) consecutive weeks, but not more than eighteen (18) months.
c.	Occasional Employees. , An occasional employee is one who is engaged on a daily basis for a period of not more than three (3) consecutive weeks; or for a cumulative total of not more than thirty (30) days, in any calendar year, regardless of the length of daily or weekly assignments. An occasional employee who actually works or is engaged to work in excess of three (3) consecutive weeks or thirty (30) days in a calendar year shall be reclassified as a regular or a temporary, full-time or part-time employee as appropriate.
Section 3.	Employees who are classified as Regular or Temporary as defined in Section 2. above, will be further classified as either full-time or part-time as defined below:
2
a.	Full-Time. A full-time employee is one who is employed and scheduled to work forty (40) hours (or its equivalent for Operating employees) in a calendar week.
b.	Part-Time. A part-time employee is one who is employed and normally scheduled to work less hours per average month than a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification, and work group working the same normal daily tour.
Note A. The classification of a part-time employee is based on the employee’s “part-time equivalent work week” which shall be initially determined by dividing the employee’s anticipated scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6, rounded to a “part-time equivalent work week” classification of 16.)
Note B. The “part-time equivalent work week” classification of each part-time employee shall be recalculated by the Company no less often than every six (6) months on April 1 and October 1 of each year, based on the actual average number of hours worked per month during the preceding six (6)-month period. The recalculated “part-time equivalent work week” classification shall be placed in effect if it differs by more than plus or minus three (+/-3) hours from the employee’s current “part-time equivalent work week” classification, or if it would change the employee’s current premium payment percentage for the Medical, Dental, and Vision Plans, as described in the “Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Part-Time Employees,” in the 2004 Labor Agreements, paragraph 5., a., b., and c. Any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate shall not be counted in computing the average number of hours worked.
3
ARTICLE III NEW JOB TITLES
Section 1.	Whenever the Company determines it appropriate to create a new job title in the Bargaining Unit or restructure an existing job title, it shall notify the Vice President of the Union in writing. Restructure, for purposes of this Article, shall be limited to those situations in which the restructure of the duties of an existing job title is so significant that the associated job description is no longer representative of the major functions of the restructured job. Such notification shall include the job title, the job description of the duties for such job title, and the initial Wage Schedule for such job title. The initial Wage Schedule shall be classified as temporary.
Section 2.	Following such notice to the Union, the Company may proceed to staff such job title.
Section 3.	The Union shall have the right, within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice from the Company, to initiate negotiations concerning the initial Wage Schedule established as temporary by the Company.
a.	If negotiations are not so initiated within thirty (30) days as outlined in Section 3. above, the temporary designation shall be removed. If negotiations are so initiated, and agreement is reached between the parties within sixty (60) days following the receipt of notice from the Company, the agreed-upon Wage Schedule shall immediately replace the Wage Schedule designated as temporary.
b.	If negotiations are so initiated and the parties are unable to reach agreement within sixty (60) days following receipt of notice from the Company, the issue of an appropriate Wage Schedule shall be subject to a binding mediation process. A mediation conference shall be held
4
as soon as possible following the conclusion of negotiations, but no later than ninety (90) days from receipt of notice from the Company.
(1)	If agreement is reached in the mediation process, the agreed-upon Wage Schedule shall immediately replace the Wage Schedule designated as temporary.
(2)	If no agreement is reached in the mediation process, each party shall submit a final proposed permanent Wage Schedule to the mediator at the conclusion of the mediation conference. The mediator shall determine which of the final submissions is appropriate, taking into account the facts, discussions and arguments presented by the parties during the conference. Pie Wage Schedule designated by the mediator shall immediately replace the Wage Schedule designated as temporaiy.
c.	The mediator used in the mediation process referred to in paragraph b. above, shall be selected by mutual agreement from a list of five (5) mediators compiled by the American Arbitration Association. Such individuals on the list shall possess acknowledged expertise in the area of job evaluation.
Section 4.	The Company agrees to notify in writing the Vice President of the Union of the addition of an Exchange to Appendix F, Exchanges and Job Vacancy Scopes, of the Departmental Agreement when the Company intends to initially locate employees in such Exchange.
Section 5.	The Company agrees to notify in writing the Vice President of the Union of any additions, deletions, or rearrangements to the Job Groups contained in Appendix G of the Departmental Agreement. Following such notice to the Union, the Company may implement the identified modifications to the Job Groups for the purposes of Article XVII,
5
Force Adjustment, application. Within thirty (30) days from receipt of notice from the Company, the Union shall have the right to initiate negotiations with the Vice President-Labor Relations concerning such Job Group modifications.

Note: Time worked less than ten (10) minutes in excess of scheduled tours shall be treated as normal trade time, and the time shall not be accounted for on work reports. This is in recognition of the fact that because of practical considerations or uncontrollable circumstances, employees occasionally will quit work a few minutes before or after the end of their scheduled tour. Such differences in work time shall be “traded out" on days following, in the same week. Trade time must be made up within the calendar week or else paid for as work time.
Trade time applies also to that travel time defined as work time. If employees are returned to a designated place of reporting less than ten (10) minutes after the close of a scheduled tour, such time, defined as work time, may be traded out during that current week. Trade time not traded out during the current week shall be paid for as work time.
It is the general policy of the Company to avoid the necessity of using trade time as far as practicable.

e.	Authorized Holidays. For all employees, either time worked or not worked but excused without loss of pay on an Authorized Holiday observed Monday through Saturday, up to the length of a normal tour, shall be considered as work time for the purpose of determining hours in excess of the number of hours that constitute a normal work week at the basic rate in the calendar week; provided, however, that such treatment shall not apply where the employee is an “absentee” as defined in Article VIII, Section 4., Holidays, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement, or is treated as absent on the Holiday under Article XI, Absences From Duty, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement.
f.	Overtime at Two Times the Basic Hourly Rate. Where an employee, at the Company’s request, works overtime for which the rate of one and one-half (1 72) times the basic hourly rate is otherwise applicable under Section 4., paragraphs a., b., c., and d. preceding, and such overtime worked exceeds nine (9) hours in a calendar week, compensation for such overtime in excess of nine (9) hours in that week shall be paid, instead, at the rate of two (2) times the basic hourly rate.

Normal Work Week, Forty (40) hours consisting of five (5) scheduled tours of eight (8) hours each, or five (5) full-time tours for Operating employees, shall constitute the normal work week; however, if service requirements demand, the forty (40) scheduled hours may be spread over any six (6) days in the calendar week.

13
sions, each of which shall not be less than three (3) hours, nor more chan five (5) hours in length, exclusive of overtime periods. When the nature of the employee’s assignment requires constant attention at the post of duty, the tour is assumed to be divided into two (2) sessions.

c.	Additions to Work Group.

c.	Night Tours. Insofar as possible, night tours will be assigned to those people to whom they are acceptable. If it is necessary to assign to night work people to whom such work is not acceptable, such assignments will be made in inverse order of seniority among those people who are qualified for night work.
Section 6.	Assignment of Nonworking Days. Assignment of nonworking days shall take into account both the service requirements and the preferences of the employees.
Section 7.	Callout Time.
a.	Employees who report for special duty at the Company’s request on a scheduled day off or fifteen (15) minutes or more after release at the completion of
16
their regular scheduled tour, shall be paid at the rate applicable to such work time for a minimum of two (2) hours except that this minimum shall not apply if the special time worked on such duty immediately precedes regular scheduled tours.
b.	If an employee is required to report for special duty at a designated hour and adequate notice is given, the time between notification and the time required to reach the place of reporting for the job shall not be counted as work time unless such notification is given between 12	;
midnight and 5 a.m. If called between midnight and 5	'!
a.m., work time shall be counted from the time called. ‘ i A telephone call to anyone at the employee’s place of J residence shall constitute sufficient notice.
c.	When an employee is called outside of scheduled hours j for immediate special duty involving service emergen-	i
cies, work time shall begin at the time of notification	■
and shall include the necessary travel time going to the job and returning home after release on the job; provided, however, that if the special duty extends into the	,
employee’s next scheduled tour, the time required to re-	,
turn home shall not be so included.
d.	Without changing the provisions of paragraphs a., b. or c. preceding, covering “callouts” for special duty, an employee who is directed by the Company to report for work on a day not scheduled as a work day shall be entitled to perform any work which he or she may be directed to do by the supervisor throughout the hours specified in such direction in each case where such employee reports for duty at the appointed time, weather conditions permit the performance of the work, the physical condition and conduct of the employee permit such employee to satisfactorily perform the work, and a sufficient period of time for adequate rest has elapsed since the employee last worked.
e.	Adequate Rest Paragraph d. preceding, and Article VII, Work Schedules, both provide that the employee shall be entitled to work provided that the physical condition and conduct of the employee permit such employee to satisfactorily perform the work, and a sufficient period of time for adequate rest has elapsed since the employee last worked.
It is not possible to specifically evaluate “a sufficient period of time for adequate rest,” as this is dependent upon the nature of the work being performed, the conditions under which the work is performed, and the employee’s physical condition. In general, under ordinary circumstances, sixteen (16) hours of work may be performed without an intervening period of rest. Normally eight (8) hours should be allowed for adequate rest between such a work period and the next work period.
The following examples illustrate how this clause might reasonably be applied for a normal person under ordinary circumstances:	*
Example 1
An employee works his or her regular tour from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. He or she is needed to cany out emergency work and continues to work, with only meal time intervening, until 12 midnight, at which time the employee is released. A sufficient time for adequate rest would be from 12 midnight until 8 a.m. the next morning. In the same instance, if the employee had continued to work beyond midnight until 3 a.m., then that employee would not be expected to work his or her normal tour from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., but would be permitted to come on duty at 11 a.m. and work the remainder of the tour (with adequate time out for meal) until 5 p.m.
18
Example 2
If an employee who normally works from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m is called out at 4 a.m. and works until 8 a.m., the em ployee will, of course, be expected to work his or her nor mal tour in addition to the period from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.
f.	Standby Duty. An employee required by the Com pany to remain on standby duty on Company premise; during an emergency, as determined by the Company shall be paid until released, at the rate applicable to suet work time.
Section 8.	On Call Duty.
a.	On Call Duty is defined as being assigned to be available for a callout during a designated seven (7) day period.
b.	When management determines the need for a workgroup to have someone on call, management will solicit volunteers to be a part of the on-call pool on a six (6) week basis. Management will assign these qualified volunteers to the on-call schedule. If, at the discretion of the Company, there are insufficient volunteers among the Group 1 Craft employees whose predominant functions comprise the installation/maintenance of PBX equipment and the RMATS technicians, the Company may assign qualified employees to on-call duty by inverse order of seniority. The employee must be available to report for duty as required during the seven (7) day period assigned.
c.	An employee assigned to on-call duty shall be compensated for each week so worked at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the employee’s basic week’s pay. If circumstances prevent the employee from fulfilling on-call responsibilities, the employee must immediately inform
19
the supervisor. Compensation will be adjusted for the time the employee was unable to be on call. Subject to management approval, employees may volunteer for on-call duty for less than seven (7) days. Such employees will be compensated on a pro-rata basis. On-call employees actually called out to work shall be paid at the appropriate rate for all time worked.
Section 9.	Assigned Overtime. For assigned overtime at the end of a tour, the employee must receive two (2) hours notice prior to the end of the tour. Excluding work on an Authorized Holiday, an employee will not be assigned to work overtime, either on a scheduled day or a nonscheduled day, in excess of nine (9) hours in a calendar week during nine (9) months in a calendar year or in excess of twelve (12) hours in a calendar week during three (3) months in a calendar year unless the employee consents to such overtime assignment, with the following exceptions:
a.	in case of emergency — such as an event of national, slate or local importance, fire, explosion, or other catastrophe, severe weather conditions, major cable or equipment failure, or an act of God, etc.;
b.	long-term service difficulties;
c.	the employee involved is the “employee on job”; or
d.	the employee is directed or assigned to work on a day not scheduled as a work day, in which case the employee will remain on duty as required during the hours so directed.
The Company shall specify the months, which need not be contiguous, by Department and location, in which the overtime limitations referred to above shall apply.
20
Section 10.	Relief Periods.
a.	Employees, except for Operating employees, shall be as signed or allowed one (1) fifteen (15)-minute relief pe riod to start not less than one (1) hour from the begin ning or end of each session when working in Company buildings unless unusual conditions develop.
b.	For Operating employees, a fifteen (15)-minute relie period in each session shall be assigned or allowed ii each office.

Such relief period shall bt scheduled by Management.
Section 11.	Extra Payments on Divided Tours, When an employee works both sessions of a divided tour ir which the sessions are separated by three (3) hours or more, the Company will reimburse the employee in the amount ol two (2) dollars per tour for transportation expense.
Section 12.	Additional Payment for Night Work on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve — Appendix D. On Christmas Eve and on New Year’s Eve, in addition to payment at the basic rate and other payments applicable for night work, payment of three (3) dollars shall be made for each assigned tour worked ending after 7 p.m. to 9 p.m., inclusive, and payment of four (4) dollars shall be made for each assigned tour worked ending after 9 p.m.

In certain other forces, a thirty (30)-minute lunch period may be permitted if specifically approved by General Management. [This applies particularly to testroom employees who were formerly on a thirty (30)-minute lunch period schedule.]
No change in lunch hour practice is contemplated for other forces.
When an employee is temporarily assigned to a group observing a different lunch period, the employee will be required to follow the lunch hour practice observed by the group to which he or she is temporarily assigned. In such cases where an employee normally works from 8 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and is temporarily assigned to a group having a one (l)-hour lunch period and working from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., no overtime payment will be involved.

5.	USE OF EMPLOYEE-OWNED AUTOMOBILES
Employee-owned and driven automobiles may be used incident to the Company’s business for the convenience of the employee provided that the employee carries adequate insurance coverage with an approved insurance company, and the necessary authorization is obtained through lines of organization in accordance with the existing instructions.
Information concerning the procedure in obtaining authorization to drive employee-owned automobiles on Company time may be secured through the immediate supervisor.
The extent to which personal cars may be used on Company business must of necessity be determined in the areas, and this statement is not intended as indicating any viewpoint as to whether such usage in any locality should or should not be increased.
The safe operation of non-Company automobiles on Company time by employees is a responsibility of the Company even though the automobiles may be used primarily for the convenience of the employee.

Compensation at the rate of one and one-half (17?) times the basic hourly rate shall be paid to employees for time worked outside of scheduled tours if in excess of eight (8) hours in a day or forty (40) hours worked on scheduled tours (except on an Authorized Holiday for a fulltime employee) in any calendar week (except as may be otherwise required by law).
Note: Time worked less than ten (10) minutes in excess of scheduled tours shall be treated as normal trade time; and the time shall not be accounted for on work reports. This is in recognition of the fact that because of practical considerations or uncontrollable circum-
167
stances, employees occasionally will quit work a few minutes before or after the end of their scheduled tour. Such differences in work time shall be “traded out” on days following, in the same week. Trade time must be made up within the calendar week or else paid for as work time.
Trade time applies also to that travel time defined as work time. If employees are returned to a designated place of reporting less than ten (10) minutes after the close of a scheduled tour, such time, defined as work time, may be traded out during that current week. Trade time not traded out during the current week shall be paid for as work time.
It is the general policy of the Company to avoid the necessity of using trade time as far as practicable.
b.	Authorized Holidays. For all employees, either all scheduled time worked, or time not worked but excused, without loss of pay, up to the length of a normal tour, whichever is greater, on an Authorized Holiday observed Monday through Saturday, shall be considered as work time for the purpose of determining hours in excess of the number of hours that constitute a normal work week at the basic rate in the calendar week; provided, however, that such treatment shall not apply where the employee is an “absentee” as defined in Article Vin, Section 4., Holidays, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement, or is treated as absent on the Holiday under Article XI, Absences From Duty, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement.
c.	Overtime at Two Times the Basic Hourly Rate. Where an employee, at the Company’s request, works overtime for which the rate of one and one-half (I'/z) times the basic hourly rate is otherwise applicable under Section 3., paragraph a., preceding, and such over
168
time worked exceeds nine (9) hours in a calendar week, compensation for such overtime in excess of nine (9) hours in that week shall be paid, instead, at the rate of two (2) times the basic hourly rate.
Section 4.	Night Differentials.
a.	A night differential shall be paid to employees for each scheduled hour, or fraction thereof, worked after 10 p.m. in the amount of ten (10) percent of the employee’s basic hourly rate.
b.	Night Differentials-Company Schools. Night differentials to the extent normally applicable shall be paid to an employee regularly scheduled for night tours, for scheduled tours paid within the first week when assigned by the Company on scheduled day tours in a Company school.
2.	HOURS OF WORK
In lieu of Article VI, Hours of Work, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement, the following terms and conditions apply to Appendix I:
Section 1.	Normal Work Week. Forty (40) hours consisting of five (5) scheduled tours of eight (8) hours each shall constitute the normal work week; however, if service requirements demand, the forty (40) scheduled hours may be spread over any six (6) days in the calendar week. Tours may fall on any days of the week necessary to meet service requirements.
Section 2.	Normal Tour.
a.	A tour for full-time employees shall be considered as consisting of two (2) sessions, each of which shall not be less than three (3) hours, nor more than five (5) hours in length, exclusive of overtime periods. When the na
169
ture of the employee’s assignment requires constant attention at the post of duty, the tour is assumed to be divided into two (2) sessions.
b.	A work day shall be the day on which a tour or session shall start. All time scheduled, assigned, or worked during or contiguous to a tour shall be considered as falling on the day the tour started.
Section 3.
a.	Full-time Tours. Full-time tours of work shall be divided into two (2) sessions.
b.	Part-time Tours. Part-time tours may be assigned. Such tours shall not be less than three (3) hours in length. Subject to employee consent, these tours may be more than eight (8) hours.
c.	Day Tours. A day tour shall be one which falls wholly within the period from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
d.	Night Tours. A night tour shall be one which falls wholly or partially between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Section 4.	Assignment of Nonworking Days. Assignment of nonworking days shall take into account both the service requirements and the preferences of the employees.
Section 5.	Callout Time.
a.	Employees who report for special duty at the Company’s request on a scheduled day off or fifteen (15) minutes or more after release at the completion of their regular scheduled tour, shall be paid at the rate ap
170
plicable to such work time for a minimum of two (2) hours except that this minimum shall not apply if the special time worked on such duty immediately precedes regular scheduled tours.
b.	If an employee is required to report for special duty at a designated hour and adequate notice is given, the time between notification and the time required to reach the place of reporting for the job shall not be counted as work time unless such notification is given between 12 midnight and 5 a.m. If called between midnight and 5 a.m., work time shall be counted from the time called. A telephone call to anyone at the employee’s place of residence shall constitute sufficient notice.
c.	When an employee is called outside of scheduled hours for immediate special duty involving service emergencies, work time shall begin at the time of notification and shall include the necessary travel time going to the •job and returning home after release on the job; provided, however, that if the special duty extends into the employee’s next scheduled tour, the time required to return home shall not be so included.
d.	Without changing the provisions of paragraphs a., b., or c. preceding, covering “callouts” for special duty, an employee who is directed by the Company to report for work on a day not scheduled as a work day shall be entitled to perform any work which he or she may be directed to do by the supervisor throughout the hours specified in such direction in each case where such employee reports for duty at the appointed time, weather conditions permit the performance of the work, the physical condition and conduct of the employee permit such employee to satisfactorily perform the work, and a sufficient period of time for adequate rest has elapsed since the employee last worked.
171
e.	Adequate Rest. Paragraph d. preceding, and Article VII, Work Schedules, both provide that the employee shall be entitled to work provided that the physical condition and conduct of the employee permit such employee to satisfactorily perform the work, and a sufficient period of time for adequate rest has elapsed since the employee last worked.
It is not possible to specifically evaluate “a sufficient period of time for adequate rest," as this is dependent upon the nature of the work being performed, die conditions under which the work is performed, and the employee’s physical condition. In general, under ordinary circumstances, sixteen (16) hours of work may be performed without an intervening period of rest. Normally eight (8) hours should be allowed for adequate rest between such a work period and the next work period.
The following examples illustrate how this clause might reasonably be applied for a normal person under ordinary circumstances:
Example 1
An employee works his or her regular tour from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. He or she is needed to cany out emergency work and continues to work, with only meal time intervening, until 12 midnight, at which time the employee is released. A sufficient time for adequate rest would be from 12 midnight until 8 a.m. the next morning. In the same instance, if the employee had continued to work beyond midnight until 3 a.m., then that employee would not be expected to work his or her normal tour from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., but would be permitted to come on duty at 11 a.m. and work the remainder of the tour (with adequate time out for meal) until 5 p.m.
172
Example 2
If an employee who normally works from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. is called out at 4 a.m. and works until 8 a.m., the employee will, of course, be expected to work his or her normal tour in addition to the period from 4 a.m. tc 8 a.m.
f. Standby Duty. An employee required by the Company to remain on standby duty on Company premises during an emergency, as determined by the Company shall be paid until released, at the rate applicable to suet work time.
Section 6.	Assigned Overtime. Excluding work on ar Authorized Holiday, an employee will not be assigned tc work overtime, either on a scheduled day or a nonschedulec day, in excess of ten (10) hours in a calendar week during seven (7) months in a calendar year or in excess of fifteer (15) hours in a calendar week during five (5) months in ; calendar year unless the employee consents to such overtime assignment, with the following exceptions:
a.	in case of emergency — such as an event of national state, or local importance, fire, explosion, or other ca tastrophe, severe weather conditions, major cable o equipment failure, or an act of God, etc.;
b.	long-term service difficulties;
c.	the employee involved is the “employee on job;” or
d.	the employee is directed or assigned to work on a da; not scheduled as a work day, in which case the employe will remain on duty as required during the hours so di rected.
The Company shall specify the months, which need not b contiguous, by Department and location, in which the over time limitations referred to above shall apply.
17
Section 7.	Relief Periods.
a.	Employees shall be assigned or allowed one (1) fifteen (15)-minute relief period to start not less than one (1) hour from the beginning or end of each session when working in Company buildings unless unusual conditions develop.
b.	Employees shall be assigned or allowed one (1) fifteen (15)-minute relief period during each session of overtime worked which is more than two (2) consecutive hours in excess of an employee’s regularly scheduled tour when working in Company buildings unless unusual conditions develop. Such relief period shall be scheduled by management.
Section 8.	Extra Payments on Divided Tours. When an employee works both sessions of a divided tour in which the sessions are separated by three (3) hours or more, the Company will reimburse the employee in the amount of two (2) dollars per tour for transportation expense.
3.	HOLIDAYS
In lieu of Section 1, Note, of Article VIII, Holidays, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement, the following Note is modified for Appendix I to provide:
Note: Each employee who could complete six (6) months of service within the calendar year shall be eligible for one (1) Designated Holiday and two (2) Floating Holidays. An eligible employee will designate three (3) days in the same calendar year, or prior to April 1 of the following year, other than another Authorized Holiday, for the days to be observed as the employee’s Designated Holiday and Floating Holidays. Unlike other Authorized Holidays, Management cannot require an employee to work on his/her Designated Holiday or Floating Holidays. The Designated
174
Holiday and Floating Holidays may be scheduled in two (2) hour increments.
4.	VACATIONS
Section 8.c.(l) of Article IX, Vacations, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement is modified for Appendix I to allow employees to schedule day-at-a-time vacations in two (2) hour increments.
5.	JOB VACANCY
Section 2.(5) of Article XIII; Job Vacancy, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement is modified for Appendix I to treat a Senior Consultant in the same manner as a Service Representative for time-in-title and location purposes under this Article.
6.	PROMOTIONAL PAY TREATMENT
Section 4. of Article XIV, Promotional Pay Treatment, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement is modified for Appendix I as follows:
Senior Consultant shall be included in Job Category V. Sales and Service Consultant shall be included in Job Category VI. Sales Agent shall be included in Job Category VII.
7.	TEMPORARY WORK IN HIGHER POSITIONS
Section 5. of Article XV, Temporary Work in Higher Positions, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement is modified for Appendix I Contact employees to provide a Relief Differential.
Section 7.a. of Article XV, Temporary Work in Higher Positions, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement is modified for Appendix I to provide:
175
a.

b.	When the Company determines that it is necessary to temporarily upgrade a Contact employee and such upgrade is for more than 30 consecutive calendar days, the following wage treatment shall apply:
For the period of the temporary assignment the selected employee shall be upgraded to the higher job classification with change of title and promotional pay treatment as provided for in Article XIV, Promotional Pay Treatment.
Employees who are temporarily upgraded under this Section shall be returned to their regular classification and rate of pay when Management determines the temporary assignment is no longer required.
8. FORCE ADJUSTMENT
Note 2 in Section 4.a.(2) of Article XVI], Force Adjustment, of the 2004 Departmental Agreement is modified for Appendix I as follows:
(Nothing in this Section 4.a.(2) shall apply to surplus employees who accept an assignment to the Sales Agent title.)

Section 8.	All rights of an employee under a leave of absence granted under this Article shall terminate if the employee resigns his or her employment with the Company or accepts employment with a new or different employer other than the Union, prior to the expiration of the leave.
Section 9.	An employee returning to work during the vacation year at the expiration of a leave of absence under this Article which began on or prior to the first day of the vacation year, will be eligible for such vacation to which his or
190
her term of service entitles the employee for the year during which he or she returns to work, provided that such return to work be before November 1 and provided further that an employee on a leave of absence which began on or prior to the first day of the vacation year taken under the provisions of Section 3. or Section 4. of this Article, or combination thereof, shall not interrupt that absence for the purpose of taking his or her vacation at Company expense.
Section 10.	Nothing herein shall be deemed to affect any leave of absence hereinbefore granted in accordance with the Agreement Covering Leaves of Absence for Union Representatives dated September 1,1944, as amended, or in accordance with the provisions of Article IV of the 1949, 1950, 1951, or 1952 Agreement of General Application or Article VI of the 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956, 1957, 1959, 1960, 1963, 1967, 1968, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, or 2001 Agreement of General Application, or Article VII of the 1971 Agreement of General Application, or Article V of the 1974 Agreement of General Application, and for all purposes each such leave regardless of die date of its issuance or expiration, shall be deemed to have been issued under the provisions of this Article.
ARTICLE VI]
PENSIONS, DISABILITY BENEFITS, AND DEATH BENEFITS
During the term of this Agreement, no change may be made without the consent of the Union in the existing SBC Pension Benefit Plan, Sickness and Accident Disability Benefit Plan, or the SBC Disability Income Plan which would reduce or diminish the benefits or privileges provided thereunder. Any claim that such benefits or privileges have been so diminished or reduced may be presented as a grievance and if not resolved by the parties under their grievance machinery may be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the provisions of Article IV hereof but in any such case any deci-
191
sion or action of the Company shall be controlling unless shown to have been discriminatory or in bad faith and only the question of bad faith or discrimination shall be subject to the grievance procedure or arbitration.
ARTICLE VIU
RESPONSIBLE UNION-COMPANY RELATIONSHIP
The Company and the Union recognize that it is in the best interests of both parties, the employees, and the public that all dealings between them continue to be characterized by mutual responsibility and respect. To ensure that this relationship continues and improves, the Company and the Union and their respective representatives at all levels will apply the terms of this Agreement fairly in accord with its intent and meaning and consistent with the Union’s status as exclusive bargaining representative of all employees in the Bargaining Unit. Each party shall bring to the attention of all employees in the Bargaining Unit, including new hires, their purpose to conduct themselves in a spirit of responsibility and respect and the measures they have agreed upon to ensure adherence to this purpose. Further, during the orientation of new hires, each party will bring to the attention of new employees the relationship between the parties and the Union’s role as the bargaining representative of employees.
ARTICLE IX
NONDISCRIMINATION
In the desire to restate their respective policies, neither the Company nor the Union shall unlawfully discriminate against any employee because of such employee’s race, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin or because he or she is a qualified individual with a disability, a disabled veteran, or a veteran of the Vietnam era.
The Company and the Union further reaffirm their commitment that none of the terms of the collective bargaining 192
agreements shall expressly or in effect unlawfully discriminate against qualified individuals with disabilities as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). For this reason, nothing in the 2004 Departmental Agreement or the 2004 Agreement of General Application shall be applied or interpreted to restrict either party from taking whatever action it deems reasonably necessary to fully comply with the ADA.
ARTICLE X
TECHNOLOGY CHANGE
The Company and the Union recognize that technological changes in equipment, organization, or methods of operation may affect job security, the nature of the work to be performed and the skills necessary to work in the new environment. The parties, therefore, will attempt to diminish or eliminate the detrimental effects of any such technological changes by expanding the role of the Technology Change Committee in an effort to identify Human Resources issues as early in the planning process as possible and recommend solutions to these problems as set forth below.
The purpose of the committee, which will consist of three (3) representatives of both the Union and the Company, is to provide a “core” group of Human Resources leaders where meaningful discussion of major technological clianges (including changes in equipment, organization, or methods of operation) which may affect employees represented by the Union, can take place. To accomplish the goal of developing a skilled work force necessary for the Company to effectively compete in the Twenty-first Century, this “core” group of the Technology Change Committee will meet semiannually and discuss items such as training, testing procedures, deployment of technology and Human Resources trends. This group will also review recommendations from teams with bargaining unit members that may be used to provide input on new technology applications. The second of the semiannual meetings will emphasize reviewing work brought about by new technology that is being performed outside the Bargaining Unit and to
193
consider whether methods and procedures can be developed that would allow some or all of that work to be performed by Bargaining Unit members. In addition, annually the Company will provide a forum for up to an additional four (4) representatives of the Union to participate in a Technology Change Human Resources Planning Conference in which technological and operational changes that will materially affect the Company’s Human Resources needs can be discussed. Unless the Company and the Union mutually agree to a change in date, the semiannual meetings will be held on the second Tuesday of January and the third Tuesday in September and the Human Resources Planning Conference will be held on the second Tuesday in May.
The annual conference will focus on issues such as new organizational structures, new methods of operation, the introduction of new technology and new applications of existing technology that will require a more well-educated, more skilled work force in the future.
The Company further commits to continue the practice of notifying the Union in ad hoc Technology Change implementation meetings of planned major technological changes when firm details are available.
The impact and effect of such changes on the employees shall be appropriate matters for discussion in the meetings. The Company will discuss with the Union:
a.	What steps might be taken to provide continued employment to affected employees:
(1)	in the same locality or other localities in jobs which may be available in occupations covered by the collective bargaining agreements between the parties;
(2)	in other associated companies; and
194
(3)	in other occupations in the Company, not covered by the contract.
b.	The applicability of various Company programs and contract provisions relating to force adjustment plans and procedures, including Voluntary Separation procedures, Reassignment Pay Protection Plan, Severance Payments, retirement, transfer procedures and the like.
c.	The feasibility of die Company providing training for other assignment for the employees affected. (Example: Sponsorship of keyboard skill training on Company time.)
Attendees at the annual Technology Change Human Resources Planning Conference, the “core” group of Technology Change Committee members, or attendees at the Technology Change implementation meetings shall not formulate policy or arrive at binding decisions or agreements, but rather shall be charged with the responsibility to develop facts and recommendations on how future Human Resources needs can be met so that the parties can make well-informed decisions regarding the matters covered by this provision. In connection with any Technology Change meetings under this Article, the employee representative(s) designated by the Union shall suffer no loss in pay for time consumed in, and necessarily consumed in traveling to and from these meetings. In addition, the Company will reimburse employee representatives for the cost of round trip coach airfare, for attending Technology Change meetings. The number of employee representatives reimbursed on this committee shall not exceed the number of employee representatives as of April 5, 1998.
ARTICLE XI
COMMON INTEREST FORUMS
Recognizing that rapid changes are occurring and will continue to occur in the information and telecommunications industries, the parties express their intent that forums of com-
195
mon interest be held at appropriate operational levels in order to promote the principles of a cooperative Union-Management business alliance. Specifically, Common Interest Forums will serve the following purposes:
1.	Establish a business alliance by providing a framework for early communication and discussion between the parties on business developments of mutual interest and concern to the parties and their constituencies, including regulatory and legislative issues.
2.	Discuss and review innovative approaches to equip the Company to maintain historic levels of excellence and success in the face of rapidly increasing competition in both traditional and newly emerging telecommunications markets thereby improving employees’ competitive responsiveness, while protecting and enhancing opportunities for employment security.
3.	Promote Participative Management Employee Involvement (PMEI) at every level of the organization in ways that increase shareowner value and maximize employees’ satisfaction with their jobs’ content and operating environment by:
a.	delegating authority, responsibility, and accountability to meet customers’ needs at the point of contact;
b.	adopting innovative methods of operation which modify traditional workplace relationships; and
c.	increasing Union and employee participation in local workplace decisions.
4.	Improve understanding of and relationships between the parties and thereby avoid unnecessary disputes by cooperatively addressing significant changes and developments in both the Union and Company environments.
196
5.	Provide an opportunity for the Union to discuss various work operations being contracted out and to offer suggestions as to how employees in a particular location might perform this same work in a practical and effective manner which meets the cost and completion time objectives of the business. The Company must consider such suggestions and, as appropriate, the parties may mutually agree that such discussions be continued between designated local Management and Union representatives.
Equal numbers of key Union and Management persons shall constitute the Forum. It is anticipated that Management members of the Forum will include at least one (1) Senior Manager with operations responsibilities and one (1) upperlevel Manager with legislative and/or regulatory responsibilities. Union members of the Forum will include Local Presidents and/or CWA Staff Representatives whose positions within the CWA influence a broad range of responsibilities. Meetings will be convened by the parties at mutually agreeable places and times but no less often than quarterly, unless mutually agreed. Otherwise, the members of the Forum shall determine its composition, structure, agenda, and operation.
It is intended that each Forum support the collective bargaining process, the established contractual dispute resolution procedures, and existing joint Union-Management committees.
ARTICLE XII TRAINING/RETRAINING
In the present environment of fast-paced technological developments and structural changes, the parties recognize the benefits in offering to employees training and retraining programs for personal or career development or in the event their existing jobs are displaced. Accordingly, the Company will continue to offer at Company expense, training and retraining programs to its employees for personal or career devel-
197
opment, and to employees being displaced to qualify for job vacancies as anticipated by the Company. Any employee laid off while participating in one (1) or more courses pursuant to a Program shall be permitted to complete the course at Company expense on the same terms and conditions as had the layoff not occurred.
The personal or career development training and the job displacement retraining programs contemplated by this Article will be generic in nature and separate and distinguished from the current job specific training instruction.
A Training Advisory Board comprised as set forth below will continue to assist and advise in the training efforts encompassed by these programs.
Personal or Career Development Training
Personal or career development training programs will be designed as an educational self-development aid to assist employees in their personal development or preparing themselves for career progression opportunities or job changes within the Company.
Training under such program will be generic in nature as opposed to job specific and will cover technical, sales, clerical, and other fundamental skills.
Any regular employee with at least one (1) year of Net Credited Service will be eligible to participate in such training program under the terms of such program.
Participation by employees in the personal or career development training program will be voluntary, and time spent by employees in such training will be outside scheduled working hours and not paid or considered as time worked for any purpose.
198
Successful completion by an employee of any training or courses offered pursuant to such program will be taken into account by the Company when considering the employee for an upgrade or transfer.
Job Displacement Training
Job displacement training programs will be designed to prepare employees whose jobs are being displaced or whose jobs are being restructured to a wage schedule with a lower maximum wage rate to enhance their ability to qualify for anticipated job vacancies within the Company.
Employees will be informed of potential displacements as soon as possible and, depending on the number of any anticipated job openings, will be offered training, if necessary, which is intended to enable them to qualify for such job openings in the Company.
All regular employees who are notified of potential displacement of their current jobs or restructuring to a lower rate will be eligible to participate in such training program regardless of length of service.
Participation by employees in the job displacement training program will be voluntary, and time spent by employees in such training will be outside scheduled working hours and not paid or considered as time worked for any purpose unless the Company determines it appropriate in specific instances to permit the employees to receive such training during working hours.
Training Advisory Board
The Training Advisory Board will consist of three (3) Union representatives and three (3) Management representatives (one of whom will be the person in the Company responsible for training) who will meet periodically and have responsibility for:
199
a.	furnishing advice to the Company on personal or career development and job displacement training courses and curricula;
b.	reviewing and making recommendations regarding training delivery systems (e.g., technical schools, community colleges, home study programs, etc.) available to be used by the Company;
c.	evaluating the effectiveness of such training programs and courses and the delivery systems utilized; and
d.	encouraging employees to participate in and successfully complete the available training courses.
The Union and the Company will each be responsible for the respective costs and expenses of their representatives’ participation on the Training Advisory Board and will share equally in the joint costs and expenses incurred by the Board; however, the Company will reimburse employee members for the cost of round trip coach airfare, for attending Training Advisory Board meetings. The number of employee members reimbursed on this Board shall not exceed the number of employee members as of April 5, 1998. However, the employee representative(s) involved in Training Advisory Board meetings shall suffer no loss in pay for time consumed in, and necessarily consumed in traveling to and from these meetings.
Nothing in this program will supersede any applicable promotion or transfer provisions of this contract.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
PART-TIME EMPLOYEES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,1981
A part-time employee is one who is employed and normally scheduled to work less hours per average month than a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification, and work group working the same normal daily tour.
CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF PART-TIME EMPLOYEES
1.	Except for payment for overtime hours worked, all hours worked by a part-time employee in PhoneCenter Stores, Customer Service Centers, Phone Booths (Kiosks), DM/DR (Direct Marketing/Direct Response) Centers and any equivalent retail sales or service center operation, and any employee who is transferred to or employed by any new unregulated subsidiary or affiliated entity in the Bell System shall be paid at the equivalent basic hourly rate for a comparable full-time employee working a normal daily tour in the same job title, classification, and work group. Payment to a part-time employee for hours worked in excess of an equivalent normal daily tour or work week for a comparable full-time employee shall be at the applicable overtime rate for a comparable fulltime employee based on such part-time employee’s basic hourly rate. Any regular employee who is on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, and who works part-time on or after January 1, 1981, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to be paid on the same basis as was applicable to such a part-time employee on December 31, 1980.
2.	The classification of a part-time employee is based on the employee’s “part-time equivalent work week’’ which shall be
202
initially determined by dividing the employee’s anticipated scheduled hours per month by 4.35 and rounding the result to the next higher whole number. (Illustration: 68 hours per month divided by 4.35 equals 15.6, rounded to a “part-time equivalent work week” classification of 16.)
3.	The “part-time equivalent work week” classification of each part-time employee shall be recalculated by the Company no less often than every six (6) months on April 1 and October 1 of each year, based on the actual average number of hours worked per mopth during the preceding six (6)-month period. The recalculated “part-time equivalent work week” classification, shall be placed in effect if it differs by more than plus or minus three (+/-3) hours from the employee’s current “part-time equivalent work week” classification, or if it would change the employee’s current premium payment percentage for the Medical, Dental and Vision Plans, as described in paragraph 5., a., b., and c. below. Any hours worked which are paid at the overtime rate shall not be counted in computing the average number of hours worked.
4.	For employees, who are hired on or after January 1, 1981, and who work as regular part-time employees, payments to a regular part-time employee for sickness disability, accident disability, or death benefits under the “Pension Benefit Plan or the Disability Income Plan,” vacations, holidays, anticipated disability leave, sickness absence (not under the “Disability Income Plan"), or termination allowance (or its equivalent) shall be prorated based on the relationship of the individual part-time employee’s “part-time equivalent work week” to the normal work week of a comparable full-time employee in the same job title, classification, and work group. A part-time employee shall not be paid for time not worked on a holiday or for absence due to sickness (not under the “Disability Income Plan”) unless such holiday or absence due to sickness occurs on a day of the week on which the employee is normally scheduled to work. Regular employees
203
who are on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, and who work pan-time on or after January 1, 1981, shall thereafter continue, during the current term of employment, to receive payments for the benefits and other items listed above on the same basis as was applicable to a part-time employee on December 31, 1980.
5.	Employees who are hired on or after January 1,1981, and who work as part-time employees shall, if otherwise eligible to participate under the terms of such plans, be eligible for coverage under the Medical Plan., Dental Plan, and Vision Plan, as follows:
a.	Employees whose part-time equivalent work week classification is sixteen (16) or less shall be eligible by enrollment and payment of one hundred (100) percent of the premiums for such coverage.
b.	Employees whose part-time equivalent work week classification is seventeen (17) through twenty-four (24) shall be eligible by enrollment and payment of fifty (50) percent of the premiums for such coverage.
c.	Employees whose part-time equivalent work week classification is twenty-five (25) or more shall be eligible for such coverage on the same basis as a regular full-time employee.
d.	Regular employees who are on the active payroll of the Company as of December 31, 1980, shall continue to be eligible for such coverage on the same basis as a regular full-time employee regardless of classification.
6.	Effective January 1,1981, part-time employees regardless of classification, shall be eligible for Excused Work Days on a pro rata basis based upon the ratio of any such part-time employee’s equivalent work week to the normal work week of a comparable full-time employee.
204
7.	This Memorandum is the result of national bargaining and expresses the general principles governing the treatment of part-time employees. These principles are incorporated, as appropriate, in the various Agreements between Southwestern Bell Telephone, L.P., SBC Advanced Solutions, Inc., SBC DataComm, Inc., SBC Operations, Inc., SBC Services, Inc., and SBC Telecom, Inc. and the CWA and will expire or be changed through future amendments to those particular Agreements.
For the Union: Andy Milburn Vice President District 6
For the Company: Mike Smith Vice President-Labor Relations
205
MOTOR VEHICLE USAGE PROGRAM
1.	There will be established a Motor Vehicle Usage Program to provide, in those administrative work units where implemented, that employees who participate will be assigned a motor vehicle for use in their work and for traveling between their work locations and places of residence or other designated places for the vehicle storage.
2.	The Motor Vehicle Usage Program will be implemented only within administrative work units where some or all of the employees normally use a Company-provided motor vehicle in order to perform their work. The decision to implement and to continue the program within any such administrative work unit will be within Management’s discretion.
3.	When the Motor Vehicle Usage Program is introduced within an administrative work unit, all employees within that unit who normally use a Company-provided motor vehicle in the performance of their work assignment will be eligible to participate. Participation by any such employees will be on a voluntary basis. If an employee elects not to participate, Management will determine where the motor vehicle assigned to that employee is to be stored and that location will become the employee’s work reporting location.
4.	Employees who participate in the program will be expected to provide normally secure and legal storage for the vehicle at their places of residence. If the vehicle cannot be properly stored at an employee’s place of residence, the Company may arrange for appropriate storage at its expense.
5.	Operating and maintenance costs will be at the Company’s expense. The Company will make arrangements for maintenance of the vehicle; however, it will be the responsibility of the employee to whom the vehicle is assigned to assure that the vehicle is properly maintained.
206
6.	For employees who participate in the Motor Vehicle Usage Program, a work reporting area will be established on a local basis before implementation. Such work reporting area will be designed so as to serve the interests of the customer, reasonably accommodate the employee, and be satisfactory to Management and the Union. The work reporting area normally will be a circular geographic area. In large congested metropolitan locations or where natural barriers render a circular work reporting area impractical, other suitable parameters will be established.
7.	Each participating employee will be expected to begin and end the work tour at any assigned location within the established work reporting area. Prior to implementation of the Program, the Company and Union will determine a method of compensation for employees who begin or end a work tour outside an established work reporting area.
207

Statement of Renewed Commitment to the Principles of Cooperative Union-Management Relations
The Company and the Union recognize that significant benefits have been derived and will continue to derive from cooperative Union-Management relations. Through such cooperation, the parties have been able to explore innovative methods of operation which seek to modify traditional workplace relationships in ways designed to enhance the Company’s effectiveness and competitiveness, increase Union and employee participation in local workplace decisions, and maximize employees’ satisfaction with their work.
The parties also recognize that the 1996 Telecommunications Act and associated legislation changed the market place from heavily regulated to highly competitive. Therefore, achieving mutual goals of competitive excellence and employment security in this new environment will present ever-increasing challenges.
In light of these challenges, the parties realize that the need for effective and mutually respectful cooperation between the Union and Management at all levels of the business is more important now than ever before. Therefore, the Company and the Union hereby renew and strengthen their commitment to the following Principles of Cooperative Union-Management Relations:
1. Participative Management Employee Involvement (PMEI) is based on the tenet that employees are responsible, trustworthy and capable of making contributions when equipped with the necessary business information and train
222
ing. In this regard, the Company and the Union will promott strategies designed to:
•	educate employees and all levels of Union and Manage ment leadership to promote PMEI efforts and incrcast understanding of the link between PMEI and improve ment in both bottom-line results and job satisfaction; ant
•	provide access to relevant business information to im prove employees’ level of competitive responsivenes; and their ability to make well-informed, customer-fo cused decisions.
2.	The principles of PMEI require engaging employees ant Company and Union leadership at all levels in meaningfu opportunities for participation in and contribution to business decisions that affect their work. The parties will promote the goals of increasing shareowner value and enriching jobs by actively soliciting employees’ input and by recognizing theii contributions to these objectives.
3.	The Company and the Union agree to uphold and promote PMEI principles and to encourage and support implementation of PMEI processes in a consistent and effective manner at every level of their respective organizations. The parties recognize that effectiveness and productivity can and will be enhanced by delegating authority, responsibility, and accountability to employees closer to the actual work process, resulting in greater pride and satisfaction with the work as well as increased personal growth.
4.	The PMEI Companywide Steering Committee will continue to guide, support, and promote PMEI efforts to increase shareowner value and enrich jobs. The Steering Committee will also serve as a forum to explore and exchange innovative ideas and successful applications of PMEI concepts using both internal and external sources. The Company wide Steering Committee, with input from operations Steering
223
Committees, will continue to plan, evaluate, and introduce training and developmental programs to facilitate and enhance PMEI efforts.
5,	PMEI efforts will continue to be viewed as a supplement to the collective bargaining process. The integrity of the collective bargaining process, the contractual rights of the parties, and the workings of the grievance procedure must be upheld and maintained.
6.	Process improvement is based on the belief that improved quality leads to improved productivity, decreased costs, and increased market share, all of which allow the Company to provide more jobs and increase shareowner value. The Company and the Union recognize that a continuous quality improvement process is in their mutual best interest, and that a PMEI approach should be used to gain commitment to and support of such improvements. For example, the principles of PMEI can be applied from the beginning of, and throughout, implementation of the process improvement methodology, thus becoming the key link in obtaining input from bargaining unit employees for use in improving the business operations in which they are involved. The Company will encourage all levels of Management to utilize a participative approach in forming process improvement committees when involvement of bargaining unit employees is desired.
7.	Employment security will continue to be a major concern of the Company and the Union. Innovations which result from the PMEI processes will not result directly in the layoff of any regular employee or negatively affect the pay or seniority status of any Union-eligible employee, whether or not he or she is a participant in the process. In addition, process improvement committees on which bargaining unit employees serve will not undertake activities or make recommendations that could be expected to result directly in the layoff of any regular employee or negatively affect the pay
224
or seniority status of any Union-eligible employee, whethe or not he or she is a participant in the process.
8.	The parties recognize that genuine involvement by Man agement, the Union and all employees is essential for the sue cess of these mutual efforts. The parties agree, therefore, l encourage all levels of their respective organizations to co operate in the design, development, and implementation o PMEI efforts that foster a business alliance in the spirit c mutuality and responsible leadership. PMEI remains a pro cess; there is no universal or one best approach.
