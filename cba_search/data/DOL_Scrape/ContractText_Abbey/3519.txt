The Employer agrees that it will make such assignments for not less than an employee's full work day. Such payment shall be made on the next regular payday or as soon thereafter as is possible, but in no event later than the pay period following the pay period in which the payment was earned.
The time limits for such individual assignments to higherrated jobs shall be ninety (90) days, except where a regular incumbent is on leave of absence, in which case the time limit shall be six (6) months. The time limits may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. To the extent the Employer continues to require the performance of the duties of the higher-rated job beyond the time limits set forth herein, the assignment shall be treated as a "permanent vacancy" within the meaning of Section 14.8 of this Agreement, and shall be subject to the applicable provisions of that Section.
9
356615.1
Section 4.8	Payment of Wages
(a)	All regular base wages will be paid to employees not later than the next regular pay day following the end of the payroll period in which it is earned. All overtime or premium pay shall be paid to employees not later than the second regular pay day following the end of the payroll period in which it is earned. In the event of an arbitration involving a dispute arising solely under this Section, the losing party will pay the entire amount of the arbitrator's fee.
(b)	In the event an employee's pay check, at the time specified in paragraph (a) above, fails to include all of the regular base, overtime and/or premium pay to which he/she is entitled, the Department will correct that shortage provided the employee promptly notifies the Department's timekeeper in writing. Employees shall submit a payroll dispute to the Department timekeeper on the "Employee Payroll Inquiry Form" attached hereto as Appendix B. The employee's submission of such Form shall toll the period for processing a grievance filed by the employee or Union over such dispute. If the Department concludes that there is a shortage in the employee's paycheck, and if the amount in question exceeds $100.00, the Department will submit a supplemental payroll to the Comptroller to cover the shortage, and will issue the employee a check in that amount on the next scheduled check/deposit advice delivery date after the timekeeper is notified of the employee's
10
356615.1
complaint. Shortages less than $100.00 will be added to the employee's next regular pay check.
(c)	Should an employee not receive this supplemental check (for a sum greater than $100.00) within the aforementioned check/deposit advice delivery date period, the Employer will pay to the employee the sum of $5.00 for every pay period thereafter until the full supplemental check is received.
(d)	It is understood that pay shortages relating to newly-hired employees, persons returning from leaves of absence (including but not limited to duty disability), overtime earned under the City's emergency snow removal program, and inaccuracies due to changes in payroll deductions, are excluded from the provisions of this Section. Chis paragraph does not supersede any other payment obligations with respect to the payments referred to in this paragraph which may be contained elsewhere in this Agreement.
(e)	In order to provide a basis for ongoing discussion concerning the City's payroll practices, the parties will form a Labor Management Committee consisting of four (4) persons appointed respectively by the City and by the Coalition. The City's members of the Committee will consist of representatives from the Department of Personnel, the Office of Budget and Management, the Comptroller and the Director of Labor Relations. The Coalition, as it shall determine, shall select four (4) representatives to serve as members of the Committee. The
11
356615.1
Committee will meet not less than quarterly, or more frequently as the need may arise, to review ongoing issues regarding payroll, compliance with this Section, or other issues of mutual concern which may arise during the life of the parties' Agreement. In addition, at the request of the Coalition, the City may include from time-to-time a representative of the Coalition at the Comptroller's weekly staff meetings with Department heads to review and address pending payroll inquiries from bargaining unit employees.
ARTICLE 5 HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 5.1	The Work Week
This Article shall be to calculate overtime and shall not be a guarantee of work or hours for any day or week.
The normal work week shall consist of five (5) consecutive 8-hour days Monday through Friday and two (2) consecutive days off, except where the Employer's operations require different scheduling needs. The Employer will notify the Union of these exceptions.
The work week shall be a regular recurring seven (7) day period beginning at 12:00 midnight (one minute after 11:59 p.m. Saturday) Sunday and ending at 12:00 midnight the following Sunday. The start times of employees currently vary between the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m., 4:00 p.m. and midnight as determined by the Employer. The Employer may change the currently established time of its normal work day or work week for a department, bureau, work unit, crew or individual upon
12
356615.1
fourteen (14) days written notice to, and upon request, discussion with the Union. Said changes in starting times shall not be scheduled more than two (2) hours before the regular starting times currently in effect in this Agreement. All such changes, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, shall be in effect for a minimum of one (1) week, and shall provide for the same starting times each day of that period. No employee shall be placed on a split shift without agreement by the Union. Failure of the Employer to comply with this provision shall result in the payment of appropriate premium time to affected employees.
It is the intention of the parties that the Union have meaningful input concerning any such changes and no changes shall be made by the Employer for arbitrary or capricious reasons.
Section 5.2	Overtime
All work performed after eight (8) hours worked in any 24 hour period; or on Saturday as such when Saturday is not part of the employee's regular work week, or on the sixth consecutive day worked, shall be paid for at one and one-half (1-1/2) times the regular straight time hourly rate of pay, provided the employee completes the normal work week or is absent with the Employer's permission. All work performed on Sunday as such when Sunday is not part of the employee's regular work week, or on the seventh consecutive day worked, shall be paid for at two (2) times the regular straight time hourly rate of pay, provided the employee completes the normal work week or is absent with
13
356615.1
the Employer'’s permission. Such overtime shall be computed on the basis of completed fifteen minute segments. Employees exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act shall not be eligible for overtime under this Section. There shall be no pyramiding of overtime and/or premium pay. Daily and/or weekly overtime and/or premium pay shall not be paid for the same hours worked. All overtime shall be paid in the next regular paycheck.
Section 5.3	Overtime Distribution
(a)	Overtime and/or premium time referred to in this Agreement shall be offered first to the employee performing the job and thereafter by seniority to the most senior employee in the classification at the work location being given the opportunity to work, provided the employee has the present ability to perform the work to the satisfaction of the Employer without further training.
A reasonable amount of overtime shall be a condition of continued employment, provided however, that in the event such offers of overtime are not accepted by such employees, the Employer may mandatorily assign such overtime by reverse seniority.
(b)	Employees in the classification at the work location who have been given the option to work the overtime and/or premium time, whether the option was accepted or rejected, will not be afforded the option to work subsequent overtime and/or premium time until all employees in the classification at the work location have been reasonably afforded the opportunity to
14
356615.1
work the overtime and/or premium time, subject to the same provision as in Section 5.3(a).
Section 5.4	Reporting Pay
When an employee reports for his or her regularly scheduled shift, the employee shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours work or pay at the employee's regular straight time hourly rate, unless the employee was told at least three hours prior to his or her normal starting time not to report for work, except for reasons beyond the Employer's control. To be eligible for pay under this provision, employees must advise the designated person within the Department of his or her current telephone number.
If the employee works more than two (2) hours, he or she shall receive a minimum of four 4) hours work or pay for that day. If the employee works more than four (4) hours, he or she shall be guaranteed eight (8) hours work or pay for that day. An employee who does not complete a normal eight (8) hour shift because he or she is sent home by the Employer shall have the option of using a portion of accrued vacation, personal or compensatory time for that day upon notice to the Employer. Section 5.5 Call-In Pay
Except as otherwise agreed in writing, employees called in outside of their regular working hours shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours pay at the appropriate overtime rate from the time that they arrive at their workplace.
The term "call-in pay" as used in this Section shall refer to an employee being brought back to work outside of his/her
15
356615.1
!	- i
normal work day, and shall not refer to any situation where the employee is brought into work or required to stay at work during periods which are contiguous to his/her regularly scheduled shift.
Section 5.6	Emergency Call Pay

Section 7,2	Pro Rata Vacation
An employee shall be eligible for pro rate vacation if:

2.	The employee was separated from employment, other than for cause, during a calendar year in which the employee did not have twelve (12) months of continuous service.
20
356615.1

Any fraction is rounded off to the nearest whole number of days. Employees separated from employment, other than for cause, will be paid on a supplemental payroll as soon as practicable following the last day worked.
Part-time employees who work at least 80 hours per month earn vacation on a pro rate basis calculated in accordance with the formula used by the Employer in accordance with past practice.
Section 7.3	Forfeiture

In the event of the death of an eligible employee, the surviving widow, widower or estate shall be entitled to any vacation pay to which the deceased employee was entitled.

Any such cancellation of the vacation pick shall result in the payment of the vacation pay (thereby reducing the total of the employee's accrued vacation time) plus payment to the employee of the appropriate pay rate for all hours worked as if it were a normal work day, or for a normal
23
356615.1
work day, whichever is greater, unless the employee voluntarily agrees to reschedule the vacation days lost.
Cancellation of approved vacation requests which would result in serious provable financial loss to an employee shall occur only in the most extreme emergencies. In the event of such cancellation, the Employer will reimburse the employee for reasonable losses incurred as a direct result of the cancellation, (e.g., cost of rescheduling airline tickets, deposit forfeitures, and the like).

Employees may receive up to five of their vacation days one or more day(s) at a time as days off in each year. Such days off shall be scheduled pursuant to Section 7.6 above. Such day(s) off shall be approved by the employee's supervisor and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the employee seeks such days so late in the vacation year that the employee's supervisor cannot reasonably grant the employee's request, such days shall be scheduled by the Employer prior to the year-end.
Employees may designate and use at their option up to five (5) of their vacation days in each year of this Agreement as sick days to cover periods of bonafide medical illness.

If the employee appeals the discharge, the Personnel Board shall be requested to set a hearing date within the 30 day notice period, and the employee shall remain on the payroll for the full notice period, except if prior to completion of the 30 day notice period (1) the Hearing Officer affirms the discharge; or (2) the employee continues the discharge hearing; or (3) the employee withdraws his/her appeal or otherwise engages in conduct which delays the completion of the hearing. However, no event may the employee require the Employer to retain the employee on the payroll beyond the 30 day period. The Union
43
356615.1
shall have the right to have its representative present at either of the Board(s) or grievance procedure, including arbitration, and to actively participate.
(c)	The Employer within its discretion may determine whether disciplinary action should be an oral warning, written reprimand, suspension or discharge, depending upon various factors, such as, but not limited to, the severity of the offense or the employee's prior record. Such discipline shall be administered as soon as practical after the Employer has had a reasonable opportunity to fully investigate the matter and conduct a meeting with the Union and employee. The Employer is not obligated to meet with the employee and Union prior to taking disciplinary action where the employee is unavailable or emergency situations.
Demotions shall not be used as a part of discipline. Transfer shall not be part of an employee's discipline.
In cases of oral warnings, the supervisor shall inform the employee that she/he is receiving an oral warning and the reasons therefore. For discipline other than oral warnings, the employee's immediate supervisor shall meet with the employee and notify him/her of the accusations against the employee and give the employee an opportunity to answer said accusations. Specifically, the supervisor shall tell the employee the names of witnesses, if any, and make available copies of pertinent documents the employee or Union is legally entitled to receive, to the extent then known and available. Employer's failure to satisfy this Section 11.1 shall not in and of itself result in a
44
356615.1
reversal of the Employer's disciplinary action or cause the Employer to pay back to the employee.
In the event disciplinary action is taken, the employee and the Union shall be given, in writing, a statement of the reasons therefore. The employee shall initial a copy, noting receipt only, which shall be placed in the employee's file. The employee shall have the right to make a response in writing which shall become part of the employee's file.
Any record of discipline may be retained for a period of time not to exceed eighteen (18) months and shall thereafter not be used as the basis of any further disciplinary action, unless a pattern of sustained infraction exists. A pattern shall be defined as at least two substantially similar offenses during said 18-month period. If an employee successfully appeals a disciplinary action, his/her file shall so record that fact. If the appeal fully exonerates the employee, the Employer shall not use said record of the discipline action against the employee, or in the case of promotions or transfers.
In any disciplinary investigation of a non-egregious offense conducted by the investigative staff of the Office of Budget and Management, the Employer shall notify the employee who is the subject of the disciplinary investigation of the pendency of the investigation and its subject matter, within 30 days of the Employer being made aware of the alleged rule violation. For the purposes of this Section, the term "non-egregious offense" shall not include indictable criminal offenses, gross insubordination, residency issues, or drug and
45
356615.1
alcohol violations. Thereafter, the employee shall be granted a predisciplinary hearing if requested within thirty (30) days. Any discipline given in violation of this notice provision shall be null and void.
In the event that a discharged employee appeals an adverse decision of the Personnel or Police Board to the Circuit Court of Cook County, or thereafter to the Appellate Court of Illinois, and the decision of the Personnel or Police board is reversed or remanded resulting in restoration of the job, the Employer will pay the employee's reasonable attorney's fees which he or she has incurred in connection with the court proceeding, excluding fees incurred before the Personnel or Police Board. The employee shall submit a post-appeal fee petition to the Employer, which shall be supported by full documentation of the work performed, the hours expended, and the rates paid by the employee. Should the parties be unable to agree on the proper amount of the fees to be paid to the employee, either party may refer the dispute to arbitration under the relevant provisions of this agreement.
Section 11.2	Procedure For Department Review of Disciplinary Action Including Suspension
Step 1. Within five (5) working days after an employee receives written notice of proposed disciplinary action, including a suspension for ten (10) days or less which is not appealable to the Personnel or Police Board, or in the case of suspensions of 11 or more days which may be appealed to arbitration in lieu of the Police or Personnel
46
356615.1
Board upon the written request of the Union, the Employer shall conduct a meeting with the Union and employee. Discipline shall be administered as soon as possible after the employer has had a reasonable opportunity to further investigate the matter as appropriate. If disciplinary action is taken after the meeting or further investigation, the employee may request in writing to the department head for review of said disciplinary action on a form provided by the Employer. Said request for review shall be in writing and submitted within three (3) working days or receipt of written notice of discipline. Said review form shall be printed on the back of or attached to the notice or discipline together with instructions for appeal. The failure to submit a written request for review of disciplinary action within (3) working days of receipt of notice of disciplinary action will preclude the employee's right to review.
Step 2, Within three (3) working days or any mutually agreed upon extension after the department head or his/her designee receives the employee's request for review, the department head or designee shall conduct a meeting to review the suspension. Failure to conduct said meeting in three (3) days will result in automatic advancement to Step III and the Union shall so notify the Employer. At the meeting, the Department will give the basis for its action and the employee and Union representative, if any, will be heard and provided the opportunity to ask questions. The
47
356615.1
department head or designee shall render a written decision within two (2) working days of the meeting, except where both parties agree a further investigation is required. The absence of such agreement or failure to decide and communicate such decision will result in automatic advancement to Step 4 and the Union shall so notify the Employer. A copy of such decision shall be sent to the employee and the Union.
Step 3. Where further investigation is agreed upon, a second meeting shall be held between the department head or designee and the employee and/or his/her Union representative to discuss the results of the investigation. Said meeting shall be conducted within five (5) working days of the close of the Step 2 meeting, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. The department head or designee shall render a written decision within two (2) working days of the second meeting. A copy of such decision shall be sent to the employee and the Union. If the parties fail to meet within five (5) working days or a written decision is not submitted within two (2) working days, the appeal shall automatically proceed to Step 4 and the Union shall so notify the Employer. Except where otherwise indicated, the time limits set forth herein are to encourage the prompt reviews of said disciplinary action and failure to comply with these time limits will not affect the validity of the said disciplinary action. This procedure shall be the employee's exclusive remedy for all said disciplinary
48
356615.1
action, including suspension for ten (10) days or less, or for suspensions of 11 days through 30 days which may be appealed to arbitration in lieu of the Personnel or Police Board upon the written request of the Union.
Step 4. If the matter is not settled in Steps 2 or 3, the Union may submit the matter to arbitration under the terms of this Agreement. The rules governing procedure for arbitration shall be the same as in 11.3, Step III.
Section 11.3	Grievance and Arbitration
Except as in disciplinary provisions of Sections 11.1 and 11.2 above, a difference, complaint or dispute (hereinafter called a grievance) between the Employer and the Union or any of the employees of the Employer it represents, arising out of the circumstances or conditions of employment, shall be exclusively settled in the following manner.
There shall be no interruption of the operation of the Employer. It is agreed that the time limitations set forth herein are of the essence and that no action or matter not in compliance therewith shall be considered the subject of a grievance unless said time limitations are extended by written agreement of both parties to this Agreement.
Failure of the Employer to answer a grievance within the time limits herein shall permit the Union to advance the case to the next step. The Union will be informed of and allowed to be
49
356615.1
in attendance at all grievance or disciplinary hearings. The Union shall send written notice to the Department Head notifying him/her of advancement to the next Step.
Before a formal grievance is initiated, the employee may discuss the matter with his/her immediate supervisor. If the problem is not resolved in discussion, the following procedure shall be used to adjust the grievance: Step I - IMMEDIATE SUPERVISOR
A.	The employee or the Union shall put the grievance in writing on the form to be supplied by the Employer upon request, but in the absence of such a form, employee or the Union may submit the grievance in letter form, within twelve working days of either the employee or the Union having knowledge of the event which gives rise to the grievance. The employee or the Union will indicate what Section and part of the Agreement is in violation, a brief description of the facts underlying the grievance, and the requested remedy, and submit the grievance to the employee's immediate supervisor. It is understood that if the employee has knowledge of the grievance more than twelve working days than the Union, the Union shall not thereafter file any grievance concerning that same issue with the Employer.
50
356615.1
B.	Within five (5) working days of the written grievance, the immediate supervisor will notify the employee and the union in writing of the decision.
Step II
A.	If the grievance is not settled at Step I, the Union Representative and/or the employee shall have the right to make an appeal in writing to the Department Head or the Department Head's designee within seven (7) working days after the date of receipt of the decision or the date it was due under Step I, by the immediate supervisor.	The name of the Department
Head's designee shall be posted for employees in areas where employee notices are normally posted and submitted to the Union. Failure to post and so notify the Union will permit immediate advancement to arbitration unless corrected within two (2) working days of notice of failure to post.
B.	The Department Head or the Department Head's designee shall meet with the Union's representative at least once each month to discuss all pending grievances that have been advanced to Step II. The purpose of the Step II meeting will be for the Department and the Union to share relevant information and discuss their respective positions with respect to each grievance
51
356615.1
pending at Step II, and attempt to amicably resolve as many grievances as possible. The Department Head or the Department Head's designee shall have the requisite authority to resolve grievances during the Step II meeting. No grievances will be discussed at more than one Step II meeting, unless the City and the Union mutually agree that further meeting and discussion would be beneficial. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve the City and the Union from their obligations to otherwise process and respond to grievances in accordance with this Article.
C.	The Department Head or the Department Head's designee will notify the employee and Union in writing with a copy to the Union of his/her decision within seven (7) working days of the completion of the Step II meeting. The	response	to	the	grievance shall	state	the
Department's position with respect to the grievance together with	a	brief	statement of the facts	and
reason (s) supporting that position.
D.	Any	settlement	at	Step	I	or II shall be	binding upon
the	Employer,	Union and the aggrieved	employee or
employees. Grievances may be withdrawn without
52
356615.1
prejudice at any step of the grievance procedure if
mutually agreed.
E.	If the grievance is not settled at the second Step, the Union or the Employer may request final and binding arbitration by serving written notice on the other within ten (10) working days from receipt of the Employer's Step II decision or the date it was due.
F.	If the grievance or arbitration affects more than one employee, it may be presented by a single selected employee representative of the group or class. A class action shall be identified to the Employer at Step I or as soon as practicable. The resolution of a ( grievance filed on behalf of a group of employees shall be made applicable to all of the affected employees within that group.
G.	Even though a grievance has been filed, employees are obligated to	follow instructions or	orders of
supervisors of the	Employer, except where	the
instruction or order is so inherently dangerous to the employee that it could cause death or serious physical harm.	The	Employer agrees	that by following
instructions or orders the employee does not waive his/her right to process his or her grievance.
53
356615.1
Refusal to follow instructions or Order, shall be
cause for discipline.
Step III - ARBITRATION
If the matter is not settled in Step II, the Union or the Employer, but not an individual employee or employees, may submit the dispute to arbitration by serving a written request to arbitrate to the designated representative from the Employer's operating department, with copies of the request to the designated law department representative and counsel for the Coalition Unions, setting forth the facts and specific relief requested, within ten (10) working days after the answer is given or due at Step II hereof.
Within five (5) days of serving the request for arbitration, or as soon thereafter as the parties mutually may agree, the Union shall have the right to convene a meeting with the Employer's designated representative in an attempt to resolve the grievance prior to any further action being taken to advance the matter to arbitration. At such meeting, the Union shall set forth in writing the facts of the matter in dispute and the relief requested. The Employer will respond to the grievance in writing by giving the reasons which it contends support its position with respect to the grievance. In the event the parties are unable at such meeting to resolve the
54
356615.1
grievance, the Union and the Employer will proceed with the selection of an arbitrator as provided below.
Either party may submit the grievance to arbitration by serving a written request to arbitrate to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service under the rules of that tribunal with a copy to the other party. The foregoing shall not prevent the Employer and Union from mutually agreeing to the selection of an arbitrator.
The panel of arbitrators submitted must agree as a whole to commencement of a hearing within sixty (60) days of selection and that they will render a decision within thirty (30) days of the close of hearing. Any extension of those time limits must be by written consent of the Union and the Employer. The failure of either side to agree to an extension of time shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
Arbitrators will advise the parties of their fees and expenses prior to selection and such fees and expenses shall be borne equally between the Union and the Employer. The arbitrator shall have the right to subpoena witnesses and require the production of pertinent documents at the request of either party.
Each party shall be responsible for compensating its own representative and witnesses. The cost of a transcript shall be
55
356615.1
borne by the party requesting the reporter unless the parties agree to share such costs.
An arbitrable matter must involve the meaning and application or interpretation of a specific provision of this Agreement or a document incorporated by reference thereto. The provisions of this Agreement and any other document incorporated by reference shall be the sole source of any rights which either party may assert in arbitration. Questions of arbitrability shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have no power to amend, add to, subtract from, or change the terms of this Agreement, and shall be authorized only to interpret the existing provisions of this Agreement and apply them to the specific facts of the grievance or dispute. The decision of the arbitrator shall be based wholly on the evidence and arguments presented to him by the parties in the presence of each other. No arbitration hearing shall be held unless both parties are present. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute, including the employee or employees involved. Where timeliness is in dispute, it shall be decided by the arbitrator.
A.	ADVANCED GRIEVANCE STEP FILING
Certain issues which by nature are not capable of being settled at a preliminary step of the grievance procedure, or which would become moot due to the length of time necessary to
56
356615.1
exhaust the grievance steps, or which the Union believes which would be resolved more expeditiously, may be filed at the option of the Union at Step II or Step III.
B.	PERTINENT WITNESSES AND INFORMATION
The Union may request the production of specific documentation, books, papers or witnesses reasonably available from the Employer and substantially pertinent to the grievance under consideration. Such request shall not be unreasonably denied, and if granted shall be in conformance with applicable laws and rules issued pursuant thereto governing the dissemination of such materials.
A Union representative, a grievant, and Union steward will be permitted a reasonable amount of time without loss of pay during working hours to investigate and process grievances where this does not substantially interfere with the efficient operation of the Department, provided that representatives shall observe the Employer's reasonable visitation rules for Union representatives.
The steward shall notify his/her immediate supervisor for permission to handle grievances on work time, it being understood that the operation of the Department takes precedence unless there is an emergency, but such permission shall not be denied unreasonably. A reasonable number of employees may attend the meeting without loss of pay; such meetings shall be
57
356615.1
set by mutual agreement by the Employer and the Union. Where the Employer directs an employee to report for a meeting concerning a grievance at a time when the employee is not scheduled to work such time shall be considered time worked.
If there is space available, the Employer, upon request of the Union representative, shall provide the use of a room and telephone, to discuss the grievance, subject to the Employer's reasonable rules for the Union's use of such facilities.
C.	EXPEDITED ARBITRATION
The Employer and the Union may mutually agree to submit any grievance to expedited arbitration. Pursuant to expedited arbitration, the parties shall mutually select an arbitrator from a group of arbitrators approved by the parties. The expedited arbitration hearing shall be scheduled as early as possible from the date the parties agreed to submit the grievance to expedited arbitration. The parties agree to waive the stenographic recording of the hearing and the filing of post-hearing briefs. Pursuant to the parties' agreement, the arbitrator shall issue either an oral decision at the close of the hearing or a written decision within twenty (20) days of the date of the hearing. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on all parties to the dispute.
58
356615.1
D.	MANAGEMENT OF ARBITRATION DOCKET
A representative from the Employer's law department and counsel for the Coalition Unions shall meet at least quarterly, or more frequently as necessary, in order to discuss the scheduling of specific cases for available hearing dates. At these meetings, the parties shall designate at least one preestablished hearing date per month for the arbitration of grievances.
Section 11.4 Conduct of Disciplinary Investigations
Supplementing all rights and processes due employees covered by this Agreement who may be the subject of a disciplinary investigation by the Inspector General, the interview will be conducted in the following manner:
A.	The interview of the employee shall be scheduled at a reasonable time, preferably while the employee is on duty, or if feasible, during day shift hours.
B.	The interview, depending upon the allegation, will take place at the employee's location of assignment, normal	department location	or	other appropriate
location.
C.	Prior	to an	interview,	the employee under
investigation shall be informed of the person in charge of the investigation, the identity of the interviewer and all persons present during the interview. When a formal statement is being taken,
59
356615.1
all questions directed to the employee shall be asked by and through one interviewer at a time.
D.	The length of the interview sessions will be reasonable, with reasonable interruptions permitted for personal necessities.
E.	At the beginning of the interview, the employee shall be informed of the nature of the matters to be discussed.
F.	An employee under investigation shall not be threatened with transfer, dismissal or disciplinary action, or promised a reward, as an inducement to provide information relating to the matter under investigation, or for exercising any rights contained in this Agreement, provided, however, that this Section shall not prohibit or prevent an accurate reading of the employee's administrative rights, or the imposition of discipline in accordance therewith.
G.	An employee under investigation will be provided without unreasonable delay with a copy of any written statement the employee has made.
H.	(1) If the allegation under investigation indicates a recommendation for discipline is probable against the employee, said employee will be given the statutory administrative proceedings rights prior to the commencement of the interview. (2) If the allegation indicates that criminal prosecution may be probable against said employee, the provisions of this Section
60
356615.1
shall be inapplicable and said employee will be afforded his constitutional rights concerning selfincrimination prior to the commencement of the interview. An employee will not be read his/her administrative and Miranda rights during the same interview.
I.	At the request of the employee under investigation, an employee who may be subject to discipline shall have the right to be represented in the interview by a representative of the Union. The employee shall be told that he/she has the right to Union representation before commencement of the interview.	The
interrogation shall be suspended until representation can be obtained, provided the suspension is not for an unreasonable time and the Employer does not have the interview unduly delayed.
J.	The Employer shall not compel an employee under investigation to speak or testify before, or to be questioned by, any non-governmental agency relating to any matter or issue under investigation.
K.	The results of a polygraph examination shall not be used against an employee in any forum adverse to the employee's interests. The Employer will not require a polygraph examination if it is illegal to do so. If an employee is asked to take a polygraph examination, he/she will be advised in writing 24 hours prior to the administration of the examination. The results of
61
356615.1
any polygraph examination shall be known to the employee within one week.
L.	This Section shall not apply to employee witnesses.
M.	The identity of an employee under investigation shall not be made available to the media during the course of an investigation until charges are filed by the Employer and the employee has the opportunity to respond thereto. If an employee is exonerated after the City initially informed the media of the charges against the employee, the City will make that fact available to the media where the employee requests it.
N.	In the event that disciplinary action is taken against an employee, any allegations of violations of this Section shall be heard in connection with, and in the same forum	as,	grievances which protest	said
disciplinary action, except as provided in paragraph 0(2) below. If no disciplinary action is brought against the employee following the conclusion of the Inspector General's investigation, no grievance concerning the conduct of the investigation shall exist.
0.	(1) Any evidence or information including employee
statements that is obtained in violation of the rights enumerated in this Section, shall be suppressed and shall not be used by the Employer for any disciplinary action against the employee, or in the case of promotions or transfers.
62
356615.1
(2)(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph N above, at the option of the Union, a claim that the Inspector General has violated the provisions of this Section may be raised in a suppression hearing before a member of the permanent hearing panel listed herein, rather than in the disciplinary hearing as required in paragraph N above.
(2)	(b) (1) The Union may exercise this option by notifying the employee's Department Head and the Employer's Law Department in writing not later than ten (10) calendar days before an arbitration or the Personnel or Police Board hearing, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Agreement. The appeal shall specify the particular contract provisions allegedly violated, together with a factual summary of the conduct alleged to have violated the Agreement. It is understood that by exercising this option, any and all time limits set forth in Chapter 2-74-060 of the Municipal Code of the City of Chicago regarding the Personnel Board hearing shall be tolled until the arbitrator renders a decision as provided below.
(2)	Upon receipt of said notice, the parties will select in order of rotation one of the three permanent hearing panel members who are chosen as follows. To be eligible for service on this panel, members must be willing to convene a suppression hearing within thirty (30) days of receiving notice of his or her selection.
63
356615.1
To select the initial panel, or should any member of the panel resign or be removed upon mutual agreement of the parties during the life of this Agreement, the parties will meet to reach agreement on new panel member who must be an arbitrator listed with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. If no agreement can be reached, the Employer will request a panel of seven (7) arbitrators from FMCS, all of whom must be members of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Thereafter, the parties will meet to strike names from the list, with the Employer striking first, until one name remains, which person shall be named to the panel.
2 (c) The suppression hearing shall be convened within thirty (30) calendar days of the selection of the panel member, or at such other time as the parties may mutually agree. The arbitrator's jurisdiction shall be limited to determining if the Inspector General obtained evidence or statements in violation of paragraph 0(1) above, and if such evidence should be suppressed. The arbitrator shall have no authority to rule on the merits of any underlying discipline or take any other action beyond that specifically set forth in this subparagraph.
2(d) The panel member shall render an expedited decision which shall be final and binding upon the parties. It shall not be subject to collateral attack
64
356615.1
in any further disciplinary proceeding involving the employee in question.
P.	Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section to the contrary, no interview by the Inspector General will be conducted at a police station or other correctional facility unless the employee works at the police station or correctional facility, . or if the employee has been incarcerated for more than 72 hours.
ARTICLE 12 NO STRIKES-NO LOCKOUT
Section 12,1	No Strikes
The Union agrees that during the life of this Agreement, there shall be no strikes (including, but not limited to sympathy strikes and strikes to protect union or third party conduct), work stoppages, slowdowns, picketing, delays of work of any kind.
Section 12.2	Union Efforts
The Union agrees that it will use its best efforts to prevent any acts forbidden in this Article and that in the event any such acts take place or are engaged in by any employee or group of employees in the Union's bargaining unit, the Union further agrees it will use its best efforts to cause an immediate cessation thereof. If the Union immediately takes all necessary steps in good faith to end any stoppages, strikes, picketing, intentional slowdown or suspension of work, including: (a) publicly disclaiming such action as not called or sanctioned by the Union, and (b) posting notices in conspicuous
65
356615.1
places	which	notify involved employees	that the	action was not
called	or sanctioned by the Union, in	addition	to instructing
employees to	immediately cease such	activity,	the Employer
agrees	that	it will not bring action against	the Union to
establish responsibility for such unauthorized conduct.
Section 12.3	Right of Non-Association
The Employer may terminate the employment of or otherwise discipline any employee or employees who have been found to have engaged in any act forbidden in this Article.
Section 12.4	No Lockout
The Employer will not lock out bargaining unit employees during the term of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 13 DUES CHECK-OFF AND FAIR SHARE
Section 13.1	Indemnification/Authorization
The Employer, upon receipt of a validly executed written authorization card, shall deduct Union dues and initiation fees from the payroll checks of all employees so authorizing the deduction in an amount certified by the Union, and shall remit such deductions on a monthly basis to the Union. Authorization for such deduction shall be irrevocable unless revoked by written notice to the Employer and the Union during the fifteen (15) day period prior to the expiration of this Agreement. The Union shall indemnify, defend and hold the Employer harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability, including damages, attorney's fees and court and other costs, that shall arise out of, or by reason of action
66
356615.1
taken or not taken by the Employer for the purpose of complying with Sections 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, and 13.4 of this Article, or reliance on any list, notice, certification or assignment furnished under any such provisions or in reliance upon employee payroll deduction authorization cards submitted by the Union to the Employer.
The Employer shall provide to the Union within thirty (30) days name, address, classification, rate of salary and starting date of any new employee hired into the Union's bargaining unit. Section 13.2 Fair Share
It is further agreed that 30 days after the later of the execution of the Agreement or the employee's date of hire, the Employer shall deduct from the earnings of employees who are not members of the Union, a monthly amount as certified by the Union and shall remit such deductions to the Union at the same time that the dues check-off is remitted. It is understood that the amount of deductions from said non-member bargaining unit employees will not exceed the regular monthly union dues and represents the employee's fair share cost of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.
Section 13.3	Right of Non-Association
Nothing in this Agreement shall be inconsistent with Section 6(g) of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act in protecting the right of non-association of employees based upon the bona fide religious tenets or teachings of a Church or other religious body of which such employees are members.
67
356615.1

All employees hired on or after the effective date of this Agreement and who have not made application for membership shall be required, 30 days after the later of the execution of this Agreement or their hire date, to pay a fair share of the cost of the collective bargaining process and contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.
ARTICLE 14 MISCELLANEOUS
Section 14.1	Job Titles
The Employer will notify the Union of any change in job title. If the Employer makes any substantial change in job duties it will discuss such changes with the Union prior thereto.	If the Employer changes a job title without
substantially changing the duties of the job, the Union will retain its existing jurisdiction over the new job title. The Employer will not permanently assign bargaining unit work to the
68
356615.1
jurisdiction of another bargaining unit without the mutual agreement of the unions involved.
Section 14.2	Traditional Work
Any work which has been traditionally performed by employees who are represented by the Union shall continue to be performed by said employees, except where non-unit employees have in the past performed unit work, or in emergencies, to train or instruct employees, to do layout, demonstration, experimental, or testing duties, to do troubleshooting or where special knowledge is required, provided however, where employees do not report to work because of vacations, or other absences or tardiness, or for personal reasons during the course of the day, or because all of the employees are or will be occupied with assigned duties, or to complete a rush assignment, employees of any other unit represented by another Union shall not perform the work of said employees. For example, if a Machinist is on vacation, a Plumber shall not be assigned as a replacement Machinist. The Employer shall not arbitrarily extend the period of any emergency beyond the need for that emergency.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood that it shall not be a violation of this Agreement if the following functions are performed by members of management, regardless of whether they are also performed by the bargaining unit: (a) crew assignment and scheduling; (b) work inspection; (c) discipline; (d) ordering of equipment and materials from vendors. Nothing herein shall deprive members of the bargaining unit of the right to perform historical and traditional unit work; nor shall the
69
356615.1
City lay-off a bargaining unit employee for the purpose of replacing that person with a member of management.
Section 14,3	Jurisdictional Disputes
In the event that the Union files a grievance claiming that the Employer has violated the terms of this Agreement by assigning certain work to City employees represented by another union, or where the Employer receives a grievance from another union protesting the assignment of work to employees covered under this Agreement, the Employer shall serve written notice to the Union, and on the other affected union(s), of the existence of said dispute. This notice shall describe the nature of the work in dispute.
In the event this dispute remains unresolved and is submitted to arbitration, the provisions of Article 11 herein regarding arbitration of grievances shall apply, except that in addition to the Employer and the Union, the other affected union (s) shall have the opportunity to participate in the hearing and to present evidence, but shall not be bound to the results of that arbitration unless all parties so agree in advance of the hearing.
If the Union shall prevail in said arbitration and is awarded the work in dispute, and if, in that event, the other affected union(s) shall pursue a claim against the Employer that the reassignment of the work in dispute violates the Agreement of that other union, the provisions of this Section shall apply to that claim as well. All parties to the dispute shall have
70
356615.1
the right to participate in any arbitration hearing of that claim and to present evidence therein. Should the arbitrator in the second proceeding determine that the Employer's reassignment of the work in dispute violates the other union(s)' Agreement, thereby requiring the Employer to comply with two conflicting arbitration decisions as to which of the unions is entitled to perform the disputed work, the following provisions shall apply.
The Employer shall have the right to invoke arbitration of the dispute under the provisions of the grievance and arbitration procedures contained in Article 11 of this Agreement, except that the Union and the other affected union(s) shall select the arbitrator. The Employer, the Union and the other affected union(s) shall be parties to that proceeding, and shall have the right to fully participate in the hearing. During the pendency of this proceeding, the work assignment directed by the first arbitrator shall be followed by the parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to decide only which of the two conflicting awards shall prevail. The arbitrator's decision shall be based solely upon the prior arbitration awards, the record before both prior arbitrators, and the traditional work and other relevant provisions of this Agreement and of the collective bargaining agreement of the affected union (s). No other evidence or testimony shall be admitted in that hearing. The decision of the arbitrator in this proceeding shall be final and binding upon all parties to the dispute, and none of the parties to the dispute shall seek
71
356615.1
review of that award in any other judicial or administrative forum.
Nothing herein shall preclude all parties to the dispute from voluntarily resolving it at any time.
Section 14.4	Deferred Compensation
The Employer's policy which is in effect at the execution of this Agreement, pertaining to deferred compensation, shall be afforded to all employees of the Employer without change during the term of this Agreement.
Section 14.5	Rules of Conduct Changes
When the Employer proposes to initiate reasonable changes or additions to its rules of conduct, which could subject Employees to discipline, the Employer shall transmit four (4) copies of the proposed changes or additions to the Union. The Union will consider the proposals, and upon request, the Employer will meet with the Union within twenty (20) calendar days of the receipt of the proposals to receive the Union's comments. Absent an emergency, the Employer will not implement its proposed changes or additions until the Union has had a reasonable opportunity to present its views and discuss the proposals with the Employer. No such changes or additions shall be implemented without prior publication and notice to the affected Employees.
Section 14.6	Safety
(a)	The Employer shall provide a safe and healthful working environment for employees covered by this agreement
72
356615.1
including in accordance with applicable federal and state occupational safety and health laws, and shall maintain in good and safe working condition all equipment necessary for the safe and proper performance of the job.
(b)	In furtherance of those efforts, a joint safety committee shall be established which shall be composed of six (6) representatives of the Union Coalition and six (6) representatives of the Employer. The purpose of the committee shall be to discuss, examine and to make recommendations concerning occupational safety and health issues affecting employees. All recommendations of the committee with respect to safety and health issues shall be submitted in writing to the appropriate Department Head with a copy to the Union and the Director of Labor Relations. The Department Head shall promptly issue a written response to the committee concerning the Department's views regarding the committee's recommendations.
The parties may decide, from time to time, to refer certain safety issues and concerns to the personnel of the affected Department(s) responsible for safety matters and Union representatives of the affected employee(s). The Department safety personnel will meet and confer with a representative of the affected Union about such issues and report back to the Committee on any decisions or recommendations concerning them.
(c)	The joint safety committee shall meet at least once a month, or otherwise by mutual agreement.
(d)	The parties agree and understand that if an employee is faced with an unsafe working condition, the employee is
73
356615.1
required to perform the task in question unless the employee's performance of an assigned task presented the strong likelihood of subjecting the employee to imminent danger of death or serious injury. If the employee, with no reasonable alternative, refuses in good faith to perform that task and expose himself to that dangerous condition, the employee will not be subject to discipline. In order to avoid discipline under this paragraph, the condition must be of such a nature that a reasonable person, under the circumstances, would conclude that there is a real, substantial, and imminent danger of death or serious injury. In addition, the employee must also have sought from the Employer, and have been unable to obtain, correction of the situation before refusing to perform the task in question.
Section 14.7	Information to Union
The Employer will provide to the Union on a monthly basis a bargaining unit report of current active employees, the list to include employee name, address, social security number, title, pay schedule, grade, current pay rate, status, continuous service date, time in title, date of birth, race and sex.
The Employer shall also provide to the Union on a monthly basis a bargaining unit activity report of current active employees that will list Career Service Retirements; Career Service Resignations; Career Service Discharges; Non-Career Service Terminations; Leaves of Absence; Suspensions; Reinstatements; Reappointments; Transfers (change of department
356615.1

Each month the Employer will provide to the Union the current month's bargaining unit activity report and the updated report from the previous month.
Section 14.8	Filling of Permanent Vacancies
The Employer shall determine if there is a permanent vacancy to be filled and at any time before said vacancy is filled whether or not said vacancy shall be filled.
Employees within a department who desire a change in shift, day off group or work location of their job assignment shall request such change in writing on the Employer's form. When filling a vacancy, the Employer shall select the most senior employee in the job classification in the department who has such a request on file, provided the employee has the present ability to perform the required work without further training.
Employees may file such requests in December for the period beginning in January and continuing through June of the following year and June for the period beginning in July and continuing through December. Employees accepting a transfer shall be allowed one such transfer only in any six (6) month period.
In the Department of Fleet Administration, newly hired employees customarily are provided with a training period of up to six (6) months on the day shift at the main work location. Upon satisfactory completion of said training period, the new
75
356615.1
employee may be reassigned to the shift of another more senior employee who has a timely transfer request on file and who desires to transfer to the new employee's assigned shift.
When filling a Vacancy and there are no said employees who have requests on file, the Employer shall select the employee in the job classification in the department from the recall or reinstatement list, if any, in accordance with the recall procedures in this Agreement.
Qualified bargaining unit employees shall be given an equal opportunity to bid on jobs which are declared vacant by the Employer. The posting of an Employer determined permanent vacancy shall be on bulletin boards at each Employer physical site in the department and other appropriate locations as determined by the Employer. Said vacancy shall be posted for 14 days. In making selections, the Employer give preference to employee applicants over non-employee applicants, unless the non-employee applicants have demonstrably greater skill and ability to fulfill the needs determined by the Employer. The Employer shall select the most senior employee of those applying who has the greatest ability to fill the needs determined by the Employer.
"Ability" shall be determined by the Employer based upon performance evaluations, experience, training, proven ability and similar criteria.
"Seniority" shall mean for purposes of this Section, the employee's continuous service in any bargaining unit title (s) city-wide.
76
356615.1
The successful bidder for any jobs under this Section shall have an evaluation period, not to exceed sixty (60) days, to demonstrate that he or she can perform the job. If the Employer has just cause based upon the employee job performance at any time during that period that the successful bidder cannot perform the job, then the successful bidder shall be returned to the job he/she held just prior to the awarding of the bid, displacing, if necessary, any employee who has been placed into said job.
Section 14.9	Balancing Work Force
The Employer's movement of employees from one location, shift or day off schedule to another shall not be deemed a permanent vacancy if there is not a net increase in the number of employees in the affected classification(s) in the affected locations, shifts, or day off schedule.
If the Employer intends to reduce the number of employees in a job classification at a location, shift or day off schedule and reassign them to another location, shift or day off schedule, the Employer shall seek volunteers among the employees in the affected job classification, provided that the volunteers have the present ability to perform the required work without further training.
If there are more volunteers than there are assignments, such reassignments shall be made on the basis of seniority. If there are insufficient volunteers available, the Employer shall
77
356615.1
reassigns employees using
reverse
seniority provided the
employees have the present ability to perform the required work without further training.
Section 14.10	Subcontracting
The Employer shall not contract or subcontract out bargaining unit work to any person, contractor or employer who is not in compliance with the area standards established under and pursuant to the formula used by the United States Department of Labor administering the Davis-Bacon Act. Notice of any such contracting or subcontracting shall be given to the Union at least thirty (30) days prior to its effective date. The notice shall be in writing and shall contain the name and address of the party who will perform the work, a description of the work to be performed and any other relevant data to enable the Union to determine compliance with this Section. In the event such party is determined not to be in compliance with the said area standards, the Employer shall withhold payouts and shall not contract or subcontract further with any such party until the Union and the Employer receive a written and enforceable assurance of compliance.
In the event that the Employer determines to subcontract unit work under this Agreement, and as a result bargaining unit employees would be laid off by the proposed subcontracting, the Employer shall make available, on a seniority basis, equal-rated
78
356615.1
permanent jobs which the Employer has declared to be vacant in the affected Department, or other departments, as the case may be, in that order, provided the laid off employees have the then present ability to perform the required work without further training. However, the employee shall be provided with a reasonable amount of orientation to allow him or her to perform the work.
Prior to sub-contracting of bargaining unit work, the Employer, the Union, and the proposed sub-contractor shall meet to discuss the employment of employees subject to layoff. During that meeting the Employer will request and urge that the subcontractor hire laid off employees.
Section 14.11	Automobile Reimbursement
Employees who are required by the Employer to use their own automobiles in the performance of their job shall receive mileage reimbursement at the then effective rate recognized by the Internal Revenue Service, with a maximum of $250 per month. On the effective date of this Agreement, following its ratification by all parties, the maximum reimbursement will increase to $350.00 per month. Effective February 1, 2008, the maximum reimbursement will increase to $450.00 per month. Effective February 1, 2009, the maximum reimbursement will increase to $550.00 per month. Thereafter, the maximum reimbursement will increase effective each February 1 by the
79
356615.1
percentage increase in the Transportation Expenditure Category of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U): U. S. City Average for the previous year, as rounded to the nearest $5 increment. Employees seeking mileage reimbursement must submit that request on a form provided by the Employer. Payment for mileage expenses will be made on a monthly basis. In the event that during the life of this Agreement the Employer shall implement for any group of employees an automobile expense reimbursement program which is more favorable to employees than the provisions of this paragraph, upon notice from the Union, the Employer will meet and discuss with representatives of the Union the possible application of said new program to employees covered by this Agreement.
Upon request by either party made no earlier than January 1, 2010, the parties shall meet to discuss any proposed changes to this Section 14.11.
Section 14.12	Detailing
Detailing is the temporary transfer of an employee to a work assignment within his/her job classification geographically removed from the employee's normal work site and/or to a different shift.
Employees shall not be detailed for more than sixty (60) days, unless the Employer gives advance written notice to the Union of its need to do so and confers with the Union upon
80
356615.1
request. In any event, no such assignment may extend beyond one hundred and eighty (180) days without the agreement of the parties.
The Employer shall notify the employees of the requirements for said detailing and shall seek volunteers among the employees who have the then present ability to perform the work required without further training. If there are more volunteers than there are assignments, selections shall be made on the basis of seniority. If there are insufficient volunteers, the Employer shall assign the detailing by inverse seniority, starting with the least senior first, and attempt to rotate such assignments within each calendar year.
Thirty (30) days' advance notice of detailing shall be given to the employees if the need to detail is known; otherwise, as soon as reasonably possible.
ARTICLE 15 LAYOFFS/RECALL
Section 15.1 Layoffs/Recall
Probationary employees with more than 90 days of service shall be laid off first. Thereafter, the least senior employee in the affected job classification shall be laid off first, provided the ability, qualifications to perform the required work, and the employee's job performance are equal among the other employees in the job. "Seniority" shall mean, for
81
356615.1
purposes of this Section, the employee's continuous service in any bargaining unit title (s) city-wide.
A laid-off employee may displace (bump) the least senior employee, if any, in the most recent lower job title the employee to be laid off has held, provided the employee to be laid off has the then present ability to perform the job to the Employer's satisfaction without further training.
Employees shall be recalled in the reverse order they were laid off.
ARTICLE 16 SEPARABILITY
Section 16.1
In the event any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be or become invalid or unenforceable by reason of any Federal or State Law or Local Ordinance now existing or hereinafter enacted, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the remainder of the provisions hereof. The parties agree to meet and adopt revised provisions which would be in conformity with the law.
ARTICLE 17 UNION REPRESENTATION
Section 17.1	Union Stewards
The Union will advise the Employer in writing, of the names of the Stewards in each department or area agreed upon with the Employer and shall notify the Employer promptly of any changes.
Stewards will be permitted to handle and process grievances referred by employees at the appropriate steps of the grievance

356615.1
procedure during normal hours, without the loss of pay, provided that such activity shall not exceed a reasonable period of time, or unreasonably interrupt the work of employees.

current practices, and shall at all times be conducted in a manner so as not to interfere with normal operations. The Employer may be able to change or set rules of access, provided that any change in current practices must be reasonable and subject to the grievance procedure.
ARTICLE 18 DRUG AND ALCOHOL PROGRAM
Section 18.1	Policy Statement
The City of Chicago's essential mission is to provide services to its citizens in a safe and economic manner. The parties to this Agreement recognize that drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace has a deleterious effect on the health and safety of employees, as well their morale and productivity, all of which creates an undue burden on the persons which the City and the employees covered by this Agreement serve. Furthermore, the economic cost of providing health care services to employees who abuse drugs and alcohol has put an increasing burden on the City's finances.
The Employer and the Union maintain a strong commitment to protect people and property, and to provide a safe working environment. To this end, the employer has also established its confidential Employee Assistance Program for employees with personal problems, including alcohol and substance abuse, and the parties to this Agreement urge employees who have such problems to utilize the Program's services.

Section 18.3	Disciplinary Action
(a)	All employees must report to work in a physical condition that will enable them to perform their jobs in a safe manner. Further, employees shall not use, possess, dispense or receive prohibited items or substances on or at the Employer's premises, nor shall they report to work under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
(b)	When, based upon the direct observation of two supervisors, the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that an employee is under the influence of a prohibited substance, the Employer shall have the right to subject that employee to a drug and alcohol test. At the Employer's discretion, the employee may be placed on administrative leave with pay until test results are available. If the test results prove negative, the employee shall be reinstated. In all other cases, the Employer will terminate all employees who:

two supervisors have reasonable cause to believe that an employee has reported to work under the influence of or is at work under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
(ii)	a test may be required if an employee is	’
involved in a workplace accident or fighting;
(iii)	a test may be required as part of a followup to counseling or rehabilitation for substance abuse for up to a one year period.
(b)	Employees to be tested will be required to sign a consent form and chain of custody form, assuring proper documentation and accuracy. If an employee refuses to sign a consent form authorizing the test, he or she will be subject to termination.

Positive results of said retesting shall be conclusive as to the presence of alcohol or drugs. The failure to take a sufficient sample, or to preserve such sample, to allow for retesting, shall not affect the removal from eligibility of an applicant of personnel action, including discharge, of any employee.
(j)	No laboratory report or test results shall appear in the incumbent's personnel file unless they are part of a personnel action under this program, but shall be placed in a special locked file maintained by the Commissioner of Personnel, except as such disclosure may be required by this policy, law or ordinance.

The purpose of the Initiative is to increase the opportunities for participation of graduates of CPS and/or City Colleges in Union apprenticeship and training programs and to provide expanded postapprenticeship and training employment opportunities for such graduates. In conjunction with the execution of each Coalition Union's collective bargaining agreement with the City of Chicago, the Parties shall enter into a supplemental memorandum of understanding regarding the structure, implementation, monitoring and enforcement of this Initiative. Said memorandum shall be attached to this Agreement as Appendix D. Section 19.2

LABOR NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND COUPE
SIDE LETTER
FOUR 10-HOUR DAY WORKWEEK
Agree to the following in a side letter to this Agreement:
Since the Arbitrator issued his Opinion and Award dated June 21, 2007 in the Matter of Arbitration between the City of Chicago and Laborers Local 1001/Teamsters Local 726 ("Award"), the City and affected Coalition Unions have explored various approaches to resolving their dispute over the scope of the Award and the application of Section 3 (a) of the Memorandum of Understanding dated July 18, 2005 entered into between the City and Coalition ("Section 3(a)"). In addition to amending Section 3(a) to reflect the Unions' preferred approach to the four 10-hour workweek, the parties, in return, have discussed an agreement by the Unions to waive some or all of the monetary make whole remedies directed by the Arbitrator in his Award. Although the City is willing to amend Section 3 (a) as requested by the Unions in order to conclude negotiations at the Coalition level, such willingness is contingent on the expectation that the affected Unions will reach agreement with the City to waive some or all of the monetary make whole remedies. Until such an agreement is reached, the affected Unions agree that the City shall not be obligated to implement the monetary make whole remedies in the Award. In addition, if such an agreement is not
102
356615.1
reached by December 1, 2007, the parties shall submit the issues
of the Unions' proposed amendment to Section 3(a) to reflect the
Unions' preferred approach to the four 10-hour workweek and the
City's proposed relief from the monetary make whole remedy to an
arbitrator for resolution.

WHEREAS, the City of Chicago must confront many unique challenges because, among other reasons, of the diverse, complicated and sometimes hazardous nature of the public work, the training required, the pressure of competition from non-governmental employers who may not have similar budgeting constraints and the impact of City employment for the health, safety and well-being of its Employees and the public at large; and
WHEREAS, the Unions and the City agree that skyrocketing health insurance costs are foremost among these challenges and require the aggressive pursuit of measures designed to control employee health insurance costs while maintaining high quality and multiple-optioned employee health insurance coverage; and
WHEREAS, addressing the health care challenge is of mutual concern to the Unions and the City but is not always susceptible to effective resolution through the collective bargaining process; and
WHEREAS, the Unions and the City recognize the desirability and necessity of working together to increase overall health insurance plan savings through the investigation and implementation of a value-based health insurance model; and
WHEREAS, the Unions and the City acknowledge that labor management cooperation committees have been used to significant success in the private sector and especially in the context of health insurance; and
WHEREAS, the Unions and the City desire and agree to establish a joint labormanagement cooperation trust for such purposes (the Trust, as subsequently defined); and
WHEREAS, the Unions and the City desire that such Trust be designated as an organization exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as it may be amended from time to time (the “Code”) and as other than a private foundation under Section 509 of the Code to the extent so qualified.
