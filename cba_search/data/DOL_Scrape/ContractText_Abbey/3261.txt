A "grievance" shall mean an allegation by a teacher resulting in a dispute or disagreement between the teacher employee and the School Board as to the interpretation or application of terms and conditions of employment, insofar as such matters are contained in this agreement. Where the singular use of the word teacher is used, the plural of teachers may be substituted, where applicable.
5-2 Representation
5-2-1	School District
The administrator or School Board may be represented during any step of the procedure by any person or agent designated by such party to act in the administration's behalf.
5-2-2	The Grievant
The grievant shall be represented at all steps of the grievance procedure by the Federation, unless the Federation refuses to carry the grievance. In the event the Federation chooses not to process a grievance at any level, the grievant shall not be limited from proceeding independently or with representation other than the Federation. The grievant shall be present at all steps of the procedure that the grievant elects to pursue. In the case of a group grievance where more than one teacher is involved, the group shall choose three or fewer teachers to act as grievants.
5-2-3	The Federation
The Federation shall have the exclusive right to process all grievances on behalf of grievants. If the Federation refuses to carry a grievance and the grievant chooses to proceed as outlined in 5-2-2, the Federation shall be informed of all grievance hearings, shall be permitted to attend such hearings, and shall receive from the School Board or its representative, any correspondence between the parties. In the event a teacher uses a representative other than the Federation, the grievant or the grievant's representative shall bear all costs normally borne by the exclusive representative.
5-3	Extension
Time limits specified in this agreement may be extended by mutual agreement.
5-4	Days
Reference to days regarding time periods in this procedure shall refer to school days. A school day is defined as all days teachers are required to be on duty. During the summer months, a day shall be defined as a normal district workday (Monday through Friday, excluding all holidays).
5-5 Time Limits
Failure at any step of this procedure to communicate the decision on a grievance within the specified time limits shall permit the aggrieved teacher to proceed to the next step. Failure at any step of this procedure to appeal a grievance to the next step within the specified time limit shall be deemed to be acceptance of the decision rendered at that step.
5
5-6 Computation of Time
In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by procedures herein, the date of the act, event or default for which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be counted, unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday or a school holiday, in which event the period runs until the end of the next day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday or a school holiday.
5-7 Filing and Postmark
The filing or service of any notice or document herein shall be timely if it bears a postmark of the United States mail within the time period.
5-8 Adjustment of Grievances
All effort shall be made to resolve any conflict by the teacher involved, with the supervisor or administrator directly involved. Any grievance must be filed within a reasonable time not to exceed thirty (30) school days from the date of the occurrence alleged to be a grievance and every effort shall be made to keep the grievance from carrying over into another fiscal year. Grievances of a teacher, during the course of the teacher's employment, shall be presented and adjusted in the following manner:
5-8-1	First Level
The statement of the grievance shall be in writing and the proceedings informal. It shall be submitted on the prescribed form to the first- level administrator who possesses the authority to adjust the grievance. A copy shall be submitted to the Federation and the Director of Human Resources.
The written grievance shall state the facts upon which it is based, the provisions in the agreement allegedly violated and the relief requested. Within ten (10) school days after receipt of said written grievance, the supervisor or administrator shall discuss the allegation with the teacher in order to seek a satisfactory settlement of the grievance. The supervisor or administrator shall submit a decision in writing to the teacher, to the superintendent and to the Federation. If a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached within ten (10) school days, the second level may be initiated within five (5) school days thereafter.
5-8-2	Second Level
Any teacher who has not received satisfactory settlement as outlined in the first level shall submit the grievance in writing with a letter of transmittal to the superintendent of schools. Within fifteen (15) school days of receipt of the grievance, the superintendent, or the superintendent's designate, shall meet with the aggrieved, the supervisor or administrator directly involved in an effort to reach a satisfactory settlement. The superintendent, or the superintendent's designate, shall render the superintendent's decision in writing to the parties involved, including the Federation. If a satisfactory settlement cannot be reached within fifteen (15) school days after the superintendent's hearing, the third level may be initiated within five (5) school days thereafter.
5-8-3	Third Level
If a satisfactory settlement is not reached at the second level, either party may voluntarily request mediation through the Bureau of Mediation Services. The School Board will receive notice the grievance has reached the third level. Both parties must agree to use this step; otherwise, the unresolved grievance will proceed to the fourth level. If no agreement is reached within twenty (20) days, the unresolved grievance will proceed to the fourth level.
6
5-8-4	Fourth Level
Within said five (5) days, either party may request arbitration. The parties shall, within ten (10) days after the request to arbitrate, attempt to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator. If no agreement on an arbitrator is reached, either party may request the Bureau of Mediation Services to submit a list of five arbitrators, providing such request is made within twenty (20) days after request for arbitration. The parties shall alternately strike names from the list of five until only one name remains that shall be the agreed-upon arbitrator. Failure to request a list of arbitrators from the Bureau of Mediation Services within the time periods provided herein shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.

Each teacher will be scheduled for an average of sixty (60) minutes per day planning time free from student contact. At the elementary level, an average of 30 minutes of preparation time shall be during the student day and an additional 30 minutes shall be designated prior to the student day. All building committee meetings should seek to end before this time.

The teacher who chooses to share his/her position may recommend, as a job share partner, another member of the collective bargaining unit currently on staff, a retiree, a teacher on unrequested leave or a new hire.
There is a distinction between a shared position and a part-time position. A shared position results from the initiative of a teacher who chooses to share a position designated as full-time by the administration. A part-time position results from the staffing needs of the school district and is based upon administration decision.

7-5 Extended Contracts
At the end of the 1995-96 school year all Lifework Coordinators were placed on unrequested leave and recalled to a standard teacher contract. Since that time, a pool of days has been established annually by the District for each of the high school lifework departments to be used by the individual lifework coordinators. The pool of days for the high school will be equitably distributed using a formula that incorporates the number of students registered for each lifework coordinator’s program as compared to the total number of students enrolled in all of the lifework programs in that building. The student count to be used is the number of students officially registered for the program as of March 1 prior to the school year. (For example: if a lifework coordinator has 25% of all the students enrolled in all the lifework programs enrolled in his/her program, he/she will receive 25% of the days allocated to that building for the next school year. Modification to the formula may be made by the Assistant Superintendent for Teaching and Learning due to student programming needs.

At the elementary schools where this procedure would necessitate bumping in the building, the administration may choose to transfer the least senior teacher assigned to the grade level in which a position is to be eliminated rather than the least senior teacher in the building. The least senior teacher, as elsewhere in this agreement, refers to the teacher possessing the least amount of district-wide seniority.
Transfers due to changes in school/class enrollments shall be initiated by the administration in the following manner:
Secondary transfers shall be initiated on or before the tenth (10th) student school day of each semester. Elementary transfers shall be initiated on or before the tenth (10th) student school day after the following natural breaks: a. The beginning of the school year for students;
b.	Parent/teacher conference day in the fall;
c.	The end of the winter recess.
8-3-2-2 Administrative Transfers Due to Unsatisfactory Work on the Part of a Teacher
Normally, when transfers are initiated based on unsatisfactory work, the following steps will be taken:
Step 1:	When a teacher's work performance is unsatisfactory, the principal
shall notify the teacher in writing, stating the reasons for the principal's dissatisfaction with the teacher's performance. The teacher shall have ten (10) teaching days in which to respond in writing to the principal's notice. A copy of the notice shall be sent to the Assistant Superintendent for Teaching and Learning and the Director of Human Resources who may offer, in writing, further corrective steps to be taken by the teacher after consultation with the teacher and the principal.
Step 2:	After notice has been given to the teacher, and after corrective
steps have been attempted, if the teacher's work does not improve to the satisfaction of the principal and appropriate administrator, and if in the judgment of the appropriate administrator a change in placement and assignment indicates a possibility for satisfactory work, a transfer to another building may be made before the end of the school year, normally to become effective at the beginning of the next school year.
Step 3:	The receiving principal shall be informed within a reasonable time
in advance of the teacher's transfer and shall be informed of the steps taken or to be taken in attempting to assist the teacher to make a satisfactory adjustment.
8-3-2-3 Administrative Transfers Due to Programmatic Needs of the District
Transfers may be initiated based on programmatic needs when:
19
	1.	The Minnesota Department of Education rules and/or regulations requires the course offering; 2.	The course offering is an elective and the offering is retained by the administration in the building curriculum; 3.	There exists a serious imbalance in the ratio of male/female teachers in physical education within a particular school so student locker-room supervision cannot be provided by a teacher of the same sex based on current staffing. 4.	Dual licensure is required for a position. Transfers will be implemented by district-wide seniority and licensure.
8-4	Special Assignment A teacher on special assignment is a teacher who holds a bargaining unit position for which the School Board requires special qualifications beyond those required by the Minnesota Board of Teaching or the Minnesota Department of Education. The specific job duties for the teacher on special assignment shall be defined by the school district. Lead teachers in special education are considered to be on special assignment. By notifying the Human Resources Office prior to February 1, a teacher on special assignment may return to a position in the bargaining unit similar to the one the teacher held prior to accepting the special assignment. Transfers from special assignment positions to other bargaining unit positions must conform to the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement. Notwithstanding Minnesota Statute 122A.40, a teacher on special assignment shall not be bumped from such a position due to the placement of a more senior teacher in the same licensure area on unrequested leave of absence.
8-5	Staffing Process The District and the RFT shall agree to a timeline for the staffing process for the following school year by February 1. 8-5-1	Internal Building Staffing Internal building staffing occurs after the district determines its district-wide staffing needs by licensure area and before positions are posted in Transfer Pool 1 and between the first and second posting of Pool 1. Internal building staffing may occur again after the transfer pools are closed. Assignments within a building and/or department shall be made by the building principal following consultation with the RFT chief building representative and the parties involved before any vacancies are openly declared. The principal has the final authority to determine placement within the building. The dates for internal building staffing are set by the School Board, based upon concurrence with the Federation President and the Human Resources office. A full-time teacher assigned to more than one building is considered assigned to that building which is the larger or largest portion of his/her total assignment. If the larger of the two (or the largest of more than two) portions are equal, between or among buildings, the teacher must designate which of his/her buildings is to be the assigned building for the school year by October 1 of the school year. This does not apply to parttime teachers, even if the teacher possesses the right to retain a full-time position as outlined in 6-14.
20
8-5-2	Displacement of Teachers from Buildings
After internal staffing occurs, it may be necessary to displace some teachers from one or more buildings. If this occurs, the teacher or teachers with the least district-wide seniority shall be displaced from the buildings by area of licensure and their names placed in Transfer Pool 1.
8-5-2-1 Building Closing
In the event of a building being closed teachers with continuing contract rights shall participate in a similar pool process prior to the district transfer pools described in 8-5-4-1 and 8-5-4-2.
8-5-3	No Bumping
No teacher may use the transfer provisions of the contract to bump from a building another teacher with similar licensure and area of teaching who may have less seniority in the district.
8-5-4	Transfer Pools
There shall be two Transfer Pools entitled Transfer Pool 1 and Transfer Pool 2. Teachers wishing to voluntarily transfer for the ensuing school year may participate in Transfer Pool 1 and Transfer Pool 2. Teachers involved in an involuntary transfer shall have their names placed in Transfer Pool 1, and if a position is not secured during Transfer Pool 1, shall have their names placed in Transfer Pool 2.
8-5-4-1 Transfer Pool 1
Transfer Pool 1 will include the following eligible teachers:
a.	Teachers involuntarily displaced as described in 8-5-2.
b.	Teachers returning from leave of absence.
c.	Teachers voluntarily seeking a transfer effective for the ensuing school year (not listed)
The hiring principal or administrator will select a teacher for the position. Seniority will not be used as the basis for selection.
8-5-4-2 Transfer Pool 2
Transfer Pool 2 will contain the names of the following:
a.	Teachers whose names were contained in Transfer Pool 1 who did not obtain a position for the ensuing school year.
b.	Teachers voluntarily seeking a transfer effective for the ensuing school year.
A teacher who voluntarily joins Transfer Pool 2 must notify Director of Human Resources, in writing. A teacher who chooses to participate in Transfer Pool 2 places his/her position and building assignment in the pool. Assignments for teachers whose names are in Transfer Pool 2 are determined based on seniority and area of licensure.
8-5-4-3 Closing of Pools
Transfer Pool 2 shall begin shortly after the completion of Transfer Pool 1.
Transfer Pool 2 will last until all teachers are contacted and make their selection.
8-5-4-4 Assignments That Occur After the Close of Transfer Pool 2
Teachers whose names are in Transfer Pool 2 and who did not select a position by the close of Transfer Pool 2 will be assigned to an existing vacancy by the Director of Human Resources.

APPENDIX B:	Co-Curricular Activities
ARTICLE I: Salary Calculations and General Procedures
Appendix B establishes the level of compensation for activities but does not guarantee that the District will offer a program or activity.
1-1 Salary
Salary is determined by multiplying the ratio times the dollar figure in 1-1-1 and 1-1-2. If part or all of the co-curricular activity occurs during the regular school day, a different salary schedule will be determined by the district based on the percentage of time spent outside the regular school day.
1-1-1	Athletic Sections
Calculations of 2007-2008 salaries for positions listed in the athletic sections of Articles II, III, IV shall be based on $60,483 that represents a 2 percent increase over the base used for 2006-2007.
Calculations of the 2008-2009 salaries for the same positions shall be based on $61,995, which represents a 2.5 percent increase over the base used for 2007-2008.
1-1-2	Fine Arts, Other and District-wide Activities
Calculations of 2007-2008 salaries for positions listed in the fine arts and other sections of Articles II, III, and IV and for positions listed in the district-wide activities section V, shall be based on $60,483 that represents a 2 percent increase over the base used for 2006-2007.
Calculations of 2008-2009 salaries for these same positions shall be based on $61,995, which represents a 2.5 percent increase over the base used for 2007-2008.
1-2 Experience
For all coaches and supervisors salary for the ninth (9th) year of experience in the same activity shall be multiplied by 1.1. Experience shall be defined as the cumulative number of years spent directing or coaching in the same activity whether the activity is men's or women's, the position head or assistant, or the middle school or high school. The coach/activity director must apply for this change in experience level on the proper form prior to the beginning of the season/activity.
1-3 Reports and Payment
a.	The sponsor of each activity that has a fee attached shall make a report in duplicate to the principal. One copy shall be forwarded to the coordinator of athletics.
b.	Payment of extra-curricular salaries shall be paid in accordance with the printed payroll dates. The first payment for directors or coaches of year-long activities shall be made prior to November 1.
1-4 Pay for Participation in Post-Season Tournaments
a.	Post-season pay benefits will only be paid to the number of coaches allowed by the Minnesota State High School League playing in post-season tournaments.
b.	Post-season pay shall be earned by coaches and assistant coaches the day after the team has won a first-round contest or advanced beyond a preliminary round.
c.	Head coaches will be paid $35 per day for each day of post-season practice or play. Assistant coaches will be paid $25 per day for each day of post-season practice or play.
d.	The band director and cheerleading advisor will receive $50 for each post-season tournament performance. No additional pay will be made for supervising practices or rehearsals.
44
1-5 Middle Schools
All appointments to positions under Article III, Middle Schools, shall be made by the middle school building principal or designee. A complete list of all appointments made by the principal under this schedule shall be filed in duplicate with the Director of Human Resources at the end of the first week of school and be made available to the RFT building representative upon request.
1-6 Scheduled Levels
Where more than one scheduled level of an activity is mandated by the Minnesota State High School League, where at least two-thirds of the Classic Lake Conference schools are offering that level, and where a coach is available, and where sufficient students exist to support each level, then such scheduled levels shall be provided by District 281 high schools, unless the specific level or entire program has been eliminated by the School Board.
1-7 Joint Federation/District Study Committee
The joint Federation/district study committee will study extra-curricular pay issues and make recommendations to the Federation and District negotiation teams.
1-8 Posting Extra-Curricular Positions
1.	When a vacancy occurs in an extra-curricular position, the principal shall make it known to the building staff through the Principal's Bulletin. The principal may also make the vacancy known to the district staff through a District internal posting or the Direct Line.
2.	If the position is not filled by a member of the building staff, the principal shall publish a District internal posting or notice in the Direct Line.
3.	The principal may also advertise the position to people other than the District 28l staff by any means of communication.
4.	If the position is not filled by a building staff member, it will not be filled until at least three (3) school days following notice of the District internal posting or Direct Line. As the District internal posting or Direct Line are not published during vacation periods, (summer, winter, spring), the three-school-days waiting period shall not apply; however, the principal will make an effort to inform people who might be interested.
5.	Assistant coaching/directing vacancies identified shortly before or during the season need only be publicized in the Principal's Bulletin before considering external candidates.
1-9 Filling Vacancies
The principal, in consultation with the building athletic/activities director, is given final authority to fill all positions listed in the extra-curricular portion of the Collective Bargaining Agreement unless directed not to by the Superintendent or the School Board. In filling extra-curricular vacancies, the principal shall strongly consider bargaining unit employees over non bargaining unit employees, and when selecting a bargaining unit employee, shall normally choose one assigned to the principal's building during the regular school day over one who is assigned elsewhere. Should the principal choose a non bargaining unit employee for an extra-curricular position for which one or more bargaining employees have applied, the principal shall inform the bargaining unit employee(s) as to the reason(s) in writing.
1-9-1	End of Year Review
Each head coach shall meet with his/her respective athletic director within four weeks of the end of the season. The coach will be notified at this meeting about whether he/she will retain this coaching position for the following school year. Normally a vacancy shall not occur merely because the coach has transferred to another building.

It is understood by the Federation and the District that all provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, except sections 10-1-2, 10-2-3, 10-2-1, and all of Article VII, apply to that class of employees referred to as Chemical Health Specialists. If there is any deviation from this understanding, it either is noted in the specific article and section, or is delineated below in this appendix.
Probationary Period
A newly hired chemical health specialist will serve an eighteen-month probationary period. The district may discharge a chemical health specialist at any time during the probationary period for failure to meet job expectations.

The chemical health specialist becomes a permanent employee after successful completion of the probationary period.
