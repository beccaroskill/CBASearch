Dear Local 25 Members:
The document you hold in your hand is the evidence of your victory in the hotel negotiations of 2004. It is also the standard of excellence for the New Local 25. Never before have so many of you been committed to change. Your commitment, your spirit and your determination are all here.
Many of you joined in actions in your shop. Hundreds participated in picket lines. Thousands of you were there during the historic negotiation sessions; You have a right to be proud of yourself and your Union - Local 25.
Our work is not yet done though. Together we will continue to build a strong and aggressive Leadership Committee. Together we will build the strength of Local 25 by bringing the power of the Union to workers who want and need what you have achieved.
As your elected leader, I salute you. I pledge to you that I will work hard to fulfill the goals and high standards you have set for our New Local 25. I am honored to have been part of this great victory.
John A. Boardman
Executive Secretary-Treasurer

ARTICLE I
Union Representation and Membership
1.1	Scope of Unit: The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative for the purpose of collective bargaining with respect to rates of pay, hours, and other conditions of employment for all of its employees, with the exception of managerial and supervisory employees, office employees, musicians, engineers, firemen, carpenters, painters, barbers, and upholsterers.
1.2	Gender: Whenever in this Agreement the masculine gender is used it shall be deemed to include the feminine gender.

1
employment with the Employer, shall become and remain members of the Union in good standing and shall remain members in good standing as a continuing condition of employment. An employee shall be considered to be in good standing within the provisions of this section if he or she tenders the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring and retaining membership in the Union. The Employer will notify each new employee in writing of the existence of this contract and the requirement that all new employees within the bargaining unit must, upon completion of thirty (30) days following the beginning of their employment with the Employer, become members of the Union in good standing. The Employer further agrees to discharge • any employee who fails to comply with this Uniun's security provision within seven (7) days of receipt of a written request to that effect from the Union.
1.4	Union Notification (New Hires):
(a)	The Employer shall notify the Union by electronic format compatible with the Union’s information systems, within seven (7) days, in writing, of the name, address telephone number, social security number, and classification of new or additional employees hired into the bargaining unit.
(b)	Electronic Transfer of Information: The Employer agrees that with respect to new hire information in Section 1.4, Union dues and Credit Union deductions in Section 1.6, time and payroll information in Section 2.4(c), information relating to extra room(s) sold in Section 10.3, cot placement pay records in Section 10.4, sick leave balances in Section 14.3, and gratuity records in Section B.25, the Employer, upon request by the Union, will transmit such information to the Union within a reasonable time (unless this Agreement sets a specific time), and in an electronic format which is compatible with the Union’s information systems (e.g., Microsoft Excel) except where such information is not reasonably available in an electronic format or where such transmittal is technologically infeasible or unreasonably costly. In such circumstances where such
2
information is not reasonably available in an electronic format or where such transmittal is technologically infeasible or unreasonably costly, the Employer and the Union shall agree to an alternative form of providing such information.
1.5	"Tools of the Trade” Clause:
. (a) It is recognized that managerial and supervisory employees are not covered by this Agreement, provided,-however, that no such persons shall normally be permitted to use the tools of the trade or perform any of the work or duties performed by employees who are covered. In the event managerial or supervisory persons or other persons not covered by this Agreement digress from the above, such persons shall be deemed to come under the terms of this Agreement and shall be required to become Union members as specified in Article I hereof.
(b) One bona fide supervisory and managerial employee who is the primary authority in a recognized department is excluded from the prohibitions of the above paragraph so long as he does not have a specific station within the kitchen, and does not fill a job classification outside the kitchen, and provided further that, in the event that an affected classification is on layoff, the excluded employee performs no more than the usual and customary tasks otherwise permitted under this subsection.
1.6	Deductions:

(b)	The Employer shall deduct dues from the first paycheck for each month and shall transmit the deducted dues to the Union no
3
later than the 20th day of that month. In the event an employee's first paycheck, because of priority deductions (i.e. FICA, withholding, etc.), Is not sufficiently large to permit deducting dues, the Employer shall deduct dues from the second paycheck and shall transmit the deducted dues to the Union no later than the 27th day of that month.
‘(c) Credit Union: The Employer shall deduct from the wages and transmit to the Local 25, AFL-CIO Credit Union such amounts as the employees shall authorize in writing.
(d)	The Employer shall transmit to the credit union by the 15th day of each month ail moneys deducted during the previous calendar month.

1.7	Initiation Fee Procedure For Newly Hired Employees: To the extent not contrary to law, the Employer shall provide new employees with dues checkoff authorization cards for execution by such employees on a voluntary basis at the time such employees execute the appropriate tax withholding form. The Employer shall check off the moneys so authorized in the first paycheck issued following the Employer's receipt of such authorization from the employee or the Union. Such dues checkoff authorization cards shall be supplied by the Union and may provide for the continuation of such dues checkoff i n the event the employee transfers to another hotel belonging to the Hotel Association of Washington, D.C., upon said hotel being notified by the Union of such transfer. The Employer shall provide a list of all employees on its payroll who have not
4
executed such authorizations along with their dates of hire, social security numbers and addresses, and shall keep such list current on a weekly basis. This may not be construed as evidence that the Association is an employer or joint employer of any of the employees covered by the Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the Association is not an employer or joint employer of any such employee.
1.8	Equal Employment Policies: It shall be the policy of the parties to provide equal employment opportunities, including promotions, to all qualified workers, irrespective of race, color, creed, sex, national origin, age, disability, union activity, or sexual preference.

(d)	Leadership Committee members may perform their duties on behalf of the Union on the premises of the Hotel during non-working or off-duty time, provided that they do not interfere with the work of bargaining unit members who are on duty. Leadership Committee members who enter the establishment outside of their rcgtrlarfy-scheduled work hours shall, upon entering, notify the Hotel at a place designated by the Hotel and shall follow the Hotel's entry process.
(e)	Leadership Committee members shall be entitled to use one (1) day of sick leave each year for the purpose of attending Union training or seminars.

(a)	In most cases, it would suffice for the employee to provide an explanation in sufficient detail to enable the supervisor to make a judgment as to whether sick leave is justified.
45
(b)	Some cases require more, but the proof need not be in any particular form, nor must it be the strongest and best proof possible, Verification could be in the following forms:
1.	A doctor's letter would, be appropriate but should not be an absolute requirement-since there may be illness without the attention of a doctor.
2.	A druggist’s prescription might be adequate; or
3.	A written statement from the employee's spouse, neighbor, or fellow worker might suffice.
4.	The nature of the proof must ultimately depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.

ARTICLE XVII
Grievance and Arbitration Procedure
17.1	Grievance Procedure: In the event a grievance or misunderstanding arises out of and during the term of this Agreement, such disputes shall be processed as prescribed below. It is agreed that any differences arising incident to negotiation of terms of a new Agreement are not subject to this section, the sole purpose of which is to make subject to arbitration grievances arising out of and during the term of this Agreement.
17.2	A grievance shall be presented in writing within thirty (30) days from the date of the incident or occurrence giving rise to the grievance. The written grievance shall be signed and dated, and shall contain a statement of facts describing the grievance, including
50
the contract provision(s) at issue, the names of affected employees (or a description of such employees in the case of a class action), and the resolution requested by the grieving party. It is understood that the Union shall not be precluded from introducing additional information as it is developed during the Union's subsequent investigation. In discharge cases, failure to file a grievance within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of discharge by the Union shall result in a waiver of the grievance and all rights under this Grievance and Arbitration procedure.
In all other cases, failure-to file a grievance within ninety (90) days from the date the incident or occurrence was known by the Union shall result in a waiver of the grievance and all rights under this Grievance and Arbitration procedure.
Step 1.
Upon the filing of a written grievance as set forth above, a meeting shall be held between the Employer and the Union no later than ten (10) -working days after the filing of the grievance to discuss the issue(s) raised in the grievance and any relevant facts. The Employer shall designate at least one manager (i.e., supervisor, department head, human resources director, etc.) who shall serve as the Employer's representative at this Step 1 meeting and shall have the authority to resolve the grievance, and the Employer shall also make available for this meeting the manager who is most familiar with the relevant facts surrounding the grievance. At the Union’s request, and upon reasonable notice, the Employer shall make available any other manager who has personal knowledge of such relevant facts. The Union shall be represented by a representative from Local 25, a Leadership Committee member, or both, and the Union's Executive Secretary-Treasurer shall also have the right to attend at his/her discretion. The employee or employees involved in the grievance may also attend. If a grievance involves a group of
51
employees, up to four employees may attend. The parties may mutually agree to additional Employer, Union and employee representatives. Prior to a Step 1 meeting, the parties will disclose the names of all participants who will attend the Step 1 meeting.
At this meeting, the parties may agree on a resolution of the grievance, or the grievance may be denied. If the grievance is denied, the Employer shall submit to the Union a written response to the grievance within ten (10) working days following the Step 1 meeting. This written response shall be signed and dated and shall set forth the reasons for the denial of the grievance (including a statement of facts, contract provision(s), and any other, information relevant to the Employer’s denial of the grievance). If the Employer does not provide a written response within ten (10) working days of the Step 1 meeting, the grievance shall be upheld and the relief requested shall be granted; provided that the relief requested is not unreasonably excessive or inconsistent with controlling legal authority.
Step 2.
If the grievance is not resolved at the Step 1 meeting, and the Union wishes to proceed with the grievance, the -Union shall, within ten (10) working days after receipt of the Employer's Step 1 response, advance the case to mediation. Mediation shall be conducted by a mediator mutually agreed upon by the HAWDC and the Union. Mediation sessions shall be held at least once every two weeks, and at such other times as mutually agreed-upon. To advance the case to mediation, the Union shall submit to the Mediator the grievance papers (j.e., copies of the grievance and the Employer's response), together with a copy of any information provided to the Union by the Employer, and shall specify the date of the mediation. The Union shall provide the Employer with written notification of its
52
submission to the Mediator and the date of the mediation. Grievances not timely advanced to mediation shall result in a waiver of the grievance and all further rights under this Grievance and Arbitration procedure.
Step 3.
Grievances not resolved at Step 1 or Step 2 may proceed to arbitration pursuant to Section 17.3. Arbitration shall be requested in writing within fifteen (15) working days following the mediation, or the grievance shall be considered waived.
17.3	Selection of Arbitrators: A permanent panel of five (5) arbitrators agreed upon by the parties shall arbitrate all cases on a rotating basis during the life of this Agreement. The parties agree to the following as the panel of arbitrators to hear cases in rotation (subject to availability): Roger Kaplan, Joseph Sharnoff, Nicholas Zumas,, and Richard Bloch (contract cases only). The parties may by mutual agreement make changes to this panel. Vacancies in the panel by reason of preemptory deletion, death, resignation or other inability to serve, shall be promptly filled by the parties by mutual agreement.
17.4	Arbitration Hearings:
(a)	Grievances not resolved in either Step 1 or Step 2 shall be scheduled for arbitration on the next scheduled date in the month following the date of the Step 3 written request for arbitration (e.g., if the Step 3 request is made in September, the grievance shall be heard on the next available arbitration date in October). The parties agree that the third and fourth Thursday of each month shall be reserved for arbitration hearings. One of the panel of arbitrators shall be scheduled for the third Thursday and a different panel arbitrator shall be scheduled for the fourth Thursday in each month. Cases which are not scheduled for hearing on one of the set arbitration dates shall be scheduled for a mutually agreeable alternative date before the next panel arbitrator scheduled in the rotation, but in no
53
event shall any grievance be heard later than sixty (60) days after the Step 3 request for arbitration, except upon written stipulation of the parties. For the purpose of scheduling hearings, (a) termination cases shall take precedence over contract cases, (b) earlier cases shall take precedence over later filed cases.
(b)	Arbitration hearings of non-precedent setting cases (including all cases involving discharge or discipline of employees) shall be conducted without stenographic transcripts or pre-trial or post-trial briefs unless the parties otherwise stipulate or the arbitrator otherwise directs. Within ten (10) days following the conclusion of the hearing, the arbitrator shall issue a written award u/i+hni if nnininn iinlcicc fha r\cir+icir hw Arfrnnmnnt
W < I I > I i	LIIV	VII	I_/J| t VVH I I U	ulv
arbitrator to issue a full written opinion.
(c)	Arbitration hearings of cases which are precedent setting and do not involve discipline or discharge shall ordinarily be conducted without stenographic transcript. If one party desires a transcript, the cost of the transcript shall be borne by the party choosing to obtain the transcript, with the further understanding that a copy of the transcript will also be made available to the other party and the arbitrator. Further, a party may request that briefs be filed in such cases. In such cases where briefs are filed (unless by mutual Agreement), the losing party will pay the Arbitrator's fee in total. Within twenty (20) days following the conclusion of the hearing or the filing of briefs, the arbitrator shall issue a written opinion and award.
(d)	Any compensation required to be paid to the arbitrator shall be borne equally by the parties hereto, except as stated in (c) above.
(e)	Except upon stipulation of the parties, (i) continuances shall be granted only upon a demonstration of good cause, and (ii) any arbitrator fees imposed because of continuation of any hearing date shall be the sole responsibility of the party requesting such continuance.
54
17.5	Provision of Information:

In all cases not involving discipline or discharge, the Employer shall provide the Union, prior to the Step 1 meeting, with all relevant information requested by the Union in writing at or before the time the grievance is filed, provided that such information is reasonably available to the Employer (as defined above).
(b)	Any information required to be produced under subsection (a) and reasonably available to the Employer (as defined in subsection (a)) but not provided to the Union prior to the Step 1 meeting shall not be introduced as evidence by the Employer in a subsequent arbitration of the grievance, except by mutual consent. Prior to the Step 2 mediation, the parties shall provide each other with all relevant documents which are reasonably available to the party (including those relevant documents requested by the other side). Any relevant documents which were reasonably available to the party prior to Step 2 and were not so disclosed shall not be introduced as evidence, in a subsequent arbitration, except by mutual consent.
(c)	With respect to all grievances, the parties, prior to the date of the arbitration hearing, shall provide to the other side all relevant documents reasonably available to them that either (I) they intend to introduce or rely upon in the arbitration hearing, or (ii) were requested by the other side, and shall be prohibited from introducing any documents in the arbitration hearing which are not so disclosed, except by mutual consent.
55
17.6	Employer grievances shall commence at Step 1 anc proceed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article.
17.7	Implementation of Settlements and Awards: When a grievance is settled between the Employer and the Union, or is resolved by an Arbitrator, the settlement or award, including any monetary payment, shall be implemented within one week of the settlement or award, except where the award or agreement between the parties provides for a different time period for implementation.
17,8	Arbitrator's Authority to Restore or Preserve the Status Quo: A party who believes, reasonably and in good faith, that a violation of its rights under this Agreement has occurred, or will imminently occur, which will result in irreparable harm, may upon actual notice of two (2) calendar days to the other party, apply to an arbitrator for an order requiring that the status quo be restored or preserved until such time as the underlying grievance has been heard and decided by the arbitrator, The arbitrator authorized to hear an application for an order under this Section shall be the arbitrator who would normally hear cases on the next regularly scheduled hearing date, as provided in Article 17.4(a). The underlying grievance shall be heard by the arbitrator on the next regularly-scheduled hearing date, and such hearings shall take priority over hearings for any other cases scheduled to be heard on that date. The arbitrator shall issue an award within five (5) calendar days after the close of the hearing held under this Section.
17.9	Time limits set forth in this Article may be waived by mutual written agreement between the Employer and the Union.
17.10	Effective for instances which arise after the effective date of this Agreement, an Employer found by an arbitrator to have willfully failed to properly pay employees shall be liable to the affected employees for, in addition to the unpaid amounts, interest in the amount of ten percent (10%) per annum. It is understood that this provision shall not apply to situations where the Employer has
56
a good faith belief that its interpretation of the pay provision in the Agreement is correct.
ARTICLE XVIII No Strike Provision
18.1	No Strikes; No Lockouts: Except for the failure to submit to arbitration or to comply with the decision of an arbitrator, he Employer shall not declare any lockout during the life of this Agreement and the Union shall not cause, call or ratify any strike, stoppage of work, slowdown or picketing during the life of this Agreement.

57

(a)	Employees shall not be assigned an unreasonable workload, recognizing that certain situations or emergencies may require reasonable extra efforts in order to maintain the proper level of guest service.

(b)	If an Employer makes changes which result in a significant increase in the workload of employees in any classification during the term of this Agreement, the Employer will advise the Union of the changes and will discuss the workload increase and whether a modification in workload, compensation or other accommodation or recognition is appropriate.
(c)	If the Union believes that the workload is unreasonable, it may submit the issue to expedited arbitration; provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the hotel from instituting the change. In determining whether an increase in the workload is unreasonable, the arbitrator shall determine whether employees in the classification can reasonably complete their duties within the normal shift with reasonable effort and efficiency.
(d)	In determining whether an increase in the workload is unreasonable, and, if so, what remedy is warranted, the arbitrator shall consider objective factors, including, but not limited to: (1) the current workload in effect; (2) whether the workload has decreased due to contemporaneous or past changes; (3) the amount of time required to perform the additional duties; and (4) whether the
59
additional work is more physically demanding. The Union shall not be restricted from claiming that the cumulative effect of changes in job duties has resulted in an unreasonable workload that warrants accommodation under this section. The Union shall have the burden of proof.
(e)	Nothing in this Article limits the Union from availing itself of any other rights or remedies provided under this Agreement,
ARTICLE XXI Savings Provision
21.1	If any provision of this Agreement or part thereof is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a body of competent jurisdiction, the parties shall meet to agree to new terms that most closely effectuate the intent of the parties in drafting the language found to be invalid or unenforceable.

Re: Article 3.4 Work Day Schedules (Spread of Hours)
Dear Glenn:
The following should once and for al! clear up the confusion surrounding which classifications fall under which spread of hours.
(A)	Full-time employees:
- All food and beverage employees except those listed below in (C)
(B)	Non-tipped service employees:
- All non-food and beverage employees, except bellstand employees, except where the bellstand has a precedent for less hours
(C)	Full-time food service employees:
- Waiters, waitresses, buspersons, captains and hostesses
I hope this will resolve this matter
Sincerely,

EXHIBIT “C”
In a layoff the employee with the least classification seniority is aid off first. He can then bump into a previously held classification eased on classification seniority which is counted from the employees entry date into the classification. An employee continues o accrue classification seniority even after he transfers into a new classification. If there is no employee with less classification seniority in the previously held classification, the employee is laid off even if he has greater house seniority than someone in his current classification. The same is true for recall.
Examples:
I.	Employee A:
Busboy - 1/80;
Room Service Waiter - 1/82;
Waiter - 1/83
Employee B:
Room Service Waiter - 1/81.
Employee A is laid-off as a waiter. In seeking to bump into a previously held classification, he may not bump employee B in room service because employee B has more room service classification seniority. Employee A may bump any busboy who is hired after 1/80.
II.	Employee A:
Waiter - 1/82;
Room Service Waiter - 1/85
Employee B:
Waiter - 1/84.
Both employees are laid off, and employee A is unable to bump into a waiter position. When recalling, employee A is recalled first, because he has greater classification seniority.
Purposes of determining layoffs and recall, room service waiter and other waiters are separate classifications.
