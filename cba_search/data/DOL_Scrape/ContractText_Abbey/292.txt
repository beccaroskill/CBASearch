However, the Corporation shall not be required to promote an employee at time of layoff unless he has previously performed the higher-rated job and is able to do the work.
3.	Local supplemental seniority agreements may provide that an employee in one seniority group who thereafter is laid off, and who desires to displace an employee in another seniority group as set forth in this Subsection shall, within two (2) weeks of notice of such layoff, apply in writing to do so at his plant Employment Office. Such an applicant shall be recalled within thirty (30) days after layoff or, if not recalled within that time period, at the time lesser seniority employees are being recalled to the other seniority groups to displace an employee with less seniority in another seniority group in the same classification or in a classification that he previously held the work of which he satisfactorily performed, provided he has thirty (30) days more seniority than the employee he displaces and he is qualified to perform the duties of the employee he displaces. Employees placed under this Subsection shall enter the new seniority group with full ranking for seniority, and their seniority in other groups shall terminate. The Corporation shall have five (5) working days after the Union files a written grievance in which to correct any error in the application of this Subsection.
Local engineering supplemental seniority agreements may provide that employees assigned to engineering classifications who transfer from one noninterchangeable occupational group to another noninterchangeable occupational group may 44
continue to accumulate seniority in their former noninterchangeable seniority group.
4.	For the purposes of Paragraph 3., the phrase "in a classification that he previously held" includes (i> classifications that appear on the employee's employment record, the work of which he satisfactorily performed for the Corporation since his last date of hire, regardless of whether or not it was then a bargaining unit position, and (ii) a job in the unit, the duties of which, as set forth in the job description thereof, the employee satisfactorily performed in the unit although the classification does not appear on the employee's employment record in his present unit. In the event of a dispute under this Paragraph 4., the employee’s employment record shall be controlling.
The provisions of Paragraphs 3. and 4. of this Subsection (a) shall not require any change in the Corporation's practices or procedures with respect to recording the classification of employees.
(b)"Temporary Layoff Procedure.
1.	Employees may be laid off for five (5) working days according to seniority by classification in each department. If such layoff exceeds five (5) working days, the Union may request in writing the Plant Management to adjust the working force according to seniority, by department, division, or occupational group. Plant Management shall then do so within five (5) working days thereafter, unless said time is extended by mutual agreement. During such adjustments, including those instances where it is anticipated a number of such adjustments will occur on a regular recurring basis, Management will
45
endeavor to give consideration to retaining senior employees when time and circumstances permit, or
2.	Local Supplemental Seniority Agreements may provide that when there is a temporary layoff, employees on each shift in each classification and in each department or such groupings of departments performing substantially similar work as may be agreed upon locally will be laid off as follows:
(a)--Probationary employees will be laid off.
(b)--Employees with less than six (6) months of seniority will be laid off according to seniority.
(c)-Employees with six (6} months or more of seniority will be laid off in the inverse or descending order of their seniority with the most senior employee being laid off first provided that the employees remaining at work have the present ability to perform the available work without breakin. Employees will be advised of the expected duration of the layoff and their scheduled return date. However, such employees may elect to remain at work and if able to perform the available work will be permitted to do so in the same seniority order up to the number of employees required. Employees laid off under this Subsection (b)2.(c) shall not be eligible for placement in other plants of the Corporation pursuant to Section (54), Work Opportunity for Laid Off Employees.
(d)--lf the expected duration of the temporary layoff is subsequently extended to a later but definite date, employees laid off pursuant to Subsection (b)2.(c) above will be afforded the option of returning to work on the date originally
46
scheduled or remaining on layoff for the duration of the extended period. An employee who elects to return on the originally scheduled date will displace the junior employee on the shift in the classification in the department.
(e)--(i) If it becomes necessary to recall employees laid off under Subsection (b)2.(c) above prior to the date originally planned, they will be recalled in the ascending order of their seniority with the most junior such employee in the department on the affected shift and classification being recalled first.
(ii) If, after employees are laid off under Subsection (b)2.(c), it is determined in a department that the layoff will be extended for an indefinite period of time, the workforce in the department Including those employees on layoff will be adjusted within ten (10) working days thereafter in accordance with Section (52) (a), Layoff Procedure-Indefinite Layoffs.
(f)--If the duration of a temporary layoff is expected to exceed ten (10) working days, the Local Union will be so notified. At the request of the Local Union the Management will consider employees on all shifts in a department as being on one shift for purposes of Subsection (b)2.(c). In a temporary layoff of such expected duration, the Local Union may request the Management to waive the Temporary Layoff provisions set forth in Subsection (b)2.(c) and Management will reduce the working force according to the Indefinite Layoff provisions as set forth in Section (52)(a). Either of such requests shall be made in writing within twenty-four (24) hours of the time the Union is notified of the layoff.
47
(g)--Further, prior to each temporary layoff affecting fifty percent (50%) or more of employees in each department, the Management and the Local Union may agree to combine the existing shifts for the purpose of applying the inverse seniority concept. The parties recognize the number of employees which can be interchanged between shifts will vary between departments depending upon the nature of operations, the skills and experience required, etc. Any such agreement must result in maintaining an experienced, qualified workforce with the present ability to perform the available work without break-in. If combining shifts prevents the twenty-four (24) hour notice of layoff required by Section (51), such requirement is waived.
It is understood and agreed that the application of this provision shall be for temporary layoffs that are scheduled to last one or more lull weeks.
If the International Union believes that in a particular plant the agreements set forth under this Subsection (b)2.(g) are being unfairly applied, they may take up any such requests which it believes meritorious with the Corporate Union Relations Staff.
(c)-Engineering Group Layoff Procedure. The provisions of this Subsection (c) shall only apply when employees, as set forth below, are placed on indefinite layoff.
1. Within forty-five (45) days after an engineering employee is placed on indefinite layoff from his plant in the Detroit area (Wayne, Macomb and Oakland Counties), the laid off employee shall displace the junior employee (provided such employee has twelve (12) months less seniority 48
than the laid-off employee in the same engineering classification in another bargaining unit of the same group or in another plant in the same group and bargaining unit if a bargaining unit consists of employees in two (2) or more plants), provided, however, that this Agreement shall apply only as hereinafter designated:

SALARY GRADES AND PROGRESSION APPLICATION SUPPLEMENT
This Memorandum of Understanding supplements the current National Office and Clerical and National Engineering Agreements between DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORPORATION and the INTERNATIONAL UNION, UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW), and certain of its Local Unions as follows:
(1)	Salary Grade Systems
Salary grades are numbered in a consecutive series for all classifications. Automatic Progression increases have been provided for all grades.
(2)	Progression
The progression range is that portion of the salary range from the minimum of the grade to the top progression rate for the grade. For the purpose of computing six (6) month progression increases, credit will be earned only for those months in which an employee works the majority of workdays in the month. Days worked will include regular vacations and all days actually worked in the Monday through Friday workweek. Overtime, days for which Salary Continuation payments are made, or other absence will not be considered as days worked. Progression time shall not be accrued tor time worked at the top progression rate or in the merit range of a grade. An employee whose salary is within the progression range of the employee's grade will receive progression increases, not to
102
exceed the maximum of the employee’s grade, of tw"pement (2^0%)i of the employee's basesalary. Anemployee whose salary is less than twppercent '(2.0%)' below the top progression rate shall receive a two percent (2.0%) progression increase provided the new salary is within the merit range of the employee's grade and not in excess of the employee's grade maximum. If a progression increase places an employee’s salary within one percent (1%) of the maximum of the employee's grade, the employee's salary shall be adjusted to the maximum.
(3)	New Hires
An employee will be hired at the minimum of his classification unless Management determines that an employee's qualifications and experience warrant a higher salary.
(4)	Transfers--! ntra-PI ant
An employee transferred within a plant or office in the same bargaining unit or under the provisions of the Group Layoff Procedure regarding the placement of certain laid off Engineering employees will be transferred in accordance with die following provisions:
(aj-Within the same grade. An employee transferred from one classification to another classification in the same grade will be transferred at the employee’s current salary and all credited time accrued in that grade will be applied for progression within the progression range.
(b}«To a higher grade. (i)--An employee promoted from one grade to a higher grade will be paid not less than the minimum of the higher grade. If such increase is less than four percent (4%) for an employee promoted to grades 2 through 8, the 103
employee's salary will be increased to provide at least a four percent (4%) increase. If such increase is less than five percent (5%) for an employee promoted to grades 9 through 18, the employee's salary will be increased to provide at least a five percent (6%) increase. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, in no case will the employee’s salary be increased above the maximum for the grade to which the employee is promoted. The employee will begin a new progression period effective with the date of transfer.
The provisions of Section (4) (b) are applicable only to an employee’s initial promotion to a higher grade. Accordingly, Section (4) (b) is not applicable to an employee who, as the consequence of a reduction in workforce, is transferred from one grade to a lower grade and who is subsequently transferred either to a higher grade lower than the highest grade previously held or to the highest grade previously held provided the time lapse between the transfer to a lower grade and the transfer to the higher grade does not exceed five (5) years. In such a case the employee’s salary is to be determined with reference to the applicable Sections excluding Section (4) (b).
(it)--A salary increase calculated as provided in Section (4)(b)(i) will also be applicable to an employee who is reclassified from a classification in one grade to a classification in grades 2 through 18 as Wie result of a determination that the work performed by the employee warrants the application of such higher classification.
If Management determines that an employee's qualifications and experience warrant a salary higher than the salary resulting from the application
104
of (4) (b) (i) above, they may at their discretion increase the employee to a higher salary in the new grade.
(iii)--Temporary transfer. When an employee is assigned for a temporary period to a job which is classified on a higher salary grade than the employee's regularly assigned job and such temporary assignment exceeds one (1) week, the following provisions shall be applicable:
(t)--Temporary job assignments are intended to cover such situations as coverage for fluctuations in work loads, replacements for employees who are absent from work because of vacations, short-term illness and other short-term leaves of absence.
(2)-An employee so transferred will be advised in advance of the temporary nature of such assignments and will be reclassified to the higher classification and grade, and the employee's salary rate shall be adjusted in accordance with Section (4)(b>(i> of the Salary Grades and Progression Application Supplement.
(3)-An employee who is transferred to a temporary position which is on a higher grade and who within one hundred twenty (120) days of such transfer is transferred again to the grade from which the employee was transferred shall, upon transfer to such lower grade, receive the same salary Ute employee received in the lower grade immediately prior to the employee’s transfer. If an employee is eligible for additional progression increases, upon transfer to the lower grade, the time spent in the higher grade wll be credited toward completion of tite required credited time toward the next
105
progression increase in the lower grade.
(4)--An employee who is transferred to a temporary position and who exceeds one hundred twenty (120) days on such job and is then transferred to a lower grade shall have the employee’s rate determined in accordance with Sectton (4)(c), To a Lower Grade, of the Salary Grades and Progression Application Supplement.
(c)-To a lower grade. An employee transferred from one grade to a lower grade will be transferred:
1.	At the same salary if the employee's current salary falls within the progression or merit range of the lower grade and a new progression period begins effective with the date of transfer.
2.	To the maximum salary of the lower grade if the employee’s current salary exceeds the maximum.
3.	An employee who is transferred to a higher grade and, at the employee’s own request, is transferred again to the grade and classification from which the employee was promoted, shall receive the same salary earned in the lower grade immediately prior to promotion and the time and salary on the higher grade shall not be used for subsequent transfer and salary determination.
4,	An employee who is transferred to a higher grade and classification and who, within six (6) months of such transfer, is transferred again to the grade and classification from which the employee was promoted due to the employee's inability to satisfactorily perform the work of the higher grade,
106
shall, upon transfer to such lower grade and classification, receive the same salary the employee earned in the lower grade immediately prior to his promotion and the time and salary on the higher grade shall not be used for subsequent transfer and salary. It the employee is eligible for additional progression increases, upon transfer to the lower grade, the time spent in the higher grade will be credited toward completion of the required credited time toward the next progression increase in the lower grade.
(d)-To a higher grade previously held. An employee transferred to a higher grade previously held by the employee shall be transferred either at the same salary earned when previously on the higher grade, or at the employee's present salary rate, whichever is higher, and shall receive credit for time accrued toward the next progression increase that the employee earned when previously employed on the higher grade, provided the employee was actively employed on the higher grade within the past five (5) years.
(e}~To a higher grade lower than the highest grade previously held. An employee transferred to a higher grade which is lower than the highest grade previously held by the employee in the past five (5) years shall be transferred at the salary earned when previously employed on the highest grade, but not to exceed the maximum of the new grade, or at the employee's present salary, whichever is higher, but the employee will not be credited with any accrued progression time.

Management determines that the employee's qualifications and experience warrant a higher salary. In no case shall an employee be paid a salary in excess of the maximum salary for the grade.
(d)-To a higher grade previously held. The salary earned by an employee when previously employed in the higher grade shall be used in determining the appropriate salary upon transfer or hire from layoff under the provisions of Paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) above, provided the employee was actively employed on the grade within the past five (5) years.
(e)-To a grade higher than any grade previously held. The salary earned by an employee in the highest grade previously held shall be used in determining the appropriate salary upon reclassification or hire from layoff under the provisions of Paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) above, provided the employee was actively employed on the grade within the past five (5) years.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING NEW TECHNOLOGY
The Corporation is mindful of the Union's concern regarding the scope and work content of job classifications of represented employees and how each may be affected by advancing technology. The Union has also voiced concern about the possibility the new, technologicaily impacted bargaining unit work will not be awarded to represented employees because they are insufficiently trained to perform it.
In view ol the parties' interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with new and advancing technology, the parties shall review skill requirements and ensure that employees' skill levels match work assignment requirements. The parties will identify appropriate specialized training programs so that employees will be capable of performing new or changed work normally performed by represented personnel. The parties shall also attempt to address issues where employees, despite their best efforts, are unable to adequately adapt their skills to changes resulting from advancing technology.
During these negotiations, the parties have recognized that technological progress, better toots, methods, processes, equipment or materials have improved the quality of work life and standard of living for all employees, as well as the Corporation's competitive position. Over the years, the scope and work content of job classifications of both represented and non-represented employees have been changed by the methods and processes associated with technological progress.
139
Advancing technology has created, and wilt continue to create, new and more complex problems bearing upon the work content of job classifications of employees represented by the Union. It is not the Corporation's policy to assign to non-represented employees work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at a particular plant location or unit. The Corporation recognizes that mere novelty or sophistication of new technology alone is not grounds for withdrawing work from represented employees. At the same time, it is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of performing a work function will not serve to shift the work function from represented to non*represented employees.
In this regard, the National Committee (comprised of an appropriate number of Union and Management members of the current Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee will meet periodically to discuss the development of new technology, methods and processes at the Corporate level and its possible impact upon the scope of the bargaining unit. The parties may also discuss other matters concerning new or advanced technology as well as opportunities for additional value added business which could be undertaken on a competitive basis for redeployment of employees impacted by new technology that may be referred by local unions or by local managements as well as any claims of erosion of the bargaining unit, occasioned by the introduction of new technology. The parties will also discuss other matters concerning new or advanced technologies that may be referred by UAW 140
Sourcing Representatives as issues arise in their day-to-day interaction with their respective platforms.
In addition, the Corporation agrees to continue to provide advanced written notification to the International Union and the impacted Local Unions at a location planning the introduction of new or advanced technology before the implementation of such technology so as to permit meaningful discussions of its impact, if any. Examples of situations where notification should be given are;
A.	The first introduction of a technology as compared to previously existing plant or unit technology.
B.	Introduction of a new, more advanced generation of existing technology having a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
C.	Introduction of a new application of existing technology which has a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
The written notification will describe the technology, involved, the anticipated impact on the Bargaining Unit, the equipment being introduced, its intended use and the anticipated installation datefs).
The Local Plant Management Representatives shall meet with the Local Union Representatives to review the various matters of concern relative to the Introduction of the new technology involved.
During those discussions the	Unit
Chairman/President shall include, as appropriate and necessary, other Local Union Representatives 141
such as the Local Union President or a representative from the Local Skill Development and Training Committee, in order to review the various matters of concern relative to the introduction of the new technology involved. In the event the introduction of technology eliminates current jobs, the parties may explore redeployment opportunities for affected employees to meaningful assignments including regular productive assignments and "non-traditional" work, and/or identify opportunities for additional value added business which could be undertaken on a competitive basis.
Likewise, the Local Management Representatives shall include representatives from appropriate functions, including, but not limited to, Manufacturing Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Human Resources in order to enhance meaningful discussions. Those discussions shall take place with all parties present as a group or separately according to individual disciplines as practicable.
Jointly, the Corporation and the Union shall seek to Identify appropriate specialized training programs to afford maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology and shall submit to the UAW/DaimlerChrysler National Training Center their recommendations for any training programs intended to assist present employees to perform work within the bargaining unit which Is new or changed as a result of technological improvement.
in the event the Vice President and Director of the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department considers it appropriate, he may arrange a meeting with the Vice President of Employee Relations of the 142
Corporation to discuss the impact of such technological changes and any proposed responses to such changes.
Any problems not resolved in such discussions may be submitted to the grievance procedure, or to any other procedure on which the parties may agree.	■

6,	Overlapping Salary Ranges
The Corporation and the Union agree that neither party, in any arbitration proceeding involving the correctness of the classification of an employee, shall argue as the basis of their respective positions that the salary of an employee in the overlap portion of the classification salary range should be determinative of the correctness or incorrectness of the classification of the employee.
7.	"Red Circle" Employees
An employee whose base salary exceeds the maximum rate authorized for the classification and grade assigned shall have any general or improvement factor increase calculated as a percentage of the maximum rate applicable to the employee's classification/grade and not on the employee's "red circle" salary.
6. Learner Classifications
Classification Nos. 50100, Learner - Drafting -Body; 52100, Learner ■ Drafting • Chassis; 54600, Learner - Model Maker; and 70100, Learner -Drafting - Electrical, are primarily intended for employees who perform elementary assignments in their respective areas of work within such classifications, thereby, providing an opportunity for them to acquire the necessary degree of skill and proficiency required for promotion to their respective basic classifications. An employee on one of the above designated classifications shall be advanced to a higher classification in the employee’s respective area of work within a one (1) year period unless there are unusual circumstances which would require the employee to spend
161
additional time on the respective Learner classification to acquire the necessary degree of Skill and proficiency required for promotion to the respective basic classification. The Engineering Staff shall make periodic reviews of the performance of each employee in Classification Nos. 50100, 52100, 54800 and 70100, so that the employee is advanced to the appropriate higher classification upon attaining the required degree of skill and proficiency.
9.	Chassis and Electrical Checking
Classifications
in determining the propriety of applying Classification No. 52000, Product Designer II or Classification 70900, Electrical Designer II to individual employees who, on a regular and recurring basis, are checking designs and layouts, such determination will be based on the nature, scope and complexity of the checking duties. Classification Nos. 52000 and 70900 will not be deemed inappropriate solely because such employee is not creating designs of major components and making complete and comprehensive designs or performing preliminary and advance work in the development of designs.
10.	"A" Level Classifications - Manufacturing Engineering
If an employee on an BAH level classification is transferred to a "B" level job having the same title as the ''A'1 level classification from which the employee is being transferred, such employee will continue to be classified on the "AM level classification and will continue to receive the same salary unless the "B” level job to which the employee is transferred is tn another plant in which
162
event the employee’s salary shall be determined in accordance with the Inter-Plant provisions of the Salary Grades and Progression Application L	Supplement as applied to the grade of the
employee's "A" level classification, and if the employee is subsequently returned to a bona fide "A" level job in the employee's classification, the L	employee's salary wilt then be determined in
’	accordance with Section (4)(d) of the Intra-Plant
j	provisions of the Salary Grades and Progression
Application Supplement as if the employee were being transferred to a higher grade.
11.	Clerk-Typist
The Corporation is willing to review with the Union those jobs in which the Union claims a minimal amount of typing is actually performed, and for which reason the Union claims such jobs do not need a fully qualified typist. If the investigation shows that an employee has sufficient typing ability to justify the typing needs for such jobs and is otherwise able to perform the job, then the Corporation will not disqualify such employee solely because of failure to meet the speed and accuracy requirements for a fully qualified typist.
In agreeing to this review, the Corporation does not waive its right to require employees to meet the requirements of a typing test nor does it waive its right to determine that a job does, in fact, require the capabilities of a fully qualified typist.
12.	Tabulating Machine Operator
The Corporation, upon receipt from the Union of the name of an employee classified on Classification No. 13700, Tabulating Equipment
163
Operator - Junior, who the Union claims is performing the duties of Classification No. 13800, Tabulating Equipment Operator - Senior, will review the actual job duties of such employee. If the results of the review show that the employee is performing work of an advanced nature, then the Corporation will not base its determination relative to the proper application of Classification No. 13800	j
to such employee solely on the degree of the board	1
wiring duties of the employee's job.
13.	Classification No. 37500, Analyst - Parts
Cost
Classification No. 37500, Analyst - Parts Cost, grade 6, is applicable to employees whose primary duties on a continuing basis are as set forth in the salaried position description, dated December 8, 1952 for Classification No. 37500.
14.	Transfer to Class 37700, Trainee - Parts	i

15.	Phase-Up Classifications
During the course of National Negotiations since 1971, the Corporation and the Union have agreed on a number of phase-up classifications and methods of administering such classifications as follows:
(a)	An employee who has actually worked for the Corporation on the base classification for the stipulated length of time shown on the Phase-Up Classification and Requirements Chart shall be reclassified to the appropriate phase-up classification provided the employee has performed satisfactorily on the base classification.
(b)	Where indicated in the "Other Requirements" column, time spent on classifications other than the base classification will be combined for credit for reclassification to the phase-up classification, provided the employee has performed satisfactorily on these other classifications.
(c)	Management will advise the Union of the reasons for its decision in those instances in which it determines an employee is not to be reclassified pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding.
(d)	Only the period of time during which the employee worked for the Corporation and was
166
actually classified on die required classifications as reflected in the employee’s personnel records, shall be included except as provided in (e)(u) below.
(e)	(i) Only the time worked since the employee’s last date of hire with die Corporation shall be counted. Time worked on appropriate classifications prior to a permanent break in Corporate service or seniority shall not be included. Time spent on temporary separations such as layoff, illness or injury, or other leaves of absence during which die employee was temporarily separated from die active roll shall not be counted as time worked on die classification.
(ii)	A returning veteran who, prior to entering military service had been assigned to a C-E-T classification which has phase-up applications, may have such applicable service time credited tor phase-up purposes as time actually worked on die classification of record at the time of the military leave of absence. Such credited time will be applied only if the veteran was employed by Chrysler Corporation on such classification upon entering military service and reinstated on the same classification upon completion of military service.
(f)	Time worked on other salary or hourly classifications, no matter how similar in nature to the appropriate salary classification, and regardless whether or not such salary or hourly job may have been accepted in lieu of a layoff, shall not be included as time worked on the appropriate salary classification.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SALARIED WORKERS' EMPLOYMENT SECURITY SYSTEM
The Corporation and the Union are committed to enhancing the job security of DaimlerChrysler Corporation employees. The parties also recognize that such job security can only be realized within a work environment which promotes operational effectiveness.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to this Salaried Workers' Employment Security System (SWESS) Program, and have pledged to work together consistent with this Program and other provisions of the National Agreements to enhance the Corporation’s competitive position.
The cornerstone of the SWESS is a commitment to certain pre-determined salaried workers’ employment levels (SWELs), a series of SWEL Benchmark Minimums, and protection against indefinite layoff tor eligible employees as expressly provided herein.
f. SCOPE OF SALARIED WORKERS' EMPLOYMENT SECURITY SYSTEM
Salaried Workers Employment Levels
(A). Salaried Workers Employment Levels (SWELs) (i.e., numbers of eligible employees or positions covered by this program as defined herein) initially shall be established as of Wie effective date for each Unit as listed in the Index of Units contained in the Office, Clerical and Engineering Agreements.
177
The Jt 99$ initial SWEL for each Unit was determined as being equal to the sum of 1) the number of active employees with one or more years seniority at work and on-roll in the Unit, or Group on the effective date.: 2) the number of active employees with less than one (1) year of seniority occupying SWEL slots on the Effective Date; and 3) the number of unfilled new hire obligations as of the Effective Date due to application of the outsourcing/new hire provisions of the 1999 Agreement (Article II (B) 2,c,). Such active employees will be SWEL eligible and the term active employee will include an employee at work as well as an employee not at work who is:
1.	on vacation,
2.	receiving bereavement pay,
3.	on jury duty,
4.	on any leave of absence of ninety (90) days duration or less,
5.	on temporary layoff, and
6.	any other employee having a direct attachment to the active workforce.
SWEL Benchmark Minimums
(B)	A series of SWEL Benchmark Minimums will be established for each Unit effective' September 30, 2003 equal to 90% of the Unit's Initial Salaried Workers' Employment Level as of the Effective Date of the 1999-03 Agreement, "These newly established Benchmark Minimums will, then remain fixed for the duration of the new Agreement, except for other adjustments (e.gj bperations transferred)required , under the Agreement,1
Covered Event
(C)	.A covered event hereunder is any event that absent the protection provided herein, would
178
cause the layoff of one or more SWEL eligible active employees for any reason except those actions or events specified in Section I.D. below.
The obligation to provide benefits hereunder shall not arise unless one (1) or more covered events would otherwise result in a reduction or further reduction during the term of this Agreement, in the number of SWEL eligible active employees.
Excluded Events
(D)	. No employee will be laid off during the term of this Agreement except for the following reasons:
1), Volume related declines attributable to market related conditions as described in SWESS Letter (85), SWESS Program - Volume Related Layoffs- SWEL, not to exceed forty-eight (48) weeks (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks except for shutdowns taken during periods of model change-over or plant rearrangement) over the term of this Memorandum of Understanding;
2)	. Acts of God or other such reasons beyond the control of the Corporation;
3)	. The sale of a part of the Corporation’s operations as an on-going business;
4)	. Where the employee has been recalled or reassigned to fill an opening known in advance to be temporary; or
5)	. Model change or plant rearrangement until the employee otherwise would have been recalled.
An employee impacted by any of the above reasons is, if otherwise eligible, covered by the
179
appropriate Supplemental Agreements which are attached to the National Agreement as Exhibits.
(E)	. The number ot employees Protected by the Salaried Workers' Employment Security System will be the equivalent ot the employees within the SWEL who would otherwise have been laid-otf as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph I.D,	(
II. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SWEL -	<|
ELIGIBILITY
Following the initial determination of a Unit SWEL, it will be adjusted as follows:
(A)	. An employee shall become SWEL-eligible for any of the following reasons, at which point the Unit SWEL will be increased by one (1) position for < each such employee: (1) an employee in the active workforce, as defined by Paragraph LA. who had less than one (1) year seniority on the effective date of the Agreement who subsequently attains one (1) year of seniority; (2) an employee with one (1) or more years seniority who is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SWEL, and who is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the Effective Date; (3) an employee with less than one (1) year seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SWEL, who	.
subsequently attains one (1) year seniority and is I actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week ’ period ending after the Effective Date; (4) an ! employee newly hired/rehired after the Effective	!
Date who attains three (3) years seniority; (5) an	.
employee deemed to be eligible, recalled or newly hired in order to satisfy a SWEL Benchmark ,
180
Minimum. Notwithstanding the above, the National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing (JSOES) Committee is authorized to establish special mechanisms, including SWEL eligibility provisions for the purpose ot attracting new work.
(B)	The ypit SWEL will be reduced for the attrition ot eligible employees who quit, retire or die.
(C)	.Unit SWELs and Group SWELs (if appropriate) will be adjusted in the event of a transfer of operations or consolidations between Units on a one-for-one basis by reducing the sending Unit's SWEL and increasing the receiving Unit's SWELs by the corresponding number of jobs involved in the transaction. Similarly, corresponding adjustments will also be made to the SWEL Benchmark Minimums of each affected Unit and Group.
(p). Each employee who leaves the Bargaining Unit for a permanent Non-Bargaining Unit salaried position will be replaced immediately with no effect on tiie Unit SWEL For each Non-Bargaining Unit salaried employee returning to the bargaining unit, the Unit SWEL will be increased by one (1). The transfer of an employee between Hourly and Salaried Bargaining Units will cause the Unit BEL or SWEL for the Bargaining Unit receiving the employee to increase and the other to decrease.
(E)	SWEL-eligible employees off roll will maintain their eligibility upon reinstatement.
(F)	Notwithstanding the above, SWEL Benchmark Minimums will not be established for a facility determined to be closing.
191
(G)	SWEL Benchmark Reviews/Actions
1.	Following the fast pay ending of each month and within ten (10} working days of the following month (SWEL Benchmark Review), the number of SWEL-eligible employees in each Unit and Group shall be compared to the Unit's and Group's corresponding SWEL Benchmark Minimum. Adjustments will be made consistent with the provisions of this Memorandum, and attrition replacement obligations will be fulfilled as set forth below.
2.	When the number of SWEL-eligibfe employees in the Group exceeds the Group Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-two basis by recalling employees on layoff in accordance with the procedure described tn Section (3)(b) below.
3.	When the number of SWEL-eligible employees in the Group would otherwise fall below the Group Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-one Group basis by the following actions in order to maintain eligible employment at the Benchmark Minimum:
a.	First, by allowing an Ineligible active seniority employee at the affected facility to become eligible.
b.	Second, by recalling employees on layoff from that facility, and employees on Return to Home Plant. Next, the highest seniority volunteer on the combined Labor Market Area List would be called, in accordance with Section IH(D). If there are no employees on that list, the employee with the highest seniority between the Out of Labor Market Area List and the Return to Former Labor
182
Market Area List would fill the opening on a voluntary basis.
c.	Or third, by hiring new employees up to the net number of jobs outsourced minus those insourced (as defined in MOU-10 of the Agreement and determined by the National Committee) subsequent to the Effective Date. Such positions will be filled on a Unit SWEL basis no later than ninety (90) days following the SWEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected Unit is encountering market-driven, volume-related layoffs or has employees in protected status for reasons other than sourcing actions.1
4.	Notwithstanding the above, the net outsourcing/new hire obligation provided in Section (3)(c) above shall be activated earlier than required therein if and when the number of SWEL-eligible employees is less than the greater of: (1) the SWEL Benchmark Minimum for the quarter; or (2) 90% of the Group's Snapshot SWEL under the 1999 Agreement.
5.	If, after fulfilling the above requirements, subsequent attritions would cause the number of SWEL-eligible employees in the Group to fall below the Group's Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on the following basis:
a.	When the number of SWEL-eligible employees is greater than 90% but less than 100% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each three (3) attritions.
b.	When the number of SWEL-eligible employees is greater than 80% but less than 90% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each two (2) attritions.
183
c.	When the number of SWEL-eligible employees is below 80% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each one (1) attrition.
d.	Such positions will be filled on a Unit SWEL basis no later than ninety (90) days following the SWEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected unit is encountering market-driven volume-related layoffs or has employees in protected status for reaspnsjjfher than sourcing actions.
6.	Employees recalled, hired or rehired to fulfill the above obligations may be assigned within their Unit at Managment's discretion, subject to applicable seniority provisions of the Agreement.
... In the”event there are any hire obligations that remain unfilled 120 days after the SWEL Benchmark Review upon which they were 'established, including new hire obligations carried forward from the 1999-03 Agreement, the National Committee at the direction of the Vice PresidentDirector of the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department and Senior Vice President-Employee Relations; DaimlerChrysler Corporation, will jointly determine how, where and when these obligations are to be fulfilled, taking into account the current and future hiring requirements of the affected Unit and other Units, the cyclical nature of demand in the industry, the timing of product plans and insourcing actions, and a joint commitment to fulfill these obligations as expeditiously as possible f
7.	In the event new hire obligations are fulfilled through the placement of new employees at a Unit other than the one at which the obligations were created, SWELs for the respective Units will
184
be adjusted on a one-for-one basis, by reducing the SWEL at the Unit where the openings occurred by the number of new hire fulfillments and correspondingly increasing the SWEL(s) at the Unitfs) where the new hires were placed. Similarly, offsetting adjustments will also be made to the SWEL Benchmark Minimums of each affected Unit.
If on the adjustment date the SWEL number results in less than a whole number, the Engineering Method of Rounding will be used to determine the SWEL
HL PROTECTED EMPLOYEES
A. If an event, other than those described in l.(D), would otherwise cause the number of SWEL eligible employees to be laid off, die employees so Protected as provided for in I fCj, will be placed on Protected status, after application of the seniority provisions of the National and Local Seniority Agreements.
B.	The parties recognize that covered events may occur during the course of this Agreement that will cause die number of SWEL Protected employees to exceed the Corporation’s production requirements. The parties recognize further that the scope of this Program requires flexibility with regard to the assignment of such employees and the selection of employees for training. In this regard, the Local Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee will insure that assignments are made on a basis consistent with the seniority provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and local Seniority Agreement while also meeting plant needs, minimizing workforce disruption and enhancing the
185
personal growth and development of employees. After a decision by the Local Committee, an available Protected employee may be (1) placed in a training program, (2) used as a replacement to facilitate the training of another employee, (3) placed in a job opening at another DaimlerChrysler Corporation-UAW plant or unit provided there is no employee on layoff with a seniority recall entitlement to such opening, and no employee on layoff in the same labor market area who would otherwise be entitled pursuant to Section (54), of the National Agreement, unless otherwise directed by the National Committee, (4) given a job assignment within or outside the bargaining unit which may be non-traditional, (5) placed in an existing opening or (6) given other assignments consistent with the purposes of this Memorandum of Understanding,
C.	For in the Labor Market Area Placement, job opportunities will be filled in seniority order from a combined list of Protected and laid off employees in the same Labor Market Area. The number of Protected employees made available for placement cannot exceed the number of employees who have been laid off for the duration of the forty-eight (48) week volume related layoff limit. For placement purposes, employees on the Labor Market Area list will be offered, in seniority order, the opportunity to volunteer for openings based on a canvass at the time of layoff or placement into Protected employee status. Volunteers will be placed in seniority order. Absent volunteers, the junior employee on the combined Labor Market Area list must transfer to the new location. The Unit SWEL will be increased by one (1) at the location to which the employee is transferred ,_and reduced by one (1) at the location from which the employee transferred, unless the
186
transfer satisfied the SWEL, in which case the SWEL will remain file same at both locations.
Employees permanently transferred to another location may remain at the secondary location until laid off from that location, at which time they may elect options available under Section 54(c) of the National Agreement, or elect to return to their "home" unit under the terms and conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding - Return to Home Plant (Office and Clerical only),
A Labor Market Area is comprised of all plants within a fifty (50) mile radius of a given plant or larger as may be agreed upon by die National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee.
Out of Labor Market Area employees will be offered the opportunity to volunteer. If the employee refuses the opportunity, he/she will remain at his/ her facility.
D.	In the event there is an opening due to a volume increase, the highest seniority available Protected employee, seniority permitting, will be placed in this opening, unless the Local Committee determines the employee should first complete the employee's current assignment. If seniority employees are on layoff from that plant, a number of such employees, equivalent to the number of Protected employees placed in openings due to volume increases, will be recalled from layoff. A Protected employee transferred to another DaimierChrysler-UAW plant due to a volume increase who is subsequently laid off from the secondary plant due to a volume decrease will be returned, should he/she so elect, to available
187
openings at the employee's home plant, seniority permitting.
E.	A layoff caused by an event described in 1. (0) will have no impact on the number of Protected employees except for an employee who is protected from a layoff attributable to a market-related volume decline in excess of forty-eight (48) weeks (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks except for shutdowns taken during periods of model changeover or plant rearrangement), in such instances, those Protected employees having the least seniority will be laid off and replaced by an equivalent number of greater seniority employees who would otherwise have insufficient seniority to remain in the plant.
F.	The parties agree that any non-traditional work outside of a bargaining unit, which has historically been performed by rion-represented personnel, given to a represented employee who is Protected, shall not be used by the Union as a basis for a claim of Erosion of said work in i) any other instance or job where the same or similar work is performed by non-represented personnel, or it) when such assignment is terminated and the work is returned and/or continued by nonrepresented personnel.
G A Protected employee will continue to receive his/her regular straight-time salary. In the event a Protected employee is assigned to another classification, the employee will receive the rate of pay as provided by the National Agreement.
H.	Protected employee assignments will be considered temporary and not subject to provisions governing permanent filling of vacancies or the application of shift preference, except for
188
assignments to fill openings resulting from volume increases. Experience gained from these temporary assignments will not be used to advantage such employees over other employees for selection to fill permanent vacancies, nor will such employees have seniority in the department to which they have been temporarily assigned.
I.	An employee replaced by a Protected employee will receive his/her regular straight-time salary, and will be returned to the same classification and job assignment upon completion of the replaced employee's assignment. In the event the employee has insufficient seniority to return to the formerly held classification, the employee will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Local Supplemental Seniority Agreement.
J.	If an employee would have been promoted or transferred pursuant to Sections (€0) or (61) of the National Agreement or placed in an Apprentice Program were it not for participation in a training assignment provided by this Program, the employee will be so transferred upon completion of the training assignment. In the event the employee would have been selected for an Apprentice assignment, or if entering a new non-interchangeable occupational group, the employee's date of entry will be adjusted as if the employee's assignment had not been delayed.
K.	While it is suggested that a replaced employee returned to a job assignment under this Program will be credited with al) overtime hours the employee worked while out of the equalization group, but not with the overtime hours the employee would otherwise have worked in the group had the employee not been replaced by the
189
Protected employee, the issue will be resolved by the focal management and the local unit. In the event they are unable to reach a mutual resolution, the aforementioned suggested mechanism shall apply.
L.	A training assignment will be voluntary on the part of an employee being replaced by a Protected employee, unless such training is to develop or improve technical skills relevant to the employee's current job assignment or anticipated future job needs.
M.	Subject to the direction of the National Committee, no Protected employee will be temporarily assigned to a job outside of the bargaining unit unless on a voluntary basis except for those employees subject to Section (52)(c), Engineering Group Layoff Procedure.
Outside the Labor Market, permanent transfers of Protected employees are voluntary. Such an employee will remain Protected at his/her facility upon refusal to transfer.
N.	A Protected employee who is permanently transferred out of the Labor Market Area in accordance with this Paragraph, or if so transferred later accepts a recall at a former location, will be eligible to receive a relocation allowance as provided in the Exhibits to the National Agreement after providing documentation satisfactory to Management that the employee has changed permanent residence and relocated. Married applicants may initially apply for the "single employee" amount and within one (1) year, the balance of the "married amount," when their families are relocated. Applicants may receive a maximum of two (2) such relocation allowance
190
payments during trie term of this National Agreement. A Protected employee temporarily transferred out of the Labor Market Area who does not change permanent residence as a result of the transfer will receive reasonable transportation and living expenses for the duration of the assignment. Any problems connected with the above may be raised with the National Committee.
O.	In the event the National Committee determines that the number of Protected employees exceeds the number of expected openings at the plant or units within its Labor Market Area within the next succeeding twelve (12) months, Special Programs as set forth in Attachment A may be triggered upon prior approval of the National Committee. There-after, to the extent Protected employees still exceed expected openings, such employees, under the direction of the National Committee, may be transferred out of the Labor Market Area pursuant to Section ULM., above. The National Committee may also explore the extension of Attachment A to other locations to create job opportunities for excess Protected employees within the Labor Market Area.
P.	Earnings, including wages and wage related payments, received by employees while on Job Security assignments, will be charged against the maximum liability amount. The cost of benefits and other payments made or incurred on behalf of Protected employees, specifically, health care (including dental and vision), group insurance, pensions, legal services, training fund contributions and FICA will be charged against the maximum liability amount. Moving allowance payments and the cost of benefits provided under Attachment A of the Memorandum of Understanding will not be charged against this liability. Earnings received 191
and the cost of benefits and other payments made on behalf of protected employees while assigned to fill permanent job openings resulting from volume increases or assigned to other regular and productive work (e.g., absentee replacements) will not be charged against this liability.
Q.	Charges against the Corporation's liability will commence with the first payments made to eligible employees and will continue until the maximum liability is reached or the expiration of the Program as provided in this Memorandum of Understanding, whichever occurs first. The records of such charges will be maintained by the Corporation and will be available to the Union at appropriate times.
IV. ADMINISTRATION OF THE SALARIED WORKERS’ EMPLOYMENT SECURITY SYSTEM
The Corporation and Union agree that:
(A)	. At each bargaining unit covered by this National Agreement, a Local Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee will be established to administer the Program.
(B)	. The membership of the Committee will consist of the local Plant Manager, or the manager's designated representative, and other representatives selected by Management on behalf of the Corporation. On behalf of the Union, the membership will consist of the Local Union President and the affected Unit Chairperson or President.
(C)	. The duties of the Local Committee will be:
192
1.	Review Local employee accessions and separations relative to the Unit Salary Workers' Employment Level (SWEL) provided for in Paragraph 1(A).
2.	Review the number and status of available Protected employees on a monthly basis, specifically noting the potential impact on this group of attritional and volume related events, as well as future manpower requirements. Other pertinent subjects as mutually agreed upon may also be considered proper subjects for discussion.
3.	Monitor the initial placement of an employee whose job is impacted by an event covered in Paragraph l.^p)\
4.	Monitor the placement of Protected employees. In this regard consideration should be given to both the nature and duration of the assignment following the guidelines contained in this Memorandum of Understanding. Coordinate with the National Committee the placement of an employee outside the job or Labor Market Area as defined in Paragraph lll.(p)'.
5.	Monitor permanent layoffs caused by the events described in l.(pj.
6.	Participate in discussions regarding sourcing decisions as outlined in Memorandum M-10 on tine subject of sourcing.
7.	Participate in discussions, in lieu of the Local parties referenced in the Memorandum of Understanding Regarding New Technology as it pertains to Salaried Workers, regarding the introduction of new technology as provided for in said Memorandum.
193
a. Review attrition and changes in the workplace. As required, develop plans to replace attrition, including the use of hires to meet operational needs when other appropriate placement sources have been exhausted. The local parties are required to report monthly that appropriate communications have taken place; upon the request of the National Committee, the local parties may be required to provide detailed information to support their monthly joint reports.
9.	Review the manpower requirements of forward product, facility and business plans, maintaining the confidentiality of the material being evaluated.
10.	Plan and coordinate the assignment of Protected employees in their home unit, and with the National Committee the relocation of such employees to other plants or units in or outside the labor market area and the application of Special Programs to such employees and active workforce employees as described in Attachment A to this Memorandum of Understanding.
11.	Design non-traditional work assignments for Protected employees where practicable both within or outside the bargaining unit.
12.	Review any complaint regarding the administration of the SWESS Program. Refer unresolved complaints to the National Committee, utilizing the appropriate form. The National parties will limit the review of complaints to those raised, in writing, within sixty (60) days of a SWEL Benchmark Review or other event giving rise to the complaint unless the time limit is waived by the National Committee. Only those matters governing
194

ATTACHMENT B
GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS
The Corporation and the Union recognize that quality and operating efficiency are inextricably wed to job security, and that a high level of quality and
202
operating efficiency requires mutual respect and recognition of each other's problems and concerns. Accordingly, in addition to the Local Job Security, Operations Effectiveness and Sourcing (JSOES) Committee's responsibilities for the SWESS Program and participation in discussions provided in related Letters of Understanding, each committee will focus on cooperative efforts toward our common goal to improve the effectiveness of operations and remove barriers to improvements, increase job opportunities and fully utilize the work force. The Local Committees will jointly develop a plan through an exhaustive analysis of the location's operational efficiency.
Within (6) six months of the effective date of the Agreement, each Local JSOES Committee will review with Divisional/Group Management and the International Union the overall competitiveness of the location's products and their plans indicating actions, and/or changes needed to improve quality and efficiency at their location and to stimulate job security of the existing work force and attract new work. Such plans must then be approved by the National JSOES Committee.
The National Committee will oversee implementation and administration of these Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Plans. Members of the National Committee will meet jointly with Local Committees to discuss the importance of job preservation and job creation, reasons for the commitment to increase operational efficiency, suggest possible topics for consideration, and encourage good-faith efforts to develop and implement meaningful local plans.
203
_ In the event there are any hire obligations that remain unfilled 120 days after the SWEL! Benchmark Review upon which they were established, including new hire obligations carried forward from the 1999-03 Agreement, the National Committee at the direction of the Vice President; Director of the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department and the Senior Vice President-Employee Relations,' DaimlerChrysler Corporation, will jointly determine! how, where and when these obligations are to be! fulfilled, taking into account the current and future hiring requirements of the affected Unit and other; Units, the cyclical nature of demand in the industry,-the timing of product plans and insourcing actions ■ and a joint commitment to fulfill these obligations as ‘expeditiously as possible/
The National Committee will be available on an ongoing basis as a resource to Local Committees and will review progress at the local level at least on an annual basis.
In these efforts, it is recognized that a great deal of initiative and imagination will be required by the local parties. While not intended to limit such innovation, the following are examples of appropriate areas the local parties may address:
1.	Identification of investments in the facility or equipment necessary to improve product quality or operational effectiveness;
2.	The establishment of joint work efforts to achieve common goals;
3.	The identification of non-labor cost savings and efficiencies;
204
4.	Procedures end plans Io review past outsourcing and outside contracting decisions, and identify opportunities for insourcing and new business.
5.	The examination of new forms of work organization, such as job assignments relating to Just-in-TIme or other quality enhancement systems;
6.	Procedures to review supervisory staffing and support for the initiatives in this Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing section of the SWESS Program;
7.	Initiatives to reduce excessive absenteeism;
8.	Procedures for improved access by the Local Joint Committee to product plans and other information affecting employment security and operational effectiveness, assuring confidential treatment of such information;
9,	The establishment of work tasks and assignments that fully utilize employees;
10.	The examination of alternative work schedules which provide greater employment opportunities.
Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness may require change or waiver of certain agreements or practices. It is understood that any such waivers, modifications or changes would not be effective unless agreed to by the local parties involved and approved in writing by the Union Relations Staff of the Corporation and the DaimlerChrysler Department of the Union. Such changes would be effective only at the location(s) specifically designated.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING SOURCING
During the 2003 negotiations the Union raised numerous concerns about the Corporation's sourcing actions and the impact on employment opportunities. To that end, the Corporation wil! work wittr and assist the Union at both the Locai and International levels to preserve jobs, replace jobs which may be lost by outsourcing action, and to create jobs for Protected employees and laid off employees. It is the Corporation^ intention to grow the business by increasing market share through new product offerings,! and to continue to rely upon its employees and facilities as the source of its products. However, the opportunity to grow the’ business may be limited by market conditions, or the availability of funding for new product investment,! The Corporation agrees to incorporate the procedures and structure outlined herein when making sourcing determinations during the 2003 Agreement.
National Committee Members
The parties have agreed to maintain the National Job Security, Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee (National Committee), comprised of Corporation and Union representatives. The National Committee shall be co-chaired by the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW (or his designated representative) and the Senior Vice President ot Employee Relations (or his designated representative). The members of the National Committee shall have specific responsibility tor
206
interfacing with individual vehicle Product Teams (their equivalent and/or successors).
ProductTeam Sourcing Meetings
The Corporation and Union representative for each (Product Team will meet on an as required basis, as frequently as weekly, but no less than twice a month.
In order to facilitate these discussions, the Corporation shall also appoint one (1) Product Team Specialist from each Product Team to ensure that information regarding Product Team sourcing is provided on a timely basis to the designated UAW Sourcing Representative for the respective Product Team while new or redesigned vehicles are being developed, and to serve as the Corporation representative through whom the UAW Sourcing Representative may arrange for a meeting to present their competitive in-house alternatives to Corporation^ sourcing decisions. In addition, the Product Team Specialist shall be responsible for advising the UAW Sourcing Representative of meetings, which may occur as frequently as weekly, but no less than twice monthly, and assuring access to same, regarding Corporation sourcing decisions’. The Product Team Specialist Ml..ajso , provide notice of potential make/buy studies, along with prototype and related salaried sourcing information. With such early access to and involvement in the sourcing decision-making process, the UAW Sourcing Representative shall be able to develop an in-depth understanding of their respective Product TeanTs sourcing patterns along with the possible impact which sourcing decisions may have on the hourly and salaried bargaining unit(s). They strati meet upon request with senior members of the Product Team so as to
207
gain information and knowledge and to provide input into sourcing_patternsand sourcing determinations for that Product Team,
Pre-Program Start _______ ________________
.... In order to involve the UAW Sourcing Representatives at the earliest stages of the product creation cycle, quarterly discussions wilt be conducted with the Vice President of Advance1 Vehicle Engineering (AVE) and/or Product Strategy; at die Pre-Program Start phase.
ProgramStart Meeting
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern relative to full involvement at the earliest stages of the decision-making process._To that end, the Corporation Product Team Specialist shall inform the respective UAW Sourcing Representative of New Major Vehicles or Major Redesigned Vehicles at the Program Start Meeting. Information discussed at this meeting will typically include program objectives, <CDS quality gatej dates, marketing objectives and customer requirements, and potential assembly and stamping plant loading capability.
Ch^slerDeyeiopment System(CpS)
It is imperative that sourcing discussions and notification become an effective and trusted tool. Jt is recognized that early involvement by the UAW in the COS process will greatly enhance the chances for mutual success and will not jeopardize the product creation objectives of quality, speed to market, product innovation, and lower total cost.
The Corporation^ continuing objective is to further compress the CDS process timeframes and improve speed to market. The timing for achieving various CDS process quality gate dates will
208
fluctuate depending on the risk inherent in each product program. Therefore, future sourcing notification timing wifi vary uniquely with each prograrn on a case-by-case basis. Specific CDS quality gate target dates will be disclosed at the Program Start Meeting. The reality ot variable program timing and ongoing system change dictates frequent and structured communication for effective sourcing discussion and notification.
'Supplier Selection Period
The International Union will be notified in writing by the Corporation of plans to proceed with a new or redesigned vehicle, sub-system or component part. At or around the completion of the Preliminary Program Specifications (Rahinenheft) date, provided in foe Program Start Meeting, the National Committee Co-Chairs, Administrative Assistant(s) to foe Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW, Assistant Director of foe DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW responsible for Sourcing, other designated senior management representatives, and the appropriate UAW Sourcing Representative(s) shall be provided a Program Overview by senior Product Team management. Such information shall include a review of current sourcing patterns, including the names of suppliers producing components for the current vehicle, any passible changes in assembly, sub-assembly, stamping, power train and other component sourcing patterns which have been identified by the Product Team, possible insourcing opportunities, targeted market and cost objectives, and technology which may impact the represented workforce.
All contemplated sourcing decisions which impact tooling programs, process changes, die
209
construction, die design, tool design, stamping * tooling, assembly tooling, processes, technology and design and prototype work at Assembly, Stamping, Power Train and Component manufacturing locations shall also be provided subsequent to the Program Overview^ With the information provided during the Program Start Meeting, Program Overview and subsequent meetings, and as appropriate during the meeting cycle with the UAW Trades Effectiveness Coordinator, the UAW Sourcing Representative may provide input or alternatives to sourcing pattern(s) during the Supplier Selection Period which coincides with the Program Start Meeting and the Final Program Specifications (Lastenheft) date. If, during these meetings, issues between the UAW Sourcing Representative and their respective Product Team cannot be resolved, the matter may be referred to the National Sourcing Council (Council) for early resolution. The Council shall consist of the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW, Administrative Assistant(s) to the Vice President and Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW, Assistant Director of the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW responsible for Sourcing, Executive Vice President of Manufacturing, Executive Vice President of Product Development, Vice President of ^Corporate Quality and Senior Vice President of Employee Relations, and other appropriate designates. The Council may meet to review issues brought to their attention by either party in the interest of reaching a resolution which serves the mutual goals and competitive challenges of the parties.
Final Program Specifications (Lastenheft)
Assuming the Program has received approval, on or around the completion of the,Final Program
210
Specifications (Lastenheft), the UAW Sourcing Representatives and UAW Trades Effectiveness Coordinator shall be provided updated and confirming sourcing documentation of the types provided during the Supplier Selection Period as notification of contemplated changes in sourcing patterns. The Corporation's Product Team Director of Program Management and Product Team management will also supply a copy of such documentation to the Union Relations Sourcing Administration office. This documentation, which will provide the design and engineering sourcing information and prototype sourcing information where different than the production source, shall be forwarded to the appropriate Salaried Local President or Unit Chairperson.
National Committee representatives will monitor sourcing, address sourcing concerns, as well as monitor and oversee employment levels and the administration of the SWESS Programs. They shall be provided timely access to all data, including financial and cost information, to evaluate potential sourcing actions and their impact on UAW-represented jobs.
The National Committee shall meet on a quarterly basis. At the quarterly meeting, data regarding work brought in-house and work outsourced will be provided and discussed. Moreover, the members of the National Committee shall be advised of all Appropriations Requests as they are received, including the number of potential jobs affected. (In addition to providing hard copies, the Corporation will provide a summary of this data on a computer disk.)
Roundtable Meeting
211
An annual Roundtable Meeting will be conducted involving senior management from Source Planning, Procurement and Supply, Product Strategy, Engineering, Manufacturing, Union Relations and the National Committee and the leadership from the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department, The agenda for meetings will include a review of vehicle plans for assembly, stamping, power train and components. Related Source Planning actions to support these plans also will be the subject of the meeting,
it is understood that the Corporation's frank discussion with the Union about sourcing and related plans may require the Union to keep information confidential until the Corporation consents to its release. The Corporation, on its part, also agrees not to use the results of such discussions to obtain more attractive contract terms from outsiders in lieu of keeping the work in-house.
Power Train Meeting
An annual Power Train Meeting will also be conducted by senior management from Power Train Operations for the National Committee and the leadership from the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department. The agenda for meetings will include a review of the Power Train Long Range Plan (LRP) and the anticipated effect on Power Train plant product loading.
Sourcing Rationale
The rationale for sourcing actions will consider the following criteria: the degree to which the Corporation’s resources can be allocated to further capital expenditures, cost, technology, timing, quality, statutory requirements, proprietary rights, overall financial stability of affected facilities,
212
occupational and related environmental health and safety issues, the impact on related facilities, and the impact on long-term job stability. Other factors considered by the Corporation before a final sourcing decision is made will include the effect on employment, and job and income security costs on both a short and long-term basis. Such criteria shall give equal weight to the full impact of a sourcing action on DaimlerChrysler Corporation-UAW represented employment levels and the job and income security of DaimlerChrysler Corporation-UAW represented employees. The National Sourcing Committee may form Joint Task Forces to ensure full implementation of such criteria throughout the Corporation and, on an as needed basis, to address any specific sourcing areas of concern identified by the Union.
The National parties will jointly further develop the above criteria to be used to address sourcing issues. In developing financial criteria, appropriate Corporate return on investment and burden will be considered. Pertinent criteria will be applied consistently in comparisons of internal and external supply capability.
Local Committee
The appropriate member(s) of the National Committee will assist the Local Job Security, and Operational Effectiveness and Sourcing Committee (Local Committee^ in implementing the provisions of the Sourcing Memorandum. If the parties cannot resolve a sourcingjssue, the Local Union may file a grievance at the third step of the regular Grievance Procedure. If the grievance cannot be resolved, the grievance may be appealed to the Appeal Board in accordance with the Grievance Procedure. In file event the Appeal Board is unable to resolve the issue, it may be appealed to the Impartial
213
Chairman. The Impartial Chairman can only provide a remedy where he finds that (1) a violation of the express commitments set forth in this Memorandum has been established; (2) the established violation resulted from the exercise of improper judgment by Management; and (3) any employee who customarily would perform the work in question has been laid off or was allowed to remain on layoff as a result of work being outsourced or not being brought in-house. The Impartial Chairman's remedy shall be limited to back wages for the affected employees, and the recall and/or placement of affected employees on regular productive work.
Temporary Offloading
When a temporary offloading action is being contemplated, the Plant Manager or his designate will provide to the President of the Local Union, a written notice containing the reasons under consideration for the temporary offloading at that location. The notice of the offloading action will be given as soon as practicable, consistent with the reasons such offloading becomes necessary and expected date of return. Copies of this notice also will be provided to the UAW Assistant Director responsible for sourcing and other National Sourcing Council members.	.
Temporary offloading notification is not intended to provide a means for circumvention and abuse of the normal outsourcing notification procedures outlined in this Agreement. Should circumstances arise that an offloading action may be viewed as no longer temporary, the local parties will meet to discuss their respective concerns relative to the projected return of the work. Should these issues remain unresolved at the Local Union and Plant Management level, such matters shall be .
214
referred to Corporate Union Relations and the Assistant Director ot the DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW responsible lor Sourcing in an attempt to reach a resolution. If after discussions, it is deemed appropriate, the Corporation shall forward a copy of the temporary offloading notice to the Vice President and Director of ttte UAW DaimlerChrysler Department.
In addition, the following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of UAW members:
insourcing
The National Committee and, where appropriate, the Local Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Union identifies as that which might be performed competitively within the location based on the criteria outlined above.
To assist in this process, the International Union will be furnished a complete list of work similar to that currently performed at the location that (1) has been outsourced from that location, or (2) is currently performed by non-DaimlerChrysler UAW suppliers for DaimlerChrysler Corporation. These lists will be updated and will include the suppliers' location (city and state), union affiliation and the supplier contract expiration dates, if any, and will be furnished on an annual basis during the second quarter. The parties will initiate efforts to insource particular work consistent with the aforementioned criteria to create prospects for growth and to provide jobs for Protected employees and employees on layoff,
215
If ft is established that certain work can be performed competitively, judged by the above criteria, Management will adopt the Committee's proposal and, barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work in-house. 'Hie Union shall obtain any necessary approval or ratification within thirty (30) days of the decision to bring the work in-house.
Outsourcing
Outsourcing as used herein means the Corporation's sourcing of work from DaimlerChrysler Corporation UAW locations, including work connected with current, new or redesigned vehicles, fabricated parts, power train, component products, dies and fixtures.
If changes to the published and distributed sourcing pattern are contemplated at any time during the vehicle development or production cycle through the initiation of make/buy studies, or when any change in sourcing direction for a process unrelated to vehicle development is contemplated, the International Union, the UAW Sourcing Representative, and the Local Union at the affected location will be given written notice. Mien the Source Planning function, or the equivalent function at either the Corporate, Division, plant level, vehicle engineering or manufacturing engineering contemplates an outsourcing decision, the International Union, the UAW Sourcing Representative, and the affected Local hourly and salary Unions will be provided written confirmation of the action. The notice shall be provided to the Union as far in advance as possible or promptly following approval, and consistent with the timing requirements of the product's development cycte. The notice will provide, on a confidential basis, the reason for the outsourcing, a description of the
216
work involved, the number of jobs affected on both a short-term and long-term basis, if known, at both the affected facility and any other DaimlerChrysler Corporation-UAW represented facility, the identification of the sourcing authority, the quality status of the recommended supplier, and all financial and cost information. Proposals to keep the work in-house will be made by the Union within ninety (90) days of the receipt of written notice.
if it is established that the work can be performed competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in the Memorandum of Understanding, Management will, barring unique and unforeseen circumstances, keep the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approval or ratification within thirty (30) days of the decision to keep the work in-house.
Where make/buy study findings do not impact the current sourcing pattern, the notice of contemplated sourcing will be withdrawn.
When such an outsourcing decision is contemplated at any level of the Corporation, the written notice will be given to the Vice President and Director, DaimlerChrysler Department, UAW. A copy of such notice will be given to the Chairperson of the Local Committee at the same time.
When such a contemplated outsourcing decision is initiated by the Corporation at a level external to the affected location(s), the Corporation will provide sufficient advance written notice to allow the designated Management representative at the affected location(s) to comply with the notification procedure.
217
Additionally, International Union and Local Union input will be sought by the Corporation as early as possible in the outsourcing decision making process. The intent of the evaluation period and Union input being sought as early as possible is to allow for more thorough discussion and to permit the parties to better assess the impact of outsourcing on the longterm job stability ol employees and the financial viability of given Corporate locations.
The Corporation will not enter into a contractual relationship with a non-DaimlerChrysler UAW supplier until such time as the designated Management representative of the impacted location provides written verification that the above notification procedure and discussion by the Local Committee has taken place.
The Corporation agrees to a full disclosure to the International Union of the procedures utilized in the sourcing decision-making process.
Full implementation of the processes contained with-in this Memorandum should provide the parties the mechanisms to take advantage of every opportunity to use internal resources.

DRUG TESTING
(Return to Work from Substance Abuse Related Medical Leave - Illegal Drugs and Unauthorized Prescription Drugs)
During these negotiations, the Corporation and the Union discussed their firm commitment to helping employees who are affected by substance abuse problems, In particular, the parties reviewed circumstances pertaining to an employee returning to work from substance abuse related medical leave of absence who is still using illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs. The parties agreed that permitting such an employee to return to the work place jeopardizes the employee's safety and the safety of fellow employees, it also hampers the ability of the Corporation and the Union to meet today's challenges, including the ability to achieve continuous improvement in quality, safety, customer satisfaction, and operating effectiveness.
To address this problem, the parties agreed that drug testing will be included as part of physical examinations for each employee returning to work from a first substance abuse related medical leave for treatment of illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drug use or dependency. For purposes of this Memorandum, only medical leaves occurring after the effective date of the 1996 Agreement will be considered.
Drug testing will be conducted in accordance with established Corporation practice, and the reason for conducting the test and the test results will be strictly confidential and will be made known
.	219
only to the employee, the Managed Care Program (Help-line) or the employee's Health Maintenance Organization (HMD), whichever is applicable, plant physician, and plant Employee Assistance Program (EAP) representatives having a business reason to know.
An individual who tests positive for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs will not return to work except under conditions set forth below. To facilitate recovery, the employee will be referred to the Managed Care Program (Help-line) or the employee's Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), whichever is applicable, and the Employee Assistance Program for assessment and/or followup. Upon meeting the objectives of the prescribed course of treatment and a negative drug test the employee may return to work, but will be subject to drug testing for the following twenty-four (24) months, it being understood that such testing will be conducted no more frequently than six (6) times in any twelve (12) month period. The decision as to when an employee must have such a drug test will be made by the plant Medical Department, and will not be a supervisory determination. If the employee subsequently tests positive for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs, the employee will not be allowed to continue work and will be placed on medical leave. Criteria for returning to work following this subsequent medical leave will be as described above.
The 1996 Letter of Understanding, Employee Assistance Program, reads in part: "Employees with alcoholism, drug dependency, emotional or personal problems will be able to seek help voluntarily without having to be concerned that their employment status will be affected because they
220
have sought help for such problems." This provision notwithstanding, any employee who has three (3) positive return-from-medical leave tests within any three (3) year period may return to work after the third positive test only if, in addition to meeting the criteria specified above, that employee agrees to a twelve (12) month waiver which will in part require the following:
(1)	Drug testing during the period of the waiver.
(2)	Termination upon a positive drug test result.
(3)	No access to the grievance procedure to protest the reasonableness of any penalty, including discharge, as the result of a positive test for illegal drugs or unauthorized prescription drugs during the twelve (12) month period.
Other terms and conditions of the waiver may be determined locally by the Company and the Union.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING RETURN TO "HOME” UNIT
The parties recognize that some employees placed pursuant to Section (54) of the National Office and Clerical Agreement may have the desire to return to their "home" unit. The parties recognize also that, in affording such employees the opportunity to return, it is necessary to do so in a manner consistent with the maintenance of quality and efficiency in both the releasing and receiving units. Accordingly, the purpose of this Memorandum is to provide methods and procedures and to detail the circumstances whereby eligible employees will be offered the opportunity to return to their "home” unit.
1. Eligible employees are those active employees who have been assigned to a unit other than their "home" unit pursuant to Section (54) of the National Office and Clerical Agreement. Eligible employees are further defined as those placed:
a.	Prior to the effective date of the 1996 Agreement who were not offered an opportunity to return to their Mhomew unit pursuant to the work opportunity for (aid off employee provisions of Section (54) of the National Office and Clerical Agreement,
b.	Subsequent to the effective date of the 1993 Agreement and who have worked at least six (6) months at the new unit.
223
2.	Eligible employees may file an application to return to their "home" unit at the Employment Office on or after their anniversary of the sixth (6th) month following placement. Employees will be provided a copy of their application.
3.	Eligible employees who have applied to return to their "home" unit shall be placed (in seniority order) on a "return home" list at the "home" unit.
4.	Each unit will maintain an applicant listing for use by the local parties.
5.	Should a unit with a "return home" list have employment requirements, it will combine its Protected employees, "return home" list and recall list (if any) in seniority order and recall from such combined list until its needs are met or such combined list is exhausted. Should the combined list be exhausted and additional employment required, it will fill further openings in accordance with other applicable agreements between the parties and then by hire.
6.	Should an employee return to his "home" unit under the provisions of paragraph 5 above, the employee will forfeit seniority rights at the ’releasing" unit. Should an employee, having requested return under paragraph 2 above, subsequently refuse an offer of return, the employee shall lose seniority at all units of the Corporation except the unit at which he is working.
7.	It is recognized that the unit from which the eligible employee is released must do so in a manner consistent with the maintenance of quality and efficiency. Accordingly, no eligible employee will be released until a fully trained replacement is
224
J
available. Consistent with these principles, it is recognized that the rate at which employees are released may vary due to the types of jobs held by "returnees", the availability of replacement personnel, product or new model launch, releasing unit staffing requirements, etc. In all cases, Management will endeavor to release employees as quickly as possible. Disputes regarding this issue may be referred to the Corporation's Employee Relations Staff and the UAW's National DaimlerChrysler Department for resolution.
8.	Employees transferring pursuant to the provisions of this Memorandum will be placed on available work and will not be eligible to alter the vacation schedules in effect at the time of their return.
9.	An employee accepting transfer will be eligible to receive a relocation allowance as provided in the Exhibits to the National Agreement after providing documentation satisfactory to Management that the employee has changed permanent residence and relocated.
10.	The parties recognize that the provisions of this Memorandum have complex administrative implications. Accordingly, claims of violation are not subject to the Grievance Procedure but instead may be referred to the Corporation's Employee Relations Staff and the UAW’s National DaimlerChrysler Department for resolution.

Any type of control established should be evaluated after three (3) months of its implementation to confirm its effectiveness.
(D)	Job Analysis and Time Lines
Jobs will be identified as candidates for analysis by reviewing injury/illness and lost time data, including the "54-08” Report andappropriate OHM reportfs)'. A good faith effort shall be made to conduct an initial job analysis, as required, within two (2) months of when a job is identified as having a potential MSP* risk factor. Each facility will use a documentation process to record progress with ergonomic modification efforts. In that regard, a monthly report will be required of the Local Ergonomic Committee to be forwarded to Corporate OSH and the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department. Each facility shall implement feasible measures to control MSP risk factors. A good faith effort will be made to implement ergonomic solutions within a six (6) month time frame after the Local Ergonomics Committee determines that corrective action is required and it prioritizes the remediation. The parties acknowledge that there may be times when it may take longer than six (6) months to make the proper correction, and the reasons need to be dqcumerited._ The Local Ergonomics Committee is to develop a "top five" list of the most concerning jobs requiring remediation. Factors to be considered for placing a job on the "top five” list shall include injury rates, ErgoPal scores, lost work time ratesand investment cost paybacks. The LEG
249
wHi work aggressively to find practicaT^feasibie^ economical solutions to the, "top five" list J IrTthe event that a Local Ergonomics Committee believes that a facility is not making proper technical resources from the facility available, it should raise the issue with the LEPC. If not resolved, the matter should be referred to the National Employee Participation Council (NEPC) for immediate resolution.
(E)	Ergonomic Support Equipment
Seats, chairs and mats are considered appropriate solutions to control ergonomic risk factors. The Corporation agrees that it will not remove ergonomic support equipment that is currently in use for ergonomic reasons without mutual agreement with the Local Ergonomics Committee.

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT ON PREVENTING EROSION OF BARGAINING UNITS
This SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT ON PREVENTING EROSION OF BARGAINING UNITS (to be known as the Supplemental Agreement on Erosion), made and entered into on the date of signing of the 1993 National Agreements referred to herein, between DaimlerChrysler Corporation (hereinafter referred to as the Corporation) and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (hereinafter referred to as the International Union) and certain of its Local Unions (said International Union and said Local Unions being hereinafter referred to as the Union).
It is not the policy of the Corporation to reassign bargaining unit work so as to erode bargaining units covered by the National Office and Clerical and National Engineering Agreements between the Corporation and the Union, unless the Corporation can demonstrate clear economic, organizational, or geographic reasons for such reassignments. Furthermore, the Corporation will notify the Union prior to any such reassignment of work. In disposing of cases arising under this Memorandum, the Committee including the Impartial Chairman will reverse Management's reassignments only in cases where based upon the facts it is apparent that the motive for the reassignments was to provide work to non-Union personnel at the expense of personnel represented by the Union.
264
THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows:
I. a. The Corporation and the National DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union, UAW, each will appoint two representatives to a Joint Committee on Preventing Erosion of Bargaining Units (hereinafter called the Joint Committee). Each member of the Joint Committee shall have one vote, but one representative of either party hereto may cast the votes of both representatives of that party.
b.	Any claim within the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee shall be deemed a matter on which the Appeal Board has authority to rule.
c.	The Joint Committee will be constituted as herein set forth unless and until the parties mutually agree to change its composition or operation, or to discontinue it.
II. Any claim that the Corporation has reassigned work contrary to the aforementioned policy set forth in the preamble of this Supplemental Agreement shall, after verbal discussion of the claim with the Labor Relations Supervisor, be submitted as a grievance by the Local Union at the Second Step of the Grievance Procedure provided by the above mentioned National Agreements within thirty (30) days after the claim arises.
At the Second Step Meeting each party will endeavor in good faith to furnish the other all facts and information then available with respect to the grievance. All plants and offices will also use the approved erosion grievance checklist. The Unit President or Chairman shall initiate and complete the checklist in the meeting and management shall
265
cooperate in its completion. The completed checklist will be forwarded to the Regional Director with the grievance and answers as provided for in Section (21 )(f) of the Agreements. It is understood and agreed that the checklist shall be used without prejudice to either party and will not be used or referred to in any arbitration proceeding.
If not disposed of at the Second Step within the prescribed time limits, the same shall, 'ri the Regional Director or his designated representative determine the claim warrants merit for appeal, be submitted to the Joint Committee within thirty (30) days after the date of the answer at the Second Step. Such submission shall be made by the international Union by written notice to DaimlerChrysler Corporation, Corporate Union Relations, and shall state the facts and the basis of the Union's claim in reasonable detail. The Joint Committee will meet and consider the matter on a timely basis after receipt by the Corporation of such notice. It may dispose of any such claim (1) by referring it back to the plant of origin as a matter that is not within the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee, or (2) by a written settlement thereof. In the case of claims involving legal issues, counsel for the respective parties may participate in the Joint Committee’s discussion. If the Joint Committee is unable to dispose of a ciaim within thirty (30) days after the same has been submitted to it, the Union may within ten (10) days after said thirty (30) day period, either (1) give to the Corporation written notice of its desire to submit the same to final and binding arbitration by an arbitrator or arbitrators chosen by unanimous agreement of members of the Joint Committee or, in the absence of agreement, by an Impartial Chairman under said National Agreement, or (2) file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board for an amendment
266
or clarification of the appropriate bargaining unit or units, or (3) withdraw the same, in which event such withdrawal shall be without prejudice to the Union's right thereafter to renew the claim before the Joint Committee. If the Union does not give such written notice of its desire to submit the matter to arbitration or file a petition with the National Labor Relations Board within said ten (10) day period, the matter shall be considered settled, unless said time limit is extended by mutual consent.
Ill,	in order to establish an orderly procedure for processing claims that are referred to the Joint Committee by this Supplemental Agreement or that are hereafter referred to it, each such claim shall be assigned a case number in the order of its submission to the Joint Committee, and unless the members of the Joint Committee unanimously agree otherwise, said Committee shall consider and dispose of them in that order.
Any two members of the Joint Committee may call a meeting thereof on five (5) days written notice to the other members. A meeting may be held at the plant ot origin of a matter that the Joint Committee will consider at such meeting, in which event a member of the Local Union bargaining committee and a representative of the local plant management may attend, if requested by the Corporation or the Union. Notices pursuant hereto shall be addressed to the National DaimlerChrysler Department of the International Union, UAW, in the case of its representatives, and to DaimlerChrysler Corporation, Corporate Union Relations, in the case of the Corporation's representatives.
IV.	Any employee who, by the terms of this Supplemental Agreement or by a decision of the
267
Joint Committee, an arbitrator, the Impartial Chairman or the National Labor Relations Board, becomes a member of a bargaining unit will have forty (40) days after the effective date of the Supplemental Agreement or decision, as the case may be, in which to become a member of the Union.
The seniority date of such employee will be established in the following manner: (1) if his placement in the bargaining unit is as a result of a decision by the National Labor Relations Board, the Impartial Chairman or an arbitrator, his seniority date shall be his last date of hire, (2) if his placement in the bargaining unit is as a result of a disposition by the Joint Committee, said Committee will endeavor to agree on a seniority date. Failing such agreement within a reasonable time, then the seniority date shall be his last date of hire.
V,	The International Union, UAW, shall indemnify the Corporation and hold it harmless against any and all penalties, damages, or claims, including reasonable counsel fees, by reason of or arising out of compliance by the Corporation with the terms of this Supplemental Agreement or any decision of the Joint Committee, an arbitrator, or the Impartial Chairman pursuant thereto.

(7) Salary Pay Practices
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Jack Laskowski
Dear Sirs:
Certain questions of interpretation have developed relative to Sections (66), (6S), (69) , (71) and (74) of the National Salaried Agreement. The Corporation's interpretation of the applicable Sections ot flits Agreement will be as follows:
Section (66)
(i)	When death occurs in an eligible employee's immediate family within the meaning of Section (66) of the National Salaried Agreement on the Saturday or Sunday prior to his vacation scheduled to commence on the following Monday, the vacation will be rescheduled at a mutually convenient time.
(ii)	In the event an employee is granted a leave of absence because of the illness of a member of his immediate
276
(amity and such (amity member dies within the first seven (7) calendar days of the leave, the requirement that the employee otherwise would have been scheduled to work will be waived.
Section (68)
In administering Section (68) of the Salaried Agreement, the Corporation follows the following procedure:
(I)	An employee will be paid the appropriate shift premium (or each day worked. The shift premium will only be paid for lime worked, and paid casual absence and holidays, and vacation days as provided in Section (79), where the employee would otherwise be scheduled to work a premium shift.
(ii)	An employee who works overtime in conjunction with an assigned shift will be paid the shift premiums appropriate to the assigned shift for all time worked.
(iii)	First shift employees who are scheduled to work and who do work additional hours in advance of their regular shift starting time will receive the shift premium applicable to their advanced starting time for all hours worked on such shift. For example, a first shift employee is normally scheduled to work 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p,m. On Friday, he is scheduled to work and works a shift from 3:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. He will receive third shift premium for those hours on Friday.
(iv)	While the establishment of starting times is a Management prerogative and the establishment of such times are dictated by valid operating and business reasons, in the event a local unit feels that Management has established a starting time solely and exclusively to avoid the payment of shift premium, they should raise the issue with the International Union who may discuss the matter with Corporate Union Relations.
Section (69)
(f) Saturday Work
Section (69) provides:
Time and one-halt will be paid as follows:
(b) For time worked on Saturday, except when a shift starts on Friday and continues into Saturday; provided, that hours in
277
excess ot eight (8) per day or forty (4(?) per week on such shift will be paid at time and one-half,"
Notwithstanding the language of Section (69)(b) of the Salaried Agreement, a third shift employee who starts on Sunday night and works a sixth scheduled shift starting Friday night and working into Saturday will receive time and one-half for hours worked on Saturday, irrespective of any absence during the workweek,
(ii)	Saturday Following a Holiday
Except as specified in paragraph (i) above, employees whose shift begins on Friday and work into a Saturday do not receive time and one-half for work on Saturday. A holiday falling during a workweek has no effect on the payment of premium lor Saturday work.
(iii)	Work into a New Workweek
While a workweek has not been defined in the Salaried Agreement, the parties have accepted the following as the definition of workweek for said Agreement;
"The regularly scheduled workweek starts at 12:01 AM, Monday, and ends 168 hours thereafter, except those employees on third shift operations starting Sunday night in which case (heir regularly scheduled work week starts with the beginning of their shift Sunday night and ends 168 hours thereafter,"
Accordingly, an employee who begins a shift on Sunday and works into Monday will receive double time tor hours worked on Sunday and straight time for hours worked on Monday.
Section (71)
The holiday for third shift salaried employees who start work Sunday night or Monday night will be designated by Management thirty (30) days prior to the holiday as either the shift that starts the night before the holiday and continues into the holiday or the shift that starts the night of the holiday and continues into the tollowing day. It not designated, the holiday is on the calendar day.
An employee on the third shift who performs work during the designated holiday will receive pay for time worked on such
278

holiday in accordance with Section (70) of the National Salaried Agreement.
Section (74)
Overtime Pyramiding. Section (74) Overtime Pyramiding Prohibited, provides: 'The allowance of overtime or premium pay (other than shift premium) for any hour or part of an hour excludes that hour from consideration for overtime or premium pay on any other basis, thus eliminating any pyramiding of overtime or premium payments."
tn Interpreting Section (74), it is understood that, for second shift employees, (i) hours worked on the calendar holiday portion Of a shift that begins on a designated holiday and continues Into the next calendar day will not be excluded from consideration for overtime premium under Section (69)(a) and (ii) hours worked on the Sunday portion ot a shift that begins on Sunday and continues into Monday will not be excluded from consideration for overtime under Section (69)(a).

(8)	Plant Vacation Shutdown-MOA Plants
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Charles Livingstone
Dear Sirs:
A question has arisen as to the manner in which salaried represenied employees will be treated during a plant shutdown period in those facilities in which we have negotiated a Modern Operating Agreement for the Production and Maintenance employees. This letter shall confirm the manner in which we intend to treat the salaried represented employees who are not
279
scheduled to work during a shutdown period in those facilities with a Modem Operating Agreement.
Salaried represented employees not scheduled to work during a shutdown period shall have the option of either scheduling unused earned vacation time for such period or elect to be temporarily laid off during the shutdown period. In the event they elect to be temporarily laid off, they will be paid a payment in lieu of vacation equal to the amount of time of such layoff but in no event more than the amount of unused earned vacation time the employee is entitled tor the current calendar year of the shutdown. The employee’s entitled vacation shall then be adjusted by the amount paid.
Such accommodation is consistent with the original intent of Letter (67), "Plant Vacation Shutdown" and Section (78), "Transfer and Termination'' of the Office and Clerical and Engineering Agreements and will not be used by either party as precedential in any other situation.

(13)	Temporary Hires
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Edward A. Rickey
Dear Sirs:
On occasions the Corporation finds it necessary to hire additional employees in temporary positions included in salaried bargaining units. Temporary employees are hired for a period not to exceed one hundred twenty (120) consecutive calendar days. They are used for such purposes as replacing permanent employees on vacation or leave of absence. Temporary employees are not hired to fill positions which are permanent openings or where qualified iaid-off salaried, seniority employees are available. The utilization of temporary hires shall not diminish the rights of seniority employees under other Sections of this Agreement. Claimed violations of the above may be referred to the International Union for review with Corporate Union Relations.
Because ot the limited term of their employment, we believe it desirable to clarify the entitlement of these temporary employees to certain benefits available to permanent employees under our agreements covering salaried employees.
It is the Corporation's position that temporary employees are entitled to receive only the cost-of-living allowance, shift premium, overtime premium, improvement factor increases, payment for holidays and, provided they are not covered under hospitalization insurance carried by their parents or spouse, temporary employees will be permitted to enrol) tor hospital-surgical-medical coverage as provided in the applicable agreement, the National Office and Clerical Agreement and the National Engineering Agreement, and no other benefit.
Temporary employees hired to positions included in a bargaining unit would be subject to the Union security provisions of the applicable National Agreement and would be classified and paid in accordance with the applicable Salary Grades and Progression Application Supplement.
It is not intended that an employee be repeatedly hired as a temporary employee for the purpose of depriving the employee
286
of benefits he would be entitled to receive as a permanent employee.
Would you pieasa indicate your acceptance of the foregoing by signing the original and one copy of this letter and returning them to me.

Dear Sirs:
During the recent negotiations the Union raised the subject of Management Trainees being assigned work improperly.
The Corporation explained that in order to properly acquaint Management Trainees with the various Corporate functions, it is necessary to assign them from time to time to work in bargaining unit areas. The Corporation assured the Union that when it assigns a Management Trainee to perform work in such an area for such purpose, the assignment is generally of short duration and the Steward in the involved area will be notified of the particular assignment.
292
It is not intended that a Management Trainee so assigned will displace an employee in a bargaining unit and that, when such trainee performs productive work that is regularly performed by an employee in a bargaining unit, a bargaining unit employee in the area involved will be asked to instruct the trainee in performing such work.
It Is understood that Management Trainees, while in training, are not part of the regular work force engaged in productive work and are therefore not required to become members of the bargaining unit.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
The following is the text of DaimlerChrysler Corporation's written and published guidelines regarding sexual harassment prevention:
POLICY STATEMENT;

It violates Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and various state fair employment laws in locations in which the Corporation does business. The Corporation's policy to prohibit the occurrence of sexual harassment is based on concern for the individual as well as good business lodgment.
DEFINITION:
For the purpose of determining whether a particular act or course of conduct constitutes sexual harassment under this policy, the tonowing definition will be used:
293
Sexual harassment Includes an unwanted conduct of a sexual nature that adversely affects an individual's work environment, including but not limited to the following:
unlawful sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:
1.	submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicilly a term or condition of an individual's employment,
2.	submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or
3.	such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment,

Appendix A
Sexual Harassment Complaint Investigation Process
Complaints of sexual harassment originate via many different avenues, >.e„ an employee to Management, an employee to a Union Representative, from either a Management or Union representative directly, or anonymously. Accordingly, immediately upon any member of Management becoming aware ot an allegation of sexual harassment when a Bargaining Unit employee is either the accused or the complainant, the following process is to be followed:
The involved fatality Human Resources Manager (or designee) must be advised of the allegation of sexual harassment. They, in turn, will immediately contact the Local Union President (or designee) to make them aware ot the allegation, tn cases when a complaint is received from an anonymous source, the aforementioned parties will, before commencing with an investigation, confirm with the employee who is allegedly harassed that he or she, in fact feels sexually harassed. The local Human Resources Manager is also responsible for notification to the appropriate Group Human Resources Office, as well as the Diversity and Work Family Office of ihe sexual harassment complaint.
The involved Human Resources Manager (or designee) will advise the accused party that an investigation will be conducted and, accordingly, they coutd be placed "on notice" of potential disciplinary action, and that any act(s) of retaliation will not be tolerated. Dependent on the circumstances of the individual case, the Human Resources Manager may deem it prudent to suspend the accused individual(s) until the investigation is concluded.
An Investigation Team will be formed that will include at least one (1), but not to exceed two (2) representative^) from the Local Union, which may Include members of the local Civil Rights Committee, in accordance with Section (4) and Letters 116 and 117 of the National Agreement. Recognizing the desirability of an investigative team made up of one mala and one female; each facility will attempt to structure the team accordingly. The Diversity Office may elect to name a representative to serve as an additional member of the Investigative Team or, where the Diversity Office is not part of the Investigative Team, local facilities are encouraged to confer with that activity for any guidance that may be required, in conjunction with Diversity Office presence, the DaimlerChrysler Department - UAW may elect to also name an additional
296
representative to the Team. Also, where the Diversity Office is not part of the investigation, the local Human Resources Manager will, upon completion of such investigation, forward to that activity a confidential copy of the tile, investigations of sexual harassment are to be conducted in as expeditious a manner as possible.
During interviews conducted in conjunction with a sexual harassment complaint, only members of the Investigative Team and the interviewee will be present. If the interviewed employee is a bargaining unit employee, he or she can have a Union Representative present during the interview. As part ot the investigation, attempts wilt be made to obtain signed statements from all parties, Including the complainant, accused, and witnesses where applicable. In cases where disciplinary action results, copies of al! documentation and notes relied on as the basis for such action wiS be provided to the Union and Management Investigators. All individuals involved in the handling of sexual harassment complaints, from the original receipt at such complaint through the entire investigative process, are required, to the extent possible, to maintain confidentiality of any information obtained or prepared during the process. No copies of Information obtained or prepared by the investigative Team will be provided to any employee.
Once the investigation has been concluded, the local Management, i.e., Human Resources Manager and facility operating head, shaft review the facts with management team members and determine the appropriate action to be taken. The union team members will have no rote in this determination and will make no recommendations regarding disciplinary action.
In cases, however, where the Diversity Office participated on the Investigative Team, the investigation results will be reviewed for final disposition by designees from:
Diversity and Work Family Office
Group Human Resources
Corporate Union Relations
Note: The Office of tire Genera! Counsel will, upon request, provide advice and counsel.
Actions Taken tn sexual harassment cases will be reported by the local Human Resources Manager to his or her respective Group Human Resources Manager, as well as the Diversity Office. Or in the case where Diversity participated, final disposition shall be reported to toe local Human Resources
297
Manager by his or her respective Group Human Resources office. In all cases, the complainant is to be advised when the case is ’'closed.'’ Such actions shaii be monitored to ensure closure to ali allegations is accomplished and corporate wide consistency relative to actions taken is maintained. Any discipline assessed shall be done consistent with normat requirements tor notification, representation, etc.
Where the investigative process determines an allegation of sexual harassment was made falsely or maliciously, the complaint may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. Obviously, this is not applicable to complaints that are brought forth in good faith, but are found to be inconclusive.
While the foregoing is an attempt to put in place guidelines which will allow the local facilities to investigate and dispose of the majority ol sexual harassment complaints, it is important that care is taken to ensure alt complaints are taken seriously, that an objective and thorough investigation consistent with DaimlerChrysler's policies and applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements is conducted, and that fair and equitable action results.
The Corporation bears the ultimate responsibility for the enforcement of the laws and corporate policy which prohibits sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is something that cannot be tolerated by Management or the Union. Accordingly, tire Corporation and the DaimlerChrysler Department of tire International Union, UAW are committed to ensuring investigations of sexual harassment complaints are to be conducted in the spirit of determining the truth and subsequent sharing ol aS available pertinent information between the parties. The Union’s involvement in no way predudes its grieving and resultant disciplinary action, since the assessment of such discipline would remain the sole discretion of Management.

Dear Sirs:
During our recent contract negotiations the Union claimed that problems are at times created when numbers of salaried bargaining unit employees are laid off at the same time with a minimum of advance notice to the Local Unit Chairman,
The Corporation responded that before it makes a layoff of a group of bargaining unit employees on the same date that it anticipates will result in the movement of such employees from one department to another or from one seniority group to another, the Corporation will make a good faith effort to give as much advance notice as possible of such layoff to the Unit Chairman of the affected unit. Upon request by the Union to the Labor Relations Supervisor, local Management will discuss the displacement of employees resulting from such layoff with the Unit Chairman.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr.Stephen P, Yokich
Dear Sirs:
The parties devoted much time during negotiations discussing many concepts that wilt ensure employee input into day-to-day operations, including everything from the layout of the work site to the way in which work is performed.
We acknowledged that our tong-standing, voluntary PQt process provides interested employees with the mechanism to Improve employee morale and the competitiveness of the business In our very demanding industry and that our jointly developed employee participation programs should be administered, along with our other joint programs, under the
306
leadership of the National and Local Employee Participation Councils.
The parties acknowledged that involving employees in key phases of the business such as Quality, continuous improvement initiatives, operating efficiency, joint problem solving and waste elimination, using our Joint Activities Operating Principles (JAOP), is extremely Important If we are to realize our joint vision of DaimlerChrysler becoming the premier automotive manufacturing company worldwide.
Among other things, we explored in depth the importance of an operating system and the interrelationship of JAOP with our many joint initiatives. The parties recognize that toe successful implementation of an operating system and the sustainment and growth of our joint programs are vitally important to the tong term job security of ait DaimlerChrysler employees in that such programs and processes provide the framework necessary to more efficiently and effectively operate the enterprise.
The Corporation and the Union were to accord that without toe JAOP and toe many “tool let" items associated with them, DaimlerChrysler’s ability to truly be competitive will be seriously diminished.*
It is understood that by supporting the JAOP and other programs and processes intended to increase employee input into the day-to-day operations of toe business, neither party will be abrogating or compromising their respective responsibilities, commitments or obligations under the collective bargaining Agreements.
The .parties agreed to continue to identify the best processes and work policies that will encourage employee participation and also to continue the previously established National Employee Participation Council (NEPC) composed of five (5) Representatives of the International Union, UAW and five (5) senior level Representatives of the Corporation;. The NEPC will continue to be co-chaired by the Vice President and Director tri the UAW National DaimlerChrysler Department and the Corporation's Senior Vice President - Employee Relations. The NEPC will meet quarterly, or more frequently it mutually deemed desirable or necessary, in performance of its role to provide leadership and direction to any employee participation process authorized or created by the parties. The NEPCs role is to provide leadership, stimulation, momentum and direction to the UAW-DaimlerChrysler Employee Participation Process. The NEPC may establish appropriate joint pitot programs.
307
The parties will continue to review and, as necessary, modify and/or improve the mutually agreeable employee participation process contemplated by this letter. The parties will continue to jointly identify what should occur at DaimlerChrysler in terms of employee involvement and participation to be fully competitive, improve product Quality and assure job security of UAW members. These activities may include, but not be limited to, (i) employee participation in activities such as self directed work teams having performance goals and objectives, PQf, problem solving groups, qualify initiatives, new product launch, health and safety initiatives, maintenance processes, Operating effectiveness, continuous improvement and the JAOP, each suited to the particular needs of the different locations and (ii) determining if the existing internal pay and organization structures hinder progress towards such goals. The partes will continue to benchmark outside high performance companies with demonstrated employee participation processes and/or existing plant initiatives that encourage and sustain total employee involvement. A joint study group, appointed by the chairpersons of Vie National Employee Participation Council (NEPC), empowered to use whatever resources H believes necessary, will develop the UAW-DalmforChrysler Employee Participation Process and will regularly report its findings and make recommendations to the National Employee Participation Council. The NEPC may then agree on a plan of action on how new employee participation processes contemplated by the joint employee participation process wili be launched.
Additionally, at each plant or facility covered by the Nations! Production and Maintenance, Parts Depot, Office and Clerical and Engineering Agreements, a Local Employee Participation Council (LEPC) shall function, consisting of up to ten (10) employee and management representatives, such representation being equally divided between the partes; including the Local Union President and/or (Unit Chairperson under the OC8E Agreement) and the Bargaining Committee Chairperson or his/her designee;, the Plant, Parts Distribution Center or office area manager, the Human Resources Manager or his/her designee. The remaining members of the LEPC, if any, shall be determined by the focal partes consistent with NEPC guidelines. The Local Council will meet at ths request of either party and shall, at a minimum, perform the following functions;
a.	Establish a means for employees to communicate theta participation-related ideas to the Local Council and to plar-management.
308
b.	Maintain a non-adversarial relationship between employees and management and assure ail information exchanged is accorded confidentiality.
c.	Along with the Local ESS and SWESS Committees, study and explore issues that either Inhibit or enhance the present or future viability of the plant and affect job security.
d.	Recommend to the National Employee Participation Council ways to improve effectiveness of the employee participation process.
e.	Embrace, support and provide leadership relative to the JAOP.
f.	As appropriate, link local JAOP, PQI, MOA, Health and Safety, Local Joint Training and other joint activity administration,
A member of the Local Council shall be designated to prepare a summary of major items discussed at each meeting and to furnish copies to the other members of the Local Council and the National Council. .
To assure that the Councils function in a non-adversarfal manner, the Councils shall not consider matters that are otherwise subject to collective bargaining. Additionally, it is understood that maximum Management and Union support of joint employee participation initiatives (inasmuch as their benefit to employees and the Company transcends contractual or interpretative differences), shall not be suspended and/or otherwise impacted as a consequence of internal differences or unrelated disputes.
The parties recognize it may be beneficial to consider and implement Innovative programs which enhance competitiveness, improve job security and maximize the utilization of all available resources. Therefore, to facilitate and encourage such changes, it has been agreed that it may be necessary for the National or Local Employee Participation Councils (utilizing Attachment B appended to the Memorandum of Understanding - Employment Security System ESS Program, When appropriate) to change or waive certain provisions of the National and/or appropriate Local Agreements, ft is understood that any such change(s) or waiver(s): (i) will not be effective unless agreed to by the NEPC; (if) wifi, when appropriate, require ratification; and, (ill) will bp effective only at the location(s) specifically designated.
309
Further, Local Councils shall not commit either the Corporation or the International Union to a specific course ot action. However, management will consider and afford proper weight to relevant information furnished by the Local Councils before making its final decisions.

Dear Sirs:
In the negotiations leading to the National Office and Clerical and Engineering Agreements dated today, the parties discussed at length the subject of heavy overtime schedules worked by some employees covered by the two Agreements. The parties recognized in those discussions that the Corporation's need for overtime work and local overtime agreements and practices varied greatly from location to location and also among the various office and clerical and engineering groups at each location.
This will confirm our understanding that local overtime practices and agreements may be continued. In the event any local unit, because ol a particular situation it considers troublesome, wishes the voluntary aspects of the National Memorandum on Overtime be applied to it, a request may be made to the International Union to negotiate with the Corporation on the matter.

The parties agreed that the Corporation's policy of following the principles of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Part iff, Section 4 of the Portal to Portaf Act often resulted in disparate treatment of Clerlcal-Engineering-Technical employees depending upon the Individual travel circumstances involved. In an effort to assure the consistent application of the Corporation's travel time policy, the Corporation will reissue to the plants its revised administrative guidelines incorporating the clarification outlined below:
A. When employees travel to another city on the day prior to a temporary training or work assignment, regardless of the assignment's duration, they are to be paid for ail such travel time at their regular salary including appropriate premiums as follows:
1.	Air Travel: Travel time begins at the scheduled flight departure time until the actual arrival at the airport, plus actual ground travel, up to two (2) hours, to the destination, for example, hotel/motel, seminar, or work location, etc.
2.	Driving personal or Company Vehicle: Travel time begins at the time the employee leaves home unlit arrival at the destination, for example, hotel/motel, seminar or work location, etc., if not more than 300 miles. If the destination is over 300 miles, the employee will be paid the air travel time as prescribed above.
318
B. Assuming that the return trip occurs outside Of the normal work hours on the last day of the temporary assignment, employees are to be paid such travel hours at their regular salary, including appropriate premium as follows:
1.	Air Travel: Travel time begins at the scheduled flight departure time until the actual arrival at the airport, plus the actual ground travel to the employee's home, up to two (2) hours.
2.	Driving personal or Company Vehicle: Travel time begins at the time the employee leaves the temporary training, assignment, seminar, or work location until arrival at the employee's home if not more than 300 miles. If the destination is over 300 miles, the employee will be paid the air travel time as prescribed above.
if a question arises concerning the application of this travel time policy in a particular situation, the international Union may discuss the matter with the Corporate Union Relations Staff; and if the Union feels that a particular location is not endeavoring to schedule employees during normal working hours or per these guidelines, the international Union may raise the matter with the Corporate Union Relations Staff who will review with that location the intent of the provisions of this tetter.

Dear Sirs:
During the recent negotiations the Union expressed concern about its continuing rote in Liberty acdwlies, a desire to maintain involvement, and an Interest in exploring approaches which could expand the number of represented employees both involved at and supporting Liberty and Technical Affairs.
The Corporation reviewed the history of Liberty, including the fact that it has now evolved into Liberty and Technical Affairs. Liberty, Initially a new small car project, was given a new charter and began to focus on the development of the LH Project Through the efforts of the Liberty organization, the LH Project became a reality alter being passed on <□ areas such as Vehicle Engineering and Outer Drive Manufacturing Technical Center, Liberty and Technical Affairs, a smaller organization, is focusing on new projects and continues to provide involvement for represented employees within the organization. In addition, there are significant numbers of represented employees involved in support activities in Vehicle Engineering. Product Design, Manufacturing Engineering and similar work groups and the Corporation, on its own
322
initiative, regularly oonsidare ways in which represented employees can be utilised. Also, if a particular Liberty project grows, more represented personnel are normally assigned to Liberty and Technical Affairs and/or involved at other Chrysier-uAW facilities as demonstrated by the LH Project,
The advanced, innovative, frequently changing and broadly defined nature of the work at Liberty and Technical Affairs does not lend itself to precise or firm predictions on the specific projects which wifi be undertaken. Consequently, the Corporation is not able to make commitments ss to future facility, capital or manpower requirements or the extent of involvement by represented employees. Factors which influence the level of involvement include nature of the projects, duration of the work effort, resource authorisations, types of skills required, availability within the Corporation of required skills within tne timing constraints of the project and similar considerations. Nonetheless, without making specific commitments, the Corporation will continue to be guided by toe philosophy it has foUowed since the start up of Liberty and the evolvement of Liberty and Technical Affairs which has resulted in significant involvement of represented employees. The Corporation reaffirms its intent to continue involving represented employees.
At the request of toe Wematfonal Union, the Corporation is prepared to meet periodicaily and review the activity of Liberty and Technical Affairs.
Consistent with the above, it is agreed that loitowing notice of ratification of the National Engineering Agreement a meeting may, upon the International Union’s request, be convened at Liberty and Technical Affairs, consisting of representatives from the Iniemational Union, Local Union and toe appropriate management representatives to review the current status of Liberty and Technical Affairs and discuss its future, including the proper approach tor monitoring this activity on a continuing basis.

WhHe this letter is not intended to deal with employees whose records should appropriately be addressed by corrective, progressive discipline, it is intended to apply to employees who avoid corrective, progressive discipline by attributing their absences to frequent and recurring illnesses, and mere fore, have become, in effect, part-time employees who enjoy full-time benefits and job security.
The Corporation informed the Union that methods for dealing with these employees shall include, but not be limited to, counseling and where appropriate referral to outside agencies, denial of benefits, independent medical exams, and possible discipline up to and including discharge. Disputes are subject to the Grievance Procedure, and appeal of a termination may be referred directly to the second step of the Grievance Procedure. If unresolved, the issue may be referred to an Impartial Chairman who will determine if in fact the individual has become a part-time employee being afforded full-time benefits and job security, and therefore, such termination was proper.

3.	If the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5, followed by zeros, the preceding digit is increased by one it it is odd and remains unchanged if it is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit retained Is even. For example, when rounding to five digits, 130.55500 becomes 130.56 and 130.56500 becomes 130.56.

Attention; Mr. Edward A. Rickey
Dear Sirs:
During negotiations of the collective bargaining agreement dated today, the Union expressed its concern with muftipie starting times on a shift.
The Corporation explained that starting times at individual Corporation locations are based primarily on the nature of the operations and are established to provide for the efficient utilization of manpower and facilities in order to achieve operating objectives.
Recognizing the concern of both parties, it is agreed that if within a unit there are multiple starting times among employees on the same classification, in the same department on the same shift, the Local Union may request the Plant Management to negotiate an agreement covering toe selection of shift starting times. Any such agreement shaft have sufficient flexibility to give full protection to toe efficiency of operations at alt times.

Attention: Mr. Leonard J, Paula
Dear Sirs:
During the recent negotiations, the parties discussed at length the Union's proposals to modify the Seniority and Layoff and Recall Sections of the National Office and Clerical Agreements. These Union proposals were intended to ensure that, wherever possible, long servioe/seniority office and clerical employees in Detroit area plants would receive maximum work opportunity considerations.
(n discussing these proposals, the Corporation and Union agreed that complex operating problems exist at the present time, including the continuing restructuring of the Corporation and the uncertainly of the general economy, which vitally affect the Corporation's plants and offices especially in the area of manpower planning. Additionally, the parties recognize that it is Imperative that the Corporation's offices and facilities operate in an orderly and efficient manner. It was for these reasons that the Corporation was unwilling to grant the Union's proposals.
However, in the event the International Union can demonstrate during the term of the new Agreement that there are office and clerical employees in Detroit area plants with substantial amounts of service/seniority who have been laid off for considerable periods with little or no likelihood of recall to their own plant, fhe Corporation would be witling to discuss the feasibility of various plans/programs that would have as their goal providing work opportunities for these employees. Such plans/programs may include provisions for the displacement of lower service/seniority office and clerical employees in Detroit area plants and if agreed upon, would be implemented in an expeditious and consistent manner.

Internationa) Union, UAW
Attention: Mr, Leonard J. Pauia
Dear Sirs:
Both the Corporation and the Union acknowledge that the purpose and intent of the Grievance Procedure is to assure the prompt, lair and orderly resolution of grievances.
A.	Grievance Meetings
The Corporation assured the Union of our desire that each grievance receive prompt, fair and objective consideration. Similarly, the Union assured the Corporation that it will make a sincere effort to see that grievances are processed without undue delay.
To encourage the prompt handling of grievances, it is agreed that if the Union has not requested a Step 2 Meeting with Management on a grievance within a reasonable time after its appeal from the previous Step, (he appropriate Management representative shall advise the Union in writing of its wish to have a Step 2 Meeting on that grievance. If the Union fails to arrange a meeting to discuss the grievance within seven (7) working days from the date of Management's letter, the Corporate Union Relations Staff will discuss the matter with the International Union, which in turn, will take appropriate action to ensure a Step 2 Meeting.
If the Union claims Management is unwilling to meet on a grievance in Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure within a reasonable time after its timely appeal, it will request a meeting In writing. If Management falls to schedule a meeting in response thereto, within seven (7) working days, the International Union will discuss the matter with the Corporate Union Relations Staff, which in turn, will take appropriate action to ensure a Step 2 Meeting.
The parties recognize the value of providing a full and fair exchange at factual information and of having in attendance at grievance meetings, representatives who are qualified to discuss the facts and issues. However, except as specified in our
355
Agreements, there is no obligation on any particular representative to be involved in grievance meetings.
Where the Local Union believes appropriate Management representatives are not involved in grievance meetings, it shall direct its complaint to the plant Labor Relations Supervisor for review. Any unresolved problem may be referred to the International Union tor review with Corporate Union Relations.
B.	Sections (5) and (17) Meetings
If either the Local Union or plant management incur a problem with the other party in establishing: (i) dates for convening; and/or (ii) the appropriate numbers of representatives attending a meeting pursuant to Section (5) or Section (17) ol the Agreements, such disputes shall be referred to representatives ol the Corporate Union Relations Staff and the Chrysler Department of the International Union. Such representatives shall determine the appropriate number of attendees at such meeting and shall establish an expeditious time and date for the meeting,
C,	Grievances - Disciplinary Action
During discussions as early as Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure of grievances over discipline, discharge and other terminations from employment, each party will present statement of position reciting facts then known on which it relies and a copy of a document or statement on which the party relies to support its position.
In the case of a document covering, or statement by, an employee who is not the grievant, the party relying on it may excise, block out, or otherwise remove, information on it that is not relevant or that would disclose the identity of the person who made the statement or concerning whom the document refers.
In cases where a prior disciplinary record is involved, the Corporation may present a written summary of the grievant’s disciplinary record.
The statement of position and other statements and documents that a party has provided the other shall become part of the grievance tile and may be referred to in subsequent steps of the Grievance Procedure, including the Appeal Board.
The failure or refusal of the Union to present a full oral explanation of its position shall relieve the Corporation from
356
presenting any statement or document on which it relies. The failure or refusal of a peaty to make available to the other a copy ot a document or statement which ft has in its possession and on which the party relies shall preclude the party from using it before the Appeal Board.
The Corporation expressed its concern that its providing to Local Union representatives involved in processing grievances copies of employee statements and corporate documents relating to employees may lead to abuses unless the statements and documents (I) are used solely in connection with the proper processing of a grievance, (ii) are otherwise kept confidential, and (ill) are not in any way used by any member tri the bargaining unit to attempt to harass or intimidate an employee giving a statement or providing a document. The Union assured the Corporation that it will instruct its Local and International Representatives of these restrictions on the use of such material and the need to maintain confidentiality. The Union further represents that if a copy of a statement or document provided it in accordance with Uris Paragraph C. Is used by its representatives or those under their control for any purpose other than the proper processing of a grievance or is publicized outside of the Grievance Procedure, toe Corporation would be relieved of any obligation under this Paragraph C. at the (riant where the abuse occurred.

The National Joint Committee will continue to review and provide input to the audit team on the audit program criteria as required.
The designated UAW-OaimterChryster Joint Safety and Health audit team will conduct audits as deemed necessary, but in no case less than once every two years, of all facilities covered under the M-13 MOU as directed by the NJC.
The parties recognize the critical importance of these audits to the Corporation, the Union, and the employees. To that
359
extent, the parties agree to use their optimum efforts to (i) maximize the number ot audits performed and (H) to ensure scheduled audits are conducted on a timely basis. Adjustments to approved audit schedules or staffing levels must be authorized by the National Joint Committee, The parties further recognized the demands put upon audit team members and the Union expressed concern that, on occasion, outside intervention has impeded audit schedules and training program development. In the future, if outside intervention forces a change in the audit schedule or delays program development, the matter will immediately be taken up with the Joint Activities Board for prompt resolution.

Dear Sirs:
At the request of the Union made in a recent meeting of the Pension Subcommittee, we attach for your information copies of - the standards applied by the Corporation in the administration of the "Special Early Retirement,* provision of the Chrysler Corporation - UAW Pension Plan,
Very truly yours,

EARLY RETIREMENT UNDER MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY CONDITIONS (Hereinafter Referred to as "Special Early Retirement")
A.	Special Early Retirement is designed to benefit both the Corporation and the employee, particularly in those instances when the Corporation might be reluctant, due to circumstances being beyond the control of the employee, to apply this type retirement without the advantage of the higher pension benefits that the Special Early Retirement Pension provides. Thia pension provides benefits of (1) an unreduced basic pension for life, (2) a temporary pension until age 62 and one month or until the retiree becomes eligible for an unreduced old age benefit or disability benefit under the Federal Social Security Act, (3) to the extent eligible, an early retirement supplement until age 62 and one month.
B.	The utilization of this type of retirement for an eligible employee between ages 55 and 65 with at least 10 years of credited service may be given consideration in any of the following situations:
(1)	(n the event of a permanent plant shutdown.
(2)	In the event of a layoff which appears to be permanent,
(3)	In the event an employee is physically or mentally unable to perform his work in a satisfactory manner due to permanent partial disability which results in:
(i)	Excessive absenteeism.
(ii)	Decreased productivity.
(iii)	Frequent salary continuation and/or sickness and accident payments.
(4)	in the event of an extended period ol disability, as provided in C. below.
C.	An employee not actively at work because of an extended period of disability may be considered for Special Early Retirement either (i) following the cessation of sickness and accident benefits or salary continuation payments, (ii) during the period he is receiving extended disability benefits, (iii) following the cessation ot extended disability benefits or (iv) at the time he is being considered tor return to work. A determination will be made by the Corporation at that time based on medical evidence satisfactory to the Corporation, as to whether or not the employee will again be employable by the Corporation.
361
(f) If at that time the disability still exists and it appears that such disability will be continuous until the employee's normal retirement age and the probability of his being reinstated prior to his normal retirement age is remote because of such disability, the employee may be considered for Special Early Retirement.
(2)	If at that lime the disability still exists and It appears that such disability will be permanent and total, the employee may be eligible lor a permanent total disability pension in accordance With the applicable section o1 the Pension Ptan.
D. If the employee’s condition, based on medical evidence satisfactory to the Corporation, is such that, although able to perform the duties of his job satisfactorily, he would thereby be jeopardizing his health or that of fellow employees, and it is expected that this condition will be continuous until his normal retirement age, such employee may be considered for Special Early Retirement.
E,	In making a determination as to whether or not Special Early Retirement is to be extended to an employee, care is exercised that all of the basic facts have been considered.
F.	(1) If the request for Special Early Retirement is initiated by the employee, he may make written application on a form provided by the Corporation.
(2)	It the necessary approvals are obtained, the retirement will be automatically coded under "mutually satisfactory conditions".
(3)	If the necessary approvals are not obtained the employee will be advised in writing that his request has been denied and will be given the reason for denial, e.g. insufficient medical evidence. A copy of the denial will be forwarded to the Corporate Pension Unit, Employee Relations Office.
G.	Retirement at the option of the Corporation or under mutually satisfactory conditions will be available to an employee who is laid off on or after November i, 1979 at age 50 or older
(1)	as a result of a plant closing or discontinuance ot operations, or
(2)	whose layoff appears to be permanent,
and in either case has not been offered suitable work by the Corporation in the same labor market area.

(69)	Flexible Starting Times
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Stan Marshall
Dear Sirs:
During the recent negotiations the issue of flexible starting times was discussed. The Union requested that consideration be given to implementation of flexible starting times at all salaried bargaining unit locations. While not philosophically opposed to the concept of flexible starting times, the Corporation indicated its unwillingness to agree to implement flexible starting times on a corporate-wide basis. The Corporation’s concern is primarily over the potential abuse of work hours, added administrative complexity, and the potential (or adverse effect on quality and the efficiency of operations. Notwithstanding the Corporation's concern, the parties concurred that in some instances the implementation of flexible starting times can produce beneficial effects, such as, improved morale and job satisfaction, while having no adverse affect on quality or the efficiency ot operations.
To that end, the Corporation has acknowledged that Local Unions and local plant managements may locally discuss Implementation of a flexible starting times schedule. It Is understood the decision to Implement a flexible starting times schedule is totally at Management's discretion. Any flexible starting times schedule agreed to locally must provide for full protection to the efficiency ol operations at all limes and provide, at least, that: employees must work eight (S') hour days and a minimum of forty (40) hours per week; all participants must work core hours established by Management; the start and quit times
364
will be established by Management; hours cannot be banked or carried over from one day to the next or one week to the next; participation may be withdrawn from any individual for misuse; participating employees desiring to withdraw must obtain permission from the supervisor prior to being allowed to return to the regularly scheduled hours established by department management; the frequency with which flexible starting times schedules may be changed will be determined locally; approval ot all proposed flexible starting times schedules must be obtained from the local Personnel Department prior to implementation; participation In an approved flexible starting times schedule is voluntary; and flexible starting times schedules may be revoked at Management's discretion.
Management's decision to implement, decline to implement, modify, or terminate a flexible starting times schedule shaft not be subject to the Grievance Procedure. Notwithstanding, Management will endeavor to provide adequate notice of its decisions in this regard.

(70)	Employee Assistance Program
International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Nate Gooden
Dear Sirs:
DaimlerChrysler Corporation and the UAW continue to recognize that alcoholism and drug dependency are health problems which may be successfully treated, given early identification and appropriate rehabilitation therapy. Furthermore, as with alcoholism and drug dependency, emotional disorders and serious personal problems can adversely affect job performance.
365
It is in the Corporation’s and Union's mutual interest to provide a framework within which UAW-represented DaimlerChrysler employees voluntarily and confidentially may seek professional counseling, treatment, Family intervention, or other assistance and inFormation about what benefits are available to address such problems. Similarly, it is in the parties’ interests to generally encourage, educate and otherwise help employees pursue more healthful life styles, and expand educational opportunities in this area for the entire family. Working together the Union and the Corporation can achieve common goals in those areas. In this regard, the parties accordingly established a joint Employee Assistance Program under the UAWFDaimlerChrysier National Training Center (NTC).
The Program provides for: (1) early identification and voluntary assessment of seniority employees having alcoholism or other drug dependency problems as well as emotional disorders or serious personal problems; (2) referral of such employees to recognized providers tor professional diagnostic evaluation, counseling or treatment; and (3) an ongoing support system with appropriate Follow-up on their counseling or rehabilitation progress. While the Program's primary purpose is to assist employees having such problems and help Union and Management Representatives deal effectively with such situations, it also encourages employees to obtain information about the dangers of substance abuse and other addictions, and serious family and personal problems. Additionally, the Program covers how to recognize the existence of such problems, and the availability of counseling or treatment referral services for immediate family members having such problems.
Employees with alcoholism, drug dependency, emotional, family or other personal problems will be able to seek help voluntarily without having to be concerned that their employment status will be affected because they have sought help for such problems. Such employees, however, would continue to be subject to the same standards of performance and conduct expected of any other employee, irrespective of participation in the Employee Assistance Program. Employees requiring a leave of absence for the treatment of health problems will be issued such leave in accordance with the provisions oF the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Insurance benefits, if any, for the treatment and the absence will be determined in accordance with the Agreement.
The parties recognize the value of conducting critical incident "stress debriefings" after a trauma, such as an employee suicide, a major injury accident, violence or death at
366
the work site, etc. Appropriate debriefings for employees traumatized by such events are in the best interest of the Union and the Company. In this regard, the parties agree to continue the Critical Incident Response Program. Also, in light of increasing workplace violence, the parties have implemented a comprehensive Workplace Violence Prevention Program. Through joint .Workplace Violence Prevention^ Local Response Teams (LRTji at every, location,_ whose activities shall be governed by the mutually agreed upon NTC LRT Policy and Procedural. Guidelines, designated representatives of union and management have the opportunity to work cooperatively toward preventing troubling situations from worsening, while maintaining the integrity of their respective roles. The parties agree that the best way to prevent threats and potential violence from becoming a reality is by treating all employees with respect and through early identification, intervention, and referral of employees who may be having such problems, to their EAP Representatives. The parties also agree to continue updating the Workplace Violence Prevention procedures, including NTC Local Response Team Policy and Proceduraj Guidelines, and providing awareness, education and training on procedures for Local Response Team members through the National Training Center.
The Joint Activities Board {JAB) will continue to fund the development, central administration and arrangement of necessary services regarding delivery of the Employee Assistance Program. The National Training Center wifi continue to assist locations in implementing the Program. In that context, the National Training Center will provide training or instructions deemed necessary to qualify Employee Assistance Program representatives to satisfactorily perform their duties; and, will arrange for necessary promotional, professional referral and other support services from appropriate national and local company or external resources. Also, the National Training Center will continue its support of alternative counseling techniques, such as a Chaplaincy Program, in support of local EAP programs and EAP representatives. Recommendations in this area will be presented to the Joint Activities Board as appropriate.
The JAB will continue to direct and guide the development, administration, and delivery at the national level. The Program will continue to be comprised of equal numbers of representatives of the UAW and the Corporation appointed respectively by the UAW Vice President and Director ol the National DaimlerChrysler Department and the Corporation's Senior Vice President, Employee Relations. The EAP process will function under the umbrella of the Local Employee
367
Participation Council (LEPC) and under the joint guidance of the Plant/PDC Manager or Human Resources Manager, and the local union President. All program activities will be governed by the requirements outlined In the EAP Policy and Procedural Guidelines.1 The Plant/PDC Manager, or Human Resources Manager and the local union President will meet monthly with the EAP representatives to coordinate all EAP Program activities, including promotion of the program to employees, the training of supervisors and union representatives; at their locations, and continuous improvement ot the Program, consistent with the provisions of this letter and the guidelines established by the JAB. The EAP representatives will also participate in, and report data reflecting their activities, in a manner not to violate confidentiality, at meetings of the Local Employee Participation Council, (LEPC).
Proposals and requests for funding concerning delivery of local programs and related services under the Program will be reviewed by the National Training Center and be subject to approval by the JAB. In reviewing such proposals, consideration will be given to the availability of funds and proposal consistency with the Program's objectives.
Early identification and assessment of employees needing assistance is a key element of the Program and increases the possibility of a successful outcome. Also, follow-up by EAP representatives, and on-going support through on-site support groups and family awareness is critical to maintaining healthy lifestyles. The parties further recognize that while it is the responsibility of management to maintain discipline and to invoke disciplinary measures where and when appropriate, both local management and union representatives at all levels have the responsibility to exercise their best efforts toward the objective of early identification of employees whose behavioral problems may be linked to medical and/or personal causes and to strongly encourage them to seek assistance. To facilitate their critical roles in the intervention process, participation in EAP education and training by supervisors and chief stewards is essential, and valuable for other local union and management leadership. This education and training will be provided in a variety of formats. In addition, educational materials and information on resources available through EAP, such as a newsletter and a telephone access EAP Resource and Referral Service will be made available by the National Training Center to employees and their families as a means to further support early intervention.
The parties recognize the value of providing social support to employees making positive lifestyle changes, and where the
368
local parties agree, on-site, employee-conducted support group meetings will be permitted for employees, on their own time. EAP representatives, with the assistance of the LEPC, wilt be responsible for arrangements.
Further, it is recognized that a perceived stigma may be attached to involvement with EAP, Therefore, joint local EAP teams, along with the LEPC. wifi work to generate a climate which reduces the effects of social stigma associated with mental disorders, alcoholism, drug dependency and Other personal problems that act as a barrier to employees receiving needed help to resolve personal problems. To this end, consideration will be given to the localion of the EAP*s office in the plant ensuring the greatest privacy and confidentiality.
The parties agree to continue improving the quality and performance of the EAP Program and EAP representatives' services. Therefore, the National Training Center wifi benchmark other programs and develop National UAW/OaimferChrysler EAP Program standards based on: the most successful practices, standards developed by other joint programs and professional organizations, and input from EAP representatives. The National Training Center wifi provide training on the implementation of these standards and assist with the resolution of any implementation problems.
Also, newly appointed EAP representatives will receive a thorough orientation on the background, history, development and focus of EAP Program standards, as well as methods tor coordinating a local EAP Program. To ensure that newly-appointed EAP representatives become proficient in EAP core technology, and are able to provide a professional level of service, they will be required to meet all NTC approved EAP, requirements. for ^certification, within three (3) years of their appointment. Newly-selected EAP representatives must possess the skills necessary to take and pass such a certification examination. Failure to achieve such a credential within the allotted time period could result in the representative being removed from the Employee Assistance representative position by the UAW DaimlerChrysler Department. Newly appointed representatives will, where feasible, be selected two weeks prior to the departure of the preceding representative, tor purposes of training and a smooth transition of responsibilities.
Confidentiality is a critical element tn the success of an EAP Program, To preserve the integrity of the Program and employee trust, EAP representatives will adhere to professional standards of confidentiality, except where limited by federal, state, local or corporate rules and regulations regarding
369
confidentiality, disclosure of client information, or threats. These limits will be explained io employees. . Because violations of confidentiality may destroy a program at the local level, and embarrass and offend employees who have placed their trust in the EAP, proven violations of confidentiality by EAP representatives, either by omission or commission, will be taken seriously. If it is alleged that a violation has occurred, a joint investigation will be conducted, and appropriate action taken, up to and including termination of their appointment.
To ensure that employees receive effective alcohol, substance abuse and mental health care, The NTC will work jointly with the Health Care Benefit Joint Insurance Committee to research the most beneficial treatment practices.
It is understood that nothing contained herein or in the existing or future statements concerning the Employee Assistance Program or steps taken to implement its programs and related services shall be construed or interpreted as constituting a waiver of either the Corporation's or the Union's rights or responsibilities under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, nor is the Program intended in any way to create for any employee any enforceable obligation against the Corporation, the Union, or their representatives.
In addition, it is the parties' intent that any programs, approaches or related services to be provided under the Employee Assistance Program are not to be construed as benefits or insurance programs.
Finally, the Grievance Procedure set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement shall have no application to. or jurisdiction over, any matters related to the Program.

During these negotiations there was considerable discussion regarding the application and intent ol Section (37), Use of Past Record.
The Union asserts Section (37) bars consideration of prior discipline beyond die immediate preceding twelve (12) months of active employment when imposing a penalty cm a current charge and that the same time restriction is applicable regarding the use of an employee's discipline record when presenting appeals to the Chairman of the Appeal Board.
The Corporation has no disagreement with the Union's interpretation ol Section (37) as It regards management’s initial act of "imposing" a penalty on a current charge. However, when presenting appeals to the Chairman, the Corporation may respond with evidence as to the employee's total disciplinary record unrestricted by Section (37), if a grievant or die Union advances a claim of prior lengthy good conduct as a ground for reduction ot penalty, tn the absence of such claims the Corporation will not attempt to Indude in the arbitration record, either orally or in writing, disciplines which occurred prior to the twelve (12) month period Of active employment immediately preceding the current charge.

International Union, UAW
Attention: M~NaieGooderi
Dear Sir:
During the recent negotiations, the Union raised the subject of supplier employees in the plants performing work which the Union claimed has historically been Salaried Bargaining Unit work.
The Corporation explained that in support ot our Corporate goal to be wortrLclass_by>th0_year_2C©7, the Corporation has embarked upon a number of new directions with its employees, the Union and outside concerns. As an example, "partnerships* have been formed with suppliers to advance the extended enterprise concept.
Nevertheless, we agreed that under no circumstances should a supplier employee in our ptants perform the work of Bargaining Unit employees. When performing tasks on the plant floor related to ttneir product, supplier employees wiii work in liaison with Union employees of the Corporation1, including advance communication] when the work in question has historically been done by represented employees. (The intent of this advance communication with an appropriate represented salary employee is to allow for the clarification of roles and responsibilities to prevent unannounced entry into the plant by supplier empfoyeesf
In order to eliminate potential disputes and misunderstandings, when a supplier is assigned to a plant, the Chairperson of the Unit at that location will be advised of the nature of the assignment. Further, a procedure will be implemented to ensure a constant how of communication with the appropriate Bargaining Unit employees from suppliers working in the plant.
The Corporation acknowledged that there have been Instances where supplier employees have infringed on Bargaining Unit work in the course of reaching their goal, in an effort to resolve this issue, a letter from Ihe Executive Vice President of Manufacturing and the Executive Vice President of Procurement and Supply will be sent to suppliers and Plant Managers instructing them as to the contents of the document
377
and holding them responsive for insuring adherence to the commitments made during these negotiations.
In the event the Union believes instances have occurred contrary to the intent of this document, the appropriate Chrysler Department Representative may raise the matter with the Union Relations Manager. They wili immediately attempt to resolve the matter. If these parties are unsuccessful in resolving the matter, it may be referred to the Vice President and Director of the Chrysler Department for the Union and the Vice President of Employee Relations for the Corporation who may include the Executive Vice Presidents ot Manufacturing and Procurement and Supply to resolve the matter.

During recent negotiations the parties discussed that office/ clerical employees, represented by Local Union Nos, 889 and 212 ottice/cterical units, who have five (5) years or more service/ seniority and who are currently working or who accept work opportunity under the provisions of Section (S4), 56, 60 or 61ot the Office and Clerical Agreement, have been given an option to transfer their office/cterical seniority from prior plant{s) to their current plant thereby terminating their seniority at such prior plant(s). Further, the parties confirmed this option also applies to employees having less than five (5) years service/seniority on a "5 year grow-ln" basis.
The parties agree this provision has been successful and has resulted in a significant number of employees enjoying the maximum benefit of this acquired seniority.
The Internationa! Union, UAW shall indemnify the Corporation and hold it harmless against any and all penalties, damages or claims, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, by reason of or arising out of the Corporation's carrying out the terms and conditions of any such program. Further, the Union agrees that, the Corporation may at Its option and tn its discretion terminate the program or suspend its terms pending the final settlement err determination of any claims or complaints
380
that may be filed against the Corporation arising out of the Corporation's compliance with the program.
Finally, the Union agrees that it will not process grievances by employees complaining about the implementation ot the program.

Attention: Mr. Homer Jolly
Dear Sirs:
During the course of these negotiations, we reached an agreement relating to certain bargaining units currently located at Chrysler Center entitled "Memorandum of Understanding -Auburn Hills - Chrysler Technology Center."
The Union raised a concern regarding subsequent recognition for salaried represented employees in other units which are not currently scheduled to be transferred to Chrysler Technology Center (CTC), but which at a later date the Corporation may decide to relocate to CTC.
We have advised you that in the event the Corporation decides to transfer the responsibility currently performed by employees represented by the UAW at other Chrysler locations to CTC and transfers sufficient numbers of employees to that transferred organization to the extent that majority status is attained then the Union will be recognized as the collective bargaining agent and the terms and conditions of the 'Memorandum of Understanding - Auburn Hills - Chrysler Technology Center" shall apply to those accreted bargaining units.

Dear Sirs:
We recently negotiated a Memorandum ol Understanding for Auburn Hills-Chrysler Technology Center which puts tn place the foundation fur a new relationship based upon honesty and trust, and established principles which not only modify our current operating styles but also begin to address our ability to operate optimally in a globally competitive market. It Is intended that these new philosophies will not only allow the Corporation the needed flexibility to improve operational effectiveness, but also allow for individuate to be exposed to new work experiences.
Nevertheless, we acknowledge that we are embarking upon a philosophy which is foreign to many of our existing personnel, and it will require a period of time before a smooth transition is realized. Furthermore, we agree that additional questions which the parties did not envision during the negotiations of the above referenced Memorandum may subsequently arise which will need to be addressed. To that extent, it either party has documented evidence of a need to modify and/or amend the Memorandum of Understanding, they may raise those issues or concerns at toe National Negotiations relating to the second National Agreement succeeding the National Agreement in place following the movement of represented personnel into toe Chrysler Technology Center. While this provision allows the parties a mechanism to modify and/or amend the Memorandum to address documented abuses or problems occurring from its administration unforeseen by toe parties during its negotiation, a "wholesale" revision is not intended as the parties agree that the basic concepts are sound and are endorsed by both toe Union and toe Corporation as a practical means to provide long- term job security and to ensure global competitiveness.

(55) Volume Related Layoffs - SWEL
International Union, UAW	■
Attention: Mr. Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During the course of these negotiations, the Corporation and Union have provided DaimlerChrysler Corporation employees with substantially increased job security through the SWEL feature of the SWESS Program, which protects eligible employees against layoff for virtually any reason except volume related market conditions. The parties recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry. The Corporation acknowledges, however, the importance of minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume related declines are unavoidable, in particular, the Union stressed the importance of reducing overtime and shifting dual sourced production requirements to UAW-OalmlerChrysler plants in the event of overall market declines. The Corporation agrees to take these and other actions whenever practical.
In any event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in fine with the applicable National Office and Clerical or Engineering Agreement and local supplemental seniority agreement and, if otherwise eligible, receive benefit treatment in accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the applicable 1999 DaimterChrysfer/iJAW National Agreement.
387
Identifying the complex interrelationships of alt the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a difficult task. The parties agree that for purposes Of rfetermining SWEL related protections they must identity just those volume declines that are attributable to market related conditions, and in turn just those declines that are not affected by Corporation sourcing choices of vehicles and components that compete with or act as replacements for vehicles and components produced by DaimlerChrysler Corporation employees covered by the National Agreement. In other words, volume declines that are attributable to the Corporation's production and purchase arrangements with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, captives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.) would be considered an exception to the overall volume related exclusion in Section I.C. of the SWESS Program.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that, where practicable, the Corporation provide Local SWESS Committees adequate notice ol any impending volume-related layoff, as well as ail information necessary to fully evaluate its underlying causes, the extent to which such decline is associated with a Corporate sourcing action and the appropriate number of SWEL efigibte employees that should be affected by the layoff.
The Corporation recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context Of the protections spelled out in the SWESS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Corporation also accepts the responsibility of proving that the proper number of employees are recalled to SWEL positions when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the SWESS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.
The following are lo be considered as illustrations to assist the parties in determining when volume-related declines support reductions in employment. These Illustrations should not be considered al! inclusive.
- Market-Related Conditions - Included in this category is customer preference of one vehicle over another that might result in a decline in sales of a U.S.-built DaimlerChrysler Corporation vehicle that requires the layoff of employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of increased sales or increased market share of competitive captive imports or joint venture vehicles or any other vehicle sold in the U.S. by DaimlerChrysler Corporation but not produced in a UAW-DaimterChrysier plant.
388
Examples of Market Related Conditions:
(1) There is a decline in economic activity which decreases retail sales of UAW-DaimlerChrysler vehicles. Assembly Plant A, employing 115 SWEL eligible employees, is the sole source of Vehicle Z for the U.S. market. As a result ot the reduced sales volume, the second shift is discontinued, resulting in ihe layoff of 24 employees. The number of SWEL -eligible employees at the plant remains at 115 Including 24 open Protected positions. U.S. car demand picks up to pre-fayoff levels and the second shift is called back. Active bargaining unit employment at the plant goes back to 115 employees.
<2) Assembly Plant B produces 956 trucks per day. Reduced sales volume due to customer preference results in a reduction to 826 trucks per day being produced. As a result of the line speed change, 400 hourly employees are laid off. Simultaneously, two (2) Timekeepers are also laid off. The event is not covered and therefore they are not placed into the SWESS Program. The Plant’s SWEL number remains the same with two (2) open positions.
(3)	Same circumstances as (2) above, but at the same time of the layoff an improved payroll system is implemented which reduces the amount ot payroll work. As a result, three (3) Timekeepers and one (1) Payroll Clerk are laid off. The SWEL number remains the same with the creation of two (2) filled Protected positions and two (2) unfilled Protected positions. The SWEL number remains the same.
(4)	There is a decline in economic activity which decreases retail sales of UAW-DaimlerChrysler vehicles. As a result, funds for engineering research and development projects are significantly reduced resulting In the layoff of 25 Designers and 25 Mechanics. Since the reduction of funds was a result of reduced car sales, the SWEL number remains unchanged with 50 open Protected positions.
(5)	There is a new product line being installed at the Mound Road Engine Plant which is expected to take approximately six (6) months to complete. To help facilitate the implementation and completion ol this project, two (2) Facility Engineers are recalled from layoff. The work is completed and both Facility Engineers are laid off. Since these employees were assigned to temporary work, they are not eligible to be placed on SWESS Protected status.
389
Note: Since this project was for a known duration, it is considered temporary work. The Union should be notified in advance o1 the engineering project and the fact that it is temporary work,
- Product Discontinuance - Because of the introduction ot a new U.S,-built DaimlerChrysler Corporation vehicle or a nonallied company vehicle not sold by DaimlerChrysler Corporation sales of another DaimlerChrysler Corporation-manufactured vehicle may decline, and production of the latter vehicle must be curtailed necessitating reductions in employment. Such reductions would be considered volume-related declines under paragraph I.C. ol the Program.
- Proportional Volume-Related Layoffs - If a vehicle is assembled in a U.S. plant as well as in a plant outside the U.S. (Canada or Mexico) and layoffs result because of market-related volume conditions, the layoffs must be made proportionally between the two (2) plants. If all the layoffs occurred in the U.S. plants, then the proportional number of employees would be placed on SWESS Protected status.
Example:
Engine Plant C, employing 20 SWESS eligible Facility and Tool Engineers, produced half of the engines for Vehicle X; the ether half are produced at a corporate plant in Mexico. The volume reduction is made totally at Plant C rather than split proportionately between Plant C and the plant in Mexico. Therefore, in accordance with the SWESS guidelines, half of the ten (10) employees who are not required any longer in Plant C due to this event go into the Protected status, and the other five (5) employees would be laid off. The SWEL at Plant C remains at 20 including five (5) open positions (volume related).
- Faulty Product - Vehicle line volume may decline because of faulty parts in a vehicle that cause customers to place the product in disfavor. Such reductions would be considered volume-related declines under paragraph I.C. of the Program.
-- Changes in Retail Preference - DaimlerChrysler Corporation volume may decline because of customer preference shifts - in turn affecting mix and therefore demand, e.g., small car preference shifts to large car; option preference swings; high product content to low product content. Such reductions would be considered volume-related declines under paragraph I.C. of the Program.
390
- Engines, Transmissions, Stampings and other Components or Materials - It is recognized that reductions in vehicle production will often be accompanied by reductions in component production. When reductions in vehicle production are volume related, pro-rata reductions in component production will normally be considered volume related as well. However, to the extent a reduction in component production results from a shift in sales to vehicles sold by DaimlerChrysler Corporation but not produced In UAW-DaimlerChrysler Corporation plants, the reduction will not be considered volume related. For example, a new car model is introduced for sale in the United States which is built In Mexico. The new model directly results In reduced sales of a car that is built in a UAW-DaimlerChrysler plant In the United States. As a result, there Is a line speed reduction resulting in a workforce reduction of two (2) Timekeepers and three (3) Production Control employees. The SWEL number remains unchanged and the five (5) laid off employees are placed on SWESS Protected status.
Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dualsourced from a UAW-DaimlerChrysler Corporation and a non-UAW-DaimlerChrysler Corporation plant, production declines at the UAW-DaimlerChrysler Corporation plant will only be considered volume related to the extent the dual sourced component produced at that plant continues to be produced in its pre-production decline proportion.
Examples:
(t) Plant A receives regular automotive batteries from a UAW-DaimlerChrysler Corporation plant and heavy duty batteries from a non-UAW-DaimlerChrysler Corporation plant. A volume decline occurs in regular automotive batteries because of customer preference for heavy duty batteries. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under the program but would not have to be taken proportionately because the batteries would not be considered like or similar components.
(2) Plant B receives batteries that have plastic fastening 1	brackets from a UAW-DaimlerChrysler Corporation plant and
regular batteries that have steel fastening brackets from a non-UAW-DaimlerChrysler Corporation plant. The batteries are used interchangeably and would be considered like or similar components. Therefore, any volume declines in battery production would have to be taken proportionately to be considered volume related.
391
As Implied by these examples, there are many variations to be considered when determining volume actions. This letter is intended to provide a framework within which Local and National SWESS Committees may review the applicability of Paragraph I.C. to volume reductions.
If a Local SWESS Committee cannot agree on a situation being defined as volume related, the matter may be appealed to the National SWESS Committee for resolution.

Dear Sirs:
During negotiations of the National Production and Maintenance, Office and Clerical and Engineering and Parts Depots Agreements, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable Grievance Procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the Grievance Procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles ot collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its (i) Executive Board, (ii) Public Review Board, or (iii) Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the UAW Chrysler Department may inform the Corporate Union Relations Staff in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the Grievance Procedure at the Step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is agreed, however, that the Corporation will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either (i) are already barred under the provisions of the aforementioned National Agreements at the lime of the reinstatement of the grievance or (ii) that relate io the period between the time of the original disposition and the time of the reinstatement as provided herein. It is further agreed that the reinstatement of any such grievance shall be conditioned upon the prior agreement of the Union and the employee or employees involved that none of them will thereafter pursue such claims for damages against the Corporation in the Grievance Procedure, or in any court or before any Federal, provincial, state, or municipal agency.
415
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a decision of the impartial Chairman of the Appeal Board or any other arbitrator on any grievance shall continue to be final and binding on the Union and its members, the employee or employees involved and the Corporation, and such grievance shall not be subject to reinstatement.
This letter is not to be construed as modifying in any way either the rights or obligations of the parlies under the terms of the aforementioned National Agreements, except as specifically limited herein, and does nol affect Sections thereof that cancel financial liability or limit the payment or retroactivity of any claim, including claims for back wages, or that provide for the final and binding nature of any Appeal Board decisions or other grievance resolutions.
It is understood this Agreement and the Corporation's obligations to reinstate grievances as provided herein can be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days notice in writing to the other.

employees. The Corporation was concerned about targe numbers of employees who could return to a plant that had no available work for them. The Union, on the other tvand. expressed an interest tn longer seniority employees being able to take advantage of a program which would permit them to take a layoff and grow into retirement, while being replaced by Protected employees.
A mutually acceptable program has been developed that permits the utilization of Protected employee slots for voluntary pre-retirement leaves or other appropriate leaves.

The tunction of the Vehicle Engineering Resident Engineer is to reduce the time between identification of product related issues in the manufacturing process and corrective actions in the plant, since product design changes are the responsibility ot Vehicle Engineering. The Resident Engineer will work with vehicle Engineering to pursue design changes, and any resulting manufacturing and assembly process changes will be implemented by fhe plant Bargaining Unit engineers. In addition, the Resident Engineers will continue to use Corporate quality indicators (internal and externa!) to prioritize issues relating to product design.
It is not intended that Resident Engineers displace Bargaining Unit engineers or perform work that is normally performed by Bargaining Unit engineers. The Resident Engineer functions as a team leader/faciittator coordinating the activities ot the other members of the team(s). The team(s) will generally include Bargaining Unit engineers from the appropriate

(130) Product Development and Product Transformation
International Union, UAW
Attention: Stephen P. Vokich
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations the parties discussed various issues related to product development and product transformation. Both the Company and the Union recognize that future jobs depend on, among other things, continuing investments in product development. Shifting markets, changing consumer tastes, new governmental regulations, international harmonization of such requirements, and a host of other factors have a direct impact on vehicle development and manufacturing. The products manufactured and services delivered must meet evolving customer preferences and demands at a competitive price.
447
The Company fully understands the Union's concerns relative to investment in new products and services, and that such investments, while absolutely necessary, may no! alone guarantee good future jobs. New products require additional skills, spur changes in labor demand, and entail new sourcing decisions. The parties acknowledge that involving the Union at the earliest stages of the product development cycle is key to attaining job security while meeting the global challenges ot improved quality, speed to market, product innovation, and lowering total costs. To that end, the Corporation has been, and continues to be, fully committed to working with the Union to seek and Identify appropriate jointly developed technical training programs that will match new skill requirements with evolving technologies, products and services, along with the implementation of new programs to cushion unavoidable dislocative effects of rapid product transformation and development. The Company recognizes that working together will help preserve and grow good paying jobs for all current and future UAW-represented employees at DaimlerChrysler Corporation.
in preceding National Agreements and during these negotiations, the parties have recognized the importance of the Union's role and Involvement in the product development cycle and product transformation through provisions, such as the Memorandum of Understanding-Sourcing (M-10), which provide a mechanism for early UAW involvement in the Corporations' plans to proceed with a new or redesigned vehicle. To that end, it is understood and reaffirmed that early during the product development cycle, matters such as sourcing patterns, possible changes in assembly, sub-assembly, stamping, power train and other component sourcing patterns, possible insourcing opportunities, and technology which may Impact foe represented workforce will be reviewed with the International Union in accordance vdfo foe provisions of foe Memorandum of Understanding-Sourcing (M-10). Such early and up front involvement will allow foe Union to continue to be provided with current and anticipated major product developments/product transformations that are having, are expected to have, or could potentially have an effect on employment levels such as projected changes in the major components for motor vehicles (e.g. shift to new propulsion technology and energy storage devices), in materials (e.g. increased use of plastics and/or aluminum in body panels, shift to aluminum castings), in assembly and design (e.g. for easier assembiy/manufacluring methods and tor disassembly for recycling purposes).
448
Further, the Union's early involvement during the product development process allows for discussions relative to issues such as the Impact of a traditional gas-fueled Internal combustion engine vehicle, and, for example, the comparable electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, or dedicated and flexible altemative-liquid-fuel vehicle with respect to major components, materials, and assembly methods. In each case, the Company will indicate the extent to which changes in specifications will be handled through the revamping of existing UAW operations, by means of technology residing in other divisions of the Corporation or by outside sourcing arrangements.
Finally, It is recognized that the Memorandum of Understanding-Sourcing (M-10) provides an avenue for discussions as eariy as practicable in the product development cycle relative to projected production volume of new materials, components, and products, and the potential impact, if any, on UAW represented jobs.

Dear Sirs:
This will confirm our understandings in ttte following three areas:
Emergency Absentee Replacements
1.	This tetter clarifies that the Corporation intends to continue the practice of limiting the use of Protected employees as absentee replacements to emergency situations only (e.g., snow days or other acts of God), and even then only with the consent ot the Local SWESS Committee unless otherwise directed by the National Committee.
Volume Increases
2.	When the workforce increases due to an increase in volume, Protected employees corresponding to the increase in volume are removed from Protected employee status and placed into a regular plant department, and If there are seniority employees on layoff, the same number will be assigned to Protected employee status from layoff. The term "Protected Employee Status" as used by the Company is only a control against improper charging.
SWESS Accounting
3.	Within ninety (90) days of the effective date, the National SWESS Committee will review the Corporation's accounting practices that relate to charges for the SWESS program.

International Union, UAW
Attention: Mr, Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 The Company assured the Union that it will comply with the provisions of the FMLA.
As part of its compliance, the Company presently plans to establish a new category of unpaid leave called "FMLA Leave", in some instances, FMLA Leaves will be concurrent with leaves of absence covered by Section (66)(a) and (78)(a) of the Office, Clerical and Engineering and Production and Maintenance Collective Bargaining Agreements, respectively. Accordingly, in those cases where the employee is eligible for leave under the DaimlerChrysler-UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement and the leave also qualities under the FMLA, the Company Intends to comply with the requirements of the FMLA as well as the separate provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement regarding covered leaves of absence.
Pursuant to the Company's present plan for compliance with the FMLA, the Company's rights under the Act will be modified to:
- Provide that an employee on FMLA Leave will continue to accumulate seniority in the same manner as the employee also would be eligible under Section (66)(a) and (78)(a) of the Office, Clerical and Engineering and Production
467
and Maintenance Collective Bargaining Agreements, respectively, as appropriate;
-	- Permit but not require employees to substitute vacation and/or excused absence allowance for unpaid FMLA Leave;
-	Provide that employees who are married to each other will be each entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks of qualifying leave under the Act;
-	Provide that, when a third opinion is necessary under the medical certification and dispute resolution sections of the FMLA, the neutral provider will be selected jointly by the Company and the Union from a list, provided by the appropriate local or state professional medical association, of board-certified specialists in the field of medicine in which the point of controversy exists;
-	Continue Company-paid Group, Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Disability Insurance during all FMLA Leaves trial are not also DaimlerChrysler-UAW Medical Leaves as if such teaves were DalmterChrysler-UAW Personal Leaves of Absence.
In addition, the Company's plan for compliance would;
-	Not automatically designate and apply absence time that is compensated under the Sickness and Accident Insurance provisions of the Life, Disability and Health Care Benefits Program against an eligible employee’s FMLA entitlement.
-	Use, initially, a calendar year as the 12-month period of the leave entitlement (for example: in 1993, from the effective date through December 31, 1993; in 1994, from January 1, 1994 through December 31,1994);
-	Require repayment of the cost of health care coverage provided during the leave 1rom employees who fail to return from FMLA Leave to the extent permitted by law.
The Department of Labor has not yet issued final regulations regarding this Act. The Company may make changes in its compliance plans to reflect final regulations and/or subsequent court decisions and the gaining of additional administrative experience but without reducing leaves provided by the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

While a number of issues were covered, a specific area of concern involved employees subject to support orders when certain lump sum payments are made. For these employees, such payments can be delayed because of the legally required arrearage verification and adjustment procedures.
The Company advised the Union of existing procedures tor the advance notification to the respective courts, in a manner consistent with legal requirements, of pending lump sum payments to employees subject to support orders. Further, the Company recognizes that processing adjustments to those lump sum payments should be done in a timely manner consistent with the law.

International Union, UAW
Attention; Mr, Stephen P. Yokich
Dear Sirs:
During these negotiations, we discussed at length our collective successes in the arena of health and safety. Moreover, we share the belief that furthering our progress will aid in our recognition as a world class Corporation - one which places a high value upon the heatth and safety of Its workers and their families. Realizing that our past and present improvements have provided an enhanced work environment, we, nevertheless, recognized that many opportunities exist for even further improvements.
In that regard, we conceived an approach to enhance our efforts towards achieving those mutual objectives. A new program entitled BEST (Bringing Excellence to Safety Teams) will be launched with the start of the new millennium. The core foundation of BEST will be that only through total enterprise ownership and mobilization can optimal health and safety results be achieved. In order to establish that foundation, the parties recognize that a significant commitment towards training and resources will be required, along with personal commitments by all participants, from senior leadership all the way to the shop floor.
While insufficient time existed during our negotiations to address the program specifics, we concurred that BEST shall contain the following general elements:
1.	A cascade training format will be utilized, whereby training shall be waterfalled, on a joint basis, throughout organizations where top leadership will be trained and then they will train subsequent levels.
2,	A minimum of four (4) hours of leadership training, addressing roles and responsibilities, among other issues, will be given to the Co-Chairs of the Local Employee Participation Council (LEPC) at our Annual UAW-DaimlerChrysler Meetings.
3.	Specific training addressed to members of the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee shall take place at the Annual Health & Safety Meetings. This training shall include 3 flow 471
(material, process, information) training; root cause analysis; Plan, Do, Check, Act (POCA) training; and other relevant tools.
4.	A general awareness and responsibilities training program tor all employees will be developed.
5.	Wherever possible, the tools ot the Operating Principles will be utilized and leveraged to ensure alignment, standardization and continuity. The program will be modeled after the joint quality process, which emphasizes continuous improvement through process control, effective design of equipment and processes, and effective training and work methods.
6.	Risk assessment and hazard control wili be conducted for high hazard jobs. This includes identification of tasks, identification of hazards associated with each task, risk assessment and selection of method(s) to control. Selection of controls will be based on the hierarchy, which gives preference to engineering solutions over procedures and personal protective equipment. High hazard Jobs to be targeted will be determined by the NJC.
The responsibility for the development of BEST shall be with the National Joint Committee on Health and Safety in conjunction with the National Employee Participation Council. Funding for BEST programs shall be from National Training Center allotments.
We are confident that BEST can become a benchmark for other companies and unions. Moreover, we are excited about its possibilities for allowing us to make even greater improvements in our workplace environments, thereby enhancing overall Corporate performance and employee morale/well-being.

Our new facilities have been engineered with significant attention to employee health and safety, resulting in metal working fluid levels well below 1.0 mg/m3. Moreover, as new equipment has been placed in existing facilities, similar results have been achieved. Likewise, in existing facilities, a variety of means and efforts associated with current systems have resulted in impressive improvements over pre-existing conditions. These efforts, along with other recent announcements (such as Mack II and the Kenosha expansion), and new tooling (installed and projected) at existing facilities have dramatically reduced our overall Corporate mist levels, in fact, in those locations with new installations, we believe the overall environmental average for the area or plant is at or below 0,5 mg/m3.
The Corporation advised the Union of our intent to continue similar efforts throughout the life of the current Agreement. To that end, we will endeavor to engineer and design new equipment to attain a level ot 0,5 mg/m3 time weighted average (TWA) for initial production start-up. Furthermore, efforts will be made to attain this level after start-up. Moreover, the Corporation agreed that, for its existing equipment, it will strive to obtain a DaimlerChrysler exposure guideline of 1.0 mg/m3 or less on or before the year 2004.
Medical surveillance (consisting ot a standardized respiratory symptoms questionnaire) for respiratory effects of machining fluids will be offered to employees who regularly work in operations with machining fluids.
Records of laboratory testing and coolant additions will be maintained and, upon request, made available to the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee.

(168)	Payment of Shift Premium During In-Plant Training
Internationa) Union, UAW
Attention: Mr. Jack Laskowski
Dear Sira:
During these negotiations lengthy discussions were held regarding in-plant training of Cferical-Engineering-Technical employees. Both parties continue to support training initiatives and maximum participation by Cterical-Engineering-Technical
478
employees in efforts which will enhance skill levels and fully Utilize the talents and abilities of these employees to meet the competitive challenges that He ahead.
The Union expressed concern that maximum participation is being hindered because of a pay practice which results in the loss of shift premium to Clerical-Engineering-Technical employees who receive and attend training on a shift other than the shift on which they would otherwise normally work. The Union further maintains such loss of shift premium has adversely impacted morale and plant efficiency, resulted in certain employees not attending such training and therefore, missed the opportunity to upgrade their skills.
In an effort to seek maximum participation in available inplant training, the parties have agreed that notwithstanding the provisions of Section (68) of the Engineering Office & Clerical Agreement, a salaried employee who is required to attend inplant training necessary to upgrade his/her skills in his/her classification on a shift other than he/she would otherwise normally work, will be paid the shift premium normally paid for his/her regularly assigned shift during the period he/she is attending such training.
