KING SOOPERS, INCORPORATED MEAT PLANT SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT
KING SOOPERS, INCORPORATED (Denver, Colorado) a Division of DILLON COMPANY, INCORPORATED, hereinafter referred to as the "Employer” and the UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION, LOCAL #7, AFL-CIO, CLC, hereinafter referred to as the “Union” are parties to a Labor Agreement having as its term May 10, 2009 to September 14, 2013. Said Agreement, hereinafter referred to as the "Principal Agreement" covers the retail operations of the Employer’s stores in the metropolitan Denver area.
This Supplemental Agreement which has as its term May 10, 2009 to September 14, 2013, amends, modifies, or changes certain identified portions of the Principal Agreement as set forth below. Where there is no reference to an Article or Section of the Principal Agreement, the provisions of the Principal Agreement shall be controlling.
ARTICLE 1 RECOGNITION AND UNION SECURITY

The Employer also recognizes the Union as the sole collective bargaining agency for production employees, including the boners and meat cutters, apprentices, lead-persons where designated by Management, receiving crews (including handling boxed merchandise not processed in the plant) order fillers of plant processed meats or meats to be further processed, staffers, scalers, laundry and sanitation crew, and packaging department employees employed at the Employer's Meat Plant, Denver, Colorado.
Excluded from Union jurisdiction are maintenance personnel, order selectors handling boxed merchandise (involving shipping and storage not processed in this plant) clerical employees, inspectors, guards, buyers, professional employees, and supervisors, as defined in the National Labor Relations Act, as amended.

The language of paragraph (2), (2A), item b, shall be amended to read:
In connection with the instruction or training of an employee or employees, picking up product from floor to salvage the product, rectifying of machinery malfunctions, or correcting safety hazards.
ARTICLE 9 TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENTS
The Principal Agreement shall be amended as follows:
The Employer shall determine if a temporary vacancy will be filled by assignment of an employee in the same classification or the assignment of an employee in a lower or higher classification.
Temporary vacancies of three (3) consecutive shifts or less may be filled at the discretion of the Employer by an employee in the same classification. When the temporary vacancy will exceed three (3) consecutive shifts, it will offer the temporary vacancy to the senior qualified employee(s) available to perform the work on the shift in the same classification in another department. If the temporary vacancy is not filled in this manner, the Employer will assign the temporary vacancy by reverse seniority to the qualified employee available to perform the work on the shift in the same classification in another department. If none or insufficient employee(s) are available, the Employer will offer the temporary vacancy to the senior qualified employee(s) available to perform the work on another shift in the same classification. If the temporary vacancy is still not filled, the Employer will assign the temporary vacancy by reverse seniority to the qualified employee available to perform the work on another shift in the same classification.
Temporary vacancies of one (1) shift or less may be filled at the discretion of the Employer by an employee in a lower classification. When the Employer knows in advance the temporary vacancy will exceed one (1) shift, it will offer the temporary vacancy to the senior qualified employee(s) available to perform the work on the shift in the next lower classification. If the temporary vacancy is not filled in this manner, the Employer will assign the temporary vacancy by reverse seniority to the qualified employee available to perform the work on the shift in the next lower classification.
Employees, without regard to their classification, shall be required to perform any labor or render any service in or about or in connection with the Employer’s Meat Plant, provided that when he or she is working in a higher classification, the highest classification shall apply in hourly units for each hour or major fraction thereof.
Nothing herein shall prevent a higher classified employee from performing whatever work he may be assigned in the Plant.
2
When Meat Cutters and/or Meat Wrappers are needed for temporary assignment at straight time of overtime to either the Meat Plant or a Retail Meat Bargaining unit, the Employer will ask for available qualified volunteers by seniority in the classification for which the temporary assignment is needed.
If additional employees are needed the Employer will assign by reverse seniority the number of qualified employees needed in the classification where the temporary assignment is needed.
At the conclusion of Temporary Assignments, employees will be returned to their original location.
ARTICLE 16 HOLIDAYS
Delete language of Principal Agreement and substitute the following:
All employees hired on or before March 5, 2005 who have completed their probationary period shall be paid for the following holidays whether or not they fall on what would normally be a workday for the employees involved: New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. Such employees shall be entitled to two (2) personal holidays, which must be requested two (2) weeks in advance and approved by supervision.
All employees hired on or after March 6, 2005 who have completed their probationary period shall be paid for the following holidays whether or not they fall on what would normally be a workday for the employees involved: Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. Such employees shall be entitled to one (1) personal holiday after two years of service, two (2) personal holidays after three (3) years of service, and three (3) personal holidays after four years of service. Such holidays must be requested two (2) weeks in advance and approved by supervision.

Provided, however, that employees absent because of illness, verified by a doctor's certificate or other authoritative verification of illness, death in the immediate family, or other excused absence will receive holiday pay.
In the event that any of the above-mentioned holidays should fall on Sunday, the following Monday shall be observed as the official holiday.
3
To be eligible for personal holidays during each calendar year, an employee must be on the payroll as of January 1 of each year. Such holidays must be taken during the respective calendar year. An employee whose employment terminates prior to his having taken his personal holidays or who fails to take his personal holiday in the calendar year shall not be entitled to holiday pay. In the event an employee fails to schedule his personal holiday by October 1 of the calendar year, the employer will select a date and schedule such employee for his remaining personal holidays for that year.
Employees hired on or before March 5, 2005 required to work on any of the above holidays will be compensated for hours worked at one and one half (1 Vi) times their hourly rate of pay, in addition to the eight (8) hours compensation at the straight time rate which the employee shall receive for an unworked holiday. Employees hired on or after March 6, 2005 required to work on any of the above holidays will be compensated for hours worked at one dollar ($1.00) per hour, in addition to the eight (8) hours compensated at the straight time rate which the employee shall receive for an unworked holiday. A holiday shall consist of the hours from 12:01 a.m. to 12:00 midnight on the night of the holiday. When the Employer limits the number of employees taking a personal holiday on a given day, the Employer shall allow the most senior employee(s) requesting the day to take said personal holiday. The Employer shall allow at least one (1) employee in the bargaining unit off on a personal holiday each regularly scheduled work day.

No later than the second Wednesday prior to the beginning of the week in which a holiday observed hereunder occurs (exclusive of personal holidays), the Employer shall post by classification a holiday volunteer work list. An employee desirous of working the upcoming holiday, in the classification and job assignment he normally performs, shall sign such list no later than Tuesday prior to the holiday week. Signing of another employee's name on such list shall be cause for disciplinary action. The Employer will select the necessary employees from this list in accordance with seniority and ability, within each classification and shift. If the Employer cannot adequately staff the employees by selecting from within the classification and shift, the Employer will select the necessary employees from the list within the classification, provided such selection would not cause the employee to work back to back shifts. Should the Employer not be able to staff its schedule requirements through this procedure, qualified employees shall be assigned the remaining available schedules by reverse seniority and ability within their respective classifications and shifts.
There shall be no pyramiding of over-time on any of the above provisions.
No employee on leave of absence shall be eligible for holiday pay and to be eligible for holiday pay an employee must perform work during the week in which the holiday occurs, unless the employee is on vacation.
4

BARGAINING NOTE: The Employer intends to continue the canceled vacation policy.
The Employer will post a notice November 1 of the prior calendar year, senior employees and continuing with employees of lesser seniority shall choose in turn, each within two (2) working days once notified so that the vacation schedule is completed by January 31 of each calendar year.
Any employee who fails to sign such roster prior to January 31, will be permitted to take vacation at a time that will not interfere with the other employees' established vacation period(s).
When the vacation dates have been established, they will not be changed unless mutually agreed upon between the employee and Employer.
Notwithstanding the above, employees who voluntarily transfer to the plant or within the plant to another classification after their vacation selection has been made, shall forfeit their selection and be entitled only to the remaining available weeks to make their selection from, in that calendar year, in the new classification unless the transfer is involuntary.

An employee who is to be laid off from a classification in the plant shall displace the shortest service employee in the same classification in the plant.
An employee thus displaced from his classification in the plant shall have the option of displacing the shortest service person in the same classification in the stores, provided he has at least six (6) months experience in that retail classification with this Employer, or displacing the shortest service employee in a lower classification in the plant whose job he is qualified to perform, provided any displaced employee has lesser service.
Any employee being laid off shall be allowed to take a layoff in lieu of displacing a shorter service employee, but then shall be entitled to recall rights to his original classification only.
When an employee has exercised his right to displace a lower classification person in the plant and it is found by the Employer or the employee that he is not qualified to perform said job during the first thirty (30) days in the lower classification, he shall be allowed the right to take a layoff or displace the shortest service employee in

The Employer will post notice of such departmental vacancies and employees desiring change will sign the notice within seventy-two (72) hours, excluding Saturday and Sunday, after the notice is posted. The departmental vacancy shall be awarded to the senior qualified employee who has signed the notice, providing the abilities of the signing employee are substantially equal.
Days off shall be bid by classification within departments which are as defined in the vacation provisions of this Supplement. Nothing herein shall limit the Employer's right to assign employees temporarily from one department to another without regard to seniority.

The employer shall not fill a vacant position with a new applicant for employment if there are employees of the bargaining unit on lay off status who are qualified to perform the duties needed in the vacancy.

APPENDIX “A’
The minimum hourly rates of pay for the indicated classifications shall be as set forth below on the dates indicated. The Employer may hire any employee at any rate in the progression schedule at its sole discretion.
Rate Determination
Employees hired before March 6, 2005 who remain in their classification after commencement of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the “hired and assigned in the bargaining unit prior to March 6, 2005” wage schedule while they remain in that classification.
Demotions, Step Downs and layoffs: An employee who is demoted, steps down, or who is laid off in accordance with this Agreement, shall be placed back into the same wage schedule in which the employee was working immediately prior to their assignment into management or promotion into the classification from which they are being demoted, stepping down or laid off. In determining the proper progression level for an employee demoted, stepping down, or laid off from a classification with a higher “thereafter" hourly rate to a classification with a lower “thereafter" hourly rate, such affected employee shall be placed in the appropriate progression level in the rate schedule referenced in this paragraph based on their experience in the newly assigned classification, regardless of whether such assigned rate results in a reduction in hourly rate. In determining prior experience hereunder, the Employer will give recognition to the verified number of hours of actual work experience in the same classification which said employee may have performed for the Employer and the verified number of hours of actual work experience on a comparable job which said employee may have performed within the previous five (5) years for any other employer in a similar retail grocery operation.
Rate Determination - Promotions, new hires and new entrants into the bargaining unit: Employees hired into, or assigned to, or promoted to a different classification, the bargaining unit on or after March 5, 2005 shall be assigned to the “employees hired into the bargaining unit or assigned or promoted ON or AFTER march 6. 2005” wage scale. Employees who are promoted to a different classification after March 5, 2005 shall not receive a reduction in their hourly rate of pay if when promoted to such classification they are being paid an hourly rate of pay greater than the minimum, unless they are above the "thereafter" hourly rate in which case they will immediately be paid the "thereafter" hourly rate. When such employee is paid less than the “thereafter" hourly rate, prior to receiving an increase in their hourly rate of pay, they must work 1,040 hours at their current rate before promotion to the hourly rate in the new classification that would give them an increase in their hourly rate of pay.

WEINGARTEN RULES
Under the Supreme Court’s Weingarten decision, when an investigatory interview occurs, you should ask if it is for disciplinary action. If so, the following rules apply:
Rule I: The employee must make a clear request for union representation before or during the interview. The employee cannot be punished for making this request.
Rule II: After the employee makes the request, the Employer must choose from among three options. The Employer must either:
A.	Grant the request and delay questioning until the union representative arrives and has a chance to consult privately with the employee, or
B.	Deny the request and end the interview immediately, or
C.	Give the employee a choice of:
(1)	having the interview without representation or
(2)	ending the interview.
Rule III: If the Employer denies the request for union representation, and continues to ask questions, it commits an unfair labor practice and the employee has a right to refuse to answer. The Employer may not discipline the employee for such a refusal.

DO NOT GO SUSPENDED!!!
REMEMBER, IF YOU LEAVE THE INDUSTRY FOR ANY REASON (termination, layoff, leave of absence, etc.) apply for your withdrawal card. This must be done within 30 days from the last day worked. This protects your union status in the event you should ever return to the industry. Failure to get a withdrawal card will result in SUSPENSION from the Union and a reinstatement fee will be charged. If you leave the industry IT IS YOUR OBLIGATION TO GET A WITHDRAWAL CARD!
The withdrawal card will be issued at no cost, the only requirement being that your initiation fee be fully paid and your dues must be paid for the month in which you request the withdrawal card. The withdrawal card is good indefinitely and allows you to become a member of any local union affiliated with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union without payment of any additional fee(s). Withdrawal card must be deposited with the union office within 30 days after returning to work or it becomes null and void and the reinstatement fee must be paid. All persons returning to work with a withdrawal card must fill out a new application and authorization.
WITHDRAWAL CARD REQUEST FORM
When your employment terminates, or if you are laid off, or on a leave of absence over 30 days, you should request a Withdrawal Card.
