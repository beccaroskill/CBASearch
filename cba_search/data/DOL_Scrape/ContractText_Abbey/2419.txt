(4)	Any grievance certified to arbitration which is not arbitrated within one year of the certification of the arbitration will be considered closed and is ineligible for arbitration
18
consideration unless extended by mutual agreement between the parties.
The fee of the arbitrator and the necessary expenses (exclusive of any payment to witnesses) of any arbitration proceeding shall be borne equally by the Company and the Union, except that each party shall pay the fees of its legal counsel or representative. If employees or other witnesses are called by the Company, the Company will reimburse them for time lost.

Temporary/Emergency Layoffs shall not exceed twenty (20) consecutive days without a mutual agreement to extend for a longer period of time. Temporary/Emergency Layoffs are not to interfere with an employee’s seniority rights as previously addressed in this Agreement.
23
H.	Voluntary Layoff
Employees wishing to volunteer for layoff ahead of less senior employees may submit a request in writing to their supervisor, with a copy to the Union, to receive consideration for a voluntary layoff under the following conditions:
1.	There must be a pending reduction in force which would affect the employee’s current classification.

(b)	The employee will not have the right to displace less senior employees who remain on the active payroll.
(c)	The employee must comply with all change of address notification requirements required by this Agreement.
I.	Recall
Vacancies in a job classification shall be filled by employees who have maintained seniority rights.
Employees will be recalled, by job classification, in inverse seniority order of their layoff. Employees accepting a downgrade in lieu of layoff will have recall rights to all classifications they previously held. Such recall rights shall be by seniority.
The Company will send recall notices, by certified mail, to employee's last official address. The employee must accept recall in accordance with Section 1, subsection E 7 of this Article, or shall
24
lose seniority. Employees must be ready to report on the start date and be medically certified to perform the available work. In the event an employee is not able to medically certify, but will be able to medically certify within thirty (30) days of the recall start date, the employee shall provide written notification to the Company within five (5) days of receipt of the recall notice. Subject to Medical Review Officer (MRO) approval, the employee may be permitted to delay their start date, up to a maximum of thirty (30) days. Should the MRO fail to review the fully completed return to work request within thirty (30) days, the return to work date may be extended.
Short-Duration: An employee offered a recall from layoff that is expected to last less than thirty (30) days may decline such offer and still retain recall rights to the classification held at time of layoff.
Disability Recalls: Employees who are medically certified as disabled or incapacitated during recall will be bypassed but retain recall rights for future job openings not to exceed a period of twelve (12) consecutive months.
J.	Employee Transfers
Consideration shall be given to employees in seniority order who have filed written requests with the Company and who are competent to fill the vacancy. All transfers will be subject to Company approval.
Employee swaps will require the approval of both Operations Managers at the respective sites and the Operations Director for the AFSS Program. Any complaints arising out of the administration of this section are not subject to the grievance procedure.
K.	Return to Work After Medical Leave
An employee who has been downgraded or laid off due to medical limitations and whose medical condition subsequently improves sufficiently to allow them to perform the required work shall be returned to their former job classification. The foregoing will apply provided work is being performed in such job classification and provided further that their seniority entitles them to such placement when compared to the seniority of employees in such job classification. If their seniority is not sufficient to return them to their job classification, they will be granted recall status subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Their recall status will commence on the date they would have been subject to layoff action or the date on which their medical condition
25
is sufficiently improved to allow them to perform the required work, whichever occurs first.
Section 2	- Promotions
1.	When a vacant position arises, the most qualified employee who applies at that site shall be considered for promotion. When qualifications are deemed equal, the most senior employee will be selected for the position before any new employee or employees are hired to fill such position or vacancy provided such employee is available on the Company’s active payroll.

Section 3	- New or Revised Job Classifications
A.	It is recognized that changing conditions and circumstances may require the establishment of new or revised job classifications within the collective bargaining unit heretofore defined because of changes in job content growing out of the introduction of new services, changes in equipment or in method of processes. The Company shall furnish the Union with the new or revised job descriptions and shall submit for its approval the rate. The Company shall send by certified mail a copy of any new or revised job description, including rate of pay to the Union ten (10) days prior to placing it into effect. If Agreement regarding the rates for newly established job classifications and rates and revisions for previously agreed to classifications has not been reached after ten (10) working days, the Company may place the job classifications into effect. The Union will have the right within five (5) days thereafter to file a “grievance general in character” over any alleged improper application of such rates. If the Union does not file a grievance
26
within the time limit specified above, the rates established by the Company will be considered to be fair and equitable and will remain in effect.
B.	The Company, in describing, determining the application and assigning rates for these new job classifications herein affected, will apply any known comparable wage determination technique(s). Such information will be supplied to the Union.

ARTICLE V
LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Section 1	- Introduction
The Company and Union agree that requests for leaves of absence without pay will be for the following reasons: illness, injury, military, Union business and personal. Granting or disallowance of leaves will be subject to the provisions set forth in this Article. The Company will provide the Union with notice of all approved leave of absence monthly.
Section 2	- Military Leaves
Consistent with Company policy, any employee who establishes proof of entering active duty in the U.S. uniformed services will be granted a leave of absence in accordance with the laws of the United States government, governing same, at the time such leave is taken.
For employees scheduled to work during the weekend who serve in the U.S. uniformed services:

•	Employees will exhaust the military leave provided under Company policy before consideration of the rescheduled day, and prior to allowing for vacation, floating holiday or ANP.
•	The remaining weekend day would be coded as vacation, floating holiday or ANP.
Given the complexity of the schedule, this accommodation must meet operational requirements and the time off between shift requirements. Accordingly, the Company will attempt to make alternative arrangements when possible. Employees shall provide the Company with as much advance notice of the leave as possible to allow the Company sufficient time to review and respond to the employee’s request. The employee shall forward the requested accommodation to the Operations Manager for consideration. Any complaints regarding this provision are not subject to the grievance procedure.
28

2.	Employees who leave their employment with the Company to become full-time Union representative(s) will be granted leave(s) of absence with seniority rights unimpaired, provided that they have had twelve (12) months of continuous employment with the Company.
3.	Leaves of absence for Union business will terminate if the employee fails to return to work within thirty (30) working days following completion of such Union employment. Request for such leave of absence will be made to cover “the term of office” for renewable periods of four (4) years.
Section 4	- Personal Leaves
Upon written application, a leave of absence may be granted for personal reasons at the sole and exclusive discretion of the Company, for a period not to exceed fifteen (15) days per calendar year.

ARTICLE VI
WORKPLACE CONDITIONS
Section 1	- Labor/Management Committee
The Company and the Union recognize that a harmonious working relationship is beneficial for meeting the needs of the customer and the employees. To that end, the parties may establish Labor/Management Committees at each site. The local parties may develop a charter, detailing frequency, timing, etc., based upon the following parameters:
•	Meeting schedule may be of a frequency up to one meeting/month.
•	Agenda items will be submitted one week in advance to a designated representative of the Company and Union, respectively, and may include but are not limited to flex, building maintenance, safety, etc.
•	The Committee will comprise an equal number of Company and Union representatives, up to three (3). Company representatives will be determined based on submitted agenda items.
•	Meeting duration may be up to one hour.
These committees shall not discuss or make decisions that impact or alter the terms of this agreement.
Section 2	- Areas of Responsibility
The parties have agreed that it is advantageous for the program, the employees, and the customers to have employees take calls within their primary and secondary Areas of Responsibility (AOR). Currently, employees are answering calls in their primary and secondary briefing AOR’s (at a level above 90%). We will continue to maintain this focus and will meet periodically to review our progress.
Specialists shall not be required to maintain certification on more than one primary AOR and one secondary AOR.
Except in emergency or exigent situations (and between the hours of 12:00am and 4:30am), no specialist will be required to log on to more than one work station at a time. However, due to the
30
operational configuration of the Honolulu AOR, specialists assigned to the Honolulu AOR may be required to log on to more than one work station outside of the 12:00am to 4:30am time frame.
Section 3	- Call Transfer
It is the responsibility of the specialist to provide pilots with whatever information and assistance as may be necessary from approved sources for planning and executing a safe flight in accordance with Lockheed Martin and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements. A transfer of a call is warranted and acceptable if the specialist or pilot determines that additional information can be provided by transferring the caller, with the pilot’s full understanding, to a specialist who can better satisfy the pilot’s needs.
In the event that a specialist determines a need to transfer a call exists, the following expectations are required to be met prior to the transfer:
•	Answer the incoming call appropriately.
•	Obtain background information that allows the specialist to determine the needs of the pilot.
•	Provide the requested information to the best ability of the specialist.
•	The specialist must log the transaction. The information logged should include the date, time, workstation, ACID (Aircraft Identification), and reason for the transfer.
Section 4	- Evaluations
When an employee is given an evaluation by management, they will be notified as soon as practical.
Section 5	- Complex Calls
It is recognized that after a complex call the standard 15 second reset between briefs does not always allow sufficient time to wrap up. For this reason, it is acceptable for an employee to go off line for up to one additional minute at the completion of the call.
31
Section 6	- Semi-Annual Labor Relations Meeting
The parties recognize that ongoing, open and constructive dialogue is beneficial to a productive labor-management relationship. To this end, it is agreed that during the term of this agreement, the parties will hold twice yearly meetings for the purpose of discussing issues affecting the collective bargaining relationship. The attendees shall be determined by each party, but shall include at least one (1) member of management from the AFSS Program and one (1) member from the IAM International Union. The meetings shall be scheduled at mutually convenient times and at a mutually convenient location.

Section 2:	Based on operational requirements as determined by the Company, a Basic Watch Schedule shall be set on an annual basis, normally on December 1, to become effective the second Monday in January of the following year. During the period November 1 through November 30 of each year, employees shall be given an opportunity to identify their schedule preference in writing to the Company. Assignments to the Basic Watch Schedule shall be made in order of the most senior, qualified employee.

The Company will determine the number of specialists per Area of Responsibility (AOR) by facility and will determine the staffing requirements by half hour. The Company will provide the Union these numbers no later than six (6) weeks before this meeting.
The Company and the Union will use the 30 days prior to this meeting to work on opportunities for alternate and/or compressed work schedules locally for each site.
Union representatives will have the opportunity to review the staffing requirements and develop schedules that meet these requirements. In the event that a mutual agreement cannot be reached in time for the schedule bid to be started by November 1, as required above, management will provide a Basic Watch Schedule that meets the requirements and will conduct a schedule bid according to seniority.
33
Section 4:	The most senior qualified employees will be given preference to assignments to the facility Basic Watch Schedule within their respective AORs. Seasonal shifts to the Basic Watch Schedule that have been identified prior to the bid process shall be reflected on the affected lines, including affected dates and times. Any subsequent seasonal changes to the Basic Watch Schedule shall be given with 30 days’ notice.
A one-time schedule change to an employee’s assignment is not considered a change to the facility Basic Watch Schedule. Employee schedule changes should be done on an equitable basis and with as limited number of changes as possible. Employee schedule changes will be reviewed quarterly by the local labor management committees and at the Labor Relations Summit Meetings.
A change of an individual assignment shall be given with a minimum of twenty-one (21) days’ notice with the exception of employees volunteering to change shifts or for the scheduling of training.
Should the Basic Watch Schedule need to be reset during the year due to operational requirements, the annual process as noted above will be utilized in the appropriate AOR and facility. If the facility Basic Watch Schedule is changed, assigned employees shall receive thirty (30) calendar days’ notice should their schedule change.
If operational requirements cannot be met by canvassing for volunteers, it is understood that management may schedule mandatory overtime as necessary.
Section 5:	Should the Basic Watch Schedule need to be reset during the year due to operational requirements, the annual process noted above will be utilized in the appropriate AOR and facility.

34
c)	Swaps shall be made to the facility Basic Watch Schedule as soon as practical.
d)	Swaps shall be canceled if any specialist involved transfers to another facility or leaves the bargaining unit as a result of resignation, promotion, disability, or termination.
e)	Swaps may be canceled when requested in writing by all specialists involved.
Section 7:	In the event a schedule line is permanently vacated:
a)	Management will determine whether the vacated line will be backfilled or eliminated.

c)	The open line shall be submitted to the Union to bid and offered to the next eligible specialist according to the original bid order, within the respective AOR and facility, and continue in that order until filled.
d)	Once accepted, the newly vacated line will be examined by management. If it is to be backfilled, it will be offered to the next eligible specialist in line. This process shall continue until the original bid order has been completed.
e)	If no specialist accepts a line that management determines is to be backfilled, it will be assigned to the least senior eligible specialist with not less than 30 days’ notice.
Section 8:	In the event a schedule line is added during the year, due to hiring, transfer, or other reason:
a)	Management will identify a group of eligible specialists based on operational requirements.
b)	The line shall be offered to eligible specialists within the respective AOR and facility in the original bid order.
c)	If the line is accepted, the newly vacated line shall be offered to the next eligible specialist in line.
d)	This process shall continue until the original bid order has been completed.
e)	The line that has not been selected shall be assigned to the new specialist joining the facility.
f)	In the event of a transfer, the transferring specialist shall take his or her rightful place in seniority for the next schedule bid.
35
Section 9:	Deviations in the facility Basic Watch Schedule process or selection order may occur by mutual agreement of the Local Union and Company representatives.
Section 10: During the period November 1 through the second Monday in December of each year, but after the schedule selection is complete, employees shall be given an opportunity to identify their leave preference for that year in writing to the Company. The process and procedures for that selection shall be established by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union at each site, to be administered consistent with the vacation scheduling provision in the Wages and Benefits article. In the event that a mutual agreement cannot be reached by December 1, the Company will provide the process and procedures to be administered.
Section 11: Additionally, with operational requirements permitting, and with supervisory approval, employees may flex their scheduled shift for up to one (1) hour. Requests will be considered no more than twenty-four (24) hours and no less than one (1) hour prior to the assigned shift. Flexing shall not create additional shift premium pay.
A standardized flex request form shall be developed and utilized with input from the Union and management, and agreed upon by both parties. If, at the time the flex request is submitted, staffing would permit leave approval for the time frame vacated by a flex request, then the flex should be approved.
Only the time period being vacated by the flex will be considered.
In the event a supervisor is not available, a flex request may be handled by a Designated Lead Specialist.
Any complaints about flex will not be subject to the grievance procedure.

ARTICLE VIII
WAGES AND BENEFITS
Section 1	- Compensation

Payment of the lump sum wage supplement is contingent upon written confirmation of the acceptance of the agreement by 5:00pm EST on March 31, 2016.
B.	Wage Scale - See Appendix “A”
Section 2	- Employee Group Insurance
Effective January 1, 2013, employees may participate in the Company sponsored Health & Welfare plans, including the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The Company maintains the right to pass through improvements, modifications, changes, or employee premiums to these plans at any time. Any elimination contemplated to these plans will only be as a result of Lockheed Martin Information Systems and Global Solutions, Civil no longer offering the specific plan. If and when these situations arise, the Company will notify the Union prior to taking such action.
For the benefit plan year 2017, and for the term of the Agreement, the Company will pay seventy percent (70%) of the annual medical premium and the employee’s annual medical contribution shall be thirty percent (30%).
For the term of the Agreement, the Employee’s medical contribution will not increase by more than 10% per year.
For the benefit plan year 2013, and for the term of the Agreement, the Company will pay fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the Dental Comprehensive Plan and the Dental Network Plan.

If you are covered as a dependent under any medical plan offered by the Company, the opt-out credit is not available to you.
Recognizing the impending implementation of health care legislation in 2018 and beyond, it is the intent of both the Company and Union that none of the benefits provided in connection with the aforementioned health insurance benefits (e.g. medical, health care spending accounts) will cause the application of an excise or High Cost Coverage Excise Tax (Cadillac Plan Tax) as a result of providing such benefits with respect to The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”). Accordingly, in order to avoid such a tax and in keeping with the intent of the parties, the Company reserves the right, both during the term of this Agreement and after its expiration, to amend, modify and/or discontinue the health insurance benefits provided above for the purpose of avoiding implementation of a High Cost Coverage Excise Tax pursuant to PPACA.
