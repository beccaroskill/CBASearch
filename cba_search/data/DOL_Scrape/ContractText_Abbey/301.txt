INTRODUCTION
The management of General Motors recognizes that it cannot get along without labor any more than labor can get along without the management. Both are in the same business and the success of that business is vital to all concerned. This requires that both management and the employees work together to the end that the quality and cost of Sie product will prove increasingly satisfactory and attractive so that the business .wilLbe continuously successful.
General Motors holds that the basic interests bFem7 - ployers and employees are the same. However, at times employees and the management have different ideas on various matters affecting their relationship. The management of General Motors is convinced that there is no reason why these differences cannot be peacefully and satisfactorily adjusted by sincere and patient effort on both sides.

(la) If either party at a particular location believes that the provisions-of this Agreement are being administered in a manner inconsistent with orderly collective bargaining relations, the circumstances will be discussed between the designated representative of local Management and the Chairperson of the Shop Committee in an effort to resolve the problem.

In no event shall such employee be transferred to a bargaining unit job at a time when the employee has insufficient seniority ' to be so placed.
Seniority Lists	.
(31)	Up-to-date employment lists showing employees in each occupational group by name and date of hiring will be made available to all employees within the plant for their inspection by posting where practical or by a satisfactory equivalent method.

job) and	employee would have earned
had the employee been promoted effective on the date of the grievance.
(b)	It is the policy of Management to cooperate in every practical way with seniority employees or employees who are at die top rate of their classification and who desire transfers to hew positions or vacancies in their department. Accordingly, such employees who make application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department stating their desires, quali? flcations and experience, will be given preference for openings in their department provided they are capable of doing the job. Employees who have made - “ application as provided for above and who are capable of doing die job available shall be given prefer- ■ ence for the openings in their department over new hires. In case the opening is in an equal or lower rated classification and there is more than one applicant
39
capable of doing the job, the applicant with the longest seniority will be given preference. ■
Any secondary job openings resulting from filling jobs pursuant to this provision may be filled through promotion, or through transfer without regard to seniority standing,.or by new hire.
In plants where departments are too small or in other cases where the number of job classifications within a department is insufficient to permit the practical application of this paragraph, arrangements whereby employees may make such application for transfer out of their department may be negotiated locally, subject to approval by die Corporation and the International Union.
Any claim of personal prejudice or any claim of discrimination for Union activity in connection with transfers may be taken up as a grievance. Such claim must be supported by written evidence submitted within 48 hours from the time the grievance is filed.

40
of the Shop Committee. If the employee complies with the conditions set forth in the notification, the employee’s seniority will be reinstated if it has not otherwise been broken; however, such reinstatement shall not be construed as limiting the application to the case of the Shop Rule regarding absence without reasonable cause.
(d)	If the employee fails to return to work within five (5) working days after having been notified to report for work and does not give a satisfactory reason. Such notice shall be clear in intent and purpose. A copy of Management’s notification of such loss of seniority will be furnished promptly to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee. ’

Approved vacation time off, exclusive of the time identified as a Plant Vacation Shutdown, will not thereafter be canceled or changed without the mutual con- -sent of Management and the employee. If an employee's approved vacation time off includes a scheduled Plant Vacation Shutdown and the Plant
104
Vacation Shutdown is canceled or changed, the employee may reschedule their vacation in accordance with focal plant practice,	-
(lOlw) ■ Regardless of the provisions of Paragraph (28i I), the Corporation will deduct from earnings subsequently due and payable the amount of any vacation payment made to an employee who does not have seniority as of the next eligibility date, or who receives state or federal benefits a result of unemployment during the Vacation Period, or who receives any payment in excess of the employee’s eligibility. Recovery of such overpayments may be made from any future payments payable under any term of this agreement or any Supplemental Agreement thereto.

GM-IUE Conference Board 103 West Market Street Suite 105

Dear Mr. Nichols: .	’
It is the policy of the General Motors Corporation_to wilil UE» titre n’employ provided it has the labor, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits.. At times the Corporation does not deem ' advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or Jet the work to outside contractors. This letter is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.	'
The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees to perform maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past.
In this regard, we have seen the use of joint Management and Union work schedule and business opportunity teams work very successfully in many of our
119

locations. This approach has not only enhanced job security, but has allowed a better understanding as to the competitive challenges lacing the parties. As such, each location is encouraged to establish a skilled trades subcontracting planning team involving both Management and Union representation who will review forecasted work schedules, including projects and jobs which may be subject to subcontracting, in order to develop the most efficient approach to the work to be performed. Plants whg.hav.e_experienced success with this approach have found that meetings scheduled weekly, if necessary, were most beneficial, and therefore such meetings should be scheduled accordingly at each plant.
The Corporation is genuinely interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation. Therefore, in malting	’ '
these determinations, the Corporation intends always to keep the interests of General Motors personnel in mind.
Very truly yours.

Attention: Mr. Ronnie ]. Gilvin Chairman GM-IUE Conference Board
Gentlemen:
During the current, noaoi'a’?'-^;; Union discussed •’dtl; iho Corporation serious problems affecting the job security of employees resulting from contracting out of work.
During the course of negotiations, the Union complained that in certain instances the work force in maintenance and tool and die trades particularly was reduced through attrition and then work was contracted out to the point where there was insufficient labor available within the plant to perform the work: that in certain instances Upgraders were reduced to production jobs and work in their trades which they historically performed and which they were capable of performing -was subsequently contracted out for extended periods without recalling the Upgraders to the skilled trades jobs from which they had been reduced;' and that in certain instances skilled trades employees were permanently laid off and new work which they had historically performed was contracted out for extended periods, instead of recalling these employees to their jobs,
121

Appendix B	.	,
Job Security — Corrtractitis Out of Work '	■
The essential elements in the complaints registered by the Union went to the question of Job security.
During the 1996 National Negotiations, the parties reviewed the competitive advantage of General Motors talented skilled trades workforce. Discussed were the. Union's concerns far the integrity of the apprenticeable trades, the Job security of the skilled trades workforce, the content of skilled trades work assignments, and the status of work functions historically performed by the bargaining unit.
At times if is not practicable for the Corporation to do the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve the right to decide whether it will do particular maintenance, tool and die and engineering skilled trades work, ar cantract it out. The Union recognizes that in making such decisions the Corporation must consider, among other things, the efficiencies and economies involved, the need for specialised tools and equipment, special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model change and plant rearrangement deadlines.
In our discussions we agreed that employees' jobs should not be eliminated by reason of a practice of contracting out, and we agreed that existing employment opportunities of seniority employees should not be unnecessarily reduced by reason of management contracting out work. The Corporation, moreover, states that it is its policy to fully utilize its seniority employees, under circumstances in which it is reasonable and practicable to do so, in the performance of work which they have historically performed to produce its product and perform its services.
While GM intends to provide this opportunity to its ; skilled trades workforce, the parties agreed that prolonged schedules involving substantial overtime were not in the best interest of employees or the
122
Job security— contracting Out of Work
Corporation and, as a result, GM must consider the availability of its skilled workforce when scheduling potential overtime. The parties are expected to work out acceptable means by which Management will have reliable information as to the hours employees will work when planning such work schedules.
Accordingly, the Corporation states that it will make a reasonable effort to avoid contracting out work which adversely affects the job security of its employees and that it will utilize various training programs available to it, whenever practicable, to maintain employment opportunities for its employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation.
Very truly yours.

Accordingly, the parties have agreed to this JOBS Program, and have pledged to work together, consistent with this Program and other provisions of the National Agreement to enhance the Corporation’s competitive position.- ■
The cornerstone of the JOBS Program is a commitment1 to .^-determined Secured Employment Levels iSEL's). a senes~Mr ..Bcncjmiark Minimums, and protection against indefirwekty^ff-foreligible employees as expressly provided herein, "	.
L SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM - The Cotpora-rion and the Union agree that:	‘
(A) The secured employment levels (SEL’s) (i,e„ numbers of eligible “covered” employees or positions'covered by this program as defined herein) initially shall be established as of the effective date of the Agreement at each bargaining unit for skilled and nonskilled employees. The transfer of an employee between skilled and non-skilled will cause the SEL for the group receiving Ute ' employee to increase and the other group from which movement occurred to decrease
127
Appendix D	'■
Job Security
. unless the movement occurred to satisfy the SEL, in which case the SEL will remain the same in each group.
SEL Groups are set forth in Attachment C The SEL’s for each Group will equal the sum of
’ their respectiye.Unil.SELs.
-	(B) The initial Secured Employment Levels for
each shall be equal to the sum of; 11) the number of active “covered" employees with ' one or more years of seniority at work or on ‘ roll in the Unit on the Effective Date: (21 the ■ number of active employees with less than ' one year of.seniority occupying SEL slots in the Unit .on. the Effective Date; and (3) the . , number of. unfilled new hire obligations in the Unit as of .theEffeclive Date due.fo.lhe

4)	on any leave of absence of 90 days duration or less,
S)	on temporary layoff, and
.	6) any other employee having a direct at-

minimums as of the close of each calendar quarter beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 1999 through the quarter ending June 30. 2003. Each Quarterly Benchmark shall be determined bv subtracting from the immediately preceding SEL Benchmark an_amount_equal to ,333% of the Unit’s Initial SEL. so that the June 30. 2003 Benchmark shall equal 95% of the initial SEL. df this calculation resultsin something other than a whole number, sequential rounding adjustments may be made to even out the calculations over the term of the Agreement.)	’
(D)	No employee will be laid off for any reason, other than described in 1(E), if such layoff would cause the number of active employees in the unit to fall below the then current SEL

5)	model change or plant rearrangement until the employee otherwise would have been recalled.
An employee impacted by any of the ' above reasons is, if otherwise eligible, covered by the appropriate Supplemental Agree' ments which are attached to the National
Agreement as Exhibits. ■
■	(F) The number of employees protected by this
■ JOBS Program will be the equivalent of the employees within the SEL who would otherwise have been laid-off as a result of any event’other than those described in Paragraph 1(E).
IL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SEL AND SEL ELIGIBILITY - Following the initial determination of the SEL. it will be adjusted as follows:
.(A) An employee shall become SEL-eligible for any of the following reasons at which point
. the SEL will be increased by one position ■ for each such employee: (1) an employee in the active workforce, as defined by Para-
‘ graph 1(B) who had less than one year seniority on the Effective Date of the Agreement who subsequently attains one year of seniority: (2) an employee with one of more years seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SEL. and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week • period ending after the effective date of the Agreement: 13) an employee with less than

(Bi The SEL will be reduced for the attrition of eligible employees who quit, retire, or die.
(£} The Group SELs established pursuant to Section HA) will continue to equal the sum of their respective Unit SELs and will be adjusted in accordance with'the addition or-deletion of Units to the extent such transactions affect the sum of the respective Unit SELs.
OH Unit SELs will be adjusted inlhe event of transfers of operations or consolidations between Units. The Unit SEL will be decreased _ by one at the transferring location and increased by one at the receiving location by the corresponding number of jobs involved in the transaction, unless otherwise agreed

{Ei Each .employee, who leaves, the .bargaining . unit for a permanent salaried position will . be replaced immediately with no effect on the SEL by recalling an employee from layoff or from the Area Hire List, or by Jiiring' a new employee if no such laid off employee is available. For each regular salaried em-

It is an objective of the Corporation to grow the business and to continue to rely upon its employees and facilities as the source of its products. During the life of the current Agreement, the Corporation will advise the Chairman of the GM-IUE .

Such criteria shall give equal weight to the full impact of a sourcing action on General Motors-IUE represented employment levels and the job and income security of General Motors-IUE represented employees. The National parties;will jointly further develop the above criteria to be used to address sourcing issues. In developing this criteria transfer pricing profits will not be considered in making sourcing decisions. Only appropriate return on investment and burden will be considered. The International Union and where appropriate the Local Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information, that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and contemplated sourcing. The Union agrees to keep all such information confidential until the Corporation consents to its release. Further, in this regard, the plant Chairperson will designate in writing those Union representatives who will have access to the quote package and related information.
If the Local Committee cannot resolve aisourcing issue, it may file a grievance at the appeal step of the grievance procedure. In addition, the following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of IUE members:
1.	Insourcing ,
The Local JOBS Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Committee identifies as that which might be performed competitively within the location based on the criteria outlined above. To assist in.this process, upon request the International Union will be furnished a complete master file of commodities which will be used to generate a list of parts similar to those currently manufac-

Thereafter, the parties will initiate efforts to insource particular work consistent with the aforementioned criteria to create prospects for growth and to provide jobs for Protected employees and employees on layoff. - *	. .	.
If it is established that certain work can be performed competitively judged by the above criteria, management will adopt the Committee’s proposal and barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work ’ in-house.

Following receipt of the request for quotation package1 (or in the infrequent instances where a quote package is not utilized), the local parties will have the opportunity to jointly develop a plan tv perform Ute work competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix, The local Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and the potential sourcing action. Prior to submission of the initial quote response, the information contained therein will be reviewed by the local parties..	'	.
At the close of the quoting process, the local parties will be advised in writing of the most favorable quote response which best meets customer requirements and the terms and conditions contained therein. If this quote response is other than the one submitted by the, , affected location(s), a.written notice will be issued to
the Chairperson which includes the reason for. the potential outsourcing, the quote price from the affected location, if applicable, the terms and conditions of the most favorable quote response, rthe potential jobs impact, and the anticipated impact date.

The parties are committed to the continuous improvement of employee health and safety. The joint process developed between the parlies has positively impacted this commitment. In order to place further emphasis on the implementation of the joint process and to enhance communication and resolution of health and safety issues throughout the respective di visions/groups, each operating organisation will implement a Health and Safety Review Board. Each Board will consist of the Divisional Manufacturing Manager, a designated IDE administrative representative and appropriate support personnel (or other similar arrangement approved
198
Doc. No. 3
HEALTH AND SAFETY — SUBJECTS
by the National Joint Committee). Each board shall meet on a regular basis and consider appropriate health and safety matters within the respective
; division. To further enhance joint efforts to achieve a healthy and injury-free workplace, the parties agree to establish Plant Safety Review Boards. The Plant Safety Review Board'will be co-chaired by the
; Plant Manager and Shop Chairperson and the . membership shall consist of the Local Shop Committee and members of the Plant Manager's staff. The Plant Safety ReviewBoard will meet monthly to review the unit's health and safety performance □nd monitor implementation of its health and ■ safety programs. The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee will attend all Plant Safety Review Board meetings. In addition, the Divisional Review Board and the Plant Safety Review Board may request the National Joint Committee to consider projects, studies, training, and other such matters
that pertain to em plovee .herrirh. ™ J;	’
me National Joint Committee may seek advice from and may consider for implementation the health and safety needs expressed by .the Divisional Review Board and the Plant Safety Review Board, including for example, special funding requests, 1 projects, studies, training and other employee health and safety matters,,	■
The parties are committed to preventing fatalities . and serious injuries. In furtherance of this interest, a Special Health and Safety "Review Board" meeting will be convened at such time as appropriate upon the request of the National Joint Health and Safety Committee. The Special Review Board will consist of members of the National Joint Health and Safety Committee, the Local Chairperson, the Plant Manager and the Plant Manager's superior for the affected unit. The Local Joint Health and Safety Committee, and/or other officials or resources, as,
199
Ooe. No. 3
HEALTH AND SAFETY — SUBJECTS
deemed appropriate by the National Joint Health
' and Safety Committee, may be invited to attend as . observers. The Special Review Board will meet at a site designated by the National Joint Health and Safety Committee. The National Joint Health and'. Safety Committee will provide technical support for\ . the Special Review Board's efforts. The Special Review Board will normally convene one week alter notification by the National Joint Health and Safety Committee, and issue its recommendations within j
. two weeks after concluding its review.	I
The purpose of the Special Review Board will be to. fit recommend improvements in Safety and Health	i ' ?
practices. The primary tool to accomplish this objec- y . live will be a complete.safety hazard analysis of the
job or operation at issue. This analysis will be conducted by a Joint team from the JUE-GM Joint	■
Activities Center specially trained in analytical techniques. An action plan will be developed by the , Special Review Board for the Group or Division involved. Senior Operating Management will assess the .implementation and progress of the action plan after an appropriate lapse of time as established by the Special Review Board.	'
D.	No Hands in Dies Policy	|
The Corporate policy has been and continues to be 'No Hands in Dies'. Implementation of 'No Hands In ■ Dies' in the plant requires provision for expendable band feeding tools, slide feeds, sliding bolsters, .automatic or semi-automatic operation, die cutouts or other means and procedures whereby the operators are not requited to place their hands into the point of operation. In addition, well disciplined . procedures for use of die blocks and safety lock-outs ‘ and tags for maintenance and setup personnel are imperative. An intensive orientation program for

operating supervisors, and process and facilities engineers may also be advisable.
E.	Lockout Policy
During the current negotiations the IUE and General Motors discussed their mutual concern regarding fatalities and serious injuries to employees, includ-' big operators, performing repair, service and maintenance activities on machinery and equipment. The parties agreed that, to be effective, the Lockout -Energy Control program must be universally hnple-mented and enforced throughout the Corporation. In order, to be effective, the parties reaffirmed that the elimination of the potential for injury from hazardous energy is critical to worker safety.
it is	Motors .and endorsed by
the IUE that:	- ’
Lockout is required where employees may be exposed to hazardous energy which could cause injury. Exposure means that the employee is in a position to be injured by released energy.
Where an employee is exposed to potential injury from expected machine energyfmotion, the exposure must be eliminated. If the exposure cannot be eliminated, the machine will be locked out.
Each location Will maintain an effective Lockout -Energy Control program including the IUE-GM Lockout Placard Guidelines which will apply to all employees based on implementation guidelines which have-been published by the IUE-GM Joint Activities Center.

E Training •
General Motors agrees to provide joint health and safety training to enhance employees skills and abilities to perform their jab in a safe manner. The National Joint Committee will be responsible for ■ identifying employee job-related health and safety \ education and training needs which are mandated by the Government or would be applicable across IUE-GM sites.
The National Joint Committee through the IUE-GM Joint Activities Center will continue to provide training resources for use by the plants. The National Joint Committee will direct and oversee the development and administration of required training courses and will monitor and evaluate training programs. The parties agree to utilize Joint Training Funds to partially subsidize the cost of joint health and safety training efforts. -
It is recognized by the National Joint Committee that the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee should be involved in identification of what Health and Safety Training is needed and appropriate for their particular location including Monthly Safety Talks. A local training needs analysis will be conducted at each location.

When an employee brings to Management's attention a situation where the employee is reasonably concerned that his or her safety is jeopardized because of working alone. Management will provide a copy of an applicable written Safe Operating Practice to the employee detailing precautions to take'to perform the task safely. If one has not been developed and reviewed. Management will give the employee job instructions to perform the task safely and within 24 hours make a written request to the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee for the development of a Safe Operating Practice. Safe Operating Practices will be developed by the Local Joint Health and Safety Committee within 5 working days and will be reviewed by the Plant Safety Review Board at the next regularly’scheduled meeting.

Dear Mr, Nichols:	■
Subject: JOBS Program - Volume Related Layoffs ~ SEL
During the course of these negotiations, the Corporation and Union have provided General Motors employees with substantially increased job security through the new SEL feature of the JOBS Program, which protects Jcaaainst.layoff for virtually any reason except volume related market cdndiuons~7Iw parties recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry.’ The Corporation acknowledges, however, the importance of minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume related declines are unavoidable.
In any event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in line with local seniority agreements and, if otherwise . eligible, receive benefit treatment in accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the current GM/IUE Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Identifying the complex inter-relationships of all the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a difficult task. The parties agreed, however, that for purposes of determining SEL related protections they must identify just those volume declines that are attributable to
217
Doc.' No. 4
JOBS PROGRAM ~ VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS - SEL
market related conditions, and in turn just those declines that are not affected by Corporation sourcing choices of vehicles and components that compete with or act as replacements for vehicles and components produced by General Motors employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement. In other words, . volume declines that are attributable to the .	' ’
Corporation's production and purchase arrangements -with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, captives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.) would be considered an exception to the overall volume related exclusion in Section 1(D) of the JOBS Program.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that the Corporation provide Local JOBS Committees adequate notice of any impending volume-related layoff, as well as all information necessary to fully evaluate its underlying causes, the extent to which such decline is associated with a Corporate sourcing action and the appropriate number of SEL eligible employees that should be affected by the layoff.
The Corporation recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context of the protections spelled out in the JOBS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Corporation also accepts the responsibility of proving that the proper number of employees are recalled to SEL positions when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the JOBS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.
The following are tu be considered as illustrations to assist the parties in determining when volume related declines support reductions in employment. These illustrations should not be considered al) inclusive. ..
• Market Belated Conditions — Included in this category is customer preference of one vehicle over another that might result in a decline in
218
Doc. No. 4
JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS - SEL
sales of a U.S.-built General Motors vehicle that requires the layoff of employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of increased sales or increased market share of ■ competitive captive imports or joint venture vehicles or any other vehicle sold in the U.S. by General Motors but not produced in an JUE-Generai Motors plant.
— Example of Market Related Conditions
(1) There is a decline in economic activity which depresses retail sales of lUE-General Motors vehicles. Lower production levels require the layoff ot employees. Assembly Plant A, employing 4,100 SEL-eligible employees, is the sole source of Vehicle Z for the U.S. market; it is .
' required to layoff one shift, ar 2,000 employees.
‘ The plant's number of SEL-eligible employees at the plant remains at 4.100, including 2.000 _ . — ■	iuTu-oh employees.
While the plant is down to one shift the Corporation decides to outsource the cushion room, which reduces employment require-merits by 250 employees per shift. Two hundred fifty (250) employees are placed an Protected employee status. There is no impact* ' on the SEL numbers. .
U.S. car demand picks up to pre-layoff levels . -and the second shift is called back. Active employment at the plant goes back to 4,100.
-As the second shift is called back and the plant is back to pre-downturn production levels! an additional 250 employees are placed on Protected employee status which - now leaves a total of 500 employees. The SEL plant number remains at 4,100.	-
219

JOBS PROGRAM — VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS — SEL
(2) Assembly Pl an tB (5,000 SEL-eligible employees) is not the sole, source ot Vehicle Y, which is also produced in Canada for the U.S. market, in Plant BC. Plant BC supplies one-fourth of the U.S. demand for Vehicle Y. An economic downturn in the U.S. reduces demand lor Vehicle Y by 160.0DD. In accordance with SEL guidelines, volume related employment reductions cannot exceed Plant B's share of pre-downtum volume levels (three-fourths) applied to the reduced level of overall sales. Production in Plant B is therefore reduced by no more than 120,000 units, causing
' layoffs of 2,000 workers. Plant B's number of SEL-eligible remains at 5,000, including 2,000 open - Bank positions.
Vehicle Y demand in the U.S. market picks up by 60,000. the Corporation decides to produce 30,000 of those units in Plant B and the rest in Canadian Plant BC. The increase in production is not
. accomplished in proportion to pro-layoff produc- 1 lion shares; to comply with SEE the Corporation must recall 250 employees which it assigns to Protected employee status in addition to the SOO employees required for the pick up in'production.
■ • Product Discontinuance — Because of the introduc-. tion of a new U.S.-built Genera] Motors vehicle or a non-allied company vehicle not sold by General Motors, sales of another General Motors-manufac-tured vehicle may decline, and production of the latter vehicle must be curtailed necessitating reductions in employment. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program. .	'

(I} A new U.S.-built General Motors vehicle (or any .other new non-allied company vehicle which is not marketed by the Corporation) is introduced.
. Sales of Vehicle X decline by 50%, and assembly must be curtailed. The necessary reductions in ; employment are made through layoffs, keeping the number of SEL-eligible employees at the assembly plant at the same level.	.
(2) Engine Plant C, employing 1,400 SEL-eligible . ' ■. people, produced half of the engines for Vehicle -X; the other half are produced at a Corporate 'plant in Mexico. The volume reduction is made totally at Plant C rather than split proportionately
‘ ' between Plant C and the plant in Mexico.
‘ Therefore, in accordance with the JOBS guidelines half of. the 700 employees who are not required any longer in Plant C due to this event__•
are assigned to.protect"* 'xplvyee stat&sfand ---'^;15Toiher 350 employees would be laid off. The number of SEL-eligible employees at Plant C remains at 1,400, including 350 open volume related positions.	' ’
• Faulty Product — Vehicle line volume may decline because of faulty parts in a vehicle that cause cus-tamers to place the product in disfavor. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) al the Program.
• Changes in Retail Preference — General Motors ' volume may decline because of customer preference shifts — in turn affecting mix and therefore demand, e.g., small car preference shifts to large car; option preference swings; high product content to low product content. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.

• Non-General Motors Commercial Customer Preference :— Cancellation or declines in product volume for General Motors Corporation mnnufacturedjparts

are established. .	.
At the time production is back to pre-layoff levels the Corporation introduces two robots which replace 25 employees. According to SEL guidelines all of the 15G employees .are recalled from
, layoff, 25 of .them are assigned to Protected, employee status, and the number.of SEL-eligible . employees number remains equal to its pre-layoff level. , , .	.
• Non-General Motors Produced Vehicles — If sales of a new or replacement vehicle manufactured by an allied company for General Motors, that competes with a vehicle manufactured by the Corporation, . results in reduced sales of the Corporation-manufactured vehicle, the action would not be volume re- -lated and layoffs under Paragraph 1(D) of the
’ Program would not be permitted,

• Engines. Transmissions, Stampings, and other Components or Materials' ■ "' •
It is recognized that reductions in vehicle production will often be accompanied'by reductions in component production. When reductions in vehicle production are volume related, pro-rata reductions in component production will normally be considered volume related as well. However, to the extent a reduction in component production results from a shift in - .sales to vehicles sold by General Motors but not produced in IUE-General Motors plants, the reduction will not be considered volume related. Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dual-____.
sourced from anIUEiGenOT"!-Mct-.'.irJiiua nori-IUE-

Dear Mr. Nichols: .	■	■	.
During these negotiations we have explored at length : methods to preserve and increase the job opportunities of our employees your members. Further, we have mutually recognized that the best potential for increased job opportunities is a growing and thriving Corporation fully competitive in all aspects of its business.	.	.
During the discussions and in response to your ,. concerns regarding the outsourcing of I(JE work, a new sourcing letter has been submitted providing a mechanism for meaningful advance Union involvement so that the'plant, division, group or Corporate sourcing authority may objectively consider the Union's input.
Program provides job security unmatched in American industry.~~	—
The major concern addressed by both the sourcing. ‘ letter and the JOBS program is the retention of IUE jabs within the Corporation. The entire issue of job security, however, is broader than the continuation by the Corporation of its current business activities. The ' JOBS Program recognizes that long range job security must include opportunities in our traditional and non-traditional businesses, providing jobs for our current . employees and future job entrants. The challenge to the parties is a serious one, requiring the full range of all of our talent, experience and imagination.. To enhance opportunities for employment

growth, the parties agree the Growth and Opportunity Committee will be continued during the term of the cunent Agreement. This Committee is charged with pursuing opportunities in traditional and non-traditional business areas with an overall view toward providing new jobs not currently'included in the scope oi General Motors operations. Each feature of the total business opportunity must be examined including 1) the market for the product to be produced, 21 expenditures that are required for equipment or tooling. 3} the cost oi any plant modernization or rearrangement, including additions to an existing facility,-4) the availability of -the necessary technology, 5) the lease or purchase of a new facility,- 6) characteristics al the business including materia], capital funds, and wage and benefit levels of other employers in the industry in which the new ' business will compete, 7) the nature of bargaining agreements needed to assure the new business is competitive, and 8> the expected return on investment relative to the standard in the industry in which the new venture would compete.
In analyzing the feasibility of entering into new business ventures the parties have agreed to call upon the full extent . of Corporate and Union resources./ As an indication of the seriousness of its caminitmetrt to employment growth through business divendfication into traditional and non-traditional areas, the Corporation will make available up to $5,295,000 of funding to provide for this program during the term oi the current Agreement However, should the Growth and Opportunity Committee recommend new business funding in excess of this amount, the Corporation agrees to review such requests in aocordanoe with the guidelines of this Document No. 6. These funds will be available for investment in new business ventures including, as' appropriate, the establishment of separate Corporate organizational structures.'

employees laid off from or working at Corporation facilities. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law. the Corporation or other employer will recognize the IUE as the representative of the hourly employees working at businesses developed through the Growth and Opportunity Committee for the purpose of collective bargaining. In this regard, the parties recognize the need to develop innovative approaches to labor relations and commit to negotiating new collective bargaining agreements for each venture.
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will report periodically to the appropriate General Motors Executives and International Union IUE on their progress in identifying and developing viable opportunities for employment growth.
The approach to job security and new business opportunity reflected in this agreement requires a relationship typified by trust and the mutual willingness to take risks in return for economic rewards and job opportunities. Our enthusiasm to search for new business must be shared by group, divisional and local managements and by regional and local union representatives.	-
The success of this joint activity will be measured based upon results. A high level of commitment will be required from all parties to enhance the potential for success. The commitment of a full-time effort to seek new employment opportunities should improve the overall effectiveness of the program.

GM's process for total quality management is the Quality Network. This jointly developed quality improvement process empba-sizes..custonier_enthp?igsm. continuous quality improvement. and the elimination of waste in the design. engineering, manufacturing and delivery of all products and services which serves to enhance job securityJor all employees.

During the current negotiations^ Genera!

Accordingly, tiie parties agree to continue the Individual Upward Educational Plan (IUEP). Under this Plan, qualified employees who wish to pursue a formal degree or to improve their job skills are able to receive a defined level of assistance in the form of up-front payments to specified licensed or accredited schools.
Additionally, the spouse or dependent children oi a deceased, active employee will be entitled to utilize the remaining balance of the employee's current year's Individual Upward Educational Plan Assistance eligibility excluding any advance payment for college or educational pursuits during a period’equal to the length of the present Agreement following the date of the employee’s death.
It shall be the responsibility of the National Joint Skill Development, and Training Committee to develop such a Plan along with guidelines that include, but are not limited to, such elements as initial and continuing eligibility, course degree and school approval, level of

assistance for qualified workers, and the application ' and approval process.
As specified in the IUEP Administrative Guidelines, the maximum total assistance per qualified active employee per calendar year is $4.200 for courses leading to a formal degree and $2,100 for job-related, high . school equivalency and literacy courses of which S1D0.D0 may be used for the purchase of books,
Employees enrolled in college degree programs through accredited institutions, who exhaust their current year IUEP assistance eligibility, may utilize up to $1,000 of the following year's eligibility to cover the present ar next semester eligible expenses. This advance payment is provided'only in conjunction with courses offered at regionally accredited colleges ar universities on d semester or quarterly basis and is not available far job related, high school equivalency and literacy courses. Advance payment of up to $1,000 will occur . automatically when the employee's request for IUEP assistance exceeds the cunent year eligibility.
Advance payment is not available in the last calendar year bi the Agreement, and does not expand total IUEP assistance eligibility over the life of the present Agreement, ,
The Plan will continue to be supported by joint training funds and will be jointly administered under the direction and control oi the National joint Skill Development and Training Committee.

lion. • They ore not familiar with basic contract ,provi- < sions covering.such subjects as transfers, promotions,.., ■ shift preference and seniority. ‘They may be unaware of the opportunities for advancement to highly paid ;;j . , skilled trades jabs through the Apprentice Upgrading and Trainee programs. They tend fa be unfamiliar with,' the obligations of the employee to his job. to the union and to his employer. Many are unaware of the , importance of regular attendance, quality workmanship and the need for cooperation by all in getting the job . done. Too often they are unacquainted with the various procedural matters related to their jobs and their relationship to their union and their employer.
New employees usually have little knowledge of the -long history of the IUE and of the administrative structure of the IUE at the International and local union levels. They do not understand about their relationship to the Union, about the initiation fees and dues ' requirements and their rights within the union contained in the IUE Constitution.
Frequently, they have never seen the inside of a manufacturing, plant before and are unfamiliar with the operations, the nature of the product and how it is used.
You have underscored these realistic considerations in our discussions. You have indicated that this may , explain fa some extent the high turnover and absenteeism being experienced in industry today among the - . new workforce. And you have suggested that a properly developed and conducted orientation procedure designed to create an "awareness of the dynamics of the labor-management relationship, and the years of long effort to build a community of interest in resolving labor-management problems through orderly procedures..." might serve the best interest of the employees, the IDE and General Motors.	,

’	ORIENTATION PROGRAM
Accordingly, pursuant to the Union's suggestion, the Corporation has, in cooperation with the International Union,‘developed a joint pilot orientation program to be presented to new job applicants prior to the time they ; start their jobs.'	"	■
I ■	,
[ The content of the Orientation program was developed t by the Corporation and .the International Union and I implemented on a pilot basis in Packard Electric
Division where significant numbers of new employees ' were being hired.’ This experience has formed the basis ' for the adoption and implementation of a program at all ; other plants where a sufficient-number of new employees are being hired to warrant such a program.	.
The Corporation and the International Union shall continue to determine how the various portions of the ‘ orientation prograrn'are implemented.- Some subjects -might most appropriately be_preeentad.hy
-	-T^ywaeuianve, some by a Union representative,
and others by both Management and Union-represen td-' fives-	- ■ r ;	-	-
The orientation program is not subject to the grievance - procedure and may be terminated at any plant by either the InternatiohaLUnion'or the'Cbrporatlon, in the' ' event that the program at that plant is not being carried on in a manner consistent with the purpose and intent of the program as established , by the national parties. The Joint orientation program will be limited to those t subjects agreed to by the Corporation and the International Union and the establishment of such a program will not limit any other communication by Management with its employees or by the Union with its members. •
The Corporation and the International Union will-commence development of an orientation program at all Genera] Motors plants where a sufficient number of employees are being hired to warrant such a program *

Alcoholism and drug dependency is recognized by . medical, public health authorities, General Motors and the IUE as a disease. These diseases can impair workers’ ability to function in their lives and on their jobs. Alcoholism and drag dependency as well as other personal problems contribute to increased absentee-. •_ -ism and tardiness and deterioration of job perfcuinance. This in turn disrupts work-tchcdutes” with consequent dissatisfactipr.-umongthe majority of workers who src- 'sincerely trying to do conscientious jobs. The . combination of factors is recognized as having a po-.
. tentially damaging effect on plant efficiency and endangers the job security of the worker. .	■
The causes of personal problems including aleohol-. ism, drug dependency and mental health are not well understood and cures are difficult. Nonetheless, General Motors and the IUE believe that constructive -measures are possible to deal with these problems which can be a major cause of family breakdown and are related to personal breakdown and violence in the community.
General Motors and the International Union agree that the GM-IUE Employee Assistance Program should be used to provide all EAP services for all IUE represented employees.

I.	Objective
The objectives of this joint effort are to heJp employees and their family members develop healthier life styles and enhance the effectiveness of the workforce. Further the purpose of this program is designed to help prevent the development of personal problems and provide access for treatment and after care for those already affected. .
General Motors and the International .Union acknowledge that neither local management nor the local union working alone can always provide the level of motivation required by employees experiencing personal problems. As a result, joint efforts are imperative in encouraging the employee to seek EAP services, as needed, to respond successfully to treatment, and to maintain a resolve to avoid further personal problems. ■ ’	.
II.	Guidelines for Administration
General Motors and the International Union will engage in a cooperative, effort and function administratively in consulting with and seeking the cooperation of local management and local union'personnel: In this regard it is important to: ■ n -	,
1.	Generate a climate at the plant level which will eliminate the effects of the social stigma associated with mental disorders, alcoholism and drug dependency and other personal problems, which act as a barrier to employees seeking help to resolve personal problems;
2.	Insist that local management and the local union at all levels exercise their best efforts toward the objective of earlier identification and motivation of lhe= employee to accept EAP services;	.

Dear Mr. Nicholas
During the current negotiations, General Motors and the International Union again discussed at length problems .encountered in the administration of Grievance Procedure al some locations. The parties reaffirmed their mutual determination that the purpose of the Agreement as stated in Paragraph (1) is "to provide . orderly collective bargaining relations between the Corporation and the Union, to secure a prompt and equiidbhs disposition of grievances." In addition, the • Union and the Corpoi'Gticr/rareed that the delaying or holding of grievances at any step at liii'Cr “vance Procedure was contrary to the best interests of the * employees and the parties. In this regard the parties emphasized that full implementation d this document would result in the timely processing of continuing liability cases.	■	'	■
The parties reaffirmed their mutual desire and intention to assure that grievances will not be allowed to accumulate at any step or steps in the Grievance Procedure in any plant.
The Corporation asserted that the provisions of the Grievance Procedure if closely administered make it impossible for committeepersons unilaterally to stall any grievance from consideration or decision at the next step of the Grievance Procedure and to delay the

processing of grievances in the procedure. The Corporation staled further that the current language provides Management with the right after a lapse of a reasonable time to initiate answers to grievances in order to prevent them from being delayed, at any step in the Grievance Procedure. ‘	,
Following the conclusion of negotiations, the Chairman of the Conference Board and a representative of the Corporation will conduct an audit of the administration of the Grievance Procedure at each GM-IUE location and discuss their findings and may recommend improvements to the local parties.	’	'

pointed out to the Corporation that grievances accumulate under the circumstances complained of in some instances because the Local Managements take no independent action to answer grievances or to move them from one step of the procedure to the next.
"The International Union advised the Corporation that. it fully subscribes to the principle set forth in Paragraph (181 that ’...the prompt adjustment of grievances is desirable in the interest of sound relations between the employees and the Management.' '
"Grievances should not be unduly delayed at any step of the procedure, whether such delay is occasioned by a committeeman or his supervisor refusing or failing to meet his responsibility."

The following is the text of General Motors written and published policy regarding sexual harassment.
"General Motors has had far many years a written and widely distributed policy on equal opportunity, employment. Sexual harassment, as in the case of harassment based on age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation has long been regarded as a violation of this policy.
"All employees are expected to deal fairly and honestly with one another to ensure a work environment free of intimidation and harassment. Abuse of the dignity of anyone, through ethnic, racist or sexist slurs or through other derogatory or objectionable conduct is offensive employee behavior. Sexual harassment also includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. '
"All GM employees are entitled to a work environment in which words and actions do not have even the appearance ot disrespect. Sexually-oriented

jokes, cartoons, pictures, language, certain gestures and touching may be offensive to people and, therefore, may result in a hostile work environment. This type of conduct will not be tolerated in the workplace. General Motors facilities must be free of hostility resulting from sexually-oriented behavior. It is the responsibility of management and each employee to maintain an environment free of hostility.	■	. - - '

Dear Mr. Nichols:	'
During the current negotiations the IUE complained that procedures set forth in Paragraph (86d) are not being satisfactorily implemented by Management in many instances.
This letter is intended to clarify the intent and purpose of this provision:	1	■
1.	The "advance discussion" except where time and circumstances prevent it, will take place "prior to letting the contract for the performance of maintenance and construction work," before any decision has been made as to whether the work ' should be contracted out. The "advance discussion" will include information as*to “why Management is contemplating contracting out the work." It is evident that except as noted above, since Management is only "contemplating contracting out the work" when the “advance discussion" takes place, Management should not have made any decisions concerning whether or not to contract out the work before such "advance . discussion" is held,
2.	Management will advise the local union of the "nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reason or reasons

' (equipment, manpower, etc.), why Management in contemplating contracting out the work." This information is related to the letter dated December 19, 1967, to the International Union signed by Mr. Louis G. Seaton. That letter makes reference to "manpower skills, equipment and lacilities"
. and also as to whether the Corporation "can do ' - . the work competitively in quality, cost arid ■ performance and within’the projected time limits.” Since any or all of these conditions may be entailed in the determination as to whether a ' , ■ particular contract should be let out or not, it is necessary that Management advise the local union in the "advance discussion" concerning the item or items which are relevant to the decision making.	.
_3. If in the.'advanw ^w.isicn" " iliUl * Management is only "contemplating contracting . out the work" and if in addition all the pertinent information as noted above is supplied to the. local union, then local union representatives will be given a better opportunity "to comment on Management's plans" and will also give an opportunity to Management "to give appropriate,, weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances."	.
4. These advance discussions will include appropriate Management representatives of the Plant Engineering and/or Maintenance activities '	■
knowledgeable of the issues. '	’
In addition the Union complained that in certain instances plant Management contracted for extended warranty arrangements ar service contracts were being purchased which impacted the joh security of seniority employees in skilled trades classifications. Management stated that, while Paragraph 86(b) covers the
293
Doc. No. 30
" SUBCONTRACTING - IMPLEMENTATION PARAGRAPH («<»
"fulfillment of normal warranty obligations by the vendor", warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided or the obtaining of service contracts are not covered by these provisions. Rather, such arrangements or service contracts covering work normally and historically'performed by represented skilled trades employees are to be considered'in the ' same manner as contracts tor the performance of maintenance work and such decisions are covered by the provisions of Paragraph 86(c) of the National Agreement. The local plant Managements will be advised, accordingly.	'

This will confirm the understanding reached during-the cunent negotiations that within a reasonable period after o laid off apprentice or upgrader has been
~ . - recalled .to. work, at any General Motors plant such employee willbe paia7turi«CS7it;~c b<”?"E >n recognition of satisfactory completion of any related training courses, required pursuant to the GM-IUE Standard Apprentice Plan or Paragraph (79Xa), in which the employee was enrolled at the time of layoff.
In addition, .with prior Management approval and arrangements with the school, apprentices whom Management anticipates recalling to the apprentice classification prior to the expiration oi the school term may be enrolled for one term and become eligible for an incentive bonus on the same basis.
This incentive bonus will amount to a figure to be ■ arrived at by multiplying the number o! class hours in each course times the employee's straight time hourly rate less the amount, if any, paid to the employee far such related training prior to layoff.

Dear Mr. Nichols:
During the current negotiations, the Union stated that at some plants local unions had experienced a problem with application of Paragtaph (55} of the National Agreement. This problem concerned situations where Shop Committees did not have timely advance discussion of changes in established shift hours and lunch periods.
The Corporation stated that local managements have been advised as to the scope and meaning of this paragraph in the National Agreement. In addition to the need for timely advance discussion of changes in established shift hours or lunch periods, the Corporation stated that it is important to recognize that such-advance discussion will necessarily be based upon the facts of the situation involved. In any event, however, Management should not unnecessarily delay such discussion where changes in the established shift hours or lunch periods are involved.
The International Union and the Corporation have also-discussed the provisions of Paragraph (55} which direct that such discussions of changes in established shift hours or lunch periods shall take place with the Shop Committee. The Corporation pointed out that in many locations the nature of the operation, the size of the

plant and the time factors involved often make advance discussions with the entire Shop Committee impractical.'As a matter of practice, many locations currently, have mutually agreeable practices which have satisfied the requirement lor advance discussion, but which have not involved the entire Shop Committee.
The International Union stated that, in applying ■ Paragraph (55) to such situations, the National Agreement would be satisfied if another mutually satisfactory arrangement is made locally to implement the advance discussion provision of Paragraph (SS) which does not include the entire Shop Committee.

Date:	November 13, 1999	■
Subject Overtime Policies	'
To:	All General Managers
' -	I
As part at the current negotiations General Motors informed the International Union, IUE that it was the Corporation's intention to republish Mr. Edward N. Cole's letter of November 20, 1970 regarding Overtime Policies. The text of that letter is as follows:
"There was considerable discussion in the 1970 negotiations about the claims of the Internationa] Union, IUE that too many employes who are required ‘ to work overtime over extended periods are not excused from overtime work assignments even . though they have legitimate reasons to be excused.
"The Corporation pointed out that overtime serves a number of functions essential to the effective operation of General Motors tightly integrated and interdependent manufacturing system. In many instances overtime must be worked at one or more plants in order to permit other plants to meet their schedules. Emergency overtime to repair breakdowns in essential equipment is often necessary to prevent or minimize interruptions in plant operations and resultant short work weeks for many employes. Overtime is also necessary on bottleneck jobs and also during certain times of the year in order to meet model change deadlines and to satisfy fluctuations in customer demand for General Motors products.
320
Doc. No. 47
OVERTIME POLICIES

r_. r
i
"Both the International Union and the Corporation recognized that the nature ol the business requires overtime work assignments. In many instances, however, less than a full complement in a foreman's group is needed to man the jobs which are working overtime. When less than a full complement of employes is needed it is usually practicable for the foreman to excuse employes who do not wish to work and confine the overtime assignments to those employes who do wish to work. In situations where there are sufficient employes available who wish to work overtime and who are capable of doing the overtime work assignments, employes who do not wish to work overtime are to be excused from doing so, insofar as practicable.	'
"Employes who .are reran ne given as much advance notice as is practicable so that they can make any personal arrangements that may be necessary. ■
’’An individual employe's personal problems in connection with working overtime should be given careful consideration and his individual needs should be recognized. The individual employe's request to be excused from an overtime work assignment, when made a reasonable period oi time in advance, should receive every possible consideration. When the employe's request is granted he will be notified as far in advance as possible so that the employe can make his personal plans accordingly, Thereafter, any cancellation or change in the arrangements to excuse the employe will only be made with his consent.
■ ■
"Except in situations of an emergency or crisis nature, an employe who is not assigned to a necessary continuous seven-day operation and who has worked thirteen consecutive calendar days will be

"ine’Uriibn cited instances where certain employees . have been unable to obtain time-off when such request has been made in advance of the requested day. The Union also stated that other employees have not been '
, excused when the individual circumstances have not permitted an advance request.	.
the Corporation assured the Union that an individual employee's needs will be given every possible consideration when determining if an advance request can be accommodated.

STATEMENT ON TECHNOLOGICAL .	PROGRESS
The parties have recognized that continuing improve' ment in the standard of living of the employees covered by the National Agreement depends upon technological progress, better tools, methods, processes and equipment as well as a cooperative attitude on the part of all parties in such progress.
The Corporation is mindful of the Union’s concern regarding the scope and work content of the job classifications of employees in the IUE bargaining unit , and how such may be affected by advancing technology-	.
Accordingly, the GM-1UE Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee will meet periodically to discuss the, development of new technology at the Corporation level and its impact upon the scope'of the bar- _ gaining unit.
It is not the Corporation’s policy to assign to nonrepresented employees work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at a particular plant location. The Corporation recognizes that mere novelty or the sophistication of new technology alone is not grounds for withdrawing work from represented employees. Similarly, the Corporation does not believe that the perimeters of the bargaining unit at a particular plant location should be expanded simply by the introduction of new technology.	-
. It is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of

performing a work function including the introduction of computers, energy management systems, modem, art to part, tool cutting paths, broad band communication systems and fiber optics. CAM, CMM. CAE, 3D visualization or other new or advanced technology will not serve to shift the work function from represented to non-represented employees. Therefore:
1.	Where a work function at a plant location preceded the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was assigned at the time of certification, unless there has been written agreement otherwise.
2.	Where a work function was introduced at a plant location following the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was originally assigned, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.	■
The Corporation and the International Union are in agreement that the assignment of represented or nonrepresented employees depends upon the“ work function involved and not necessarily upon the work tasks required to accomplish such work function. ■
In view of the Corporation’s interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology, the Corporation shall make available, as far in advance of the Technology introduction to the plant as practical, short-range, specialized training programs for those employees who have the qualifications to perform the new or changed work, where such programs are reasonable and practicable. Therefore, in the event the work performed by employees covered by the National Agreement is altered as the result of technological changes so that addi

tional short-range training may be required, the Corporation is willing to train such employees where practicable to enable them to perform such work,
, Where, as the result of the initial introduction of new or advanced technology, it is anticipated that an impact upon the scope of the unit of Union represented employees may occur, the Local Management will discuss the matter with the .Chairperson of the Shop Committee. Such discussion will take place as ”	- far in advance of implementation of such a techno-
logical change as is practicable in order to provide the ■ Local Union with timely input into the particular ap-

Comments by the Chairperson of the Shoo Commitriy-^—— --------iCc.icomiag'uic'iuiarrnauoh provided will be carefully
evaluated by the Local Management in accordance with the Corporation’s policy relative to the assignment of work which comes within the scope and content of thatnormally assigned to represented employees at the plant location.

Chairperson of the Union Members of the Local Ap-■ prentice Committee, as necessary, in order to review the various matters of concern relative to the introduction of the new technology involved.

Dear Mr. Nichols:
During the 1990 negotiations, the Union expressed concerns relative to the assignment of work at certain locations by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which the Union felt should have been assigned to the respective IUE bargaining unit. In this regard, the Corporation agreed to reissue the B. P. Crane. Jr. letter dated -February 20. 1986, the text of which fallows:
"General Motors and Electronic Data Systems entered . into a contractual agreement which defines,the business relationship between the two entities. Under the terms of this agreement, EDS has assumed world wide responsibility for the management, operation, provision and maintenance of computer and information processing services, communication services and health care administration activities for CM. It is also the intent of the parties that the GMUset Organisation continues to be the customer of EDS.	■
■	w	+ ■
"As such, it is of particular importance to bear in mind .that EDS, under the terms of this business agreement,J. remains separate and distinct. It becomes, in part, our responsibility to offer assistance in the successful operation of this relationship. Specifically, this relates to our acknowledging the fact that EDS is not a party to our National and Local agreements with the unions representing General Motors employees. EDS does ’

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS - EOS
recognize the historical nature of GM job functions and agrees-that those job functions associated with - ■manufacturing processes, which have been historically
I performed by GM hourly personnel, should continue to' । be performed by bargaining unit employees.'	' *
"We can relate this to a case in pointthe installation ■	and maintenance of the new voice communication	*
'	system. The role that EDS plays in this situation is the '
1 traditional role of the local telephone company. ' ‘
Structural preparation remains the responsibility of ' General Motors and is most often accomplished ' utilizing bargaining unit employees. The other job functions associated with this voice communication . system, inmost cases, are not functions historically ’ . performed by our bargaining unit and are, therefore, the responsibility of EDS. -	■	'
______ "Also, our understanding concerning bargaining unit . ’ wort does not'limit tne nuiiiimenv'Si’ wuumnj vmuJT'" tions by vendors.

This will describe the methods io be used by NAO Compensation in regard to withholding oi Federal . income tax from employee’s wages attributable to grievance awards, vacation pay and pay in lieu of . vacation from employee’s wages. . -	> - J
Grievance awards in excess of.$500.00, but involving ' periods less than one calendar year, will be treated as ,	'
supand, income tax withholding will be calculated using the Federai ~ mcome~tir. regarding supplemental earnings. .	, -
Likewise, pay in lieu oi vacation also will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will ' be withheld using the Federal Income tax regulations ,	-
regarding supplemental earnings.-
It should be noted that the tax withholding referenced	-
above only covers the Federal withholding amount. Ah ' amount lor FICA taxes and state or local income taxes, . where applicable, will be in addition to the amount withheld for Federal income tax.	'
Grievance awards which are less than $500.00 will be * aggregated with the regular payroll and the income tax r withholding will be calculated an the total amount.
357
Doc. No. 62
. FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING
If d grievance award is made for a period of more than one calendar year, the income tax withholding will be calculated as if the payment were lor a single annual period. Thus, in such situations, NAO Compensation will use the annual percentage table to calculate .the Income tax withholding for such awards. This method would be the same as considering the award as having been paid equally over the preceding 52 .weeks. .
For vacation payments made lor iime away from work, such payments will continue io be treated as a regular wage payment; i.e., income tax withholding will be calculated as if the vacation payment represented a regular weekly wage payment. ■	'
The above methods are dictated by Federal Income Tax Regulations. Therefore, any change or amendment to such Regulations will, of necessity, have to be reviewed for compliance with the above changes. .	'
Formal procedures to effect these changes are being communicated to NAO Compensation by separate letter, with instructions to make these changes as soon as practical.	- ■

Warren, Ohio 44481 Dear Mr. Nichols: .	,
During the current negotiations. General Motors and the International Union, IUE, discussed the problem of “seniority slippage" under Paragraph 130a) which inhibits bargaining unit employees from accepting assignments to fill supervisory positions. If was recognized that in many instances it would be of ■ . mutuglbgnefit to the parties for these employees to function irisucn put Illi;;; r-  -—_________
Accordingly, this letter serves to confirm the agreement reached between the National parties that:
1.	The transfer of any employee from a job classification in the bargaining unit to a supervisory position will result in the recall of a seniority employee from layoff status; if available, consistent with the provisions of the J.O.B.S. Program, and/or;
2.	The transfer of an employee from a supervisory position back to’the bargaining unit does not . result in the layoff of a seniority employee;
Paragraph (30a) of the National Agreement will be modified in the following manner:
(3	0a) Any employee who has been transferred from a supervisory position to a job classification in the

bargaining unit shall be credited with the seniority the employee had established prior to March.I. 1977, all time worked in the bargaining unit subsequent to March 1,1977, and all time worked in a supervisory position subsequent to the effective date of this agreement provided;	' .
(a) The employee previously worked on a job . classification in the bargaining unit. This shall also be applied to employees who were promoted prior to certification of the Union.
(b> The employee's employment with the Corporation has remained unbroken.
Such employee may be placed on the job to which seniority would entitle the employee under the local seniority agreement, beginning with the last previous job held in the bargaining unit; provided however, that if such last previously held job is no longer in exist' ence, the employee may be placed in accordance with Paragraph (30). In no event shall such employee be transferred to a bargaining unit job at a time when the employee has insufficient seniority to be so placed.
In order to assure accurate and timely administration of the conditions stated above in Paragraph (30a) of the 1934 GM-IUE National Agreement, the following procedures will be instituted;
1.	When any employee is transferred from the bargaining unit to a supervisory position, the Chairperson of the Local Union's Shop Committee will be given a letter specifying the employee's name and the name of the seniority employee who is recalled from layoff status.
2.	When such supervisory employee, specified above, is relumed to a job classification in the bargaining unit, the Chairperson of the Local

Dear Mr. Nichols:	'	• .
During the current negotiations the Union complained there has been inconsistent administration ol the "normal warranty" provisions oi Paragraph (86b) of the National Agreement. The Union indicated that plant managements insist on warranties beyond normal periods of time and that our skilled employees are not assigned to the new equipment or machinery until long after it has been in the plant. This does not provide the opportunity for our own skilled trades to leant how to ~ .keep such equipment operating effectively.
The Corporation informed the Union that good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that the equipment purchased by the Corporation performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract.
. The Corporation agreed to remind the Divisions that the training and expertise that will be required of our own skilled trades must also be kept in mind as an important business consideration. The transition from vendor , to our employees and the training and timing of the transition are important parts of that consideration. The parties agreed that many locations through cooperative efforts such as assigning appropriate respective IUE-GM skilled trades employees with

Dear Mr. Nichols:
During the current negotiations, the parlies discussed and noted that in many instances the early indicators of an employee suffering from medical and personal problems such as those associated with substance abuse, for example, are matuiested in disciplinary situations involving violations of the Shop Rules. In those initial stages it is generally the first line supervisor and the district committeeperson who are first exposed to the potential of such underlying causes behind employee behavioral problems.
Although the parties acknowledge Management's responsibility to maintain discipline and to invoke disciplinary measures where violations of the Shop Rules occur, it is also recognized that local management and union representatives at all levels are necessarily charged with the responsibility to exercise

Dear Mr. Nichols:	.
During these negotiations, the parties discussed at length the necessity for the Corporation to become competitive in all aspects of the business. Among the issues discussed was the existing Skilled Trades classification structure.
With regard to the Skilled Trades classification structure, the Union expressed concern over apprenticeable Skilled Trades classifications being consolidated. In this regard, the Corporation observed that it will not dictate consolidation oi apprenticeable Skilled -	: ■.	’
Trades classifications to'its plants.. The Corporation advised, however, that they intend to rely on the current and future apprenticeable Skilled Trades classifications as the basis for our Skilled classification structure moving forward. Competitive advantages oi a review ■ of Skilled Trades classifications at any GM-IUE facility must be weighed and determined by the local parties in view of all attendant circumstances at that location. Appropriate training plans necessary to accomplish any consolidation must be submitted in a timely manner for approval by the GM-IUE Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee.

With regard to work rules and past practices, the ‘ ■ Corporation stated that many plants feel hampered in ■ their efforts to enhance competitiveness in today’s . environment by historical practices which originated at I a time when competition was less threatening. There-

Lines of Demarcation between Skilled Trades classifications which allow for incidental, overlapping and other minor access-type work will be discussed and handled locally by mutual agreement consistent with sound business judgment.

- * ■
Consistent with these discussions and in response to current skilled trades demographics, potential future ■ retirements, and attrition, the Corporation has agreed to continue to place primary reliance on the GM-IUE ■ Apprentice Program as the-training source for future skilled trades employees.

of both future apprentice graduates and current •	.
journeypersons.	.	’
With regard to the utilization of the Apprentice Program, business conditions permitting, the objective ■ would be to indenture an aggregate of £3 apprentices Corporation-wide (at GM-IUE locations) in the ' ■ • apprenticeable trades. and_will maken good faith effort to.increase the aggregate in 36, These additional apprentices will be added during the 1999 National Agreement period-provided that qualified candidates can be found who meet all the selection criteria and ' affirmative action goals can be met. While the placement of apprentices will depend on a variety of business condition factors such as attrition, business sector performance, future product plans and product allocation, the general economy and sales and market trends. General Motors intends to pursue the abjective to place apprentices during each oi the next four (4) years. Requests for apprentices, the rate of placement, and forecasted requirements will continue to be •• reviewed by the National Parties:consistent with other . understandings regarding skilled trades job security. ■
It is understood that in cases where the above goals' cannot be met, or there is an immediate need for Joumeypersons skills at a particular location, it may be necessary to hire Joumeypersons in place oi the apprentices agreed upon in this letter. In that case, the Corporation will inform the International Union of the number of Joumeypersons hired and the reasons. Also, in these discussions the parties reviewed the need to give priority consideration to the placement of laid off GM-IUE skilled tradespersons (Joumeypersons, Upgraders, Apprentices) as well as those assigned to . Protected Status.
Furthermore, where changes in the type of operation, volume, product life cycle, or other reasons, have

Dear Mr. Nichols:	'
The parties to this agreement recognise the critical impact outsourcing proposals have on the parties' relationship at both the National and local level. In . this regard, when potential outsourcing is under i consideration, the local parties should have sufficient time to evaluate the proposal to insure that they have the opportunity to develop a plan to retain the work. During the discussions leading to the current Agreement, the sourcing process was modified to provide a more meaningful role for the Union in sourcing decisions through involvement in the request for. quotation process. Under this process, which provides for earlier involvement, the Union will generally have as much time to evaluate methods to retain the work as .the ISO day notification process provided under the 1993 National Agreement. In those instances where it is anticipated that less than 150 days will be required to complete the sourcing process, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee will be so advised.
