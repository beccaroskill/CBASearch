STANDARD FORM OF UNION AGREEMENT (As Modified)
Sheet Metal, Roofing, Ventilating and Air Conditioning Contracting Divisions of the Construction Industry.
This Agreement, entered into this 1st day of June, 2009, by and between the Akron, Canton, Mansfield Roofing and Sheet Metal Contractors’ Association, Inc., dba East Central Ohio SMACNA whether represented by a Contractors’ Association or not, hereinafter referred to as the “Employer”, and Local Union No. 33 - Akron District of Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association, hereinafter referred to as the “Union”, having jurisdiction over Ashland, Carroll, Coshocton, Crawford, Holmes, Medina, Portage, Richland, Stark, Summit, Tuscarawas, and Wayne Counties in Ohio.
ARTICLE I
Scope of Work
Section 1: This Agreement covers the rates of pay and conditions of employment of all employees of the Employer engaged in, but not limited to, the a) manufacture, fabrication, assembling, handling, erection, installation, dismantling, conditioning, adjustment, alteration, repairing and servicing of all ferrous or nonferrous metal work and all other materials used in lieu thereof and of all HVAC systems, air-veyor systems, exhaust systems, and air handling systems regardless of material used, including the setting of all equipment and all reinforcements in connection therewith; (b) all lagging over insulation and all duct-lining; (c) testing, servicing, and balancing of all air-handling equipment and duct work; (d) the preparation of all shop and field sketches, whether manually drawn or computer assisted, used in fabrication and erection, including those taken from original architectural and engineering drawings or sketches, and (e) metal roofing; and (f) all other work included in the jurisdiction claims of Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association.
Section 2: Market Preservation and Recovery: With the rise of non-union competition and infringements by other craft unions, sheet metal workers’ and signatory contractors in recent years have suffered significant declines in the share of the market of work within the jurisdiction of the Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association. It is the intent of all parties of this Agreement to take strong measures to reverse these trends and provide for the long term health of the union employing industry, by making it mandatory that the signatory contractor exhaust all efforts for the purchase of all distribution of air products, specifically, but not limited to, VAV boxes, fan (powered or not), make up of air units, fans, air distribution devises, grills and diffusers, and assign them completely to the sheet metal workers’ employed by him.
Section 3: The Employer also agrees to furnish within ten (10) days of request by the Union, completed forms as required by State and/or Federal Department of Labor for purposes of prevailing wage surveys by county. Occasional or out-of-town contractors shall complete and
submit to the Union, said forms immediately upon start of a job within the bounds of Local No. 33.
ARTICLE II
Sub-Contracting
Section 1:	No Employer shall subcontract or assign any of the work described herein which is to be performed at a job site to any contractor, subcontractor or other person or party who fails to agree, in writing, to comply with the conditions of employment contained herein including, without limitations, those relating to Union security, rates of pay and working conditions, hiring and other matters covered hereby for the duration of the project.
Section 2:	Subject to other applicable provisions of this Agreement, the Employer agrees that when sub-contracting for prefabrication of materials covered herein, such prefabrication shall be sub-contracted to fabricators who pay their employees engaged in such fabrication not less than the prevailing wage for comparable sheet metal fabrication, as established under the provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE III
Work to be Performed
Section 1: The Employer agrees that none but journeyman and apprentice sheet metal workers shall be employed on any work described in Article I. And, further, for the purpose of proving jurisdiction, agrees to provide the Union with written evidence of assignment on the Employer’s letterhead for certain specified items of work to be performed at a jobsite prior to commencement of work at the site. List of such specific items, which may be revised from time to time, as agreed to by and between SMACNA and SMWIA, shall be provided to the Employer.
ARTICLE IV

Section 1:	The Employer agrees to require membership in the Union, as a condition of continued employment of all employees performing any of the work specified in Article I of this Agreement, within eight (8) days following the beginning of such employment or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is later, provided the Employer has reasonable ground for believing that membership is available to such employees on the same terms and
conditions generally applicable to other members and that membership is not denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and initiation fee uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
Section 2:	If, during the term of this Agreement, the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 shall be amended by Congress, in such manner as to change the time within which an employee may be required to acquire Union membership, such changed time limit shall become immediately effective instead of and without regard to, the time limit specified in Section 1 of this Article.
Section 3:	The provisions of this Article shall be deemed to be of no force and effect in any state to the extent to which the making or enforcement of such provisions is contrary to law. In any state where the making and enforcement of such provisions is lawful only after compliance with certain conditions precedent, this Article shall be deemed to take effect as to involved employees immediately upon compliance with such conditions.
Section 4: The Employer agrees to deduct union dues, assessment or service fees (excluding fines and initiation fees) from each week’s pay of those employees who have authorized such deductions in writing, irrespective of whether they are union members. Not later than the twentieth (20th) day of each month, the Employer shall remit to the designated financial officer of the Union, the amount of deductions made for the prior month, together with a list of employees and their social security numbers for whom such deductions have been made.
Section 5: This Agreement has been entered into in order to comply with the National labor Relations Act of 1947, as amended. Should it be found that any clause herein is invalid by virtue of any decision of the Court or the National Labor Relations Board, either party to this Agreement shall have the right to reopen negotiations pertaining to such invalid clause by giving the other party thirty (30) days’ written notice, but such reopening shall be for the sole purpose of considering changes required or permitted by such decision.

Grievance Procedure
The Union and the Employer, whether party to this Agreement independently or as a member of a Multi-Employer bargaining unit, agree to utilize and be bound by this Article.
SECTION 1:	Grievances of the Employer or the Union, arising out of interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, shall be settled between the Employer directly involved and the duly authorized representative of the Union, if possible. Both parties may participate in conferences through representatives of their choice. The local Employers’ Association or the Local Union, on its own initiative, may submit grievances for determination by the Board as provided in this Section. The grievance procedure set forth in this Article applies only to Labor-Management disputes.
To be valid, grievances must be raised within thirty (30) calendar days following the occurrence giving rise to the grievance, or, if the occurrence was not ascertainable, within thirty (30) calendar days of the first knowledge of the facts giving rise to the grievance.
SECTION 2:	Grievances not settled as provided in Section 1 of this Article may be appealed by either party to the Local Joint Adjustment Board having jurisdiction over the parties and such Board shall meet promptly on a date mutually agreeable to the members of the Board, but in no case more than fourteen (14) calendar days following the request
for its services, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement of the parties or Local Joint Adjustment Board. The Board shall consist of an equal number of representatives of the Union and of the local Employers Association and both sides shall cast an equal number of votes at each meeting. Except in the case of a deadlock, a decision of a Local Joint Adjustment Board shall be final and binding.
Notice of appeal to the Local Joint Adjustment Board shall be given within thirty (30) calendar days after termination of the procedures prescribed in Section 1 of this Article, unless the time is extended by a mutual agreement of the parties.
(a)	Said Grievance shall be reduced to writing stating the date the event occurred, the specific contract articles violated, Union members involved, Employer involved, job site location and any details allowing the Local Joint Adjustment Board to research said grievance before the hearing.
(b)	The Union shall be required to notify any union member involved in said grievance of the date, time, and location of grievance hearing. The contractors association shall be required to notify the employer involved in said grievance of the date, time, and location of grievance hearing.
SECTION 3:	Grievances not disposed of under the procedure prescribed in Section 2 of this Article, because of a deadlock or failure of such Board to act, may be appealed jointly or by either party to a Panel, consisting of one (1) representative appointed by the Labor Co-Chairman of the National Joint Adjustment Board and one (1) representative appointed by Management Co-Chairman of the National Joint Adjustment Board. Appeals shall be mailed to the National Joint Adjustment Board.1 Notice of appeal to the Panel shall be given within thirty (30) calendar days after termination of the procedures prescribed in Section 2 of this Article.

Except in case of deadlock, the decision of the Panel shall be final and binding.
In establishing the grievance procedure of the Standard Form of Union Agreement, it was the intent of Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association and the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors’ National Association, Inc., to establish a method for resolving grievances permitting appeals for out of area Employers from the grievance arbitration procedures established for the territory in which work is performed. An Employer who was not a party to the Labor Agreement of the area in which the work in dispute is performed may appeal the decision of the Local Joint Adjustment Board from that area, including a unanimous decision, as well as a decision of any alternative arbitration tribunal established for that area, and request a Panel hearing as set forth in Section 3 of this Article, providing such appeal is approved by the Co-Chairman of the National Joint Adjustment Board. Such a right of appeal shall exist despite any contrary provision in the
1*All correspondence to the National Joint Adjustment Board shall be sent to the following address: National Joint Adjustment Board, P O Box 220956, Chantilly, VA 20153-0956, or 4201 LaFayette Center Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151-1209.
Agreement covering the area in which the work is performed.
For the purposes of this Section, an Employer who is party to the Labor Agreement of the area in which the work in dispute is performed, but has no permanent shop within the area served by the Local Joint Adjustment Board that rendered the unanimous decision, shall also be entitled to appeal a deadlocked or unanimous Local Joint Adjustment Board decision, and request a Panel hearing.
SECTION 4:	Grievances not settled as provided in Section 3 of this Article may be appealed jointly or by either party to the National Joint Adjustment Board. Submissions shall be made and decisions rendered under such procedures as may be prescribed by such Board. Appeals to the National Joint Adjustment Board shall be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days after termination of the procedures described in Section 3 of this Article. The Procedural Rules of the National Joint Adjustment Board are incorporated in this Agreement as though set out in their entirety. (Copies of the procedures may be obtained from the National Joint Adjustment Board).
SECTION 5:	A Local Joint Adjustment Board, Panel and National Joint Adjustment Board are empowered to render such decisions and grant such relief to either party as they deem necessary and proper, including awards of damages or other compensation.
SECTION 6: In the event of non-compliance within thirty (30) calendar days following the mailing of a decision of a Local Joint Adjustment Board, Panel or the National Joint Adjustment Board, a local party may enforce the award by any means, including proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction in accord with applicable state and federal law. If the party seeking to enforce the award prevails in litigation, such party shall be entitled to its costs and attorney’s fees in addition to such other relief as is directed by the courts. Any party that unsuccessfully challenges the validity of an award in a legal proceeding shall also be liable for the costs and attorney’s fees of the opposing parties in the legal proceedings.
SECTION 7: Failure to exercise the right to appeal at any step thereof within the time limit provided therefore shall void any right of appeal applicable to the facts and remedies of the grievances involved. There shall be no cessation of work by strike or lockout during the pendency of the procedures provided for in this Article. Except in case of deadlock, the decision of the National Joint Adjustment Board shall be final and binding.
ARTICLE XI
Apprentices
Section 1:	All duly qualified apprentices shall be under the supervision and control of a Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, composed an equal number of trustees, half of whom shall be selected by East Central Ohio SMACNA, and half by the Union. There shall be a minimum number of four (4) trustees. Said Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee shall formulate and make operative, such rules and regulations as they deem
necessary and which do not conflict with the specific terms of this Agreement to govern eligibility, registration, education, transfer, wages, hours and working conditions of duly qualified apprentices and the operation of an adequate apprentice system to meet the needs and requirements of the trade. Such rules and regulations when formulated and adopted by the parties hereto shall be recognized as part of this Agreement.
Section 2:	The Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee designated herein shall serve for the life of this Agreement, except that vacancies in said Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, caused by resignation or otherwise, may be filled by either party hereto and it is mutually agreed by both parties hereto that they will individually and collectively cooperate to the extent that duly qualified apprentices be given every opportunity to secure proper technical and practical education experience in the trade under the supervision of the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee.
Section 3:	It is the understanding of the parties to this Agreement that the funds contributed by signatory Employers to the International Training Institute and any Local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Fund (Local JATC), will not be used to train apprentices or journeymen who will be employed by Employers in the sheet metal industry not signatory to a collective bargaining agreement providing for contributions to the International Training Institute and a Local JATC. Therefore, the trustees of the International Training Institute and Local JATC shall adopt and implement a Scholarship Loan Agreement Program, which will require apprentices and journeymen employed by signatory Employers to repay the cost of training, either by service following training within the union sector of the industry or by actual repayment of the cost of training, if the individual goes to work for a non signatory Employer in the sheet metal industry. The cost of training shall include the reasonable value of all International Training Institute and Local JATC materials, facilities and personnel utilized in training. If a Local JATC does not implement the Scholarship Loan Agreement, the Local JATC shall be prohibited from utilizing International Training Institute materials and programs.
Section 4:	The ratio of apprentice to journeyman shall be as follows: For two (2) journeymen employed, one (1) apprentice. When four (4) journeymen are employed, two (2) apprentices. Thereafter, it is agreed that the Employer shall be entitled to apply to the Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee on the basis of one (1) apprentice for three (3) journeymen regularly employed throughout the year and said ratio shall govern the consideration and granting of apprentices by the Joint Apprenticeship Committee.
Section 4(a): Jobsite Apprentice Manning Table:
1 journeyman -- 1 apprentice 2 journeymen -- 1 apprentice 3 journeymen -- 2 apprentices 4 journeymen -- 2 apprentices 5 journeymen -- 3 apprentices 6 journeymen -- 3 apprentices 7 journeymen -- 3 apprentices

Maintaining a three (3) to one (1) apprentice ratio thereafter.
Section 5:	All applicants for apprenticeship shall serve an apprenticeship of five (5) years. Such apprentices shall not be put in charge of work on any job and shall work under the supervision of a journeyman.
This does not imply that the apprentice must always be in sight of a journeyman sheet metal worker. Journeymen are not required to constantly watch the apprentice. Supervision will not be of a nature that prevents the development of responsibility and initiative.
Work may be laid out by the Employers designated supervisor or journeyman based on their evaluation of the apprentices skills and ability to perform job tasks.
Apprentices shall be permitted to perform job tasks in order to develop job skills and trade competencies. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice.
Apprentices, who have satisfactorily completed the first four (4) years of related classroom training using the Sheet Metal Joint Apprenticeship Training curriculum and accumulated a minimum of 6,500 hours of OJT with satisfactory performance, shall be permitted to work alone on any job site.
Section 6:	In addition to the training received on the job, apprentices in the program agree to attend school on their own time at least one (1) night per week or during the daytime as directed by the Committee.

The time spent in school (minimum 160 hours per year) shall be a part of his apprenticeship and is to be attended in each of the five (5) years of his apprenticeship.
Section 7:	A graduated wage scale for apprentices shall be established and maintained on the following percentage basis of the established wage rate of journeymen sheet metal workers for:
First year:
45% of the journeyman taxable wage rate + health and welfare

50% of journeyman taxable wage rate + $0.50 local pension + applicable fringes
Third year:
55% of journeyman taxable wage rate + $0.50 local pension + applicable fringes

The Employer agrees that in the event the cost of benefits provided by the National Pension Fund shall be increased as a result of passage of federal or state legislation mandating changes in funding and/or vesting requirements, it will increase its contributions in an amount sufficient in the judgment of an actuary selection by the Trustees of the Pension Fund, to maintain at the current level and on a sound actuarial basis all benefits then being provided for present and prospective covered employees, said increase in contribution to commence on the first (1st) day of the month following the effective date of the aforementioned legislation.

(3)	If it is not legally permissible to reallocate the deferred or cutback portion, the Employer shall commence paying the wage and/or benefit rate that was deferred or cutback when and if it becomes legally permissible to do so.
(4)	It is acknowledged and agreed by the parties that upon the making of all contributions required of them by this Agreement, Participating Employers shall have no other or further
obligation or responsibility to pay for, provide or otherwise fund, and fringe benefits; it being the acknowledged intention of all parties that benefits from all employee benefit plans shall be limited to those which can be financed from the respective Trust Funds. The Participating Employers shall not be liable or responsible for the failure of the Trustees to secure, pay or provide the benefits contemplated in the employee benefit plan for any participating or beneficiary. The obligation of the Participating Employers shall be and is hereby expressly limited to the payment of contributions to the Trust Funds and no more, unless otherwise provided by law. If at any time any of the employee fringe benefit Trust Funds shall not be sufficient to pay out and provide all of the benefits provided for in the employee benefit plans, the Trustees shall take such action as may be necessary and desirable in connection with the reduction of the then existing benefits in order that the cost of the benefits shall not be greater than that which can be paid from the Trust fund. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is expressly acknowledged and agreed that the Participating Employer shall have no responsibility or obligation to increase its contributions to the Trust Fund beyond that otherwise expressly provided for herein. It is expressly acknowledged, understood and agreed that the Participating Employer does not guarantee any benefits to any participant or beneficiary; the obligation and responsibility of the Participating Employer being expressly limited to its obligation to make agreed contributions into the Trust Fund.
(5)	In the event that the parties hereto desire to alter the allocation of funds from the overall economic wage package negotiated by the parties and reflected in this Agreement, to increase or decrease the amount of money being contributed to any and/or all of the existing employee benefit plans or deductions they may do so upon the express conditions precedent that: (a) the Trustees of any plan affected acknowledge and agree in writing, (b) the Union shall have the right to make changes for Health and Welfare and Pension contributions and any such change amends this Agreement and becomes effective upon the date requested by the Union, provided the Employer is given a forty-five (45) day notice of such change.
(6)	If the Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association, National Pension, or other funds fall below predetermined safe financial level of operation, then the contribution rate shall be increased by the amount determined to be needed by the Trustees, or benefits would be reduced to protect the safe financial level.
