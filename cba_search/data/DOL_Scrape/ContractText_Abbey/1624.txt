DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION and DETECTION
The parties recognize the problems which drug abuse have created in the construction industry and the need to develop drug abuse prevention programs. Accordingly, the parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the work place and to maintain a drug free work environment, individual Employers may require applicants or employees to undergo drug screening. The parties agree that if a screening program is implemented by an individual Employer, the following items have been agreed upon by Labor and Management:
Section I.	It is understood that the use, possession, transfer, or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics, or other unlawful substances is absolutely prohibited while employees are on the Employer’s job premises or while working on any site in connection with work performed under the applicable agreement.
Section 2.	All applicants or newly hired employees will undergo a drug screen at a facility agreed upon by the Employer and the Local. The Employer agrees
68
to pay each applicant or employee who takes and passes the drug screen test for all the time it takes to undergo the drug screen up co a maximum of two hours travel time plus lab time. This paragraph shall not apply to applicants who have worked for the employer within the prior 18 months of the date of application for re-employment.
Section 3.	Applicants not passing the drug screen will not be placed on the Employer’s payroll or receive any compensation. Employees not passing the drug screen will be removed from the Employer’s payroll. The Employer agrees to pay the cost for administering the drug screen.
Section 4.	The Employer may require that an employee be tested for drugs where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is impaired from performing his/her job. Observation must be made by at least two (2) persons, one of whom may be a Local Union employee. This provision shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Supervisors will administer the program in a fair and confidential manner. For employees who refuse to take a test where the prerequisites set forth in this paragraph have been met, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the test result would have been positive for an unlawful substance.
Section 5-	An Employer may require that an employee who contributed to an accident be tested for drugs where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the accident resulted from drug usage.
69
Section 6.	No later than June 1, 2009, each Employer signatory to this Agreement must have adopted and implemented a drug/alcohol testing program, which will include a provision for random drug testing, and will be otherwise similar to the Substance Abuse Program currently in effect at the Harvard University Project Labor Agreement (on file at the Union Hall Office) for major construction, renovation and rehabilitation.

Adherence to the procedures set forth in the Harvard University Program shall institute compliance with Section 8 of this Article.
Section 7.	It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of prescribed medication impairs the employee’s ability to perform work, is a basis for removal.
Section 8.	A sufficient amount of a sample shall be taken to allow for an initial test and a confirmation test. The initial test will be by Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT). In the event a question or positive results arises from the initial test, a confirmation test must be utilized before final action can be taken against the employee or applicant. The parties recognize that in most cases the
70
Employer will not be aware of any positive results arising from an initial test until after the results of the confirmation test are made known; however should the employee be suspended based on any initial test results and the confirmation test indicates that the initial test was erroneous and the confirmation test is negative, the employee shall be reinstated with all lost earnings. The confirmation test will be by Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). Testing standards for both the initial test and confirmation test will be those established by the National Institute of Drug Abuse. Confirmed positive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in secured long-term frozen storage for a minimum of one year. Handling and transportation of each sample must be documented through strict chain of custody procedures.
Section 9.	Present employees, if tested positive, shall have the prerogative for a rehabilitation program at the employee’s expense. When such program has been successfully completed, the Employer shall not discriminate in any way against the employee. If work for which the employee is qualified exists, he or she shall be reinstated.
Section 10.	Any dispute which arises under this drug policy shall be submitted to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the applicable Agreement.
Section II.	In the event an individual Employer is required, as a condition of contract award, to abide
71
by the terms and conditions of an owner’s drug policy, the Employer will notify the interested unions in writing prior to implementing such policy.
Section 12.	The establishment or operation of this policy shall not curtail any right of an employee found in any law, rule, or regulation. Should any part of this policy be found unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over the parties, the remaining portions of the policy shall be unaffected and the parties shall enter negotiations to replace the affected provision.
Section 13-	The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Local harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits or liabilities that may arise solely out of the Employer's application of the Substance Abuse Program.
