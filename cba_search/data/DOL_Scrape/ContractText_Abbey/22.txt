ARTICLE 2	- UNION SECURITY
Section 2.1:	Considerations
In consideration of the Company’s willingness to the inclusion of the following provisions governing union security, the Union recognizes that the Company has agreed to this provision for the duration of this Agreement because of the Union’s claim that higher productivity per man hour, a higher level of morale among workers, higher levels of efficiency, increased cooperation between union stewards, union committee members, Employees and supervisors and more efficient attention to the mutual interest of the Company and the Union by EmployeeUnion representatives will result from such provisions.

Section 2.3:	Indemnity
The Union shall indemnify, defend and save the Company harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or by reason of action taken by the Company under this Article in reliance upon representation by the Union that an Employee may be lawfully discharged under this Part or upon a wage deduction authorization submitted by the Union under Section 2.4 or 2.5 so long as the action taken does not result from erroneous information provided by the Company.

d.	The Company will not deduct Union dues from the wages of an Employee in any pay period in which his earnings, after deducting taxes, and amounts
3
due the Company, are insufficient to cover the full monthly dues deduction, and the Company will not subsequently deduct for that month’s dues.
Section 2.5:	Initiation Fee Deduction
a.

c.	Application of Section
This Section shall apply and shall not be contradicted by any other provision of this Article.
Section 6.2:	Establishing Seniority
a.	Probationary Period
(1)	There shall be a probationary period of 90 days from the date of initial employment in the bargaining unit or reemployment after breaking seniority.
25
(2)	There shall be no obligation on the part of the Company to reinstate an Employee terminated during the probationary period. In the event an Employee is reinstated within 30 days following a layoff for lack of work, the time worked before layoff shall be counted as part of the probationary period.
b.	Plant Seniority
(1)	An Employee shall, upon completion of the probationary period, be entitled to plant seniority from the first day of the probationary period.
(2)	The plant seniority date of each Employee in the bargaining unit as of the effective date of this Agreement shall be that date shown on the Company records, such date having been established in accordance with the terms of the previous agreements between the Company and the Union.
c.	Occupational Group Seniority
(1)	The occupational group seniority date of each Employee in the bargaining unit as of the effective date of this Agreement shall be that date shown on the Company records, such date having been established in accordance with the terms of the previous agreements between the Company and the Union.
(2)	An Employee who enters an occupational group shall acquire occupational group seniority on the effective date of his transfer or on the date of the expiration of a job posting, whichever is earlier.
(3)	All Employees bidding into an occupational group in response to the same job posting shall have occupational group seniority as of the effective date of the earliest entry into the group resulting from that posting.
(4)	An Employee who bids into an occupational group in response to an earlier job posting than another Employee or other Employees shall have an earlier occupational group seniority date than such other Employee(s).
(5)	If, while the job posting procedures are being followed, the Company hires new Employees into the plant, on this job that is posted, the successful bidders shall be given an earlier occupational seniority date than such new Employees.
26
(6)	The occupational groups as shown on Company records as of the effective date of this Agreement shall be continued for the period of this Agreement except as modified by joint agreement of the Company and the Union.
(7)	Whenever two or more Employees have the same occupational group seniority date, the plant seniority dates shall be used to determine which Employee is senior.
(8)	Whenever 2 or more Employees have the same plant seniority date, the actual time and date when the Employees were hired as shown by the Company’s employment records will be used to determine which Employee is senior.
d.	Seniority Lists
(1)	The Company shall furnish seniority lists to the Business Representative of the Union showing plant and occupational group seniority of each Employee at least every 3 months and/or upon the request of the Business Representative, but not more often than once a month.
(2)	A separate list shall be furnished for each occupational group showing Employees in the order of their occupational group seniority. If 2 or more Employees have the same occupational group seniority date, these Employees shall in turn be listed in the order of their plant seniority. If any such Employees also have the same plant seniority date, they shall in turn be listed in the order of their hiring date and time as noted on employment records. If any such Employees also have the same hiring date and the hiring time has not been recorded, then the last 4 digits of their Social Security numbers will be considered and the Employee with the higher number will be considered senior.
(3)	The lists shall carry codes which indicate the active or inactive status of Employees appearing thereon. The Union will be provided with a key to the codes and will be advised of any revisions which may occur.
(4)	These lists shall be revised and posted in all departments concerned every 3 months or sooner.
(5)	Any errors in a seniority list, called to the attention of the Company by the Union, shall be
27
corrected and a new corrected list shall be posted and furnished to the office of the Business Representative within 30 days.
Section 6.3:	Loss Of Seniority
a.	Plant Seniority
An Employee’s plant seniority shall be broken for any of the following reasons:
(1)	resignation,
(2)	discharge for cause,
(3)	failure to report off for (3) consecutive working days (which is considered a quit) unless a reason is given which is satisfactory to the Company,
(4)	failure to return to work after a layoff within 5 working days after being notified to return to work, unless a reason is given which is satisfactory to the Company and the Union. (Each Employee must keep the Company informed of his correct mailing address.) Notification shall consist of either a completed telephone call or a certified or registered letter sent to the Employee’s last known address as shown on the records in the Company’s Employment Office. A copy of said letter shall be forwarded to the office of the Business Representative,
(5)	layoff for 2 years; or
(6)	retirement.
b.	Occupational Group Seniority
An Employee’s occupational group seniority shall be broken for any of the following reasons:
(1)	broken plant seniority,
(2)	transfer to another occupational group at the request of the Employee,
(3)	return to any occupational group wherein the Employee has an earlier occupational group seniority date (unless the Employee, prior to returning, requests the Records and Employment Department, in writing, to maintain his recall rights to some other group),
(4)	refusal of reinstatement from layoff in the occupational group, or
(5)	layoff from the occupational group for 2 years.
c.	Transfers Outside the Bargaining Unit
28
(1)	The Company has the right, without regard to seniority, to transfer any Employee to a supervisory position or to any other position not within a bargaining unit with his consent and to determine promotions and demotions in such positions.
(2)	An Employee transferred to a position at East Alton not within another bargaining unit shall, upon release from such position, be credited with plant and group seniority accumulated up to a maximum cumulative period of one year outside the bargaining unit.
(3)	Such Employee, upon release from such position, shall have the right to return to his occupational group and assume his former job or any lower-paying job according to his seniority. If he does not have sufficient group seniority to enter his occupational group, he may exercise his plant seniority in the same manner as at time of curtailment.
(4)	An Employee, having accumulated one year’s seniority outside the bargaining unit, shall not accumulate further seniority while outside the unit. However, if he returns to the bargaining unit for one continuous year, he shall, upon any subsequent transfer out of the bargaining unit, again be credited with seniority as provided in (1), (2), and (3) above. For example, if an Employee is transferred outside the unit for three years and then returns, he will be credited with having accumulated seniority for one year, but not for the other two years. If, after four months, he again is transferred outside the unit for two years and returns, he will be credited with the four months he worked in the unit but not for the two years outside the unit. If, after 18 months, he again is transferred outside the unit for four years and returns, he will be credited with the 18 months he worked in the unit plus one year while outside the unit, but not for the other three years.
(5)	Except as limited by (4) above, transfers outside the bargaining unit which do not exceed six months in any 12-month period shall be disregarded for purposes of adjusting seniority.
29
Section 6.4:	Disqualification
a.	An Employee who is disqualified by the Company or who is allowed self-disqualification shall be entitled to the same rights as an Employee curtailed from that classification, except recall rights to that classification.

b.	An Employee disqualified from a job classification shall not be considered for the same classification until after six (6) months have elapsed.
Section 6.5:	Military Service
a.	Except for the additional benefit provided by Subsection “b” of this Section, the reinstatement rights of an Employee who seeks to return to work from military service will be determined in accordance with applicable laws and will not be subject to the grievance procedure.
b.	An Employee who is otherwise entitled to reinstatement from military service in accordance with applicable laws shall not be denied reinstatement for the reason that he would have lost seniority because of layoff had he not entered military service. Such Employee shall resume his place on the plant and occupational group seniority lists.
c.	If such Employee does not have sufficient seniority at time of application for reinstatement to claim a job in the plant and/or in his occupational group, he shall be shown on the seniority list(s) as laid off on the date of his application for reinstatement.
d.	Vacation eligibility for Employees reinstated following military service is in Article 10, Section 10.11.
Section 6.6:	Establishment of New Departments
a.	In the event the Company eliminates an established department or establishes a new department, the Company shall notify the Union Business Representative and appropriate Union Unit Chairperson in writing in advance.
b.	Employees affected by the elimination of any department may exercise any applicable occupational group seniority or plant seniority rights as provided under the Agreement, including those enumerated under the Transfer of Operations provision if such transfer of operations is applicable.
30
c.	Once the Company has established a new department, it shall notify the Union in writing of the occupational group or groups and the classifications authorized for use therein and the proposed method of filling the classifications, together with all other seniority factors relating thereto.
d.	The Union shall, within 30 days, accept or reject the Company’s proposal regarding the proposed method of filling the classifications and related seniority factors or request a meeting with the Company for the purpose of discussing the proposal or making counterproposals.
e.	If a meeting is requested, the parties shall meet as soon as possible in order to resolve any seniority issue involved. Any dispute or unresolved issue shall be subject to the grievance-arbitration procedure.
Section 6.7:	Application of Seniority
a.	Applying Occupational Group Seniority
Occupational group seniority shall be the determining factor in matters affecting:
(1)	promotions within an occupational group,
(2)	demotions within an occupational group,
(3)	reinstatements to an occupational group from layoff status from that group,
(4)	scheduling vacations as provided in the Vacation Article,
(5)	temporary assignments as provided in the Temporary Openings Section of this Article,
(6)	shift or group assignments when vacancies occur in the same job classification.
b.	Posting and Filling Vacancies
(1)	Posting Period
All permanent job vacancies other than labor grade classifications and those classifications for which automatic progressions have been agreed shall be posted for bid for a period of 3 working days in the departments involved and on the job posting board at all active Employee plant gates. The 3 working days will begin at 8:00 a.m. the working day following the day on which the notice is posted and end at 4:00 p.m. the third working day following the day on which the
31
notice is posted. In an occupational group which includes Employees in classifications lower paid than the 400 series labor grade level, a vacancy in a 400 series labor grade classification will be posted for bid by such Employees within the same occupational group. If the qualifications stated on a job posting are modified during the posting period, or if an employee has been informed he was the successful bidder on a specific posting, but the bid is cancelled prior to the successful bidder being moved to the new bid job, the appropriate Unit Chairperson will be notified as to the business reason for the above stated occurrences.
Before a new Mechanical Unit Employee is hired, a bid will be posted for the existing vacancy, and after the posting is resolved, the new probationary Employee will be assigned to the department where the resulting opening exists.
(2)	Information on Posting
A job posting shall include the following information:
(a)	Department name and number
(b)	Occupational group number
(c)	Date of posting
(d)	Number and identification of job classification vacancies initially to be filled. (Concurrent vacancies, if created, may be posted simultaneously.)
(e)	Job classification and code
(f)	Wage rate
(g)	General description and requirements (from the 1951 agreed job descriptions, as amended, for vacancies in Mechanical Unit.)
(h)	Work schedule to be worked
(i)	Expiration date of the posting
(j)	Date on which the Company desires the vacancy to be filled
(k)	Job posting number
(3)	Successful Job Bidding Frequency
An Employee may successfully bid up to three (3) times in any twelve (12) month period for the purpose of bidding from one classification to another, or one Department to another. The following do not count towards the maximum:
32
(a)	Any bid for schedule preference within the same classification and department or bid from one machine to another within the same classification and department.
(b)	A bid utilized for the purpose of recall to a classification.
(c)	A bid to any classification for the purpose of actively returning to work by an Employee who is laid off outside the plant as a result of their being curtailed or disqualified.
(4)	Bidding from Within Group
Employees in any occupational group have the right to bid for posted job vacancies (limited as provided in (1) above for labor grade vacancies) and such bids may not be withdrawn after the expiration of the posting.
(a)	Any bid from within the Mechanical Group for a permanent opening or vacancy created will be considered only for the shift or schedule specified by the bidder in the remarks section of the bid form and will not be considered for any other shift or schedule.
(b)	When an Employee is the successful bidder on 2 or more vacancies that are posted or expire in the same work week, he may choose which one of the vacancies he prefers and which bids are to be withdrawn and shall indicate the order of his preference for the bids withdrawn.
(c)	If an Employee accepts one bid and cancels the others and the job vacancy is withdrawn by the Company, the Employee shall receive the selection of his choice of the remaining vacancies for which he bid in order of his preference.
(d)	If an Employee is informed that he is a successful bidder early in the work week and accepts that job, then later in the same work week is informed he is a successful bidder on another job, he shall be allowed to accept the second job if he so desires.
(5)	Bidding from Outside Group
In filling any vacancies other than labor grade which remain unfilled after promotions and assignments from within the occupational group, bidders from all other occupational groups shall be selected on the basis of plant seniority.
33
(6)	Prompt Transfer of Bidders
The Company shall have a maximum of 30 days after a posting expires or the date which the Company desires to fill the vacancy, whichever is later, to transfer the Employee. The Employee will begin receiving his new Occupational Group Seniority immediately upon resolution of the bid. If the transfer cannot be made within five (5) working days after the posting expires or the date the Company desires to fill the vacancy, whichever is later, the Employee shall begin receiving his new classification rate if higher. If after five (5) additional working days he still has not been transferred, he shall begin receiving any clothes change, bath time or shift premiums to which he would be entitled had he been transferred.
(7)	If Bidder is Unavailable
If the successful bidder for a vacancy is unavailable for immediate transfer to the vacancy due to absence because of being on
a.	Vacation, or
b.	Approved Medical Leave of Absence, such Employee will be transferred to it upon return to work unless there has been a reduction in force and the Employee cannot receive the job because of lack of seniority.
Openings under “a” and “b” above will be filled by temporary opening provisions. In the event, under “b” above, the successful bidder is unable to return to work or is unable to fill the job duties upon his return to work, the job will be posted as a permanent vacancy.
If the successful bidder for a vacancy is unavailable for immediate transfer for any other reason, his bid will be disregarded and other bidders for the same opening will be considered.
A bid from an Employee on leave will be disregarded.
(8)	Bidding During Vacation
An Employee, prior to going on vacation, may place bids for any vacancies which may occur and be posted during his vacation period and for which he desires to bid. Such bids must state
34
the order of preference. In the event such an Employee is the successful bidder on a given vacancy, the vacancy shall be filled by temporary assignment, in accordance with the Temporary Openings Section of this Agreement, until the Employee returns from vacation.
(9)	Bidding On Own Vacancy
Once an Employee has been deemed to be the successful bidder for a particular job vacancy, he may not then bid back to his own vacancy.

A temporary opening of up to 45 calendar days (or one caused by vacation) may be filled by temporary assignment of an Employee from within the same occupational group.
(2)	All Temporary Openings on a different shift or schedule in the Mechanical Unit, General Machinist or above, will be filled by initially canvassing for volunteers, and if not successful, the junior qualified employee will be assigned.
(3)	Higher Paid Temporary Openings
If such opening is in a higher paid job classification, group seniority shall be applied among Employees who are:
(a)	working on the same shift, and
(b)	in the same department or smaller work group where appropriate, and
(c)	insofar as they are available, qualified by past experience on the task involved, and
(d)	in the Mechanical Groups, in the next lower job classification, and
(e)	in Group 44, General Machinist Seniority (rather than group seniority) shall be applied for classifications set forth in Subsection 6.7.o(1).
(f)	if any such higher paid temporary openings are not filled pursuant to the provisions of (a) through (e) above, the junior qualified employee will be assigned to such opening.
35
(4)	Loan From Outside Group
If such opening cannot be filled from within the same occupational group, it shall be filled by loan and temporary assignment.
(5)	Openings Over 45 Calendar Days
In the case of any other temporary need which is expected to last 45 calendar days or more, the opening is to be filled as a permanent opening.
(6)	Job Recall Rights Not Affected
(a)	An Employee who is temporarily assigned to a job to which he has recall rights does not thereby renew his recall rights.
(b)	An Employee who is permitted to decline a temporary assignment to a job to which he has recall rights does not thereby lose his recall rights.
d.	Temporary Shutdown
(1)	In the application of this provision, the word “emergency” refers to situations involving factors such as an Act of God, major damage to the plant, shortage of material beyond the Company’s control, machine breakdown and temporary emergency suspension of production on government contracts, as directed by the government contracting agency.
(2)	In the event it is necessary to temporarily shutdown or materially curtail an operation because of emergency conditions, the seniority rights applicable to layoffs of affected Employees, as provided in curtailment provisions of this Section, may be suspended for a period not to exceed 5 working days.
(3)	For Production Workers, the term ‘’operation’’ as used in (2) above, means a unit as defined in the Production Workers Overtime Selection Procedure or Working Rules.
(4)	In the event the Company finds it necessary to shut down a department briefly for reasons other than those set forth in (1) above, such shutdown (limited to 5 workdays by a department in any calendar year) shall not be considered a layoff for purposes of applying curtailment provisions of this Section.
(5)	Should the Company find it necessary to invoke a temporary shutdown as provided above, the
36
Company will contact the appropriate Unit Union Committee Chairperson and advise him as to the situation. If, for any reason, the Unit Union Committee Chairperson desires to discuss the situation with the Plant Union Committee, a meeting shall be held without delay.
e.	Curtailment (All Units)
(1)	When curtailments occur, reassignments within an occupational group will be made in accordance with Subsections f (Production Workers), and k (Mechanical).
(2)	Layoff From Group
Layoffs from an occupational group shall be made on the basis of occupational group seniority.
(3)	Reassignment Outside Group
An Employee who has insufficient seniority to hold any job in his occupational group shall, if he has sufficient plant seniority, be offered the opportunity to be reassigned.
(4)	Layoff From 400 Series Or Above

Fourth, to any available vacancy in a job classification below the 400 series labor grade level;
Fifth, to displace a probationary Employee in a job classification below the 400 series labor grade level; and
Sixth, to displace the junior Employee in a job classification identified by job code 701 or 702.
Upon written request, an Employee may decline such vacancies as listed in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Steps without loss of seniority.
(5)	When on the same date, several such Employees are simultaneously scheduled for curtailment
37
from an occupational group, plant seniority will be observed by assigning the senior of these Employees to the higher paid classifications being filled as outlined in (4) above.
(6)	Layoff from Classifications Below 400 Series
(a)	An Employee being laid off from his occupational group while in a job classification below the 400 series level, who desires reassignment, shall be reassigned by the Company in the following order:
First, to fill a vacancy in any classification below the 400 series level;
Second, to displace a probationary Employee in any classification below the 400 series level;

(c)	An Employee who declines an optional classification at time of curtailment shall not be recalled to that classification.
(9)	Training Replacement (Production Workers Only)
38
An Employee being displaced by an Employee from another department may be retained for the training of his replacement; however, any deviation from exact seniority shall be limited to one working day.
(10)	Voluntary Layoff From 400 Series
An Employee being curtailed from a 400 series labor grade classification has the right at the time of curtailment to decline a 400 series labor grade classification in another occupational group. In that event,
(a)	he will be laid off with reinstatement rights only to classifications at the 400 series level or above in his occupational group;
(b)	he will remain on layoff status until such time as he is the junior Employee on layoff from a 400 series labor grade classification, at which time he must either accept reinstatement to any 400 series labor grade classification (except Janitor) or be removed from all seniority lists.
(11)	Voluntary Layoff From Above 400 Series
(a)	An Employee being curtailed from a classification above 400 series labor grade may refuse reassignment, in which event he shall be laid off from the plant with reinstatement rights only to the classification from which he took the voluntary layoff. (In the Production Workers and Mechanical Units, he shall also retain reinstatement rights to classifications in his occupational group which are above the classification from which he took the voluntary layoff.)
(b)	Changing Voluntary Layoff
However, if he has not been recalled within 6 months, he may elect to change his status from voluntary to involuntary layoff in which event he will be assigned to the first available 400 series labor grade vacancy to which his seniority entitles him, arising after receipt of notification.
(c)	Requesting Change To Involuntary
An Employee wishing to change his status from voluntary to involuntary layoff must do so by notifying the Company and the Union,
39
in writing, no earlier than 6 months following his voluntary layoff. Only 1 such request will be recognized during any 1 continuous period of layoff.
(12)	Voluntary Layoff From Below 400 Series
(a)	An Employee being laid off from a job classification below the 400 series level (other than one identified by the job code 701 or 702) has the right to refuse to accept reassignment, in which event such Employee shall be laid off from the plant with reinstatement rights only to the job classification from which the voluntary layoff was taken (or above) in his occupational group.
(b)	However, if he has not been recalled within 6 months, he may elect to change his status from voluntary to involuntary layoff in which event he will be assigned to the first available vacancy in a classification identified by job code 701 or 702, to which his seniority entitles him, arising after receipt of notification.
(c)	An Employee wishing to change his status from voluntary to involuntary layoff must do so by notifying the Company and the Union, in writing, no earlier than 6 months following his voluntary layoff. Only one such request will be recognized during any one continuous period of layoff.

(1)	he will be laid off with reinstatement rights only to classifications in his occupational group;
(2)	he will remain on layoff status until such time as he is the junior Employee on layoff from a classification identified by job code 701 or 702, at which time he must either accept reinstatement to any such classification or be removed from all seniority lists.

(b)	An Employee who has insufficient occupational group seniority to hold any job classification at the 400 series labor grade level or above in his occupational group may elect to displace a junior Employee in any lower paid job classification within his occupational group or to be laid off from his occupational group.
(2)	Curtailment From Group
Curtailment from an occupational group and subsequent reassignment shall be in accordance with Subsection 6.7.e - Curtailment (All Units).
g.	Recall Rights (Production Workers)
(1)	Job Recall Rights
(a)	An Employee is entitled to recall rights provided he retains occupational group seniority, to any job classification for which he is qualified and which carries a top rate equal to or lower than the highest job classification from which he has been laid off during the preceding 2 years. Additionally, an Employee who has held the classification for a minimum of 30 days will be entitled to recall after all eligible qualified Employees who have progressed to a higher step in the wage bracket have been offered recall.
(b)	An Employee who is laid off from the occupational group shall be recalled to any job classification from which he was laid off and to which he has recall rights.
(c)	An Employee who was not offered recall rights to any job classification from which he had not been laid off may claim such recall rights upon discovery. In such cases, the Company will be liable for a maximum of 3 days of back pay.
(2)	Forfeiture of Job Recall Rights
41
An Employee shall forfeit his recall rights to any job classification if he fails to exercise such rights at the first opportunity. An Employee who is on vacation or on approved leave-of-absence at the time a junior Employee accepts recall to a job classification shall be entitled to exercise his recall rights immediately upon return to work.

(a)	An opening in a 400 series labor grade job classification in any occupational group shall be filled:
First, by recalling an Employee to that classification on the basis of group seniority from among those Employees with sufficient plant seniority to hold 400 series labor grade job classifications;
Second, by posting for bid from among those Employees in classifications below the 400 series level in the same occupational group with sufficient plant seniority to hold 400 series labor grade classifications;
Third, by recalling on the basis of plant seniority an Employee laid off with recall rights to a 400 series labor grade job classification.
(b)	A vacancy in a job classification above 400 series labor grade which remains unfilled after all group and job recall rights and bidding privileges have been exercised will be offered, in plant seniority order, to Employees on involuntary layoff from the plant with recall rights to a 400 series labor grade job classification. (Since acceptance of a vacancy in the Adjuster Trainee or Tester C classification would result in loss of other occupational group and job recall rights, an
42
Employee may decline such a vacancy without loss of seniority.)
(5)	Openings in Classifications Below 400 Series Employees curtailed from job classifications below the 400 series level shall be recalled to openings in those classifications in the following manner:
(a)	An opening in a job classification below the 400 series level (other than those classifications identified by job codes 701 or 702) shall be filled by recalling, on the basis of group seniority, an Employee who has retained recall rights to the classification.
(b)	Such a vacancy which remains unfilled after all group and job recall rights and bidding privileges have been exercised, will be offered in plant seniority order to Employees on involuntary layoff from the plant. However, an Employee on involuntary layoff, with recall rights to above 400 job series, may decline such vacancy in writing without loss of seniority.
(c)	An opening in a job classification identified by job code 701 or 702 in any occupational group shall be filled:
First, by recalling an Employee to that classification on the basis of group seniority from among those Employees with sufficient plant seniority to hold a classification identified by job code 701 or 702;
Second, by recalling, on the basis of plant seniority, an Employee on involuntary layoff from the plant. (An Employee curtailed from a job classification at the 400 series level (or above) who had insufficient plant seniority to enter a classification below the 400 series level at the time of layoff, shall be recalled to an opening in a job classification identified by job code 701 or 702 on the basis of plant seniority provided he specifically requests such recall in writing.)
(6)	Order of Recall
Recall shall be handled as provided above except that the Company may deviate from exact seniority order for a maximum of 2 working days
43
or, when necessary to post to replace a recalled Employee, a maximum of 5 working days, and then he must be transferred.
h.	Schedule Preference (Production Workers)
(1)	An Employee may exercise occupational group seniority to select the type of schedule he prefers within his job classification and department;
(a)	when an opening occurs on that schedule, or
(b)	when he is affected by a curtailment.
(2)	Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an Employee who is transferring to a new department. For the purpose of this provision, each of the following shall be considered as a single “department”: Department 4420 Metallic, Zone 1, will be considered a separate department from Metallic, Zone 4 for the purposes of schedule realignment.
Empty Shell (Zones 1 & 4);
Occupational Group 45;
Ballistics (Zones 1 & 4).

Upon receipt, the Union shall have, within 30 days thereafter, an option of either accepting or rejecting the rate for the new classification or the method of filling classifications in a new occupational group or requesting a meeting for the purpose of discussing the proposal or making counter-proposals.
c.	If a meeting is requested, the parties shall meet as soon as possible to discuss the proposal. If no agreement is reached, the Company may elect to institute the new classification or fill the new occupational group if not instituted under a above.
d.	The establishment by the Company under either a or c above shall not constitute an estoppel to the Union to pursue additional negotiations and/or inequity requests unless the Union fails to exercise options in b above within the 30 day limitation.
Section 8.7:	Shift Premiums
a.	An Employee working on the day shift shall receive no shift premium unless such is required by law.
b.	An Employee working on the afternoon shift shall receive a shift premium of 400 an hour.
c.	An Employee working on the midnight shift shall receive a shift premium of 450 an hour.
61
d.	An Employee shall receive his regular shift premium, if any, for clothes change and bath time, even though such time is normally part of another shift.
Section 8.8:	Sunday Work
a.	Time and one-half shall be paid for work on Sunday as such.
b.	Sunday is the 24-hour period beginning with the day shift Sunday morning.
Section 8.9:	Seventh Day in Work Week
a.	Double time shall be paid for all work performed on an Employee’s 7th consecutive day worked in the same work week. An Employee called in or scheduled in prior to his assigned day shift starting time on Monday morning shall receive double time for such early hours if he had worked on the prior Saturday.
b.	When overtime is to be worked on both Saturday and Sunday, an Employee selected under any applicable Overtime Working Rules must agree to work both days in order to be selected.
If all Employees decline to work both days, Employees will be selected in the applicable overtime selection procedure order to work either Saturday or Sunday.
Paragraph 1 of Subsection b shall not apply to an Employee involved in the weekend overtime when the inability of the Employee to work on Saturday is restricted under the Illinois Six Day Work Week Law because such Employee had worked 6 days in the Illinois work week.
In such an event, the Employee will be eligible for the Sunday overtime.
Such an Employee shall not be eligible for Sunday overtime if there are sufficient Employees in the classification, on the shift who agree to work both days. It is the intent of this paragraph to allow an Employee ineligible for Saturday overtime under the Illinois law to work Sunday before going outside the classification or shift.
An Employee scheduled to work overtime on Saturday and who works Saturday shall work overtime on Sunday should it become necessary to schedule Sunday overtime in the classification worked on Saturday.
62
It is the intent of this Subsection that an Employee working the sixth day of the work week on overtime shall not be prevented from working the seventh day in the work week if overtime is required in the same job classification and same shift as he worked on the sixth day in order to avoid the payment of double time.
c.	An assignment of an Employee in accordance with the above provision will be made only when the Company deems it necessary to do such work and when the assignment will not be in violation of any law.
d.	In this Section, a period of work which is connected with another shift (“early call-in” or “hold-over”), but which overlaps another work day, shall not be counted as a separate day worked, unless such “early call-in” or “hold-over” is for a full shift or longer.
e.	However, Subsection (d) shall not apply to a “holdover” beyond the end of an Employee’s normal midnight shift on Saturday or to an “early callin” prior to an Employee’s normal day shift on Monday morning. Any such period (excluding normal clothes change time, etc.) shall be considered as a separate day worked.
f.	An Employee must work at least 4 hours on his regularly scheduled shift to have that work day counted as a “day worked’’ for purposes of eligibility for seventh day double time.
g.	If an Employee is called in to work on his regular day off for a period not connected with another shift, such period shall be considered a separate day worked regardless of the length of time worked.
Section 8.10:	Call-In Pay
An Employee called in to the plant to work during a period of time unconnected with his regular shift shall receive, regardless of the actual time worked, not less than the equivalent of straight time pay for 4 hours.
Section 8.11:	Reporting Pay
a.	An Employee reporting for work at his regular starting time and place, lacking notice from the Company to the contrary, and who, through no fault of his own, is not permitted to work in his regular job classification shall be given, without
63
affecting any other regular Employee, a full day’s work at his regular rate of pay.
b.	However, such Employee shall receive not less than 4 hours’ pay, regardless of the actual time worked, unless the Employee does not work because of:
(1)	The granting of his request to go home rather than perform temporary work for which he is physically qualified,
(2)	a plant breakdown beyond the control of the Company, or
(3)	any other cause entirely beyond the control of the Company.
Section 8.12:	Hours Outside Regular Schedule
a.	An Employee working outside his regularly scheduled shift on his regularly scheduled work day (i.e. daily overtime) shall receive time and one-half. An Employee working on his regularly scheduled day off shall receive time and one-half only after he has actually worked all of his regularly scheduled hours, or 40 straight-time hours, in that work week. (For the purpose of this section only hours “worked” includes paid vacation, paid jury duty, paid funeral leave, paid holidays, Company-paid union leave [union leave not paid for by the Company is not included as “hours worked” unless pre-approved by Labor Relations] and hours where the employee is not allowed to work due to the Company’s decision).
b.	Regular schedule, as used in this Section, means 5 consecutive days, starting with the first shift of the work week, for Employees on straight shifts and rotating 2 or 3 shift schedules and 5 consecutive days of the work period for established group work schedules. Regularly scheduled hours means the 8 hours of an Employee’s regular, assigned shift as designated in Sections 7.1 or 7.3 of this Agreement.
Section 8.13:	Selection for Overtime Work
a.	It is recognized that overtime work is important and, on occasion, necessary and that an Employee is subject to disciplinary action for failure to work assigned overtime, unless excused by his foreman. Normally 48 hour advance notice will be given for scheduled weekend work; however circumstances may require shorter notice.
b.	Once the Company has determined that Employees are to do certain work at a certain time and that there will be an insufficient number of Employees otherwise available to perform the work, Employees
64
will be selected for overtime work in accordance with working rules established by the Company and the Union.
c.	An Employee will not be allowed or required to work more than 16 consecutive hours, or to work double shifts on 2 consecutive days, unless he is the only available qualified Employee. For the purpose of this Section, 6 hours or more shall constitute a double unless provided otherwise in any agreed Overtime Working Rules.
d.	An Employee who is on vacation shall have no preference for overtime on his normal days off, except for startup activities following a shutdown.
e.	The Company will make reasonable effort not to force Employees to work overtime. However, due to Company operations, forcing of overtime may be required but, when overtime is forced, proper Employees will be forced. As a basic guideline, when possible, all forced overtime will be the responsibility of the outgoing shift unless the applicable Departmental Overtime Agreement specifies otherwise. In the event the Company might force the wrong Employee to work an overtime assignment, that Employee will be paid at 2 times his basic rate of pay for the overtime worked. Unless otherwise specified by a Departmental Overtime Agreement regarding the procedure utilized in the event of a “forced” overtime assignment, the basic guideline of “forcing the original vacancy” when available should be exercised. For known in advance Departmental openings due to vacations, leaves of absence, jury duty, funeral leave, and disciplinary suspension, the basic concept of “ask for 8 hours, ask for 12 hours, and then force for 8 hours” should be utilized as a basic guideline. However Department Overtime Agreements ultimately will govern how such openings are to be covered in each of the respective Departments throughout the plant.
f.	An Employee who works an overtime assignment in a lower paid job classification shall receive overtime payment based on his regular rate of pay.
g.	In the event an Employee is forced to work overtime under Section 8.13-e above, and such overtime is daily overtime on a hold over basis and the Employee can prove to the satisfaction of the Company that he does not have transportation
65
home, the Company shall exercise one of the following options:
(1)	Allow the Employee to work a full 8 hour double.
(2)	Provide transportation home for the Employee.
h.	An Employee who volunteers for and starts work on a full 8-hour double and whose overtime is cut short by management decision will be treated as one who is forced under paragraph g for purposes of transportation.
i.	Where more than one Employee in a classification (in the same overtime unit on the shift) is forced to work overtime, and it develops that some can leave earlier than others, the senior Employees in the classification will, if they ask, be given the opportunity to leave first, provided (1) those who remain are qualified to do the work and (2) no transportation home will be provided.
Section 8.14:	Pay for Overtime Work
Time and one-half will be paid for all hours worked in the work week for:
a.	All hours over 8 hours in a 24-hour work period (except those resulting from Employees trading shifts at their request).
b.	On an Employee’s regular scheduled day off in the work week.
c.	Over 40 hours in a work week.
d.	Hours outside the regular schedule as provided in Section 8.12.
Section 8.15:	Time Off Due to Overtime
a.	An Employee shall not be required to take time off from his regular schedule because of working overtime except to conform with legal requirements under appropriate laws.
b.	If, to conform with State or Federal law, an Employee is allowed to take a day off from his regular schedule, he shall be allowed to select the day off provided, however, that if more than one Employee is involved, such selection shall be made by group seniority.
c.	Provision b shall not take precedence over Section 8.9.
Section 8.16:	Overtime Equity Allowance
An Employee working more than 4 hours (exclusive of clothes change or wash-up time) shall be entitled to
66
an overtime equity allowance of $8.00 to be placed on the employee’s check as earnings.
Section 8.17:	Holiday as Time Worked
A day for which an Employee receives holiday pay shall be counted as a day worked for the purpose of computing overtime only if he would have been scheduled to work on that day except for the observance of the holiday.
Section 8.18:	Selection for Holiday Work
a.	Employees will be selected for work on any shift on a holiday in accordance with occupational group seniority (General Machinists date where applicable) from among qualified Employees who:
(1)	are in the job classification needed,
(2)	are in the department (with preference given to those within the appropriate overtime unit, if any), and
(3)	normally would have been scheduled to work that shift but for the holiday.
b.	This procedure will not apply to selection of standby workers for the Christmas-New Year holiday shutdown period.
c.	If departmental overtime working rules provide a procedure for selecting employees specifically for holiday work, that procedure, rather than (a) above, will be observed. Otherwise, the overtime working rules shall not apply unless and until all qualified Employees who normally would have been scheduled to work that shift are first given an opportunity to work.
Section 8.19:	Transfer to Higher-Paid Job
a.	An Employee temporarily transferred to a job having a higher wage bracket shall receive the lowest step in such bracket which is higher than his regular rate for the actual time worked on the job or for 4 hours, whichever is greater.
b.	Such Employee will be credited for all time worked in the job classification for progression within the wage bracket.
Section 8.20:	Transfer to Lower-Paid Job
a.	An Employee temporarily transferred for the convenience of the Company to a job carrying a lower rate of pay shall receive his regular rate of pay.
67
b.	An Employee temporarily transferred for his own convenience to a job carrying a lower rate of pay shall receive that rate of pay for the actual time worked on such job.
Section 8.21:	Sunday - Monday Double Shift
An Employee who is scheduled for the day shift on Monday and who is called or scheduled in for the full midnight shift on Sunday, shall receive time and one-half for his regular day shift on Monday.

Section 9.6:	Notice of Holiday Work

ARTICLE 10	- VACATIONS
Section 10.1:	General Considerations
a.	A week of vacation shall be compensated at the rate of 40 times the hourly rate of pay, without shift differential, in effect at the time the vacation is taken.
b.	In this Article, “Anniversary Date’’ means the anniversary of the beginning of continuous Company service, except that an Employee shall, on the January 1st following the completion of (two) 2 years of service, assume January 1st of the year in
71
which his service began as his service date for vacation purposes.

d.	An Employee’s eligibility for an amount of vacation pay and time off shall be based on his Company service date.
Section 10.2:	Eligibility for Vacation

a.	An Employee with 1 year but not more than 2 years of continuous service shall receive 1 week of vacation if he has received earnings in 20 pay periods.
b.	An Employee with two years of continuous service shall receive 1 week of vacation if he has received earnings in 20 pay periods since his anniversary date in the previous year.
c.	An Employee with 3 years of continuous service shall receive 2 weeks of vacation if he has received earnings in 18 pay periods since his anniversary date in the previous year.

72
Section 10.3:	Vacation Period
a.	The normal vacation period shall be a 1-week period which includes the 4th of July, and the 1-week period that follows Thanksgiving.

(2)	in 2010, June 28 - November 29; and
(3)	in 2011, July 4 - November 28;
If the Company needs to cancel one or both weeks of the vacation shutdown period, 30-days advance notice will be provided to Employees.
For the Vacation Shutdown week which includes the 4th of July, the shutdown will be (8) calendar days in duration rather than (7), due to the celebration of the July 4th holiday. Therefore, normal production would resume on Tuesday following the July 4th week, rather than Monday. (Note: For year 2009, shutdown will only be 7 calendar days due to July 4th falling on a Saturday.)
Also, in the event of the cancellation of the Company’s second week of vacation shutdown (week after Thanksgiving), upon such notice, Employees may choose to reschedule that week of vacation in a 1-week increment, or receive pay-in-lieu for that week, or reschedule that week of vacation in 1-day increments. Due to the lateness in the year, Employees may reschedule this week of vacation into the on-coming year if they so desire.
b.	For the purposes of holiday pay eligibility or of application of seniority at time of curtailment, an Employee is not considered as laid off if he is off without pay during a shutdown for vacation.
Section 10.4:	Scheduling
a.	An Employee who is required to work during the normal vacation period or who is eligible for more than 2 weeks of vacation will be given the opportunity to schedule another vacation time. If the Company needs additional Employees to fill in during Plant Shutdown, the jobs will be offered to those Employees with 1 week of vacation to work 1 week and second, to those Employees with no vacation allotment.
73
b.	The Company will contact each such Employee not later than the end of the first full week in December of the preceding year to determine preferences for vacation scheduling.
c.	An Employee shall make his preferences known promptly so as to permit completion of scheduling by December 30th.
d.	Preferences expressed before that date will be considered in accordance with Subsections i, j, k, and l below.
e.	After that date he shall be limited to available dates, even though a junior Employee may be scheduled for a preferred period. However, under unusual circumstances, if the Company changes his vacation, he then can use his seniority to select a changed vacation period.
f.	The vacation week shall begin on Monday for all Employees. Employees on a Monday through Friday schedule will not be forced to work the Saturday/ Sunday weekend at the end of their scheduled vacation week prior to returning to work on Monday. Group workers may start their vacation to coincide with their group work schedules. The Employee shall make his final decision no later than 2 weeks prior to the week he will start his vacation.
g.	An Employee may, if he wishes, take pay in lieu of time off for any week(s) of vacation in excess of 2. Such choice is to be made, if possible, when he initially schedules his vacation, but in no event later than 2 weeks prior to the scheduled start of that portion of his vacation. Pay in lieu will be issued promptly after he makes his decision known, provided he is eligible.
h.	If either or both weeks of the normal vacation period are cancelled, affected Employees will have the option of rescheduling the cancelled weeks or taking pay in lieu, or rescheduling the cancelled weeks in one-day vacation increments.
i.	Vacation Scheduling (Production Workers)
(1)	Preference for vacation scheduling expressed by or prior to December 30 will be granted on the basis of occupational group seniority within his job classification in his department.
74
(2)	The Company shall determine the number of Employees in each job classification to be assigned vacations during any given period.
(3)	In the event the number of Employees in various classifications exceeds the total number allowed by the Company in any given period, the preference for the total department number shall be by occupational group seniority.
j.	Vacation Scheduling (Mechanical)
(1)	Preference for vacation scheduling expressed by or prior to December 30 will be granted on the basis of occupational group seniority within his department.
(2)	The Company shall determine the number of Employees in each job classification and the total number in all job classifications to be assigned vacations during any given period.
Section 10.5:	Transfer to New Department
a.	An Employee who is scheduled for vacation during the normal vacation period, and who transfers to a new department where he is not to be scheduled for vacation during that period, or vice versa, shall be rescheduled.
b.	The Company will attempt to give any other Employee who transfers to a new department his vacation as originally scheduled unless other Employees are already scheduled for all available vacations during that period.
c.	In the event an Employee is to be rescheduled under either of the 2 preceding provisions, his preference will be determined on a seniority basis.
Section 10.6:	Change in Schedule
a.	Once scheduled, an Employee’s vacation is not to be changed except for good cause. No change is to be made within the final 2 weeks prior to the scheduled beginning of the vacation, except in an emergency.
b.	If the department is forced to cancel an Employee’s vacation as stated above, he will be rescheduled at that time for a new vacation period. He will receive his vacation pay at the time of taking his time off.
c.	If the department finds it necessary to change an Employee’s vacation schedule more than 2 weeks prior to the scheduled period, the Employee will be
75
rescheduled in accordance with seniority, limited to those periods which were available to him when he made his original selection.
d.	Under no circumstances may a department change an Employee’s vacation schedule more than once, except where necessary to grant the preference of a senior Employee.
e.	If the department grants an Employee’s request to change his vacation schedule after December 30th, the Employee’s selection is limited to the remaining available periods.
f.	If a vacation week becomes open after the initial scheduling period, it will be made available to Employees in the affected classification and department who have requested it. If more than one such employee has requested it, occupational group seniority will be the determining factor.
Section 10.7:	Issuing Vacation Pay
a.	A day shift Employee is to receive vacation pay no later than the start of his last regularly scheduled shift prior to leaving for vacation, provided the scheduling is completed in sufficient time. (For Monday-Friday workers, scheduling must be completed by noon of the prior Monday, etc.)
b.	An afternoon or midnight shift Employee shall receive vacation pay no later than the start of his next to last shift.
c.	In emergency or hardship cases, the Company will endeavor to make such prepayment with less notice, but such is not guaranteed.
Section 10.8:	Eligible After Shutdown
a.	An Employee who is not eligible for a vacation at the time of the normal vacation period shall receive a vacation if he becomes eligible at a later date in the calendar year.
b.	An Employee who comes within either of the 2 preceding provisions may elect to receive compensation for any week or weeks of vacation without taking additional time off provided he was absent from work during an equivalent number of calendar weeks (or periods of 5 consecutive calendar days of a group schedule) or off without pay during a plant shutdown for vacation during the calendar year.
76
Section 10.9:	Leaves of Absence
The following rules shall apply provided the Employee works in the calendar year:
a.	Each pay period in which an Employee did not receive earnings because he was absent from work due to industrial injury or industrial illness shall be counted as a pay period in which he received earnings for the purpose of vacation eligibility.
b.	An Employee who is otherwise qualified for a vacation and who is absent at the time of the normal vacation period on an approved leave of absence shall receive vacation compensation at that time.
c.	An Employee who receives a leave of absence to extend beyond the calendar year shall be considered the same as an Employee who resigns for the purpose of vacation compensation.
Section 10.10:	Terminations
a.	An Employee who is laid off for lack of work after the normal vacation period in his department or who resigns prior to his vacation period shall be considered to be scheduled for vacation on the date of termination and his eligibility for compensation shall be determined as of that date.
b.	An Employee who has not completed 1 year of service at the time he is laid off shall receive compensation for vacation if he has received earnings in 20 pay periods and if his first anniversary of employment could occur in the calendar year.
c.	If his first anniversary of service could not occur in the calendar year, he shall be eligible for vacation compensation on his first anniversary provided he has seniority status at that time.
d.	An Employee who has completed 2 years but less than 3 years of service at the time he is laid off shall receive compensation for two weeks of vacation if he has received earnings in 18 pay periods since his anniversary date in the previous year and if his third anniversary of service could occur during that calendar year.
e.	An Employee who is eligible for vacation but who is laid off for lack of work prior to the normal vacation period in his department shall not receive vacation compensation at the time he is laid off but shall receive it at the time of the normal vacation period.
77
f.	An Employee discharged for cause shall receive compensation for vacation for which he is otherwise eligible .
g.	An Employee who retires effective within a calendar year and who is eligible for vacation at the effective time of said retirement, regular or early, shall have the following options:
(1)	Taking all or part of his vacation, time permitting, prior to the effective date of his retirement.
(2)	Being paid for all or part of his vacation, after the effective date of his retirement.
All vacation allotment must be taken or paid for within the calendar year. Employees retiring after the plant vacation shutdown and who are scheduled for vacation during all or part of the shutdown shall take this period, counted as vacation.
Section 10.11:	Military Reinstatement
a.	The vacation eligibility of an Employee who did not receive vacation pay at the time he entered military service shall be determined, upon his reinstatement under the provisions of Section 6.5, by crediting such Employee with the total number of pay periods in which he has received earnings since his anniversary date prior to entering military service in the same manner as if such anniversary date was the one which preceded his reinstatement.
b.	The requirement of working any given number of pay periods shall be waived for an Employee returning from military service for purposes of determining his eligibility for vacation in the year in which he is reinstated.
Section 10.12:	One-Day Vacations
a.	An Employee who is eligible for 3 or more weeks of vacation may schedule all of his vacation (other than the normal shutdown periods) in one-day increments, provided:
(1)	he makes a written request to his supervisor during the previous week or no later than two (2) working days in advance of the requested day, except in an emergency situation which shall be limited to a maximum of five (5) days per calendar year in which case the request must be made at least one hour before the start of the shift; and
78
(2)	in the judgment of management, the day of vacation will not adversely affect operations.
