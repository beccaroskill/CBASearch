No portion of this section shall be used to displace regular employees with contract labor. The Company agrees that this section will not be used for the purpose of discrimination or to avoid any part of this agreement.
The above rights of management are not all-inclusive, but indicate the type of matters of rights, which belong to and are inherent in management. Any of the rights, powers and authority had prior to entering into this collective bargaining agreement are retained by the Company, except as expressly and specifically abridged, delegated, granted or modified by this agreement or applicable state and federal statutes.
ARTICLE 3	• NO STRIKE - NO LOCKOUT

Foster Farms CBA_Expires_7-30-2019 4/23/15 3:03 ftM Page 2
of the Union designed to curtail or interfere with production, and there shall be no lockouts by the Company because of labor disputes between employees or the Union and the Company.
ARTICLE 4	• NON-DISCRIMINATION
Section 4.01 No Discrimination. The Company and the Union are committed to maintain a work environment that is free from discrimination. In the administration of this Agreement and, in accordance with applicable federal and state law, neither the Company nor the Union shall discriminate against any employee because of that employee’s race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, martial status, veterans’ status, sexual preference or disability.
Section 4.02 Harassment Prohibited. Harassment of any employee due to that employee’s race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, veteran’s status, or disability is also prohibited by this Agreement as well as federal and state law. Harassment consists of unwelcome conduct, whether verbal, physical or visual, that is based upon a person’s protected status, such as sex, race, color, ancestry, religion, national origin, age, disability, martial status or other protected status. The Company will not tolerate harassing conduct that affects tangible job benefits, that interferes unreasonably with an individual’s work performance; or that creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
1.	Sexual Harassment. Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other physical, verbal or visual conduct based on sex, when:
(i)	. Submission to the conduct is an explicit or implicit term or condition of employment;
(ii)	. Submission to or rejection of the conduct is used as the basis for an employment decision; or
(iii)	. The conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
Prohibited sexual harassment may include explicit sexual proposition, sexual innuendo, suggestive comments, jokes, obscene language or gestures, displays of obscene material, and physical conduct.

or gestures, or displays of material offensive to members of the above described groups.
Section 4.03 Use of Grievance Procedure. If any employee feels that they have been subjected to prohibited discrimination, including harassment, they may file a grievance under the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement. If the employee feels they have been the subject of discrimination or harassment whether by other employees, supervisors, vendors, customers, or a union agent or steward, they should immediately notify their immediate supervisor.
If the supervisor is unavailable or if the employee believes it would be inappropriate to contact their supervisor, the employee should immediately contact the Human Resources Department. The Company will investigate all such complaints thoroughly and promptly. To the fullest extent practicable, the Company will keep complaints and terms of their resolution confidential. If an investigation confirms that harassment has occurred, the Company will take corrective action, up to and including immediate termination of employment of any employee found to have violated the provisions of this Article. The Company forbids retaliation against anyone who has truthfully reported harassment.
Section 4.04 Reasonable Accommodation. In the administration of this Agreement, the Company and the Union will provide reasonable accommodations to qualified employees with a disability and to employees based upon their sincerely held religious tenets. Any employee who seeks such an accommodation must inform the Company, in writing, describe the requested accommodation and cooperate with the Company and the Union in seeking to identify reasonable alternatives. The need for and extent of such accommodations shall be determined by the Company in accordance with its interpretation of the requirements of the American with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, even if such accommodations may be in conflict with another provision of this Agreement. However, in the event a reasonable accommodation may necessitate the modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, the Company and the Union will meet to discuss same.

Killer
SPC

Promotional bids will be allowed on a plant-wide basis. Non-promotional bids, (bids to the regular/non-probationary rate and shift bids) will be allowed on a plant-wide basis until twenty (20) bids have been offered. A minimum of ten (10) bids shall be from one shift to the other and the remainder limited to the same shift bid per calendar quarter.
When a job becomes available, the supervisor will notify the Union Plant Coordinator and/or Chief Stewards and provide him/her with the job posting. Any employee wishing to bid for such job shall write his/her name on the notice within two (2) working days. At the end of the two (2) working days, the notice will be removed and the senior bidder shall be assigned the vacancy if qualified to perform the work according to existing requirements and in comparison to other employees performing the same job, or if capable of learning to perform it within five (5) working days, such times which may be extended by mutual agreement, in extreme cases.
However, in cases of bids to Group Leader, Maintenance Helper, or Operator Helper in Protein Conversion and Trainers, the Company has the right to
9
Foster Farms CBA_Expires_7-30-2019 4/23/15 3:03 ftM Page 10
exercise final judgment after giving due regard to seniority. No employee will be entitled to more than one successful bid in any six (6) month period, unless their job is eliminated by the Company. No employee may bid any job until they have nine (9) or more month’s continuous service.
Once the successful bidder has been identified, the Union Plant Coordinator will be notified and name of the employee awarded the bid shall be posted.
The successful bidder will be moved to bided job within four (4) weeks from the date the bid was posted. If the successful bidder is later disqualified by the Company, they shall be returned to their old job and cannot bid again for three (3) months.
Section 8.05 Until the employee is on the bid job, the Company may designate the least senior qualified employee to temporarily fill the job.
Section 8.06 If no employee is selected, the Company has the right to hire from the outside.
Section 8.07 Nothing herein shall prohibit the Company from rotating employees to different jobs on a temporary basis or to satisfy the requirements of the Company’s O.S.H.A. Agreement and/or Alternate Duty Program.
Section 8.08	Overtime, extra work or temporary assignment will be given
to the senior, qualified available volunteer from that department. If there are no volunteers, the Company will assign the junior available employee from that department. If the entire department is not needed for overtime or extra work, employees temporarily assigned to the department will be released before overtime or extra work is given.
Section 8.09 The principle of seniority for all employees shall prevail on a plant-wide basis in regard to transfer, promotion and demotion, assuming the employee is qualified to perform the work.
The principle of departmental seniority shall prevail in regard to lay off and rehire. The Union recognizes that due to the nature of the Company’s business, various departments may be laid off (not to exceed seven (7) days) in order of completion of processing and recalled in the order of business resumption.
In such cases, employees shall be recalled on departmental assignment. Notwithstanding the above, lay-offs which are anticipated to be in excess of seven (7) days will be done on a plant-wide seniority basis, provided the retained employees have the ability to perform the work.
Section 8.10 The company shall furnish the Union, monthly, an up-to-date list of employees showing first name, middle name, last name, social security
10

number, seniority unit, department, job classification, seniority date, hire date, date of birth, rate of pay, home address, including zip code, and home telephone number.
ARTICLE 9	• GRIEVANCE & ARBITRATION
Section 9.01 The aggrieved employee or employees or the Union, may present the grievance to the Supervisor and if necessary to the Shift Manager within five (5) days of occurrence. A union steward may assist the aggrieved employee in presenting grievances. The Company will answer within five (5) days. Every reasonable effort shall be made to settle the grievance at this level.
Section 9.02 If satisfactory adjustment of the matter is not made by virtue of this meeting, the complaint may be presented in the form of a written grievance within five (5) days following the meeting, to the Human Resources Supervisor, who shall render a decision in writing within the five (5) days thereafter.
Section 9.03 In the event the decision at the second step shall not be satisfactory to the Union, it shall within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such written decision, have the right to submit the matter in writing to the Complex Human Resources Manager. A decision shall be rendered in writing to the Union, unless such fifteen (15) day period is extended by mutual consent.
The Union Representative may be involved at any step of the grievance procedure.
Section 9.04 If the parties remain in disagreement at the conclusion of the foregoing steps and the Union desires to submit the dispute to arbitration; it will so notify the Division Human Resources Manager in writing within thirty (30) days from the date of the decision of the Plant Manager and Division Human Resources Manager. Within five (5) days, the parties shall either by mutual agreement select an arbitrator or request the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to submit a list of seven (7) arbitrators. Upon receipt of the list of arbitrators, the Union and the Company shall within twenty (20) days, eliminate from the list six (6) names by each alternately eliminating one name. The parties shall use the toss of a coin to determine which party strikes the first name. The last remaining name shall then become the sole arbitrator. The arbitrator, when so selected, shall proceed as soon as practicable to hold a hearing, and examine into and render a decision on the matter at issue.
No more than one grievance may be presented to the same arbitrator at the same time except by mutual consent of the parties. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties.
