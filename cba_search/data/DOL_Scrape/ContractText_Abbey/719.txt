BUILDING OWNERSAND MANAGERS ASSOCIATION OF CHICAGO
AND
SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1 AFL - CIO JANITORIAL EMPLOYEES
April 7, 2003 through April 9, 2006
THIS AGREEMENT, entered into by BUILDING OWNERS AND MANAGERS ASSOCIATION OF CHICAGO, (thereafter designated as the "Association”) on behalf of such of its member buildings as are listed in Schedule "A" attached hereto, and SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, Local 1, AFL-CIO (hereafter designated as the "Union") covers wages, hours and working conditions for janitorial employees and working supervisors who are now or may hereafter be represented by said Union (hereafter designated as "employees") and who are now or may be employed by such members of the Association as now are or who may hereafter become parties hereto (hereafter designated as "Employers").
ARTICLE I	BARGAINING UNIT
The Employers recognize the Union as the sole and exclusive representative of the janitorial employees and working supervisors employed in the buildings which are now or may hereafter be covered by this agreement. Employers and employees shall not bargain independently of the Union with respect to wages, hours of employment or working conditions as provided in this Agreement; the right to bargain on behalf of all such employees is vested solely in the Union. All bargaining unit work, which the Employer controls, and which is performed within a building which is covered by this Agreement, shall be performed solely by employees within the bargaining unit set for in this Agreement.
ARTICLE II	UNION MEMBERSHIP, EMPLOYER RIGHTS AND CHECK OFF
Section 1.	The right to employ and discharge for just cause shall be vested solely in the Employer. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as stipulating the number of employees to be employed by any building or as restricting the right of the Employer to adjust employee work assignments and/or reduce the working force to reflect changes in cleaning specifications and occupancy within the building and/or to accomplish legitimate operating efficiencies; provided, however, that the Employer shall not reduce the number of employees without prior written 10 day notice to the Union. If the Union believes that the changes or adjustments have resulted in the imposition of unreasonable work loads upon employees, it may file a grievance which shall be processed in accordance with Article XIX of this Agreement.
Section 2.	The Employer agrees not to discriminate against members of the Union nor to engage in unfair labor practices. On and after the thirty-first day following the execution of this Agreement, all employees who are then members of the Union, shall as a condition of employment, remain members of the Union in good standing for the duration of this Agreement. All present employees who are not members of the Union and all employees employed after the date of this Agreement by employers covered by this Agreement shall, within 31 days after the date of their employment or the execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, become members of the Union (unless they are already members) and all such employees shall, as a condition of their employment, remain members of the Union in good standing for the duration of this Agreement. The term member or members in good standing shall be
1
BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
limited to the payment of the initiation fees and dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership and shall be a financial obligation only.
Section 3.	The Employer agrees to deduct in the first month of each quarter, (and prior to the 20th day of such month) from the pay of every employee, who has executed and caused to be delivered to the Employer a written assignment, the regular quarterly dues and the initiation fee of the Union, if due and owing, which are necessary to keep such employee as a member in good standing in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws of the Union, as certified to the Employer by the Union. Where the employee, who is on check off, has insufficient earnings during the first month of the quarter, the deductions shall be made by the employer from the next wage payment in accordance with billings furnished by the Union.
The Employer will submit such sums in total to the Secretary-Treasurer of Local 1 no later than ten (10) days after such deduction was made. Where the employee, who is on check-off, has insufficient earnings during the first pay period in the month, the deductions shall be made by the Employer from the next wage payment in accordance with billings furnished by the Union. With each monthly check-off record, the Employer shall give the names, social security numbers and starting dates of all employees of the Employer who performed janitorial services in the building during the preceding month including, where known, their status as temporary, extra, substitute, or regular employees.
The Employer agrees that such deductions shall constitute Trust Funds and will be forwarded by the Employer to the Union within ten (10) days after such deduction is made. Any employer who, without a bona fide reason, intentionally fails to remit such deductions within thirty (30) days on two (2) occasions within any twelve (12) month period shall, in the event of any subsequent failure, be required to pay in addition to the delinquent amount, interest at the rate of two percent (2%) per month thereon, and liquidated damages at the rate of five percent (5%) per month thereon, as well as all costs incurred by the Union in recovering such delinquent amounts, including attorney and auditor fees and court costs.
The Union agrees to indemnify and save the Employer harmless from any liability incurred by reason of such deductions.
Section 4.	The Employer shall discharge an employee for non-payment of Union initiation fees or dues within ten (10) days after the Employer’s receipt of written notice from the Union that such employee is not in good standing. Said notice shall state that the employee has previously been given fifteen (15) days’ written notice: (a) of the delinquency; (b) the amount and method of computation thereof; (c) that the employee is not in good standing; and (d) that discharge will result at the end of said fifteen (15) day period unless all arrears are paid. The Union will indemnify, defend and hold the Employer harmless against all liability, damages, claims and costs incurred by the Employer, including but not limited to court costs, judgments and attorney fees and expenses, by reason of the Employer’s compliance with this Section. The Union reserves the right, at its option and at its own expense, to appear and defend all such claims whenever suit is brought against the Employer. Employee protests of discharge for alleged non-payment of Union initiation fees or dues will not be subject to the grievance procedure or arbitration.
ARTICLE HI DISCHARGE AND DISCIPLINE
Section 1.	Except as otherwise provided by this Agreement, no employee may be discharged, suspended, disciplined or otherwise penalized without just cause. The Employer agrees that all discipline should be progressive, absent compelling circumstances warranting immediate termination or acceleration of disciplinary penalties.
Section 2.	In cases where the Employer believes that an employee's job performance has become
2
BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
unsatisfactory, such as when an employee is believed to be careless or excessively absent or tardy, the Employer will notify the Union, in writing, of such belief and the Union and the Employer shall cooperate in investigating the matters and taking corrective measures, if warranted. If the Employer contemplates severe disciplinary action beyond a reprimand, then the Employer will notify the Union in writing of such belief and the Union will promptly acknowledge, in writing, receipt of such notice. The Union need not acknowledge receipt of simple warnings or reprimands in which the Employer does not state that severe disciplinary action is contemplated. No warnings or reprimands shall be considered for purposes of disciplinary action after twenty-four (24) months from the date of the warning or reprimand.

The Union agrees to file with the Association a copy of each written and summary of each oral collective bargaining agreement it enters into with any other employer or group of employers employing employees in commercial office buildings in the above described Chicago central area within thirty (30) calendar days following the consummation of said agreements.

Each employee covered by this Agreement who has completed one (1) or more full years of service with the Employer shall, in each year of employment, receive one (1) personal holiday on a day mutually acceptable to the Employer and the employee.
If any employee’s birthday falls on one of the other holidays observed in this Agreement, the employee shall be paid for both holidays. If an employee’s birthday falls on February 29th, he or she shall be regarded as having a birthdate of February 28th in every year except leap year.
Section 2, Each regular employee shall be credited with the normal number of hours at straight time in his or her shift on each of such holidays and, in the case of those holidays which fall on what would have been Ihe employee's regular workday, such time shall be credited as time worked in computing overtime.
Section 3.	When a holiday falls on an employee’s day off, he or she shall be credited with eight (8) hours at straight time (four (4) hours in the case of one-half day holidays). For employees who regularly work less than forty (40) hours per week, the credited hours shall be the number of hours of the employee’s regular daily shift, excluding Saturdays or short hour shifts; one-half that number in the case of one-half day holidays.
Section 4.	Employees required to work on holidays shall be paid extra for such hours worked at one and one-half times their regular hourly rate, in addition to the holiday pay. The Employer may schedule regular night shifts either at the beginning or end (but not both) of a calendar day designated as a holiday. Employees working on one of these regular shifts will not be considered to be working on a holiday even if some of the hours worked happen to fall on the calendar day of the holiday. Night shift employees working a regular night shift which is at the beginning of the calendar holiday will be deemed to celebrate their holiday at the end of that day, and vice versa.
Section 5.	To be eligible to receive holiday pay, the employee must have been employed by the Employer for at least ninety (90) calendar days prior to the holiday and worked all of his or her scheduled hours on the employee’s last scheduled work day before and the employee’s next scheduled work day following the holiday, provided that tardiness of up to one hour or leaving work early (with the approval of the Employer) on either of such days shall not disqualify the employee from receiving holiday pay. Employees on approved leaves of absence or layoff who are otherwise eligible to receive holiday pay shall, upon their return to work, receive holiday pay for holidays occurring within ninety (90) days following their last previous day worked. Employees substituting for employees on approved leaves of absence shall not be eligible to receive holiday pay for the first ninety (90) days of said leaves of absence.
Section 6.	Any employee who habitually takes an extra day off in connection with the holidays provides for in this Article for reasons obviously not justified, shall be subject to a warning or reprimand, and thereafter to progressive discipline by the Employer.
7
BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
Section 7.	The Union will, through its usual forms of communication and its stewards, urge all employee’s to provide the Employer with not less than two (2) calendar week’s advance notice of the date upon which the employee’s birthday falls.
Section 8.	If a regular pay day falls on a holiday, employees shall be paid on the day before the holiday and paychecks shall be dated accordingly.

Section 3.	Service shall be deemed continuous notwithstanding leaves of absence for sickness, maternity or other reasons agreed to by the Employer.
Section 4.	A week’s vacation shall be computed upon the employee’s regularly scheduled weekly hours of work for the fifty-two (52) weeks preceding his or her vacation. If an employee has worked less than fifty-two (52) weeks, such vacation shall be based upon the scheduled hours during the total number of weeks the employee has worked.
Section 5.	Vacation accrual shall be given to a regular employee so long as such employee is carried on the payroll of the Employer (even though no compensation is paid). No vacation accrual is to be credited to a temporary, extra, substitute, floater or vacation replacement employee; provided, however that any temporary, extra, substitute, floater or vacation replacement employee who has been employed either by the Employer or by the janitorial contractor performing bargaining unit work for the Employer for more than twelve (12) consecutive months shall be eligible to receive vacation benefits. Vacation accrual for such temporary, extra, substitute, floater or vacation replacement employee begins only at such time as the regular employee is dropped from the payroll or after twelve (12) consecutive months of employment by the Employer or by the janitorial contractor performing bargaining unit work for the Employer, whichever occurs first. An employee who is absent for 180 days or more shall not be eligible for paid vacation until he/she has returned to active employment for at least 90 days, unless the employee is permanently disabled.
Section 6.	Vacation rights of employees shall not be affected by a change of ownership or management of the building so long as they remain in the employ of the new owners or managers. Any employee employed by a contractor whose employment is terminated by reason of change of contractors during the employee’s first year of employment in a building and who is retained in the same building by the new contractor shall, upon completion of his or her full first year of employment in the building, be entitled to a full vacation with pay from the new contractor, less any vacation pay which may have been
8
BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
received by the employee from the displaced contractor.
Section 7.	For vacation scheduling purposes, an employee shall receive his or her vacation in accordance with seniority and in keeping with the normal vacation scheduling of the building or at such other time as may be mutually acceptable to the Employer and the employee.
Section 8.	Vacation checks shall be paid to the employee no later than the last scheduled day of work before the beginning of the employee’s scheduled vacation.
Section 9.	Each regular employee shall be credited with the normal number of hours at straight time in his or her shift on each of such vacation days and, in the case of those vacation days which fall on what would have been the employee’s regular workday, such time shall be credited as time worked in computing overtime.
Employees required to work on scheduled vacation day(s) shall be paid for hours worked on such day(s) at one and one-half times their regular hourly rate in addition to vacation pay; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply if the Employer and employee agree to reschedule the previously scheduled vacation day(s).
ARTICLE IX	TERMINATION-VACATION ACCRUAL-FINAL PAYCHECK
Section 1.	Any employee who has been in the service of an Employer for more than one year and whose employment is terminated for any reason, shall be compensated on a pro rata basis, taking into account the employee’s accrued vacation, if any, and the period worked since the first or anniversary date of employment compared with the vacation to which the employee would be entitled if the employee worked the entire year.
Section 2.	Any employee shall receive his or her final paycheck in full at the time of separation, if possible, but in any case within five (5) days or at the next regular payday, whichever comes first.

In the event the employee is unable to attend the funeral, the employee shall be allowed one day at straight time.

ARTICLE XI	WORKING CONDITIONS

The Employer shall furnish rubbers to employees whose duties regularly require them to walk in water. If uniforms are furnished by the Employer, the Employer shall also furnish appropriate outdoor garments for snow removal or other outdoor work.

For the period July 1, 2005 through April 9, 2006, the Employer shall contribute the amount of $395.20 (three hundred ninety-five dollars and twenty cents) each month on behalf of each employee on its active payroll to the Local 25 S.E.LU. Welfare Fund; provided, however, that the Employers’ contributions shall be prorated for those months in which employees begin working, cease their employment and/or remain on medical or personal leaves of absence for periods in excess of those specified in Article XVII, Sections 1 and 2 and Section 6 of this Article, respectively; and provided, further, that in the event the Fund’s benefit consultants advise the Fund’s trustees on or before July 1, 2005 of their opinion that the Fund’s benefit payment reserves can be maintained at six (6) months or greater during the period ending June 30,2006 with a monthly contribution rate between $377.85 (three hundred seventy-seven dollars and eighty-five cents) and $395.20 and the trustees accept their benefit consultant’s opinion, the July 1, 2005 monthly contribution rate shall be reduced to such amount and, effective May 30, 2005, the difference between the amount of such monthly contribution rate and $395.20 shall be diverted to increase the wages of bargaining unit employees, with each $1.73 of monthly contribution rate reduction below $395.20 deemed equivalent to $.01 in increased wages up to $.10 (ten cents) per hour.

BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
Section 7.	Pension fund payments shall be continued on eligible employees when said employees are on a medical leave of absence up to the periods provided for in Article XVII, Section 1, or beyond that period for special reasons agreed to by the Employer and the Union. Pension fund payments shall be continued on eligible employees when said employees are on a personal leave of absence up to a period of ninety (90) days, or beyond that period for special reason agreed to by the Employer and the Union.
Beyond that time, the Pension Fund payment shall be made for and on behalf of the temporary, extra, substitute, floater or vacation replacement employee, but in no event shall contributions be made for both the eligible employee and the temporary, extra, substitute, floater or vacation replacement employee; provided, however, that any temporary, extra, substitute, floater or vacation replacement employee who has been employed either by the Employer or by the janitorial contractor performing bargaining unit work for the Employer for more than twelve (12) consecutive months shall have contributions made on his/her behalf.
ARTICLE XV HEALTH AND WELFARE - PENSION DELINQUENCIES
Section 1.	The Employers recognize the necessity of making prompt Health and Welfare and Pension contributions to preserve the benefit standing of employees and ensure adequate funding of benefits. If an Employer remains delinquent in making payments to either the Welfare Fund or the appropriate Pension Trust for a period of 10 days after written notice of delinquency is given to the building and the Association, or refuses to produce payroll records in accordance with the payroll audit provisions of the Trustees’ collection policy, the Union may strike the building to enforce such payments or production of records without regard to the no-strike clause in Article XVIII or the grievance and arbitration procedure provided in Article XIX. The delinquent Employer shall also be responsible for reimbursement to employees of wages lost because of any strike action taken by the Union under this Article.
Section 2.	If the Trustees do not receive full amount of the Employer’s required Welfare Fund or Pension Trust contribution and the accompanying remittance form by the dates set forth in Article XIII, Section 7 and Article XIV, Section 4 with respect to which contributions are due, the Employer will be required to pay, in addition to the amount of such contribution, interest and liquidated damages at the rates specified in the Trust Agreements on the unpaid amount, as well as accountants’ and attorneys’ fees and court costs, if any, incurred in effecting collection. The Employer acknowledges receipt of the Trust Agreements and represents to the Union and the Funds that it has read the interest and liquidated damages provisions and that the liquidated damages provision is a reasonable approximation of damages to the Funds which are difficult to ascertain. Employer further acknowledges that any right of the Trustees to waive interest or liquidated damages pursuant to the collection policy described in Section 3, below, shall not modify the Employer’s agreement that the maximum liquidated damages specified in the Trust are reasonable approximation of actual damages under all circumstances where the Employer is delinquent.
Section 3.	Employer acknowledges that the Trustees of the Funds have the Fiduciary obligation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) to ensure prompt collection of Employer contributions and the resolution of delinquencies through the use of payroll audits and other enforcement procedures. Accordingly, the Employer hereby irrevocably designates as its representatives the Trustees named Employer Trustees of the Funds and their successors in connection with the adoption, amendment and administration of a collection policy setting forth payroll audit and collection procedures in accordance with the terms and conditions of ERISA prohibited transaction class exemption 76-1. Employer hereby consents to and agrees to be bound by the provisions of such collection policy, as amended, as though fully set forth in this Agreement.

BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
ARTICLE XVI SENIORITY
Section 1. The term “seniority” shall mean the length of service of a regular employee in a building; provided that new employees shall be considered probationary employees for the first 45 calendar days of employment. During their probationary period, employees shall have no seniority and may be laid off or terminated at the sole discretion of the Employer and such action shall not be subject to the grievance procedure of this Agreement. An employee’s seniority rights shall not be affected by a change of ownership or management of the building so long as said employee remains in the employ of the new owners or managers. The Employer agrees to notify the Union, in writing, promptly upon the consummation of any change in the ownership or management of the building. Seniority shall not be broken except by discharge for cause, resignation or layoff for more than one year (two years in the case of employees with ten or more years of service). The Employer shall post a seniority list in each building in a place accessible to all employees. Said list shall contain the names of all employees who have seniority as provided for herein and their respective seniority date; and shall be updated quarterly including a date prior to vacation scheduling. A copy of the seniority list shall be made available to the Union upon request.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict the Employer’s right to temporarily assign employees among two or more buildings covered by collective bargaining agreements with the Union to which the same employer is signatory; provided, that such temporary assignments shall have no effect upon the employee’s seniority, and employees shall, during the period of such temporary assignments, continue to retain and accrue seniority and benefit eligibility as if they had not been temporarily assigned; provided further that such temporary assignment shall not be used for vacation replacement purposes during the months of May through September.
Section 2. When it becomes necessary to reduce the working force, the last person hired shall be laid off first provided the employees to be retained have the ability to be trained to perform the available work; and if the working force thereafter be increased, employees with seniority shall be recalled in the reverse order in which they were laid off, subject to the employee’s qualifications to perform the work for which they are being recalled. The Employer shall give not less than one (1) week’s notice of recall in writing to the employee’s last known address. A failure to report for work prior to expiration of such notice period shall result in the loss of all seniority rights under this Agreement. No notice of recall need be given in cases where the Employer and the Union agree to waive notice because it is apparent to them the particular employee will not return.
Section 3. Whenever a vacancy occurs in any job covered by this Agreement, said job shall be posted for bidding in a conspicuous place and all employees may apply for the job. The posting shall contain a full description of the job duties, starting time and rate of pay. Seniority shall be the governing factor in filling the vacancy provided the employee has the ability to be trained to perform the job. For any vacancy not filled pursuant to the foregoing posting procedure, the Employer shall offer the position to qualified replacement employees who are then working in the Employer’s building before hiring new employees to fill the vacancy.
Section 4.	Selection and preference as to the time of taking vacations shall be granted to employees on the basis of seniority, except that a building may depart from seniority in vacation scheduling where it is required in order to maintain normal operations of the building, in which event the Union shall be notified as soon as possible of the departure from seniority.
Section 5.	Union stewards shall have super-seniority for purposes of layoff and recall under Section 2 of this Article.
15
BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
ARTICLE XVII LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Section 1.	The Employer shall grant a leave of absence in writing because of illness or disability, substantiated by medical approval, upon the following schedule: under one year seniority, no leave; one year to three year’s seniority, six months’ leave; three years to five year’s seniority, nine months’ leave; after five years seniority, one year leave. By agreement between the Employer and the Union, employment of an employee on such leave of absence may be terminated. Upon return from such leaves, the employee shall return to the assignment previously being performed by the employee or in the event such assignment no longer exists, a substantially comparable position.
Section 2.	The Employer shall not unreasonably withhold the granting of a personal leave of absence submitted in writing for reasons other than illness or disability of up to fourteen (14) days after two (2) years and up to ninety (90) days after five (5) years of seniority. The Employer shall not be required to grant a personal leave of absence until after twenty-one (21) months have expired since an employee’s previous personal leave of absence. Failure to return to work without justifiable cause following a personal leave of absence will be grounds for termination.
Section 3.	An employee selected to represent the Union at conventions, conferences, collective bargaining, grievance and arbitration proceedings or for other Union business shall be granted a leave of absence for the period required to fully carry out said business.
Section 4.	During all such leaves of absence provided for in this Article, seniority shall continue to accumulate and accrue. By agreement between the Employer and the Union, employment of an employee on such leave of absence may be terminated.
Section 5.	The provisions of the Family Medical Leave Act, where more favorable, shall supercede the provisions of this Article.
ARTICLE XVHI STRIKES, LOCKOUTS, PICKETING
Section 1.	During the term of this Agreement, there shall be no strikes, lockouts or picketing, nor shall there be any demonstrations or rallies of any kind inside any building, nor shall there be any handout or distribution of handbills or leaflets of any kind in any areas of the buildings, except janitorial break rooms, without the Employer’s consent.
Section 2.	No action or suit of any kind or description shall lie by the Association or any member thereof against the Union, or any officers, representative or agent thereof, because of a strike, work stoppage or picketing in violation of this Agreement if:
(a)	The Union has not authorized or instigated the strike, work stoppage or picketing,
(b)	The Union promptly denounces such strike, work stoppage or picketing and makes an earnest effort to terminate the same within a period of five days.
Section 3.	Refusal of any employee to cross a picket line established or maintained by a recognized labor organization shall not be grounds for discharge or disciplinary action.

Section 1.	The procedure for handling a grievance pertaining to any difference or dispute which may arise under this Agreement shall be as follows:
16
BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
STEP I
The aggrieved employee, accompanied by the steward, if the employee desires, shall consult with the employee’s foreman or immediate supervisor. If a group of employees are involved in the grievance, the steward shall represent the employees. In any event, since it is in the best interest of all concerned that a grievance be promptly and expeditiously resolved, an aggrieved employee and/or the steward of the employee or employees involved, shall present such grievance as soon as reasonably possible following the event which gives rise to its occurrence, or after such employee and/or the steward of the employee or employees involved first acquired knowledge concerning such event.
STEP II
If the matter is not settled in the first step and the Union wishes to further pursue it, the grievance shall be reduced to writing and presented to the building manager and, where applicable, the contractor within thirty (30) calendar days following the event which gave rise to its occurrence or after the employee or employees involved first acquired knowledge concerning such event. The foreman or immediate supervisor, together with the aggrieved employee, the steward, and a Union Representative shall discuss the grievance with the building manager and the contractor. The building manager or contractor shall give his or her written answer within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt of the written grievance.
STEP III
If the matter is not settled in the second step and the Union wishes to further pursue it, the Union shall, within fifteen (15) calendar days following its receipt of the building manager’s or contractor’s written answer, present the Association with a written request that the grievance be referred to a Labor-Management Committee comprised of three members of the Association’s Labor Relations Committee and three representatives of the Union, which shall meet once each month at an established time and place. The Labor-Management Committee shall meet with the grievant (if requested by the Union), the building manager and, where applicable, the contractor and endeavor to resolve the matter in a way acceptable to the Association and the Union.
Unreasonable Workload Grievances. If they are not resolved in Step II within seven (7) calendar days following their presentation, grievances protesting disciplinary action because of failure to perform assigned work which allege that such failure was caused by the imposition of an unreasonable work load in violation of Article XI, Section 7 may be appealed by the Union to a Special Workload Committee comprised of two members of the Association’s Labor Relations Committee and two representatives of the Union. The Special Workload Committee shall meet promptly with the grievant, the building manager and, where applicable, the contractor and endeavor to resolve the matter in a way acceptable to the Association and the Union. If the Special Workload Committee does not resolve the grievance at this meeting, the Union may demand that the matter be arbitrated, in the manner set forth in Section 2 of this Article.
Section 2.	If the matter is not resolved in the third step and the Union wishes to further pursue it, the Union shall, within thirty calendar (30) days after the grievance was advanced to the third step, serve a written demand for arbitration upon the Employer or, where applicable, the contractor. The grievance shall thereafter be submitted to an arbitrator who shall be selected by mutual agreement of the Employer or, where applicable, the contractor and the Union from the following panel (which may be added to hereafter upon agreement of the parties);

Section 3.	The award or decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon the Employer and employee(s) involved, and the Union. The arbitrator shall not have the authority to add to, subtract from or alter the provisions of this Agreement.
Section 4,	If any Employer who is a party to this Agreement refuses to abide by an arbitration award made under this Article or refuses to abide by a written decision signed by representatives of the Employer and the Union which resolves any difference or dispute arising under this Agreement, the Union shall be relieved from the obligation of Article XVIII as to such Employer.
Section 5.	Grievances which are not presented or appealed within the time limits set forth in Sections 1 and 2 shall be considered withdrawn and abandoned. If there is not a timely answer to a grievance by the building manager or contractor in the second step of the grievance procedure, the grievance shall be automatically advanced to the third step.
ARTICLE XX	JOINT COMMITTEE ON SAFETY AND SECURITY
The Employer and the Union share a concern for the personal safety of janitorial employees during their work time in the buildings and in their travel to and from their work. Accordingly, a Joint Committee on Safety and Security is established consisting of three (3) members from the Union and three (3) members from the Association.

18
BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT
If the Employer shall, during the life of this Agreement, contract for all or any part of the work being performed by employees in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, it shall include in its agreement with the contractor a provision binding the contractor to observe the economic terms and conditions of this Agreement such as wages, hours and fringe benefits, and the making of reasonable arrangements to guarantee the payment of contributions due by such contractor to the Health & Welfare and Pension Funds.

19
BOMA/CHICAGO - LOCAL 1 - 2003 JANITORIAL AGREEMENT

ARTICLE XXVI	MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

In the event agreement thereon cannot be reached within 30 days, either party may submit the matter to arbitration as herein provided.
Section 3.	This Agreement shall be construed as divisible as to each building and the failure of any building to abide by the terms hereof shall not operate to terminate this Agreement as to any other building.

Section 4.	Neither the Employer nor the Union will discriminate against applicants or employees with regard to employment, tenure or any other term or condition of employment in violation of any applicable law. Employees and management representatives will be treated with respect and dignity by all parties to this Agreement.
Section 5.

LETTER OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN BUILDING OWNERS AND MANAGERS ASSOCIATION OF CHICAGO AND
SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1, AFL-CIO JANITORIAL EMPLOYEES
This Letter of Agreement is made and entered into this_day of, 2003, by and
between BUILDING MANAGERS ASSOCIATION OF CHICAGO ("BOMA/Chicago”) and SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 1, AFL-CIO ("Local 1”).
BOMA/Chicago and Local 1 are parties to a collective bargaining agreement effective April 7, 2003 through April 9, 2006, covering janitorial employees employed by certain member buildings of BOMA/Chicago (the "Janitorial Agreement”). By this Letter of Agreement BOMA/Chicago and Local 1 acknowledge their understandings and agreements, reached during the course of negotiations, regarding the interpretation and application of the agreed-upon amendment to Article XXI of the Janitorial Agreement providing that an Employer’s chosen contractor "shall have the right to establish and apply reasonable employment criteria and decline to employ any individual who fails to meet such criteria.”
BOMA/Chicago and Local 1 agreed that in those situations where the chosen contractor seeks to employ background checks to screen existing employees in the building, it may do so only if the background checks are requested by the building owner or manager and the Union is notified before the background checks are implemented. In addition, they agreed that if any employee is terminated as a result of such background checks, his or her termination will be subject to the grievance procedure.
Finally, BOMA/Chicago and Local 1 agreed that, while drug testing would be considered a reasonable criterion for initial employment under Article XXI, nothing contained therein would be deemed to permit the contractor to utilize recurring drug testing thereafter.
