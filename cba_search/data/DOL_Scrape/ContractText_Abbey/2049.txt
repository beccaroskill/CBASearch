A document shall be considered to be “received” when it is hand delivered to the Union steward or when it arrives by United States certified mail and the Union or Employer’s designated representative signs for the return receipt.
Section 5.6	- Step 4: Binding Arbitration
a.	If the grievance is not resolved at Step 3, the Union may send written notice to the Executive Director/designee that it is submitting the matter to final and binding arbitration. The written notice to the Executive Director must be sent within seven calendar days following receipt of the Step 3 response.
b.	Within seven days of the Step 3 response, the Union also shall submit a written request for a list of seven arbitrators from the California State Mediation and
10
Conciliation Service, simultaneously sending a copy of that written request to the Executive Director. The Union and a representative of the Employer shall select the arbitrator from the list by alternately striking names from the list until one name remains. A coin toss shall determine who shall strike the first name from the list. The one remaining name shall be deemed the mutually selected arbitrator. The process of striking names shall occur within fourteen calendar days of the receipt of the list by both parties.
c.	Once the arbitrator has been selected, hearings shall commence at the convenience of the arbitrator. Hearings shall be confined to Mondays through Fridays unless mutually agreed otherwise.
d.	After the Union has timely requested arbitration of the grievance at Step 4, the grievant or the Employer may request that the grievance be submitted to mediation. Upon receipt of the request of either party for mediation, the parties shall request the services of a mediator from the State Mediation & Conciliation Service. The mediator shall attempt to resolve the grievance by exploring settlement options with the parties, although such settlement options shall not be binding on the parties unless mutually agreeable.
e.	If any question arises as to the arbitrability of the grievance, the question shall first be presented to the arbitrator for resolution. When scheduling with the arbitrator, the parties shall schedule the number of days needed to hear the merits of the case, plus one day for the presentation of evidence and arguments on arbitrability. The parties shall request a bench decision on arbitrability before proceeding to evidence and argument on the merits of the case. In any case, in rendering a decision, the arbitrator shall first rule on arbitrability and then, provided the grievance is arbitrable, on the merits of the case. Upon mutual agreement, the parties may submit written briefs on arbitrability and request the arbitrator to issue a decision before proceeding to the merits of the grievance, thereby avoiding the extra day of hearing.
f.	The arbitrator shall have no authority to add to, subtract from or modify the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitrator shall interpret this Agreement in accordance with accepted standards of contract interpretation.
g.	The arbitrator will be without power or authority to make any decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by law, is contrary to the direction given to the Employer by any regulatory or administrative agency having licensing authority over the Employer, or is violative of the terms of the Agreement.
h.	The arbitrator’s decision will be in writing and will set forth the arbitrator’s findings of fact, reasonings and conclusions of the issues submitted. The arbitrator’s decision, absent sufficient grounds for vacation as provided by law, shall be final and binding on both parties.
i.	After rendering a decision, the arbitrator shall retain jurisdiction in the event the parties have a dispute over implementation of the ordered remedy.
j.	The costs for the arbitrator and court reporter (if any) will be borne equally by the Employer and the Union. Each side shall pay the cost of presenting its own case to the arbitrator.
11
k.	If the discharge of an employee results from conduct relating to a client, and the client does not appear at the arbitration, written statements attributed to the pertinent client may be given due consideration as if the client testified at the hearing.
Section 5.7	- Termination
In the event of a termination, the parties agree to waive Steps 1 (Informal Resolution) and 2 (Human Resources) of the grievance procedure. Within seven calendar days of the notice to the grievant of the termination, the grievant (or the Union on behalf of the grievant) may submit a formal written grievance to the Executive Director at Step 3 of the grievance procedure. If the grievance is not resolved at Step 3, the Union may timely pursue the grievance to Step 4.
Section 5.8	- General
a.	The parties agree that the time limits specified in each of the steps will be considered to be the maximum allowable and every effort should be made to expedite the process. The time limits specified may, however, be extended by mutual, written agreement.
b.	If the grievant or the Union misses a time limit, the grievance shall be considered resolved on the basis of the Employer's response at the previous step. If the Employer misses a time limit, the grievance shall be automatically moved to the next step of the procedure.
c.	A unit member shall have the right to pursue a grievance through Step 3 without the intervention of the Union, provided that any adjustment is consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Union shall be notified of the adjustment of any non-disciplinary grievance and any disciplinary grievance unless the grievant requests that the grievance remain confidential. Grievances that are confidentially adjusted under this section shall have no precedential affect.

Section 8.4	- Accrual Limit
When a bargaining unit member accrues the full annual PTO credit, consistent with the chart in Section 8.2, the bargaining unit member will not accrue any additional PTO until the bargaining unit member uses part of the accrued leave. If the employee is denied time off after a timely request for time off has been made, as defined in Section 8.5 (e), and the denial of time off will result in a loss of accrual of PTO, the employer will cash out PTO in eight (8) hour increments such that the employee’s PTO will remain below the maximum limit. When some PTO is used, PTO will again begin to accrue to the bargaining unit member’s maximum annual limit only. No retroactive credit will be given for the time when accrued personal leave was at the cap.
17
Section 8.5	- Usage
a)	When a bargaining unit member is ill, the bargaining unit member must telephone his/her supervisor or designee no less than one hour prior to the scheduled start time on the first day missed due to illness and each day of absence thereafter. The supervisor enters that PTO for the employee into the electronic timesheet.
b)	In the event a bargaining unit member cannot perform the basic functions of his/her job due to apparent illness or injury, the Employer may require the bargaining unit member to take PTO or leave without pay (at the bargaining unit member’s option) to recover.
c)	Except in the event of illness, PTO will be taken at a time mutually convenient to the bargaining unit member and the Employer. All requests shall be submitted through the electronic timesheet to the bargaining unit member’s supervisor; approval must be confirmed on the electronic timesheet by the supervisor.
d)	In the event a bargaining unit member has scheduled PTO in sufficient amounts to keep below the accrual cap defined above, and the bargaining unit member is not able to take the scheduled PTO because of a work-related emergency, the bargaining unit member will be allowed to carry over the excess PTO for six months, or to cash it out at the end of the six months if not used.
e)	Bargaining unit members shall submit requests for extended vacation time off (of one work week or more) no later than fourteen days prior to the requested time off. This needs to be done through the electronic timesheet. The Employer will approve or deny the request through the electronic timesheet within three days. If the request is denied, the reason(s) shall be provided in writing to the worker.
f)	Bargaining unit members who are at the maximum accrual limit for PTO shall submit requests for time off no later than fourteen days prior to the requested time off. The Employer will approve or deny the request in writing within three days. If the request is denied, the reason(s) shall be provided in writing to the worker and the employer will cash out the requested PTO in accordance with Section 8.4.
g)	PTO must be used before requesting time off without pay.
Section 8.6	- Eligibility for Overtime
PTO shall not be considered time worked for purposes of eligibility for overtime.
Section 8.7	- Verification of Absence for Medical Reasons
18
a)	After any absence due to illness or injury, the bargaining unit member shall update the electronic timesheet denoting the PTO time taken, or ask the supervisor to do so.
b)	The Employer additionally reserves the right to require written verification by the bargaining unit member’s physician after the bargaining unit member has missed three (3) consecutively assigned work days. Such verification may be required whenever a bargaining unit member’s absence record shows chronic absenteeism or a pattern of absences or whenever the Employer has reason to believe that an absence may not be related to illness or injury.
c)	At its expense, the Employer may require a bargaining unit member to visit a physician selected by the Employer in order to receive a report on whether the bargaining unit member is medically able to perform the essential functions of his/her position. If the report concludes that the bargaining unit member’s condition does not warrant continued absence, the Employer or its designee, after giving notice to the bargaining unit member, may deny further paid leave.
d)	In the event the bargaining unit member’s doctor disagrees with the Employer’s doctor and the bargaining unit member wishes a third opinion, the two doctors will select a third doctor to examine the bargaining unit member and make the final decision. The Employer and the bargaining unit member will share the cost of the third examination.
Section 8.8	- Payoff
When a bargaining union member leaves employment, s/he will receive a payout of all accrued, unused PTO at the bargaining unit member’s then-current rate of pay.

Full-time bargaining unit members may take up to three (3) days of paid bereavement (this is separate from PTO) for the death of an immediate family member, as defined in the next paragraph. Any time beyond three (3) days will come from the employee’s PTO balance, if such time has been accrued. Otherwise, the time off will be unpaid.

A bargaining unit member on industrial leave has the option of integrating accumulated paid time off with bargaining unit members' compensation disability benefits so that the total the bargaining unit member receives is no more than a regular paycheck.

The change will be implemented by the payroll department as soon as reasonably possible following the request.
Section 14.4	- Temporary Modified Work Assignments
a.	Temporary, modified work assignments may be made by the Employer for qualified bargaining unit members who are not able to perform their regularly assigned duties due to industrial illness or injury. Because of the limited number of modified/alternative work assignments available, bargaining unit members will be assigned to such positions on a “first come, first served” basis to a position for which the bargaining unit member is qualified.
b.	Such assignments will be made consistent with the written recommendations of a licensed medical doctor. In the event that a modified/alternative work assignment cannot be accommodated by the Employer, the bargaining unit member will remain off work until either a modified/alternative work assignment can be offered or until the bargaining unit member is released to his/her regular work assignment.
c.	This section of the Agreement shall be limited to bargaining unit members with a temporary disability who are recovering from an industrial illness or injury and who require temporary, short-term, modified work assignments rather than reassignment of the bargaining unit member’s regular work; and to bargaining unit members with a temporary disability that precludes their returning to their regular work assignment.
d.	A bargaining unit member on temporary modified work assignment shall receive the same pay rate and benefits as she/he received at the time of the industrial injury or illness.

Section 17.6	- Response to Discipline
A bargaining unit member may respond in writing to any warning, or notice of disciplinary action.
