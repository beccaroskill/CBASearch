4
4-B.	All charges of violations of Section 4-A of this Article shall be considered as a dispute and shall be

As a remedy for violations of this Article, the LMCC Judicial Committee or Arbitrator shall be able, at the request of the Union, to require an employer to pay 1) to affected employees covered by this agreement, including registered applicants for employment, the equivalent of wages those employees have lost because of the violations, and 2) into the affected Joint Trust Funds to which this agreement requires contributions any delinquent contributions that resulted from the violations. The Joint Trade Board or Arbitrator shall be able also to provide any other appropriate remedies, whether provided by law or this agreement. The Union shall enforce a decision of the Joint Trade Board or Arbitrator under this Article only through arbitral, judicial, or governmental (for example, the National Labor Relations Board) channels.
4-C. If, after an employer has violated this Article, the Union and/or the Trustees of one or more Joint Trust Funds to which this agreement requires contributions institute legal action to enforce an award by an Arbitrator or the Joint Trade Board remedying such violation, or defend an action that seeks to vacate such award, the Employer shall pay any accountants’ and/or attorneys’ fees incurred by the Union and/or the Joint Trust Funds, plus costs of the litigation, that have resulted from such legal action. This section does not affect other remedies, whether provided by law or this Article, that may be available to the Union and/or the Joint Trust Funds.
4-D. In order to protect and preserve, for the employees covered by this Agreement, all work heretofore performed by them, and in order to prevent any device or subterfuge to avoid the protection and preservation of such work, it is hereby agreed as follows: This Agreement shall be binding upon the Employer and its successors, heirs and assigns and upon any firm, partnership, corporation, joint venture, or other business entity which has performed, does perform, or in the future may perform any work of the type covered by this Agreement, and in which such entity the Employer or any of its owners, partners, officers or shareholders had or has a substantial ownership interest, or exercises either directly or indirectly (such as through family members) any significant degree of management control. In the event of any change of the form or character of the signatory Employer's company, or sale, lease or any other transaction affecting the responsible management of such business concern, the Signatory Employer shall be required to notify the Union in writing not less than ten (10) days prior to the time that such change is to take effect. In the event the Signatory Employer fails to furnish such requisite notice, such will be considered a violation of this Agreement and subject to the remedial provisions thereof.

This section shall not be affected in any manner by reason of any type insolvency proceeding including bankruptcy, in which the Signatory Employer was involved. In addition, the outstanding obligations as specified above of a Responsible Managing Employee (RME) or Responsible Managing Officer (RMO) must be satisfied prior to issuance of or a continued entitlement to a Shop Card by any Signatory utilizing the services of such person.
5
6.	Signing of Agreement: This Agreement shall be binding upon each and every business concern affiliated
with the Association with the same force and effect as if this Agreement were entered into by each affiliate individually. All business concerns affiliated with the Association executing this Agreement shall be and continue to remain liable under this Agreement during the term hereof, irrespective of whether said affiliate shall resign from such Association prior to the expiration date of this Agreement, and such liability shall remain in force and effect during the term of this Agreement and shall be represented by the Association in all matters pertaining to collective bargaining and contract administration for the term of this Agreement. Such former affiliates shall be bound by any renewals or extensions of this Agreement unless the requisite notices as specified hereinafter are given.
7.	After this Agreement takes effect, any Employer becomes a party hereto if a counterpart of the Agreement is executed by him and is approved by the LMCC Office and the Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 or by joining a Signatory Association (subject to the limitations of Section 5 hereto). This Agreement shall take effect as to such contracting party at such time as said party signs said counterpart or is accepted into membership in said Association. It is agreed that after this Agreement takes effect all Employers, and all members of any Signatory Association, shall execute an individual counterpart. The validity of this Agreement shall not be affected as to any Employer member of a Signatory Association in the event that such Employer fails to execute an individual counterpart. All executions of this Agreement as specified herein above shall be subject to the issuance of shop card by the LMCC Office.
8.	Work by Employer: It is agreed that all Employers, party hereto, shall not be privileged to work on any job covered by Article 2 of this Agreement under contract, time and material, cost plus or any other basis until he has obtained an Identification Card issued by the LMCC Office. (The name of the person obtaining the Identification Card shall appear on the State License or by verification of the State Licensing Board.) The Employer shall have at all times, at least one (1) journeyman in his employ, when working with the tools of the trade.
The above paragraph shall be understood to mean that only those Employers who obtain an Identification Card from the LMCC Office shall be entitled to work with employees of the Union on the said Employer job only. Only one such Identification Card shall be issued to any Employer, whether or not that Employer operates as an individual firm, co-partnership, joint venture, corporation or other association.
9.	Sublet Work:
A.	The parties acknowledge that a close relationship exists between the Employer and its subcontractors on its job sites; and that employment of craftsmen at a particular job site is sporadic, necessitating a ready supply of craftsmen such as are available through the resources of the Union; that precise knowledge concerning present and prospective labor costs is essential to the Employer for the purpose of bidding; and that it is necessary and desirous to reduce the friction that results when union and non-union workers are required to work together at the same job site.
The parties recognize the strong interest of the Union in insuring a continuity of hiring hall employment opportunities for its members, and continuity of funding as and for the employee benefit trust funds, to the benefit of its members and their dependents. The parties recognize in this regard that such objectives can best be achieved by requiring that all work described in this Agreement be performed by business concerns signatory to this Agreement.
6
B.	Two or More Employers: The Employer Signatory to this Agreement hereby agrees that no two or more Employers having separate shop cards will be allowed to work for each other as employees.
The Employer shall not contract or subcontract any job site work heretofore described except to a person, firm, partnership, corporation or other entity that is licensed in accordance with State Law and signatory to this Agreement. The Employer agrees that he will not sublet or contract to his employees. It shall be deemed a violation of this Agreement for any employee to act as a labor contractor.
C.	The Employer agrees that in the event he subcontracts any work covered by this Agreement, the subcontract shall be in writing and a copy submitted to the Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 and to the LMCC Office prior to commencement of the job by the subcontractor. The LMCC Office shall notify the Employer in writing within seventy-two (72) hours the status of the subcontractor. The subcontracting agreement shall contain a provision that the subcontractor shall be responsible for the observance of all terms and conditions of this Agreement including the payment of wages and other monetary obligations. In the event that any subcontractor fails to pay the wages or other monetary obligations provided under this Agreement, the Employer shall become liable for the payments of such sums and such sums except liquidated damages immediately become due and payable by the Employer.
In the event that work described in this Agreement is subcontracted to any party not signatory to this Agreement, all monies paid to the subcontractor shall be considered gross wages and divided by the basic hourly wage rate, excluding fringe benefits to determine the hours of bargaining unit work lost. Such hours are to be assessed at an amount equivalent to all contractual contributions required of the Employer, including fringe benefits and dues check off. This formula is to be utilized whether or not the subcontractor employs workmen or performs such bargaining unit work alone. While the gross monies paid to such subcontractors are the appropriate sums to be converted to contributions due and owing, in the event that the Signatory Contractor can authenticate material, overhead and profit margin on the part of the subcontractor, such authentication may be considered by the Trust Funds and/or LMCC Judicial Committee and a reduction made in the event that such is determined to be appropriate. It is recognized by the parties that each case depends upon its own facts and that any reduction thus made by either the Board of Trustees or the LMCC Judicial Committee shall not constitute a precedent in any future case. The conversion formula as described above will be affected by use of the basic contractual rate applicable to journeymen, apprentice or clean-up, irrespective to the actual rate being paid by the Employer. The conversion formula described above and elsewhere in this Agreement is recognized as the most practical and accurate means of determining the loss of hours of bargaining unit work to the employees and the contractually required monetary payments. Such conversion formula is neither intended nor designated as a penalty against any party to this Agreement.
D.	The signatory contractor in no event will permit the assignment of bargaining unit work on any job site to persons not in his employ or business concerns in an amount in excess of 80 percent of the total bargaining unit work required in the construction contract. For the purpose of this paragraph, the total monetary value of the production contract shall be deemed the equivalent of the total amount of bargaining unit work provided for therein. This paragraph will be applicable with respect to any such assignment, whether in the form of a subcontract or any other type business transaction. It is the intent of this paragraph to assure that at least 20 percent of the total amount of bargaining unit work required to perform a construction contract on any job site will be assigned to employees of the Signatory Employer. It is the further intent of the parties that
7
application of this Article is in accord with Federal and State Law, The Employer warrants that this paragraph will be strictly complied with and that any damages caused or costs incurred as a result of a violation thereof will be recoverable through the arbitration provisions of this contract or before any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that a violation of this paragraph renders the subcontracting provisions of this Agreement invalid, as applied to any job site, the Union shall be entitled to secure such damages as would be available by application of the formula set forth in Article 5, Section 9 (C) of the Agreement.

1.	SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS:
The Signatory and employees shall abide by all the Health and Safety Provisions, Rules and Regulations of those Municipal, State and Federal Agencies having issuing authority in the pertinent field of work being performed by the Signatory to this Agreement.
2:	DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION AND DETECTION:
The parties recognize the problems which drug abuse has created in the construction industry and the need to develop drug abuse prevention programs. Accordingly, the parties agree that in order to enhance the safety of the work place and to maintain a drug free work environment, individual Employers may require applicants or employees to undergo drug screening. The parties agree that if a screening program is implemented by an individual Employer, the following items have been agreed upon by Labor and Management.
23
1.	It is understood that the use, possession, transfer, or sale of illegal drugs, narcotics, or other unlawful substances, is absolutely prohibited while employees are on the Employer • s job premises or while working on any site in connection with work performed under the applicable agreement.
2.	All applicants or newly hired employees may undergo a drug screen.
3.	Applicants not passing the drug screen will not be placed on the Employer1 s payroll or receive
any compensation. Employees not passing the drug screen will be removed from the Employer1 s payroll. The Employer agrees to pay the cost for administering the drug screen.
4.	The Employer may require that an employee be tested for drugs where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the employee is impaired from performing his/her job. Observation must be made by at least two (2) persons, one of whom may be a Union employee. This provision shall be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. Supervisors will administer the program in a fair and confidential manner. For employees who refuse to take the test where the prerequisites set forth in this paragraph have been met, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the test result would have been positive for an unlawful substance.
5.	An Employer may require that an employee who contributed to an injury/accident be tested for drugs where the Employer has reasonable cause to believe that the injury/accident resulted from drug usage.
6.	It is understood that the unsafe use of prescribed medication, or where the use of prescribed medication impairs the employee1 s ability to perform work, is a basis for removal.
7.	A sufficient amount of a sample shall be taken to allow for an initial test and a confirmation test. The initial test will be by Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique (EMIT). In the event a question or positive result arises from the initial test, a confirmation test must be utilized before action can be taken against the employee or applicant. The confirmation test will be by Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS). The cutoff levels for both, the initial test and the confirmation test, will be those established by the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Confirmed positive samples will be retained by the testing laboratory in a secured long term frozen storage for a minimum of one year. Handling and transportation of each sample must be documented through a strict chain of custody procedures.
8.	Any dispute which arises under this drug policy shall be submitted to the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the applicable Agreement.
9.	The establishment or operation of this policy shall not curtail any right of an employee found in any law, rule or regulation. Should any part of this policy be found unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction or a public agency having jurisdiction over the parties, the remaining portions of the policy shall be unaffected and the parties shall enter negotiations to replace the affected provision.
24
10.	The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Union harmless against any and all claims, demands,
suits or liabilities that may arise solely out of the Employers application of the Substance Abuse Program.
11.	Where a General Contractor or Building Owner has established and requires a substance abuse program that is more restrictive, that program shall prevail. Employees shall be informed that the program they will be working under differs from the standard policy. Employees shall have the right to request that they be assigned to another project with no inferences being made.

The Business Representative shall investigate the dispute or reason given within twenty-four (24) hours from notification.
B.

2.	Piecework:
A.	The parties recognize that the piecework method of payment of wages frequently makes it impossible to calculate the hours worked by the employee; that the effect is to render it difficult, if not impossible, to enforce this contract so as to insure that employees working there under are receiving the proper negotiated rate and/or that the contractually required contributions are being made as to all hours required to be paid for. Such methods frequently result in the payment of wages to employees below the negotiated levels and the withholding from the Trust Funds and their participants of substantial amounts of contributions, all to the jeopardy of the fiscal integrity of the Trust Funds and the employee benefit programs they support.
B.	When it is impossible to determine the number of hours worked because of the piecework method of payment, it is agreed that such employee shall be deemed to have worked a minimum of eight (8) hours per day and/or forty (40) hours per week straight time hours during such week.
C.	Any evidence that the employee's earnings by the piecework method exceed those payable in accordance with the negotiated hourly rate is deemed irrelevant and inadmissible in any proceeding before a competent tribunal whether Board of Arbitration or Court.
D.	Where an employee is paid an amount equivalent to or greater than the appropriate weekly wage of the area work week, a full work week of contributions shall be paid the Trust Funds, plus any actual hours of overtime worked.
E.	Where employees are paid an amount less than the equivalent of the appropriate wage rate times the straight time hours of the area work week, the gross compensation paid such employees shall be divided by the appropriate hourly wage rate, and the quotient from that calculation shall be multiplied by the fringe benefit amounts required by the Agreement, and shall be deemed the amounts owed to the Trust Funds. If it is determined that employees actually worked more hours than reported, additional wages may be due as well as fringe benefits.
30

1.	All Employers signatory to this Agreement shall maintain time cards reflecting all hours worked by each
employee and shall remain in compliance with State and Federal laws.
2.	All wages shall be due and payable by a negotiable check payable on demand at par. On all out-of-town checks the Employer shall provide reasonable facilities, including identification, for cashing without charge or discount to the employee. Each employee shall be furnished with a detachable check stub showing the contractor's name and address, the employee's name or social security number, total straight time hours, total overtime hours, the date of the pay period ending, the total amount due and all deductions. Said check stub shall conform with the provisions pertaining to the payment of social security. It shall be a violation of this Agreement for an Employer to issue any check, other than payroll check, for compensation earned under this Agreement. Approval of any other manner or method of payment of compensation shall be obtained in writing, from the Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36.
43
3.	Accounting Hold back: Wages earned shall be due and payable Friday on the job by quitting time and shall include all wages earned up to and including Wednesday except in cases where Employers employ exceptionally large crews of men to the extent of creating a hardship in making of the payrolls. Such cases may be referred to the Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 who are empowered to permit the work week to end on Tuesday:
4.	Discharge Pay: Employees temporarily laid off or discharged must be paid in full at time of dismissal.
5.	Quit Pay: Employees who quit during the pay period shall be paid within seventy-two (72) hours either by picking up check on the job, by registered or certified mail, or through a representative of the Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 or the Financial Secretary of the Local Union having jurisdiction.
6.	Waiting Time: On failure of the Employer to pay wages, and contractually required expenses within the
stipulated time, all waiting time shall be paid for at the rate of straight time. Members of the Union must report to the representative of the Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 within seventy-two (72) hours after wages and contractually required expenses are due.
Reasonable delay beyond the control of the Employer shall not be construed as a violation of this article. The burden of establishing such reasonable delay shall be upon the Employer. Absence such proof, the failure of the Employer to pay compensation when due shall be conclusively presumed willful. Monies awarded as "waiting time" shall be deemed "wages" within the meaning of the California Labor Code and applicable Federal law.
7.	Show Up Time:
A.	Any member of the Union having been engaged to work by an Employer and who upon reporting is not given employment shall receive two (2) hours pay. Inclement weather conditions excepted.

44
8.
Waiting Time and Wage Claims:
A.	The parties hereto expressly acknowledge that it is impractical or extremely difficult to fix the nature and extent of the loss to an employee who does not receive his pay when it is due. The parties have therefore agreed upon the following liquidated damages which shall be presumed to be the amount of damages sustained by such a breach of the Agreement. Upon failure of the Employer to pay within the stipulated time all waiting time shall be paid for at the rate of straight time at his prevailing rate, not to exceed eight (8) hours in twenty-four (24) hour period on a seven (7) day basis. The LMCC may within its discretion, in any individual case, award waiting time for the number of days between the date wages are due and the date said wages are either paid or placed in escrow with the LMCC.
B.	A journeyman who has not been paid must immediately report to the paid representative of the LMCC or the representative of the Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 who shall immediately notify the LMCC and not later than forty-eight (48) hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays, after said wages are due and payable. Any journeyman who does not report not receiving wages within the time limits prescribed in this Section shall have no claim for waiting time under this Agreement, and may file a claim under this Agreement for a maximum offifteen (15) calendar days (two one week pay periods) of back wages.
C.	Delay occasioned by accidents beyond the control of the Employer shall not be construed as a violation of Article 16.
D.	When the LMCC is notified that a journeyman has not received wages due and such notification is received within the time limits prescribed in Section "B" above, the paid representative of the LMCC shall immediately contact the Employer, by telephone, special messenger, or fax and notify him that a claim for wages due has been made and instructs said Employer to make immediate payment. Failure to contact the Employer shall not relieve him of any obligation under this section. Said Employer shall be advised that waiting time may continue to accrue until payment is made.
E.	In the event an Employer disputes the claim for wages as to its validity or the amount claimed the paid representative of the LMCC shall instruct the Employer to post the disputed amount with the LMCC pending a decision on the matter by the appropriate committee or committees. The Employer shall be advised that waiting time may continue to accrue until the disputed wages are deposited with the LMCC. Waiting time shall cease to accrue as of the date wages are paid to the journeyman or deposited with the LMCC.
F.	No member of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) shall continue in the employment of an Employer or Employers whose checks have not been honored or ofany Employer who failed to pay on the stipulated day. Such member shall not return to work until it is proven that all outstanding paychecks have been honored and satisfactory arrangements for future payments made.
9.	Kickbacks: In the event that an employee refunds all or part of his compensation to the Employer or other employee, regardless of the circumstances, such action shall be conclusively presumed to constitute a "kickback.© Such practice constitutes a violation of this Agreement, and as remedy, the waiting time provisions herein above shall be applicable from the date of such occurrence and shall extend to the date that the monies withheld or refunded are made payable to the employee. This Section shall be cumulative to and not affected in any manner by the provisions of Section 221 and 225 of the California Labor Code.
45
10.	Improper Payment: No employee shall receive and no contractor shall pay more than the hourly wage rate, unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, regardless of whether the payment is issued by the contractor or any other person, firm or corporation. Any manner or method (such as: multiple checks, cash, equipment rental, bonuses, travel pay, subsistence, material purchase, subcontracting, or any subterfuge) with an intent to evade the proper payment of wages and fringe benefits shall be a violation of this Agreement. All payments as described above, shall be considered gross wages, and divided by the appropriate basic contract wage scale to determine the amount of contributions due and owing by the Employer under the contract. Nothing herein shall prohibit the contractor from paying a superior workman at a rate in excess of the appropriate contractual wage level, but seven (7) days prior notification to Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 must be made.
11.	The Employer shall be required to make the contractual contributions as to salaried employees covered under the employee benefit plans for all hours worked, but not less than forty (40) hours per week. The Employer, however, in order to avail himself of this Section, shall be required to maintain hourly records, relative to work performed by such salaried employees. Any variance in the gross pay of such employee in relation to hours worked from week to week shall be presumptive evidence of a violation of this Agreement and the assessment for contractual contributions shall be computed as specified in Article 22.
12.	Sections 10 and 11 shall not be applicable as to employees required to be compensated in accordance with the incentive pay provisions contained in Article 18.
13.	A. All employees must secure and maintain First Aid, CPR, Scaffold User and Fall Protection certification. Additionally they shall secure and maintain OSHA 10 certification. OSHA 10 will include, Forklift User and Aerial Power Lift User. Those employees who do not secure and maintain the above certification shall be paid $3.00 less than the Journeyman rate. Employees will have until October 1, 2004 to obtain OSHA 10 certification. This lower rate shall not be paid on prevailing wage jobs.
B.	A person who has passed the Journeyman test or completed the current Apprenticeship Training Program shall be paid $3.00 less than the Journeyman for a period of one year. This lower rate shall not be paid on prevailing wage jobs.
ARTICLE 20
OUT OF TOWN EXPENSES
1.	When members of Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 are required because of job location to live away from their place of residence, they shall receive not less than the regular rate of pay, plus sixty dollars ($60.00) per day, to cover expenses from date of leaving until the day of return, inclusive, to their home area. When subsistence is paid, an employee shall also be reimbursed once in any weekly pay period at the straight time hourly rate for the time required to make one round trip to his place of residence and back to the job location. Upon completion of their job and/or layoff a member is being paid for time spent in transit returning to their home area, they shall not be eligible to also collect subsistence for the day of return.
46
2.	If a journeyman quits a job paying subsistence monies without just cause during a pay period, he shall
not be entitled to any travel expenses for return to his home area.
3.	If a journeyman in a subsistence area does not show up for work on Monday, or the day following a legal holiday after having worked the previous Friday, or the work day prior to a holiday he shall not be entitled to the subsistence allowance for Saturday and Sunday or for the day or days covered by the holiday. The only exception to this clause is if a journeyman be judged by a competent authority as sick or unfit to work.
Exception: On Federal, State, or industrial projects where room and board is provided by either the awarding authority or Employer, the employee may have the option of accepting the room and board facilities, or the subsistence allowance, but not both.
If a job site is located sixty (60) miles or more from a Local Union, employees shall receive sixty dollars ($60.00) per day subsistence in addition to current IRS Standards per mile for all miles traveled beyond sixty (60). The term Local Union shall be herein defined as any Local Union in existence during the term of the 2003 -2006 Agreement and shall remain as a reference for calculating mileage.
4.	It is agreed that the interpreting body will review "out-of-town expenses" each year.
ARTICLE 21
AUDITING PRINCIPLES AND PROCEDURES
1.	The Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36, the Trustees of the Trust Funds and their agents, are hereby authorized to examine and audit any books and records of account of the Employer and the books and records of account of any business concern in which the Signatory Employer has any financial interest, regardless of the nature and character of work performed by such business entity. Such examination and audit may extend to all matters which are directly or indirectly pertinent to the Signatory Employer’s obligation to fulfill any condition to this Agreement. The Employer, upon request, shall make available, any records pertinent to this purpose, including but not limited to, payroll records, time cards, day sheets, check books, material invoices, equipment rental records, subcontract agreements for any work sublet, contracts awarded and performed by the Employer and Federal and State, and Workers' Compensation reports. Additionally, the Employer shall make available upon request documentation from his Federal Income Tax Return which shows gross income and expenditures for labor and materials. Audits shall be conducted periodically at the Employer's place of business unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
The Signatory Employer agrees that the records shall be made available upon request to either the Painters and Allied Trades District Council No. 36 and the Trustees of the Trust Funds, or their agents, within three (3) working days from the date that such audit is requested. If such audit discloses that there has been underreporting by the Employer, he shall be chargeable with the cost of the audit in addition to any delinquency charges that may be due. Where an audit of contractor's records indicates that there has been collusion between the employee and the Employer to defraud the Trust Funds, such employee will be charged before the Judicial Committee. The employee shall be assessed in an amount equal to that due as vacation pay.
47
2.	Maintenance of Records: It shall at all times be the responsibility of the Employer to maintain complete and accurate records of expenditures by the Employer for any purpose whatsoever, including, but not limited to, wages, fringe benefit contributions, travel and subsistence reimbursement, equipment rental, material purchases and subcontracted work. In the absence of complete and accurate records relating to any employee compensation or reimbursement, the gross monies received by the employees shall be divided by the basic hourly rate, not including fringe benefit contributions, to determine the hours worked by the employee and to compute the amount of contributions required under the contract. Similarly, in the absence of complete and accurate records relative to all payments made to individuals not listed as employees, including but not limited to payment for subcontracted work and material purchases, such gross expenditures shall be presumed to be in payment of bargaining unit work and shall be divided by the basic hourly rate, not including fringe benefit contributions, to determine the hours lost by workmen covered by the Agreement and to compute the amount of contributions contractually required by the Employer. In the event evidence is produced that an employee did in fact, work on a job for a Signatory Employer and his benefits were not reported to the Trust Fund barring evidence to the contrary, the assumption shall be that the employee worked forty (40) hours in each week that he was found on a job.
In the event that for any reason, an Employer is unable to produce any records reflecting monies paid for any purpose whatsoever during all or part of the audit period, it is agreed that the parties to this Agreement authorize the appointment of a subcommittee of the SCPDI Trustees or their agents to conduct a full inquiry for the purpose of determining the amount of contractual contributions due and owing from the Employer. The scope of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, the following: investigation of all construction projects upon which work was performed during the audit period, interviews with any person or persons with knowledge relevant to such inquiry, and the securing of such other information as deemed to be relevant by such committee. It is further agreed that in such event, the determination by such subcommittee as to the number of employee hours involved throughout all or part of the audit period shall be deemed conclusive and binding upon the parties. This shall in no way mean that the rights of the Signatory Employer to appeal to the Judicial Committee and/or arbitrator be denied. Such investigative committee shall consist of equal representatives of Labor and Drywall Management, each, and be appointed by the chairman of the Trust Fund Board of Trustees.
The foregoing determinations shall be competent evidence to be utilized in proceedings before the Judicial Committee and/or Designated Arbitrator. Such determinations, however, shall not in any manner affect the Employer's right to a judicial determination by the LMCC Judicial Committee and/or the designated arbitrator.
