Section 1.2.	Definitions:
Apprentice: An Apprentice is an employee who is in training to become a Journeyman Meat Cutter. Apprentices must be at least eighteen (18) years of age.
Apprentices Hired After 1/07/98:
Two part-time Apprentices per store calculated and distributed on a system wide basis, however, at no time shall the number of full-time positions be less than thirty percent (30%) of the new classification.
Newly-hired Apprentices are to be laid off before any full-time or part-time Journeyman presently on the payroll as of January 7, 1998.
All employees hired before January 7, 1998 will be given first preference for the Apprentice position with a ninety (90) day trial period. All employees hired on or before ratification whose rate is above the 0-6 Month rate will remain at their rate of pay at the time of promotion until they have the required time in the Apprentice position to progress to the next rate of pay.
No Meat Cutter or Wrapper employee in service on or before January 7, 1998 will be laid off or reduced in hours as a result of the Apprentice classification.
All Meat Cutters hired prior to January 7, 1998, who volunteer, shall have preference for all meat cutting hours on Sundays and holidays before Apprentices hired or promoted into the classification after January 7, 1998.
All newly-hired part-time Apprentices shall be guaranteed a minimum of four (4) hours per day, sixteen (16) hours per week.
Any employee who works more than forty (40) hours per week for twelve (12) consecutive weeks shall be made full-time.
After 84 months, the Apprentice will become a Journeyman Meat Cutter based on the new-hire wage structure.
Sunday shall be part of the workweek at time and one-half (1V2) the employee's regular rate of pay.
An Apprentice promoted to Market Manager shall receive the current Market Manager rate of pay in the Contract.
Journeymen: After serving the apprenticeship, an employee shall be classified as a Journeyman Meat Cutter, and shall be paid the Journeyman rate of pay, based on the new-hire wage structure.
Part-Time Journeymen: The Employer may hire and utilize part-time Journeymen on the following basis:
Wage rate shall be fifty cents (50c) per hour below the regular Journeyman rate.
No full-time Pension contribution, unless they work one hundred, twenty-eight (128) hours or more per month.
A minimum of sixteen (16) hours, and a maximum of thirty (30) hours, of work per week.
First refusal on full-time openings.

One (1) part-time Journeyman per store, except in markets where the sum of the Head Meat Cutter, Journeyman, and Apprentices equal eight (8); in which event, the Employer can utilize a second part-time Journeyman.
Part-time Journeymen must be laid off prior to the layoff of any full-time Journeyman (by area, by seniority).
Head Meat Cutter: The term “Head Meat Cutter" means a Journeyman Meat Cutter who is responsible for the efficient management of the market. Each store will have only one (1) Head Meat Cutter.
Wrappers: Full-time Wrappers may be employed, and their duties shall be confined to slicing luncheon meats and sausages; clean-up work in the market; stocking cases; and wrapping, scaling and pricing.
Current Seafood and Wrapper employees shall be red-circled, and will not have hours reduced as a result of current Seafood employees doing
wrapper duties, or current wrappers doing Seafood duties. As of January 7, 1998, Seafood employees or Wrappers may agree with the Employer to work in the other department. Effective January 7, 1998, employees will only be hired in as wrappers, and may be assigned Seafood work as determined by the Employer.
Part-time Wrappers may be employed on the following basis:
There will be three (3) part-time Wrappers allowed per store, calculated and distributed on a system-wide basis.
Part-time Wrappers can only be new hires or employees who transfer into that classification from the Delicatessen Department, it being understood that the transfer of an employee from the Delicatessen Department classification to the part-time Wrapper classification is optional with the Employer, and that any full-time Delicatessen Department employee so transferred would be “red-circled" until such time as the part-time wrapper rate reached the red-circled employee's rate of pay.
When a full-time wrapper is needed in a given store, the Employer will endeavor to fill said position by selecting from all applicants, the applicant whose qualifications, ability and availability for work are the greatest; provided, however, that where qualifications are equal, preference shall be given to part-time wrappers employed in that given store. The determination of the relative qualifications of all applicants is expressly reserved to the Employer.
Part-time wrappers shall be scheduled for a minimum of four (4) hours in any one (1) day, and sixteen (16) hours in any one (1) week. Part-time wrappers shall not be scheduled for more than thirty (30) hours in any one (1) week. In the event that they work more than thirty (30) hours per week, they must be paid the full-time wrapper rate for the hours worked in excess of thirty (30). Furthermore, part-time wrappers who were in service on or before July 20, 1985 shall not be scheduled to work past 10:00 PM. In the event that part-time wrappers who were in service prior to July 20, 1985 work past 10:00 PM, they must be paid the full-time wrapper rate for hours worked beyond 10:00 PM.
Part-time wrappers hired on or after October 6, 1985 shall be scheduled for a minimum of four (4) hours in any one (1) day, and sixteen (16) hours in any one (1) week.

Sunday work for all wrappers shall be voluntary by seniority, by rotation. If no wrappers volunteer for Sunday work, then such work shall be mandatory for part-time wrappers only by reverse seniority, by rotation. Part-time wrappers shall be paid time and one-half (IQ) their regular hourly rate of pay for all work performed on Sunday. Sunday shall be part of the work week for Wrappers hired after January 7,1998. Sunday rate of pay remains at time and one-half (IQ.
All part-time wrappers must be laid off before the layoff of any full-time wrappers.
All part-time wrappers in a given store must be laid off before any journeymen are laid off in that same given store.

It is also understood and agreed that the Employer, in consideration of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, may receive into, and utilize within the retail markets prefabricated primal and sub-primal veal, pork and lamb.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is further understood, and the parties hereby stipulate and agree, that the Employer may receive into and utilize within the retail markets Prepackaged Delicatessen items without the requirement that those items be price marked, provided that those items have a UPC symbol affixed to the package.

Employees temporarily off work due to sick leave, vacation, or other approved leave of absence shall be included on the list.
No Journeymen in service on or before November 22, 1988, will be laid off or reduced in hours as a result of the utilization of pre-priced poultry or as a result of the expanded wrapper duties.
