5.2 PERS-MEDICAL & PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS *
On January 1, 1995, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the District will provide group medical and prescription drug benefits, as provided below, through the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS). The PERS rules, regulations and plan documents will control on all issues concerning benefits, including the types and levels of benefits offered and eligibility for those benefits.
The Unions acknowledge that they understand these benefits may not equate to benefits previously available to employees and retirees through the various optional medical plans and the prescription drug plan. Because coverage will be provided through PERS, the District and the Unions understand that PERS may terminate or change covered expenses, benefit payments and co-payments on covered benefits, deductibles, lifetime and/or annual maximums and may implement various cost control features.
Except for Survivors Benefits, as provided for in Section 5.8, the Unions waive the right to any group medical or prescription drug benefit granted expressly or impliedly under other sections of this Agreement, or by any other agreement between the parties or by any District guideline, policy or practice if that benefit is not offered through the PERS medical plan.
It is the intent of the parties that providing these benefits shall result in no additional cost to the District over the projected future cost of the current plans. To that end, [for the period-up.-to and including June
30,1997 for-the.life of the cur rent-Agreement^] all employees eligible
for PERS medical benefits who enroll for such benefits shall be responsible for a premium co-payment in the amount of twenty-five
9
dollars ($25.00) per month. [Any-and all increases in premiums between-August 1, 1994, and the PERS premium adjustment on or about August 1, 1997 shall result in a like percentage increase in the employee premium co-payment for the contract period commencing on or about July 1,1997, such amount to be determined by the District.]
The parties acknowledge that the District's contribution to the PERS premium for eligible retirees [will be phased in over] has been subject to a seven (7) year phase-in period that is nearing completion after which retired employees and active employees will pay the same premium co-payment toward their total PERS medical premium cost. The District will pay the difference. The phase-in will be completed as follows:
[YEAR 1: (1/01/95-7/31/95)
Each- eligible retiree pays the entire cost of their PERS -Medical.and
Prescription Drug coverage premium less one dollar ($1) per month.
YEAR 2-4-(8/01/95 - 7/31/96)
Each eligible retir-ee-pays...the same premium co-payment as active
employees plus 6Z7ths of-the-difference between the total premium-cost of their PERS Medical and Prescription Drug coverage and the active employee premium co-payment.
YEAR 3: (8/01/96-7/31/97)
Each eligible retiree-pays the same premium co-payment as active employees plus 5/7ths of the difference between the total-premium cost of their PERS Medical and Prescription Drug coverage and the active employee premium co-payment-
YEAR 4:—(8/01/97 - 7/31/98)Each eligible retiree pays the same premium co-payment as active employees plus 4/7ths of the difference between the total—premium—cost of their—PERS—Medical—and Prescription Drug coverage and the active employee- premium-copayment.
YEAR 5:—(8/01/98 - 7/31/99)Each eligible retiree pays the-same premium co-payment as active
employees plus 3/7ths of the difference between the total premium cost-of-their PERS Medical and Prescription Drug-coverage and the active employee premium co-payment.
YEAR-64—(8/01/99 - 7/31/00)
Each eligible retiree pays the -same.premium co-payment as active
employees plus 2/7ths of the difference.between the total premium
cost of their PERS Medical and Prescription Drug-coverage and the active employee premium co-payment.]
10
YEAR 7: (8/0W0 7/01/01 - 7/31/01)
Each eligible retiree pays the same premium co-payment as active employees plus 1/7th of the difference between the total premium cost of their PERS Medical and Prescription Drug coverage and the active employee premium co-payment.
YEAR 8 : (8/01/01 - 7/31/02)
On and after August 1, 2001 [B]each eligible retiree shall pay[s] the same premium co-payment as active employees. Employees' premium co-payments will be paid for through payroll deductions. Retiree premium co-payments will be deducted from the retirement allowance paid by PERS. If a retiree's retirement allowance is not sufficient to pay the entire co-payment, the retiree must pay the balance due on such premium co-payment directly to PERS. If such payment is not received by the due date, health care coverage will automatically, immediately and permanently cease. These rules are intended to comply with the premium co-payment procedures established by PERS, which may be modified by PERS. The District, Unions and employees shall comply with the PERS procedures in effect from time to time.
The District reserves the right to terminate or change any part or all of the health benefits program at any time with respect to active or retired employees, however, any such action will be taken only after the District has satisfied its obligations under applicable Collective Bargaining Agreements. The District's contractual obligation to provide health benefits coverage to retired employees shall terminate upon the expiration of this Agreement. By providing benefits to retirees, the parties do not intend to vest retirees with such benefits.
[Until the effective date of the PERS contract, the District
agrees..-to continue- to- offeMo eligible-employees and....-retirees the
service-delivery health insurance plans and-prescription drug-plan which they selected under the last open enrollment period before the effective date of this Agreement.]
* Minute Clarification
The parties mutually understand that the only obligation to continue the health benefits of active employees after the expiration of the Agreement is that which may arise from the general legal duty to bargain in good faith.

The District shall amend its contract with the Public Employee's
Retirement Systems (PERS) to provide the two percent (2%) at 55

retirement option for miscellaneous members in the bargaining unit. This change shall become effective August 31, 1992 or as soon thereafter as practicable.

The base rate
15
monthly compensation equals one hundred seventy-three and one third (173.33) hours times base straight time hourly rate.
B.	Additional Contributions to Employees’ Money Purchase Plan Purine PERS Superfunding
Beginning October 1, 2001, and for the period(s) during which the District’s PERS account is superfunded, the District shall make an additional contribution to each employee’s Money Purchase Plan account in the amount of 3.5% of gross straight-time wages. This contribution is 50% or one half of the 7% PERS Employer Paid Member Contribution (EPMC). The other 3.5% will be available to the District for discretionary obligations and purposes. The 7% EPMC will be discontinued during the period(s) of superfunding.
If the GASB (Government Accounting Standards Board) adopts a change in accounting standards for the retiree medical insurance unfunded liability and compliance with that standard would reguire an increase in contributions toward that liability, said increase will be paid proportionally (i.e. in egual proportions) from the employer’s full 3.5% share of the 7% and from no more than 1.5% (3/7ths) of the employee’s share of the 7%. As long as superfunding is in effect, the District’s contribution to the employee’s MPPP shall be a minimum of 2%.
The terms of this subsection apply whenever the District’s PERS account is superfunded as defined by PERS.
To the extent it is within their respective authority, the District and Unions will amend the Money Purchase Plan as needed to implement this section, including amendments regarding changes in the contributions described above related to PERS account superfunding status.
Minute Clarification
If compliance with GASB accounting standards reguires a change as described above, the parties shall meet concerning implementation of any reguired changes. The contributions by the District and employees will be based on the minimum amount necessary to meet the accounting standards.
16
If compliance with GASB accounting standards requires a change as described above, the ratio of employer contributions to employee contributions is two and one third (2 1/3) to one (1). For example, if the District to contribute 1.75% of it’s 3.5 % share, employees would contribute 0.75 % of their share.

C.	Choosing An Option: Employees who wish to select Option 1 or 2 as noted above, must so designate during the option period. Employees may select only one option (“bank” or “buy-back”) for each accrual period.
Payroll clerks shall process and transmit employee hoices to Payroll during the second week of the option period.
Once an option is selected, it may not be changed until the following option period. Buy back checks will be distributed to employees no later than December 1 following the end of the accrual period.
Unless an employee elects to "bank" (Option 1), or buy-back (Option 2) during the option period, such unused sick leave hours shall be carried over the next year and will no longer be subject to the Annual options.
D.	Sick Leave Payment: Employees shall receive sick leave with pay up to the amount of sick leave accrued at the time of illness, provided the requirements of this section are met.
Employees shall accrue sick leave credits during the probationary period, however, they shall not be eligible for sick leave pay until after completion of the probation period.
An employee who is absent from work for reasons that duality for use of sick leave under section 9.1 who has no accumulated sick leave to cover such absence must use accumulated vacation, personal holiday, and compensatory time off before unpaid leave may be granted. Even though such charges are made, the employee’s absence remains subject to the contract provisions governing the use of sick leave. The employee must advise the employee’s appropriate absence report recipient, as designated by the District, of the category of paid leave that shall be charged for such absence. If the employee does not do so, the absence shall be charged by default against the employee’s accumulated vacation, holiday and compensatory time off in that order. Sick leave preserved under section 9.1.D last paragraph (below) will not be available for such charges. Holidays may not be charged if such charge would reduce
24
the number of holidays in the employee’s account below the number of designated contractual holidays remaining in the fiscal year.
Employees shall be eligible for paid sick leave as follows:
1.	Illness, injury, quarantine, or similar exposure to contagious disease;
2.	Verifiable medical and/or dental appointments which cannot be scheduled outside the normal working hours, provided that a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours advance notice is given and provided subsequent confirmation that the appointment was kept is given if requested by Management.
3.	Doctor's visits associated with pregnancy, subject to the
provisions in "2." above;
4.	Hospitalization or serious illness/accident and resulting
subsequent related scheduled doctor's visits, subject to the provisions in "2." above;
5.	Required attendance upon a seriously ill spouse or child. The District may require a written statement from the attending physician that the employee's attendance was required.
6.	Required transportation to doctor for employee's spouse or child if spouse or child has serious accident or serious illness (subsequent verified and scheduled doctor's visits resulting from initial visit and also included).
7.	Industrial injury and resulting subsequent related scheduled doctor's visits.
Sick leave with pay shall apply to each separate sick leave incident. For purposes of this section, "sick leave with pay" means pay calculated at the straight time day shift rate for the number of hours the employee was regularly scheduled to work each day, had the illness or injury not occurred.
If an employee’s absence which qualifies for paid sick leave also qualifies as statutory family and medical leave (i.e. FMLA/CFRA), the employee may elect to preserve eligibility for participation in the annual buy-back or the retirement/
25
termination bank, if either was elected during the option period, by requesting to substitute vacation, floating holidays (for increments of a full day only), or compensatory leave pay, if applicable, or, if he/she has no accrued vacation, floating holidays or compensatory leave, requesting to take the leave unpaid. The request must be made before receipt of sick pay.
E. Sick Leave Verification: The District may take reasonable means to verify the employee's eligibility for sick leave. Upon prior written notice, an employee, at his or her expense may be required to provide a doctor's statement which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the District, eligibility for sick leave as defined above, for any sick leave incident.
Employees shall furnish a doctor's statement for each sick leave incident involving absences of more than three (3) working days.
In instances where the District requires a doctor's statement, either to verify sick leave or determine an employee's fitness to return to work, that statement must include the following:
1.	date and time of treatment;
2.	duration of illness;
3.	date cleared to return to work.
Otherwise, an employee returning to work from a sick leave incident must submit a required doctor's statement and other documentation within seven (7) calendar days of his/ her return to work. Failure to submit required documentation within the time provided shall result in denial of sick leave pay, and may result in disciplinary action.
The District may require any employee to submit to a medical examination by a doctor designated by the District, at the District's expense, as a condition of return to work from a sick leave incident or to verify the continuing need for sick leave.
Pattern use, misuse or abuse of sick leave will be governed by the District's disciplinary procedures and handled on a case-by-case basis.
F. Sick Leave Reporting: It is the responsibility of every employee absent from work because of illness or injury to report such absences to his/her immediate supervisor or the supervisor's designated representative. This report mustinclude information as to the expected date of return to work and where the employee can be reached during his/her normal work hours. The employee will
26
promptly notify his/her supervisor or supervisor's designee of any change which affects his/her ability to return to work.
9.5 TEMPORARY MODIFIED ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE
[Effective January 1, 1992 or as soon thereafter as practicable, t] The parties recognize that offering Temporary Modified Work Assignments (TMA’s) can, when properly administered, benefit the District and employees financially and in accelerating rehabilitation. Temporary modified work or temporary work assignments will be provided to permanently (who volunteer to participate) and temporarily disabled BART employees, when in the judgment of the District, work is available which can be provided without adversely affecting operations or services. Temporary modified work will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Each employee who desires a TMA shall submit a written notice of such desire simultaneously to his or her immediate supervisor and the District’s Disability Programs Office, Department of Human Resources. Promptly after receipt of such notice, the Disability Program Office shall provide the employee with a Return-to-Work guestionnaire for completion by the employee’s physician, an instruction sheet on how to complete these forms, and a copy of section 9.5 of the Labor Agreement. The employee must simultaneously return this form completed to the Disability Program Office and the employee’s immediate supervisor.
Temporary modified work may involve modification of an employee's own job or assignment to work outside of an employee's current position or bargaining unit as provided herein. The [Benefits] Disability Programs Office, in consultation with the applicable department, will determine eligibility for participation in the temporary modified work program and will coordinate temporary work positions/assignments.
To aid in the administration of this program, the (SEIU and ATU) shall appoint two persons from their bargaining unit to serve on a TMA committee. The duties of the committee include (a) identifying potential TMA opportunities not otherwise identified by the District and recommending them to the Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office for consideration, (b) evaluating proposed TMA assignments and (c) advising the Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office on potential improvements in program administration. The Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office shall periodically train new committee members concerning the TMA program,
27
and shall periodically offer such training to union officers, stewards, supervisors, and managers.
The Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office shall provide committee members with a Quarterly report of all reguests for TMA application materials, completed Return to Work Questionnaires, and TMAs that have been implemented. In addition, the committee shall have access to the completed Return-to-Work Questionnaires as they are submitted. The Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office may propose a TMA that crosses bargaining unit lines or that is intra-unit but not on the list described in 9.5.3.C. The committee may by unanimous vote approve assignments that cross bargaining unit lines. The representatives of the union affected by a proposed intra-unit TMA not on the list may unanimously approve such assignment. If the Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office, the union presidents and Labor Relations Manager agree in writing, additional TMA’s may be added to or removed from the list set forth in section 9.5.3.C.
On written notice delivered to the others within 150 and 180 days before the expiration date of this agreement, (either SEIU, ATU, or the District) may terminate further use or consideration of inter-bargaining unit TMA’s and such use or consideration as occurs during the life of this agreement shall not be deemed precedent setting. The parties further agree that the relaxation of jurisdictional boundaries or rights permitted under this section is experimental in nature, restricted exclusively to this section, and may not be relied on as a precedent in any future dealings between them or any other bargaining unit.

The Benefits Analyst may, after obtaining all necessary authorizations to release medical information, review the employee's medical records, confer with the employee's doctor and/or schedule an examination with a District-selected doctor to determine what type of work accommodations are required. All proposed accommodations or temporary modified positions/ assignments will be reviewed by a District-accepted physician, which may be the employee's physician, if said physician is selected by the District for this purpose, to determine if the job requirements/assignments are within the employee's physical and mental abilities. Any disputes will be handled in accordance with Section 9.3 of the Agreement.
28
2.	Accommodation Review:	The Benefits Analyst will discuss
accommodation options with a Department representative to determine if accommodations can be made for the employee's disability on a limited term basis without adversely affecting operations or services.

b.	reassignment of non-essential duties; and
c.	alternate temporary work assignments.
3.	Alternate Temporary Modified Positions/Assignments:
a.	The [Benefits] Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Office will follow the sequence outlined below in determining whether alternate temporary modified work positions/assignments may be made:
1)	consider returning the employee to work in his/her current position in a modified capacity;
2)	when, in the District's judgment, this is not possible, consider an alternate temporary position/assignment in the employee's department (Alternate placement within the employee's department will not involve placement in a position represented by a different bargaining unit.);
3)	thereafter, consider an alternate position/ assignment outside the department (Placement outside the department will not involve placement in a position represented by a different bargaining unit.); and
4)	consider an alternate non-represented position/ assignment outside the bargaining unit. Employees placed in non-represented positions/ assignments retain the contractual protections provided for in the CBA of their respective Unions.

d.	If there are no temporary help requests available which the employee is qualified to fill, the Benefits Office will determine if there are any assignments on the modified assignment list which the employee is medically qualified to perform.
e.	If a temporary modified position/assignment is available, for which the employee meets the minimum qualifications, the Benefits Analyst will confer with the appropriate department regarding placing the disabled employee in the temporary modified position/ assignment.
f.	If the Department Head or designee agrees with the recommendation, the employee and the Union will be so notified.
g.	If the hiring department for the potential position/ assignment believes the disabled employee is not qualified, for any reason, to perform the duties of the temporary modified position/assignment, the employee will remain off work. The [Benefits Analyst] Senior Personnel Analyst of the Disability Programs Office will, after consultation with the District’s Office of Civil Rights, review the matter with [Labor Relationa-Aff irmative Action, -a Department representative, and a Union represent-ative If the question of qualifications for the position cannot be resolved with the Department, the decision of] the Department Manager of [Employee—Relations] Human Resources whose decision will be binding on the hiring department except as provided in h below.

19.2 STAFF ASSISTANTS, CLERICAL AND ENGINEERING AIDES
Staff Assistants, Clerical and Engineering Aides shall have the option of selecting one of the following alternate work schedules:
Standard eight (8) hour, five (5) day work week.
Flextime - The beginning and ending hours of the standard eight (8) hour, five (5) day work week may be selected to provide for an eight (8) hour work day with a forty-five (45) minute unpaid lunch.
Band-time hours within which the selection may be made are 0615 and 1900. On July 1 and January 1 of each contract year, the Staff Assistants, Clerical and Engineering Aides whose work week falls within the Flextime option may, at Management's discretion, reschedule their beginning and ending work hours.
4-10 Work Week - A work day shall consist of ten (10) hours of work, with a scheduled starting time, a forty-five (45) minute unpaid lunch, and three (3) fifteen (15) minute paid break periods. The assigned work week shall consist of four (4) work days within a seven (7) consecutive day period, with a minimum of two (2) consecutive days off. Vacation and Sick Leave shall be accrued and used in accordance with Section 13.2. Holidays shall be accrued and paid in accordance with Section 13.2. Overtime shall be paid in accordance with Sections 13.2 and 14.1.
9/80 Work Schedule - The 9/80 work schedule shall consist of eight (8) nine-hour days and one (1) eight-hour day. A work day shall consist of nine (9) consecutive hours of work (except on alternate weeks when one (1) work day shall consist of eight (8) consecutive hours of work) set between the hours of 0615 and 1900. A work period within this plan shall consist of a total of eighty (80) hours worked. As a general rule, employees will be required to take every other Friday off as part of the three days off portion of the schedule. The Friday the employee works shall be the eight-hour day. (Depending on departmental scheduling, an alternate compressed eight-hour day off may be assigned.) Arbitrary switching of the compressed day off will not be permitted except as approved by the individual department on a case-by-case basis. If a holiday falls on a 9/80 employee’s normal 9 hour workday, the Holiday shall be paid at a 9 hour rate of pay. Holidays falling on an employee’s RDO or 8 hour day shall be paid at an 8 hour rate of pay.
3
2001
The 9/80 plan modifies an employee's workweek as defined by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). This change to the work week is not made to avoid the payment of overtime. The eight-hour day and the day off are the same day of the week, generally alternating Fridays. However this does not preclude the parties, by mutual agreement, from using other than Fridays for implementation of the program. The work week is divided midway through the eight-hour day and the day off.
Employees participating in the 9/80 Work Schedule shall be subject to departmental guidelines regarding the implementation of said schedule.
The District and/or participatory Department(s) may unilaterally terminate or suspend the 9/80 Work Schedule or an employee's participation in said schedule at any time for reasons such as an emergency or operational necessity as determined by Management, the employee's failure to comply with this section and/or Departmental guidelines, etc.
Such selection among all of the above alternatives must be consistent with operations scheduling requirements of individual departments concerned and approved by the department manager.
Minute Clarification
The parties agree that the various work week alternatives contained in this Section are options available to Staff Assistants, Clerical and Engineering Aides which may be pursued with their respective department supervisors/manager. However, implementation of any of these optional work weeks are subject to the approval of the appropriate department manager.

In instances where operational needs prevent the supervisor from granting the specific request, the representative and the supervisor shall immediately pick an alternate, mutually agreed upon time for the future conduct of the requested Union business. Supervisors shall make a reasonable effort to grant authorized Union business as requested or as soon as operationally possible, when the original request cannot be granted. If the supervisor fails to immediately cooperate in the effort to pick an alternate, mutually agreed upon time, the representative shall be allowed release time as originally requested. Misuse of Union business by a Union representative shall subject the Union representative to disciplinary action and/or loss of pay consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. If the Union determines there to be an abuse by the District with respect to the loss of pay and/or the imposition of discipline in this context, the Union shall resort solely to the grievance procedure and seek such remedy as it believes to be appropriate. Self-help in this area will not be countenanced.
In the event of meetings or hearings concerning non- spontaneous matters not requiring immediate resolution, there will be twenty-four (24) hours notice to the immediate supervisor of those employees who are to attend such meetings or hearings. Those employees attending such meetings or hearings must be directly concerned with the subject of the meetings or hearings. In the event the number of employees required in attendance raise operational concerns, a schedule of staggered appearances shall be worked out between the parties.
Upon formal designation, Union representatives employed by the District will not be transferred from the assignment shift or location they hold at the time of their election or appointment unless mutually agreed. They will be given the privilege of utilizing using the District's inter-office mail, email and existing a telephone facilities as may reasonably be necessary in the conducting of Union business. E-mail use is permissible by stewards for corresponding with District management or individual employees on pending union business if the steward has an assigned PC with email access with no global e-mail use. The District may revoke assignment of any PC at any time. The District will explore the possibility of providing an electronic bulletin board on the District’s intranet for posting of notices and information by the Union.

28.3 CLASSIFICATION PLAN
The District and Union may from time to time, agree to conduct joint studies of job design, classification and compensation in, connection with actual or anticipated organizational change or changes in the District’s operating environment. Changes in the terms and conditions of employment resulting from the discussion of such studies may be implemented upon signature of the Labor Relations Manager and affected Chapter President.
The Union and District shall each appoint up to five (5) persons to serve on a Study Oversight Committee. District representatives shall include a member of the District’s Personnel Unit a representative of the Labor Relations Unit, and representatives of the affected operating units.
The first joint study conducted pursuant to the above paragraph shall be initiated within thirty (30) days after the signing date of this agreement as provided below. The following terms shall guide such study
17
2001
The Members of the Committee shall initially meet to discuss the steps needed to perform the study. This shall include, but is not limited to:
The scope of the existing jobs and functions that will be encompassed by the study.
The design of jobs affected by the organizational or environmental change
The locations, times, and freguency with which the affected functions are or would be performed.
The drafting of related job descriptions.
The performance of a market comparability study if needed to estimated the appropriated compensations level of jobs included in the study.
The use of expert consultants and in-house staff to assist in performing the study.
The initial study shall include the following classifications:
AFC Technician
Communications Electronic Technician
Computer Electronic Technician Electrician
Elevator/Escalator
Train control Electronic Technician
Transit Vehicle Mechanic
Transit Vehicle Electronic Technician
Structures Inspector
Track Eguipment Operator
The Classification Plan (Plan) purpose is to more appropriately describe, classify, allocate, and reallocate District work for more operational effectiveness and efficiency. In order to fully implement the Plan the following procedures shall be followed, which affect employee pay, unit representation, filling of position vacancies, and progression and promotion:
A.	"Red Circling" for Reallocated Employees: In instances where an employee's work in the then existing classification (old classification) is reallocated by downgrade in accordance with the Plan's new classification structure, then that employee's pay will be "red circled". "Red circled" means that the employee shall continue to be paid at his/her present rate of pay, but will receive future pay increases and benefit applicable to the old classification until such time as he/she vacates the position. When the "red circled" employee vacates his/her position in the old classification for any reason, the vacant position shall be filled within the new classification structure and pay range.
B.	Non-represented Position Transfer to Bargaining Unit Under the Plan (Grandfather Clause): Under the Plan some previously existing non-represented employee positions have been identified for reallocation to bargaining unit positions as the result of the Plan implementation. In that event, the incumbent non-represented employee shall have the option of remaining non-represented or be transferred and represented by the bargaining unit. The District is responsible for establishing the appropriate procedure for the then non-represented employee to exercise this option/election. Should the incumbent non-represented employee elect not to be included in the bargaining unit, then the incumbent employee shall remain exempt from Union representation as long as he/she remains in the position which was identified for reallocation to the bargaining unit. However, when that incumbent vacates the position it shall be included in the bargaining unit and the new employee will be represented by the Union.

C.	Pool Posting for District-wide Generic Classification *: The District continues its proposal for modifying and expanding use of its pool posting procedure.
D.	"Deep Classification" Progression and Promotion Procedures*-!-: This procedure applies to those classifications specifically enumerated in minute clarification. Upon the Department Head's written certification that the employee has met both the minimum qualifications of the higher level classification and any "predetermined criteria" established for movement between the various classification levels, the employees in these classifications may progress and be promoted within the classification series from level-to-level.
* Minute Clarification
-i-The "Deep Classification" concept refers to the following specific classifications: Junior Applications Programmer Analyst; Applications Programmer Analyst; and Senior Applications Programmer Analyst. Employees within any of these classifications are permitted to perform the "full range" of duties and responsibilities identified for any level of these classifications.

A.	Employees will suffer no loss of pay as a result of the pay progression.
B.	Entry and training rates are eliminated
C.	The pay progression of 76.5%, 79.5%, 90%, and 100% (top rate) apply to all base rates of pay. All percentages are based on the top rate.

D.	The new pay progression is effective July 1,1997., the effective date of the labor agreement.

F.	Employees hired on-or after January 1,1995 and before July 1, 1997 will have their current rate of pay slotted into the corresponding step-in the new pay progression. This is applicable to employees who were previously on-pay step-or-in positions whose rates of pay were flatrated.- If-the current rate of pay is higher than the new-corresponding pay progression-step, the current rate of pay will be “red-circled”. The.
19
2001
G.F. Employees hired on or after January 1, 1995 and before July 1, 1997 will not have their moves to higher pay rates subject to postponement for discipline. Employees on pay progression whose step has been withheld for discipline will be made whole.
H.G. New employees that are hired will be placed at the first year pay progression rate (76.5%) of their classification pursuant to Section 28.4 Base Wage Schedule. New employees will progress through each successive step based on their date of hire/anniversary date with the District.
