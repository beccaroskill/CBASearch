It is understood that on any project where drug testing is required, all job applicants, employees and representatives of the company (including owners) working at that jobsite, all subcontractors of the company and their employees at that jobsite and any representatives of Local 66 conducting business at the jobsite shall be tested.
B.	PRE-EMPLOYMENT
It is agreed that a job applicant shall be tested as soon as practical after a conditional offer of employment.

C.	ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT
It is agreed that persons involved in a work related accident or incident that results in property or equipment damage or injury requiring treatment defined as recordable by OSHA/ WISHA Regulations may be required to submit to a test.
D.	PROBABLE CAUSE
It is agreed that a person may be tested for probable cause in situations based on objective evidence about the employee’s conduct in the workplace that would cause a reasonable person to believe that the employee is demonstrating signs of impairment due to alcohol or drugs. Being involved in an incident may be sufficient to establish probable cause.
Those to be tested in the event of an accident or incident shall be by mutual agreement of the foreman on the project and a management representative responsible for the project.
1.	Examples of objective evidence include when an employee shows signs of impairment such as difficulty in maintaining balance, slurred speech, erratic or atypical behavior or otherwise appears unable to perform his/her job in a safe manner.
2.	Those to be tested in a probable cause situation shall be determined by observation of two (2) individuals, one of whom must be a union member that actually observed the employee’s behavior.
E.	COMMERCIAL DRIVERS LICENSE TESTING
If a Commercial Drivers License, C.D.L., is required as a condition of employment, new hire employees will be tested as soon as practical after a condition of employment is offered. Existing employees, who are members of SMWIA, will be given a forty-five (45) day prior notice of intent to test as a condition of obtaining or maintaining a Commercial Drivers License.
SECTION 3.	For all tests required under this program:
A.	Costs for tests shall be paid by the employer except for pre-employment screening which shall be paid by the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee.
B.	Employees will be paid actual time for testing except in the case of pre-employment screening.
C.	Any employee who tests positive will be provided with information regarding the Northwest Sheet Metal Workers Health Care Employee Assistance Program - E.A.P. Any employee who tests positive shall be given the opportunity for job retention so long as s/he agrees in writing to undergo an evaluation by the E.A.P. and to participate in and complete all recommendations made by the E.A.P. following the evaluation. Any employee who tests positive, does not agree to participate in the E.A.P. program and subsequently is released from employ by the employer may be redispatched to that employer and the employer may require the employee to submit to a substance abuse test as a condition of employment.
D.	Reasonable efforts will be made by the employer to acquire and provide to the employee test results that are positive, when requested by the employee.
E.	All facilities used for testing must have laboratories that are approved either by the substance abuse and mental health administration, or the College of American Pathologists under the Forensic Urine Drug Testing Program (FUDT).
Specimen collection and substance abuse testing under this agreement shall be performed in accordance with regulations and procedures approved by the United States Department of Transportation Regulations for alcohol and drug testing.
