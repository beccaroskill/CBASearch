Such consent shall be in a form acceptable to the Employer, and shall bear the signature of the employee. An employee may withdraw his/her Union dues check-off authorization by giving at least sixty (60) days notice in writing to his/her department head.

The Employer shall deduct dues or an agency fee from the pay of employees who request such deduction in accordance with this Article and transmit such funds in accordance with departmental policy as of July 1, 1976 to the Treasurer of the Union together with a list of employees whose dues or agency fees are transmitted provided that the State Treasurer is satisfied by such evidence that he/she may require that the Treasurer of the Union has given to the Union a bond, in a form approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Revenue, for the faithful performance of his/her duties, in a sum and with such surety or securities as are satisfactory to the State Treasurer.
Section 5

C.	When, as the result of the settlement of a grievance or arbitration award the Employer awards back pay to an employee, dues shall be deducted from the back pay payment, such that:
1.	the gross payment shall be divided by the employee's rate of pay to determine the number of weeks of pay in the settlement.
2.	the rate of union dues for the period of this settlement shall be multiplied by the number of weeks [see (1) above] to determine the amount of dues owed. This amount shall be deducted from the settlement and paid by the Employer to the Union. The balance shall be paid to the employee.

ARTICLE 6 ANTI-DISCRIMINATION AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION
Section 1
The Employer and the Union agree not to discriminate in any way against employees covered by this Agreement on account of race, religion, creed, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, mental or physical handicap, union activity or veteran status.
Section 2
The Union and the Employer agree that when the effects of employment practices, regardless of their intent, discriminate against any group of people on the basis of race, religion, age, sex, national origin, or mental or physical handicap, specific positive and aggressive measures must be taken to redress the effects of past discrimination, to eliminate present and future discrimination, and to ensure equal opportunity in the areas of hiring, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment, layoff or termination, rate of compensation and in-service or apprenticeship training programs. Therefore the parties acknowledge the need for positive and aggressive affirmative action.
Section 3
The Statewide Labor/Management Committee established pursuant to ARTICLE 25 shall give priority to the area of affirmative action. The Committee shall review affirmative action programs and shall devote its best efforts to alleviating any obstacles that are found to exist to the implementation of the policy and commitments contained in the Governor's Executive Order No. 116 dated May 1, 1975, or as subsequently amended, or in Governor's Executive Order #253 (1988) or as subsequently amended.
Section 4
The Employer and the Union acknowledge that sexual harassment is a form of unlawful sex discrimination, and the parties mutually agree that no employee should be subjected to such harassment. The term sexual harassment as used herein is conduct such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which constitutes sexual harassment when:
A.	Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment;
B.	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or
C.	Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.
Section 5
A grievance alleging a violation of Section 4 of this Article shall be filed initially at Step II of the grievance procedure. Such action must be brought within 21 days from the alleged act or occurrence. However, an employee who has filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment under the Commonwealth's Statewide Sexual Harassment Policy may not file a grievance regarding those same allegations under this Section.
9
ARTICLE 6A
MUTUAL RESPECT
The Commonwealth and the Union agree that mutual respect between and among managers, employees, co-workers and supervisors is integral to the efficient conduct of the Commonwealth’s business. Behaviors that contribute to a hostile, humiliating or intimidating work environment, including abusive language or behavior, are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Employees who believe they are subject to such behavior should raise their concerns with an appropriate manager or supervisor as soon as possible, but no later than ninety (90) days from the occurrence of the incident(s). In the event the employee’s concerns are not addressed at the Agency level, whether informally or through the grievance procedure, within a reasonable period of time, the employee or the union may file a grievance at Step 3 of the grievance procedure as set forth in Article 23A. If an employee, or the Union, requests a hearing at Step 3, such hearing shall be granted. Grievances filed under this Article shall not be subject to the arbitration provisions set forth in Article 23A. No employee shall be subject to discrimination for filing a complaint, giving a statement, or otherwise participating in the administration of this process. Any employee who believes that he/she is subject to discrimination in this process may file his/her grievance directly to Step 3 as described above.
ARTICLE 7
WORKWEEK AND WORK SCHEDULES
Section 1	Scheduled Hours, Workweek, Workday
A.	Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the regular hours of work for fulltime employees shall be thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) hours per week excluding meal periods or forty (40) hours per week excluding meal periods, as has been established for that job title at the particular job location. Any employee whose regular workweek has averaged more than forty hours excluding meal periods in the past shall have a forty hour workweek.
B.	The work schedule, both starting times and quitting times, of employees shall be posted on a bulletin board at each work location or otherwise made available to employees and Union stewards.
C.	When the Employer desires to change the work schedule of employee(s) the Employer shall, whenever practicable, solicit volunteers from among the group of potentially affected employees, and select from among the qualified volunteers.
The Employer shall, except in emergency situations, give any affected employee whose schedule is being involuntarily changed ten (10) days written notice of such contemplated change. The provisions of this subsection shall not be used for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime.
D.	To the extent practicable, the normal work week shall consist of five (5) consecutive days, Monday through Friday, with the regular hours of work each day to be consecutive except for meal periods. Similarly, to the extent practicable, employees in continuous operations shall receive two (2) consecutive days off in each seven (7) day period. The parties shall establish a joint Union/Management Committee in each Department/Agency to study those situations where such work schedules do not now prevail in an attempt to determine the practicability of establishing a regular work schedule for employees which might consist of five (5) consecutive workdays followed by two (2) consecutive days off. The
10
joint Union/Management Committee shall also study those situations in each facility where the employee works more than one shift in a workweek in an effort to establish more uniform work schedules. Should the parties not be able to come to agreement on this issue, then the parties may seek resolution at Step III of the grievance procedure. This subsection should not apply to employees in authorized flexible hours programs.
E.	Employees in the Department of Youth Services who engage in field trips from the forestry camps should work a regular schedule of not more than twenty-six (26) days of work followed by not more than thirteen (13) days off.
F.	The parties acknowledge the benefit of establishing alternative work schedules, including but not limited to flexible hours, staggered hours, part-time, telecommuting and job sharing where such programs contribute to the efficient delivery of state services. The Labor-Management Committee established pursuant to ARTICLE 25 of this Agreement shall meet to determine the feasibility of establishing such options where they do not currently exist, to monitor existing programs, and to recommend changes where appropriate.
Upon the written request of either party, the Union shall meet with local and central office representatives relative to developing and implementing Flex-time/Alternative work schedules where feasible for an individual worksite/facility or for the Department/Agency. Following said meetings where there continues to be any unresolved issues the areas of dispute may be brought at the request of either party to the Human Resources Division to work toward a possible resolution.
All agreements reached pursuant to the above paragraph shall be submitted to the Union and the Human Resources Division for approval.
Section 2	Overtime
A.	A full-time employee shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her
regular rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of forty (40) hours per week.
B.	A part-time employee as defined in Article 1, Section 2(C) of the Agreement
whose regular workweek is less than forty (40) hours:
1.	shall be compensated at his/her regular rate for authorized overtime work performed up to forty (40) hours per week that is in excess of his/her regular workweek, and,
2.	shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of forty (40) hours in a workweek.
3.	Except as outlined in Article 7, Section 2, Paragraph D of the Agreement, paid sick leave shall not be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating any overtime compensation.
4.	An employee whose regular workweek is less than forty (40) hours shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of eight (8) hours in his/her regular work day except that:
a.	an employee whose regular work day is more than eight (8) hours shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular
11
hourly rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of his/her regular work day and,
b.	as outlined in Article 7, Section 2, Paragraph D of the Agreement any paid sick leave used during that payroll period shall be excluded from such overtime calculations.
C.	The Employer shall not, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime, curtail the scheduled hours of an employee during the remainder of a workweek in which the employee has previously worked hours beyond his/her normally scheduled workday. This Paragraph shall not apply to employees who, because of the nature of the duties of their positions, work an irregular workday, nor shall it apply to employees who have been permitted by the Employer to participate in an approved voluntary flexible hours program that has been duly authorized by the Appointing Authority and by the Personnel Administrator.
D.	1. With the exception of paid sick leave, all time for which an employee is on full paid leave status shall be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime compensation.
2.	However, an employee who uses sick leave during the same work week in which he/she works mandatory overtime shall have the opportunity to replace up to three (3) shifts per fiscal year of sick leave with his/her available personal leave, vacation leave, accrued compensatory time or holiday compensatory time. Furthermore, up to two (2) days of sick leave may be counted toward such overtime calculation if the employee submits medical evidence pursuant to Article 8, Section 1 of the Agreement.
E.	There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of the premium pay for overtime work provided for in this Agreement.
F.	Upon the request of an employee, an Appointing Authority may grant, at its discretion, compensatory time in lieu of payment for overtime at a rate not less than one and a half hours for each hour of employment for which overtime compensation would be required under this Article. Such compensatory time shall not be accumulated in excess of ninety (90) hours. At the discretion of the Appointing Authority, employees shall be allowed to receive the cash value of their compensatory time up to one (1) week per year when they are denied the use of that time.
An Appointing Authority shall permit the use of compensatory time within a reasonable time from the employee's request, provided the use of compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operation of a department or agency.
Upon termination, an employee shall be paid for all unused compensatory time at the final regular rate of pay.
G.	Agencies should make every effort to pay overtime in the same pay period that the overtime was earned. However, it is understood that there are situations in which the overtime entries cannot be made until the following pay period (e.g. overtime earned in the first week of the pay period should be paid within the same pay period; overtime worked in the second week of the pay period should be paid in the following pay period).
H.	Overtime shall be distributed as equitably and impartially as practicable among persons in each work location who ordinarily perform such related work in the normal course
12
of their workweek. Department heads and union representatives at each location shall work out procedures for implementing this policy of distributing overtime work.
I.	Prior to implementing mandatory overtime a reasonable effort will be made to solicit volunteers.
J.	The provisions of this Section shall not apply to employees on full travel status to the extent permitted by law.

This Section shall not apply to an employee who is called in to start his/her shift early and who continues to work that shift.
An employee who is called back to work as outlined above but is not called back to a work place shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours pay at his/her regular overtime rate. For the purpose of this Section, a "work place" is defined as any place other than the employee's home to which he/she is required to report to fulfill the assignment.

1.	When an employee cannot perform his/her duties because he/she is incapacitated by personal illness or injury.
2.	An employee may use up to a maximum of sixty (60) days per calendar year for the purpose of:
a.	caring for the spouse, foster child, step-parent, step-child, brother, sister, grandparent, grandchild, person for whom the employee is legal guardian, child or parent of either the employee or his/her spouse, or a relative living in the immediate household who is seriously ill; or
b.	parental leave due to the birth or adoption of a child, to be concluded within twelve (12) months of the date of the birth or adoption. Eligible employees utilizing sick leave under this Section shall not be required to submit a medical certification, unless the Appointing Authority has reason to believe that the birth or adoption claim was not genuine. This leave benefit shall be in addition to the ten (10) days of paid leave set forth in Section 8 (A)(7) below.
15
3.	An employee may use up to a maximum of ten (10) days of accrued sick leave in a calendar year in order to attend to necessary preparations and legal requirements related to the employee's adoption of a child, except that in no event may an employee charge more than a total of sixty (60) days of accrued sick leave in a calendar year for adoption related purposes.
4.	An employee may use up to ten (10) days of accrued sick leave per calendar year for necessary preparations and/or legal proceedings related to foster care of DSS children, such as foster care reviews, court hearings and MAPS training for pre-adoptive parents.

E.	A full-time employee shall not accrue sick leave credit for any month in which he/she
was on leave without pay or absent without pay for a total of more than one day.
F.	Upon return to work following a sick leave in excess of five (5) consecutive work days, an employee may be required to undergo a medical examination to determine his/her fitness for work. The employee, if he/she so desires, may be represented by a physician of his/her choice.
G.	Sick leave must be charged against unused sick leave credits in units of one-half hour or full hours, but in no event may the sick leave credits used be less than the actual time off.
H.	Any employee having no sick leave credits, who is absent due to illness shall be placed on leave without pay unless said employee requests use of other available leave time which is subsequently approved.
I.	An employee who is reinstated or reemployed after an absence of less than three (3) years shall be credited with his/her sick leave credits at the termination of his/her prior employment. An employee who is reinstated or reemployed after a period of three (3) years or more shall receive prior sick leave credits, if approved by the Personnel Administrator where such absence was caused by:
1.	Illness of said employee;

J.	A regular part-time employee shall not accrue sick leave credit for any month in which he/she was on leave without pay or absent without pay in the same proportion that his/her service bears to one day of service of a full-time employee.
16
K.	Employees requesting sick leave under this Article must notify the designated representative of the Appointing Authority at least one (1) hour before the start of his/her work shift on each day of absence. In single-shift agencies, employees requesting sick leave under this Article must notify the designated representative not later than fifteen (15) minutes after the start of the work day on each day of absence. Repeated violations of these notification procedures may result in the denial of sick leave. Such notice must include the general nature of the disability and the estimated period of time for which the employee will be absent. Where circumstances warrant, the Appointing Authority or designee shall reasonably excuse the employee from such daily notification.
L.	Where the Appointing Authority has reason to believe that sick leave is being abused, the Appointing Authority may require satisfactory medical evidence from the employee (see Appendix G-1 or G-3). Sick leave abuse shall be defined as the use of sick time for purposes other than is listed in Section D above. This request shall be reduced to writing and shall cite specific reasons for the request. When medical evidence is requested, such request shall be made as promptly as possible. To the extent practicable, the employee shall receive prior notice that the Appointing Authority believes he/she is abusing sick leave and that he/she may be required to produce medical evidence for future use of sick leave.
In order to clarify existing practice, satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by a licensed Physician, Physician's Assistant, Nurse Practitioner, Chiropractor, Dentist or Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker working within his/her area of expertise, that he/she has personally examined the employee and shall contain the nature of the illness or injury, unless identified as being of a confidential nature; a statement that the employee was unable to perform his or her duties due to the specific illness or injury on the days in question; and the prognosis for the employee's return to work. In cases where the employee is absent due to a family or household illness or injury, as defined in Section 1(C)(2) of this Article, satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by medical personnel mentioned above indicating that the person in question has been determined to be seriously ill and needing care on the days in question. A medical statement provided pursuant to this Article shall list the address and telephone number of the attending physician or medical provider. Failure to produce such evidence within ten (10) days of its request may result, at the discretion of the Appointing Authority, in denial of sick leave for the period of absence.
If the illness or injury is identified as confidential in nature, the employee shall submit a completed Confidential Illness Certification from the attending medical provider(s) as specified above. The Confidential Illness Certification (see Appendix G-2), shall contain the medical provider's signed statement that he/she has personally examined the employee, that the employee was unable to perform his/her duties because he/she was/is incapacitated due to illness or injury for the duration of the sick leave period in question, and the prognosis for the employee's return to work. Failure to produce this certification for a confidential illness within ten (10) calendar days from the date of the request may result in the denial of the sick leave in question.
The medical provider's determination of the employee's incapacitation for duty shall be based upon the provider's assessment of the employee's health condition for the period of sick leave utilized, and by reviewing the employee's specific job duties and responsibilities as outlined in the Form 30 position description or current job description. It is the Employer's responsibility to provide the employee with a copy of the Form 30 or current job description, G-1, G-2 and G-3 forms.
17
M.	In extraordinary circumstances, where the Appointing Authority, or the designated person in charge if the Appointing Authority is unavailable, has sufficient reason to believe that an employee has a mental or physical incapacity rendering him/her unfit to perform his/her job or which jeopardizes workplace safety or stability, the Appointing Authority or the designated person in charge may authorize the removal of such employee from the workplace. It is understood that the employee might not recognize or acknowledge such unfitness.
The employee shall receive written notice from the Appointing Authority that specifically states the employee's actions leading to the removal and what is required of the employee before he/she returns to the workplace. Such notice shall be given to the employee at the time of the removal or within five (5) days of the removal.
The employee shall be required to undergo a medical examination to determine his/her fitness for work. The employee, if he/she so desires, may be represented by a physician of his or her own choice, in which case such verification and cost shall be the responsibility of the employee. However, the Appointing Authority shall reserve the right to obtain a second opinion from a Commonwealth designated physician to determine fitness for work. Such cost shall be borne by the Appointing Authority. The employee shall provide the Appointing Authority with appropriate medical documentation prior to or upon his/her return to the workplace.
Grievances resulting from the denial of an Appointing Authority to return the employee to his/her position after he/she has been removed from the workplace in accordance with this Section shall be processed in an expedited manner at Step III of the grievance process.
N.	No employee shall be entitled to a leave under the provisions of this Section in excess of the accumulated sick leave credits due such employee.
O.	Employees whose service with the Commonwealth is terminated shall not be entitled to any compensation in lieu of accumulated sick leave credits. Employees who retire shall be paid twenty percent (20%) of the value of their unused accrued sick leave at the time of their retirement. Upon the death of an employee who dies while in the employ of the Commonwealth, twenty percent (20%) of the value of the unused sick leave which the employee had personally earned and accrued as of the time of death shall be paid in the following order of precedence, as authorized by the Personnel Administrator upon request of the Appointing Authority of the deceased employee: first, to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries, if any, lawfully designated by the employee under the state employees' retirement system; and second, if there be no such designated beneficiary, to the estate of the deceased. It is understood that any such payment will not change the employee's pension benefit.
P.	Sick leave credits earned by an employee following a return to duty after a leave without pay or absence without pay shall not be applied to such period of time.
Q.	An employee who while in the performance of his/her duty receives bodily injuries resulting from acts of violence of patients or prisoners in his/her custody, and who as a result of such injury would be entitled to benefits under Chapter 152 of the General Laws, shall, if entitled under Chapter 30, Section 58 of the General Laws, be paid the difference between the weekly cash benefits to which he/she would be entitled under said Chapter 152 and his/her regular salary without such absence being charged against available sick leave credits, even if such absence may be for less than six (6) calendar days duration.
R.	The parties recognize that any unnecessary delay by agencies in processing
18
Industrial Accident paperwork is a problem of mutual concern. The parties therefore agree to establish a sub-committee to study the manner in which the various departments and agencies process the paperwork associated with the processing and disposition of Industrial Accident claims. Said sub-committee shall make such recommendations to expedite such claims as it shall deem appropriate.
S.	The parties agree to work together to develop standardized forms concerning FMLA leave.
Section 2	Domestic Violence Leave
An employee may use up to a maximum of fifteen (15) paid days per calendar year for the purpose of arranging for the care of him/herself, his/her child(ren), elderly parent(s) and spouse or for attending to necessary legal proceedings or activities in instances where the employee, his/her child(ren), elderly parents and spouse is/are a victim(s) of domestic abuse and where the employee is not the perpetrator.

19
used on an hour-for-hour basis, e.g. one hour charged for one hour used and may be used in conjunction with vacation leave. Charges to personal leave may be allowed in units of not less than one-half hour. An employee who cannot utilize his/her personal leave in the months of November and December, due to the operational needs of the Department/Agency shall be permitted to carry-over one day of personal leave credit not utilized, to the next calendar year.

21
1.	An Appointing Authority shall grant to a full-time or part-time employee who has completed her/his probationary period, or if there is no such probationary period, has been employed for at least three (3) consecutive months, an unpaid leave of absence for up to twenty-six (26) weeks in conjunction with the birth, adoption or placement of a child as long as the leave concludes within twelve (12) months following the birth or placement. For this leave, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. 2611 et seq., and accompanying regulations, 29 C.F.R. Part 825, the employer may request medical certification after the leave commences if the Employer later has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration. Such certification shall be in accordance with Section 1 (l) of this Article.
2.	At least thirty (30) days in advance, the employee shall submit to the Appointing Authority a written notice of his/her intent to take such leave and the dates and expected duration of such leave. If thirty (30) days notice is not possible, the employee shall give notice as soon as practicable. The employee shall provide upon request by the Appointing Authority proof of the birth or placement or adoption of a child.
3.	If an employee has accrued sick leave, personal leave, compensatory leave, or vacation credits at the commencement of his/her family leave, the employee may use such leave credits for which he/she may be eligible under the sick leave, personal leave or vacation provisions of this Agreement. The Appointing Authority may, in his/her discretion, assign an employee to backfill for an employee who is on family leave. Such assignment may not be subject to the grievance procedure.
4.	At the expiration of the family leave, the employee shall be returned to the same equivalent position with the same status, pay and length of service credit as of the date of her/his leave. If during the period of the leave, employees in an equivalent position have been laid off through no fault of their own, the employee will be extended the same rights or benefits, if any, extended to employees of equal length of service in the equivalent position in the department.
5.	Employees taking an unpaid leave of absence under this provision will accrue sick and vacation leave benefits only for the first eight (8) weeks of such unpaid leave. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement to the contrary, the family leave granted under this Article shall not affect the employee's right to receive any contractual benefits for which he/she was eligible at the time of his/her leave.
6.	During the time an employee is on family leave, the employee shall be entitled to group health insurance coverage benefits on the same terms and conditions in effect at the time the leave began, provided the employee continues to pay the required employee share of premium while on leave.

An Appointing Authority shall grant to any employee who has completed his/her probationary period or, if there is no probationary period, who has been employed at least three (3) consecutive months, an unpaid leave of absence for up to twenty-six (26) weeks to care for a spouse, child or parent who has a serious health condition or for a serious health condition which prevents the employee from being able to perform the functions of his/her position. For this leave, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. 26111 et seq., and accompanying regulations, 29 C.F.R. Part 825, the Employer may request medical certification after the leave commences if the employer later has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave or its duration. Said certification shall be in accordance with Section 1 (l) of this Article.

In the event there is a conflict between the second opinion and the original medical opinion, the Appointing Authority and the employee may resolve the conflict by obtaining the opinion of a third medical provider, who is approved jointly by the Appointing Authority and the employee, at the Appointing Authority's expense.
3.	Intermittent leave usage and modified work schedules may be granted where a spouse, child or parent has a serious medical condition and is dependent upon the employee for care. Where intermittent or a modified work schedule is medically necessary, the employee and Appointing Authority shall attempt to work out a schedule which meets the employee's needs without unduly disrupting the operations of the workplace.

D.	A committee shall be established to evaluate the experience of this program and to consider possible extension of the program and to make recommendations concerning both.
E.	Effective July 1, 1997, spouses of full time employees shall be eligible for the remission benefits contained in this Article and subject to the other provisions of this Article. It is understood that any program of spousal eligibility developed by the Board of Higher Education in conjunction with the Employer (HRD) require the subordination of spousal eligibility rights to those remission benefit rights extended to full time state employees in different bargaining units as well as full time employees covered by the provisions of this agreement.
ARTICLE 13C

37
ARTICLE 14 SENIORITY, TRANSFERS, PROMOTIONS, REASSIGNMENTS, FILLING OF VACANCIES, AND NEW POSITIONS
Section 1
A promotion shall mean advancement to a higher salary grade within the jurisdiction of the employee's Appointing Authority or an appointment to another title, which is not to a higher salary grade, but where substantially dissimilar requirements prevent a transfer under Section 4.
This Article is applicable to all promotions except those reasonably anticipated to be for less than one year and its application in all cases is restricted to employees who possess the educational, training, and/or experience requirements established by the Personnel Administrator for appointment to the relevant position. This Article shall apply when promoting full-time employees to positions other than positions to be filled by appointment from a civil service eligible list.
In the event that a Civil Service examination for a position has been administered but scores have not been announced, the Appointing Authority shall initially restrict eligibility for application for promotion to such position to those employees who have taken the examination. In the event that Civil Service has published an eligible list of those who passed a Civil Service examination for a position but has not certified said list, the Appointing Authority shall initially restrict eligibility for application for promotion to such position to those who passed said examination.
All vacancies, excluding those reasonably anticipated to be for less than one year, shall be posted but will not limit the Employer from hiring from outside the Department/Agency. The Department/Agency may receive applications from persons outside the Department/ Agency and consider such applications in conjunction with applications from employees within the Department/Agency for any vacancy posted under the provisions of this Article. In the event a person is hired from outside the Department/Agency, such action shall be subject to the grievance procedure through Step III as provided by Article 23A of the Agreement if the Union alleges such employee does not meet the minimum requirements for the vacancy as determined by the Personnel Administrator. Both parties agree to submit the issue of hiring from the outside to a study committee. Such committee will, during the life of this Agreement, address the problems inherent in such hiring and will recommend possible solutions.
Section 2
A.	For positions in job grades 2 through 12 in Bargaining Units 8 and 10, the Appointing Authority will select the employee who is qualified to perform the work with the longest length of service in the work unit containing the vacancy. The Appointing Authority will make the selection from the appropriate applicants as set forth in paragraph C of this Section on the basis of ability to do the job and seniority within the appropriate work unit(s).
B.	The following procedures shall apply to promotions made pursuant to this Article within Bargaining Units 8 and 10 to positions in job grade 13 and above which have not been excluded from this procedure under the provisions of paragraph E of this Section.
The following factors in priority shall be used by the Appointing Authority or his/her designee in selecting the employee for a promotion:
38
1.	Ability to do the job.
2.	Education and training related to the vacant position.
3.	Seniority as measured by length of service within the
Appointing Authority.
4.	Experience in related work.
5.	Work history.
C.	For promotions made pursuant to this Article, the Appointing Authority shall
consider applicants and post promotional opportunities in the following sequence:
1.	Within the work unit.
2.	Within all other work units under the jurisdiction of the Appointing
Authority.
The work unit and/or work units shall be designated by the Appointing Authority. Once designated the work unit and/or work units shall not be arbitrarily changed.
D.	Unsuccessful applicants for posted vacancies shall receive a Notice of Non-Selection form (Appendix E) stating the reason(s) for non-selection in accordance with the criteria contained in Sections 2A and 2B of this Article. Such notice shall be given at the time the vacancy is filled.
E.	The titles specified in Appendix D of this Agreement are excluded from the promotion procedure set forth in this Article. The Employer shall provide to the Union as soon as compiled a list of the titles in those departments/agencies not listed in Appendix D to be excluded from the provisions of this Article.
The Union may negotiate with the Employer over the job titles added to Appendix D, which it believes should be subject to the provisions of this Article. If the parties are unable to agree as to whether a title(s) should be covered by this Article, the Union may submit its request for inclusion of specified title(s) directly to arbitration in accordance with Step IV of the grievance procedure. All titles in the Employer's list shall be excluded from the promotion procedure under this Article until such time as an arbitrator determines that such title(s) should be covered by the provisions of this Article. Any titles, which are not on a list of excluded titles, shall be covered by the provisions of this Article.
In the event that new titles are created by the Personnel Administrator, which the Employer considers necessary to be excluded from the provisions of this Article, it shall so notify the Union. The Union may negotiate with the Employer over whether such new titles shall be subject to the provisions of this Article.
If the parties are unable to agree as to whether a new title(s) should be covered by this Article then the Union may submit its request for inclusion of specified title(s) to arbitration in accordance with the grievance procedure provided for in this Agreement. All new titles on the Employer's list shall be excluded from the promotion procedure under this Article until such time as an arbitrator determines that such titles should be covered by the provisions of this Article. Any titles, which are not on a list of excluded titles, shall be covered by the provisions of this Article.
39
In deciding whether or not additional titles should be added to the list of titles in Appendix D, the arbitrator shall base his/her decision on whether or not the nature and character of the new titles is consistent with the nature and character of the titles already listed in Appendix D and on other appropriate factors.
Section 3
A.	Positions to be filled under the provisions of this Article shall be posted throughout the appropriate work unit(s) for ten (10) calendar days. The Appointing Authority may reasonably determine the positions in which employees must be employed and/or the requisite experience the employees must possess in order to be eligible to apply for a given promotion. The job posting shall include the job title, the current specific duties and qualifications in accordance with official job specifications, license and registration, salary grade, area of position, schedule of shift hours and days off.
B.	An employee promoted in accordance with this Article whose performance is "Below" expectations may be returned to his/her previous job title under the jurisdiction of the Appointing Authority. If an employee's performance is determined to be "Below" expectations at any time during the following probationary periods such determination shall not be subject to the grievance procedure:
Job grades 2 through 12	-	three months
Job grades 13 and above	-	six months
Any employee in a Professional Unit	-	nine months
C.	If the employee so requests within two (2) weeks prior to the mid-point of the above designated probationary periods, his/her supervisor shall meet with the employee and a union representative to discuss the employee's performance in the position.
D.	At any time prior to the mid-point of the above-designated probationary periods, an employee may request to return to his/her former job title under the jurisdiction of the Appointing Authority and such request will be granted.
E.	In the event an employee is returned to his/her former job title, the employee displaced by such return shall be returned to his/her former job title. Where more than one position in the back filled job title was filled pursuant to this Article, the employee last selected shall be the one displaced.
F.	If an employee is returned to his/her former job title pursuant to the provision of Paragraph B of this section, said employee will not be eligible for promotion pursuant to this Article for a period of nine (9) months.
G.	Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, employees may return to their former job titles under these provisions provided there is a position available under the jurisdiction of the Appointing Authority. In the event a position is not
available under the jurisdiction of the Appointing Authority said employee shall be covered by the layoff and recall Article of the Agreement.
H.	All promotions made pursuant to this Article shall be temporary or provisional appointments at least until the completion of the probationary period. All vacancies resulting from an employee's promotion pursuant to this Article shall be filled temporarily or provisionally at least until the promoted employee has completed his/her probationary period.
40
I.	Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, employees may, upon request, be granted a demotion under the provisions of this Article provided there is a position available under the jurisdiction of the Appointing Authority.
J.	No provision of the salary plan shall be used to discourage internal promotions.
Section 4	Transfers and Reassignments
A.	Transfers
1.	For the purpose of this Section a transfer shall be defined as:
a.	a change from one work unit or work facility to another work unit or work facility in the same Department/Agency without any change in classification; or
b.	a substantial change in duties without a change of work unit or facility as long as the requirements for appointment are not substantially different.
2.	a. An employee seeking a transfer to a different work unit shall submit a written transfer request to his/her Appointing Authority or designee prior to posting.
b. An employee seeking a transfer to a different work facility under the jurisdiction of another Appointing Authority shall submit a written transfer request to that Appointing Authority or designee.
3.	a. Selection between employees seeking a transfer other than a substantial change in duties shall be made on the basis of seniority from among those employees considered by the Appointing Authority to be able to adequately perform the duties of the position.
b. An employee seeking a transfer involving a substantial change in duties shall submit a written transfer request to his/her Appointing Authority or designee and selection shall be made on the basis of seniority from among those employees considered by the Appointing Authority to be qualified to perform the duties of the position.
4.	Requests for transfers shall be kept on file and shall be considered and, where appropriate, implemented by the Appointing Authority or designee prior to the filling of any vacancy.
5.	An employee who moves from one Appointing Authority within a Department/Agency to another facility under a different Appointing Authority within the same Department/Agency without a change in classification or job title and without an interruption of continuous service shall retain all seniority for the purpose of this Agreement and shall not otherwise be subject to a probationary period.
B.	Reassignment
1.	For the purpose of this section a reassignment shall be defined as a change involving different days off, shift or work location, but without a substantial change in duties and without any change in work unit or classification.
41
2.	An employee seeking a reassignment shall submit a written request to his/her Appointing Authority or designee.
3.	Selection between employees seeking a reassignment shall be made on the basis of seniority.
C.	Procedures
1.	Written request for transfer/reassignment shall remain active and on file for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months from the date of submission by the employee seeking the transfer/reassignment. Transfer/reassignment requests not approved within this period must be resubmitted by the employee in order to remain active for consideration.
2.	Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to preclude an employee from requesting and/or an Appointing Authority from granting any transfer/reassignment not referred to in this Section.
3.	Except in extraordinary situations, new employees shall have no transfer rights until the completion of their probationary period.
4.	Employees who are granted a voluntary transfer shall work in the position into which they have transferred for twelve (12) months before another voluntary transfer request may be granted.
5.	Notwithstanding the above sentence, the Employer may, at its sole discretion, grant an employee another voluntary transfer within the aforementioned twelve (12) month period.
D.	Transfers and Reassignments by the Employer
1.	In the event it becomes necessary for the Employer to involuntarily transfer or reassign an employee, the Employer will provide the employee at least ten (10) working days prior written notice, except in cases of emergencies involving the protection of the property of the Commonwealth or involving the health and safety of those persons whose care and/or custody have been entrusted to the Commonwealth. In emergency situations management shall, at the Union's request, provide the reason(s) for the transfer/reassignment. However, a declaration of said emergency shall not be used for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime. The Employer shall use the joint criteria of ability to do the job and inverse seniority in determining which of the potentially affected employees shall be transferred/reassigned.
2.	The Commonwealth and the Union recognize the efficiency of promoting energy saving endeavors by offering an alternative to employees who may commute lengthy distances to and from their homes to work. The parties therefore agree to initiate a pilot program to implement job swapping opportunities between employees that work in the same job title and functions and within the same agency, but at geographically disparate work locations. Employees requesting a swap may file their request with the Agency’s human resource office. When two or more employees submit matching swap requests the Agency shall favorably consider the swap unless one or more of the following conditions apply:
1.	The swap would unduly interrupt client services or operational efficiency at either or both of the swap locations
42
2.	One or more of the applicants has had an unsatisfactory performance review in the preceding year or one or more of the applicants currently has a corrective action plan in place
3.	One or more of the applicants would be unable to perform the duties of the position to which they wish to swap without substantial training
An employee who enters into a swap will not be able to do so again for two (2) years. Employees shall not be able to enter into a swap during their new employee or promotional probation period, nor within twelve (12) months of entering a job title.
Swap requests by two or more employees to the same position shall be determined by seniority as measured by length of service within the Agency. If seniority is equal, then length of state service will be used to determine the more senior employee.
The Office of Employee Relations, the designated Pilot Agencies and the Union shall establish a committee to review and monitor implementation of this program and recommend changes as necessary. This pilot program shall be in effect for two years from date of signing and shall be implemented in DEEC, MRC and MassHealth.
The parties agree that there shall be a special Labor Management Committee established to discuss telecommuting, 4-day work weeks and additional energy saving endeavors.
E.	Implementation
1.	For the purpose of this Section, seniority shall be defined as length of service in the Department/Agency. If seniority in the Department/Agency is equal, then length of state service will be used to determine the more senior employee.
2.	The Employer and the Union at the Agency level shall develop simplified
forms and procedures to implement the transfer and reassignment language contained in this Section and shall review its functioning periodically.
Section 5
All employees covered by this Agreement whose employment in a particular area, facility or Department/Agency is being phased out and who are being transferred or reassigned to another facility, area or Department/Agency covered by the provisions of this Agreement or any amendments thereto, shall bring to that area, facility, or Department/Agency all seniority rights they hold at the time of said transfer or reassignment.
Section 6
The Employer shall appoint to a permanent non-Civil Service vacancy the temporary employee with the most seniority in the job title within the work unit.
ARTICLE 15
CONTRACTING OUT
Section 1
There shall be a Special Labor Management Committee to advise the Secretary of A & F on contracting out of personnel services. The Committee shall consist of four (4) persons designated by the President of SEIU Local 509/Secretary of the Alliance and four (4) persons designated by the Personnel Administrator. Said Committee shall develop and recommend to the Secretary of A & F procedures and criteria governing the purchase of 43
contracted services by the Commonwealth where such services are of a type traditionally performed by bargaining unit employees.
Section 2
In the event that the President of SEIU Local 509/Secretary of the Alliance who represent(s) the affected employees, desire(s) to discuss the purchase of services which are of the type currently being provided by employees within a Department/Agency covered by this Agreement, that Principal(s) shall request in writing a meeting of the Special Labor Management Committee established in Section 1. The Committee shall examine both the cost effectiveness of such contracts and their impact on the career development of SEIU Local 509 members. In the event that the parties fail to reach an agreement in the Committee, the parties agree to submit the matter to an expedited fact-finding process.
Section 3
When a Department/Agency contracts out work which will result in the layoff of an employee who performs the function that is contracted out, the Union shall be notified and the Employer and the Union shall discuss the availability of similar positions within the Department/Agency for which the laid-off employee is determined to be qualified and the availability of any training programs which may be applicable to the employee. In reviewing these placement possibilities, every effort will be made to seek matches of worker skills and qualifications with available, comparable positions.
The Commonwealth will at all times comply with the provisions of Chapter 296 of the Acts of 1993.
Section 4
The parties agree that payroll arrangements such as the use of personal service contractors (“03”), vendor employees (“07”), and temporary employees have appropriate uses in the Commonwealth’s total personnel management plan but that such arrangements are not appropriate for use as substitutes for regular state employees. The parties agree to work together during the life of this Agreement to more clearly identify those situations where such arrangements are being utilized inappropriately and to correct them, and to discuss other of the Union’s related interest in the vendor contracting system.
Section 5
Persons who, prior to appointment to a state position as a regular "employee" (01 or 02) had rendered service under the direct control of the Commonwealth under the same or similar conditions of employment as 01 or 02 employees and who had been paid out of the 03 or 07 subsidiary accounts shall, upon becoming an "employee", be entitled to have the time worked under said 03 or 07 account considered subject to existing rules only for the following purposes:
A.	for placement on the step system under Article 12 of the collective bargaining agreement;
B.	for determining "continuous service" solely as it relates to "vacation status" under Article 9;
C.	for determining the seniority of said person(s) for the purposes of
Articles 14 and 18.
44
Nothing herein shall be construed as authorizing or approving retroactive wages or other benefits prior to the date such persons are appointed to official state positions (01 or 02) as employees in bargaining units 8 and 10.
It is agreed that employees wishing to have such service counted shall submit a request on a form supplied by the Commonwealth for that purpose and that subject to verification adjustments shall be made to salary and benefits.
The Employer shall notify employees in writing at their time of hire, on a form agreed-to by the parties, that they may request credit for prior service as a personal service contractor (03) or vendor employee (07). Employees shall have one (1) year from the date of notification to file a request for such credit. If the employee fails to file a request within the allotted one (1) year, they shall only be eligible to receive creditable service on a prospective basis.
ARTICLE 16
OUT OF TITLE WORK
Section 1	Work in a Lower Classification
While an employee is performing the duties of a position classified in a grade lower than that in which the employee performs his/her regular duties, he/she will be compensated at his/her regular rate of pay as if performing his/her regular duties.
Section 2	Work in a Higher Classification
A.	Any employee who is assigned by his/her Appointing Authority to a vacant position in a higher grade for a period of more than thirty (30) days shall receive the salary rate for the higher position from the first day of the appointment, provided such appointment is made pursuant to Civil Service law when applicable. Where the Appointing Authority anticipates that said assignment shall be for a period of more than thirty (30) days, the Appointing Authority or his/her designee shall provide the employee with written notice of the assignment to the vacancy, as soon after the beginning of the assignment as is administratively feasible.
B.	The Employer shall not utilize the provisions of this Section to circumvent the provisions of Article 14 of this Agreement.
C.	The provisions of paragraph B of this Section shall not be subject to the arbitration provisions of Article 23 and Article 23A of this Agreement.
Section 3	Overtime Compensation
A.	An employee who has been assigned to work in a higher classification shall have any overtime payments calculated on the step of the grade of the higher classification to which he/she has been assigned and upon which his/her regular weekly "out of title" salary is based.
B.	An employee who performs overtime work in a lower classification shall have overtime compensation computed at the employee's regular rate of compensation.
45
ARTICLE 17 CLASSIFICATION AND RE-CLASSIFICATION
Section 1	Class Specifications
The Human Resources Division shall determine:
A.	job titles;
B.	relationship of one	classification to the others; and
C.	job specifications.
The Human Resources Division shall consult with the Union regarding changes to existing job specifications or reallocations of existing classes.
The Employer shall provide the Union with a copy of the class specification of each title covered by this Agreement for which such a specification exists. Each employee shall be given a copy of the Class Specifications for his/her job title within thirty (30) days of requesting it from his/her Appointing Authority.
Section 2	Employee Access
Each employee in the bargaining units shall be permitted by the Employer to have access to examine his/her class specification.
Section 3	Individual Appeal of Classification
Individual employees shall continue to have the same right to appeal the propriety of the classification of his/her position through the Personnel Administrator or the Civil Service System which the individual employee enjoyed on June 30, 1976, and such appeal may not be the subject of a grievance or arbitration under Article 23A herein.
Section 4
There shall be a Labor/Management Committee established to investigate instances of misclassification.
The Committee shall consist of two (2) persons from the Human Resources Division and two (2) persons from the Union.
Section 5
Where the Union believes that a job specification or the name of a job title is either inaccurate or inappropriate, it may present information regarding such inaccuracies or inappropriateness to the Human Resources Division for review and adjustments as needed to the job specification and/or job title.
ARTICLE 17A
CLASS REALLOCATIONS
Section 1
Class reallocations may be requested by the President of SEIU Local 509/Secretary of the Alliance whenever he/she believes a reallocation is justified by the existence of an inequitable relationship between the positions covered by the reallocation request and other
46
state positions. In the event the Personnel Administrator agrees that such an inequity exists and in the event such reallocation shall result in the need for a funding request to implement the reallocation, the Personnel Administrator may pursue options for funding at the time of issuance of said concurrence, or defer discussion on funding to negotiations for a successor Collective Bargaining Agreement, at the sole discretion of the Personnel Administrator.
Section 2
The Employer and the Union agree that the procedure provided in Section 1 shall be the sole procedure for class reallocation for all classes covered by this Agreement. No other class reallocations shall be granted under any other provisions of this Agreement.
Section 3
The parties acknowledge that the classification plan covering titles in Units 8 and 10 addresses the issue of pay equity/comparable worth. The class reallocation process contained in this Article shall be the procedure for addressing any additional pay equity/comparable worth concerns about titles within bargaining units covered by this Agreement.
ARTICLE 18 RECALL PROCEDURE
Section 1
A.	In the event that the Department/Agency shall lay-off a non-Civil Service employee because of a reduction in force, the least senior employee in the title in the Department/Agency, with seniority defined as service in the Department/Agency, shall be laid off.
B.	The Department/Agency shall maintain a recall roster from which laid-off employees will be recalled to positions to be filled in accordance with their seniority and in accordance with their qualifications to perform the work.
C.	An employee laid-off during the January 2009 - December 2011 term of this agreement shall remain on the recall list for three years, except an employee who is offered recall to a position in the same job grade as the position from which he or she was laid off and who refuses such offer shall be removed from the recall list and his/her recall rights shall terminate at that time.
Effective January 1, 2012, An employee laid-off shall remain on the recall list for two years, except an employee who is offered recall to a position in the same job grade as the position from which he or she was laid off and who refuses such offer shall be removed from the recall list and his/her recall rights shall terminate at that time.

A.	Definition - as used in this Article, the words below shall have the following meanings:
1.	Seniority - shall mean the total of all services rendered within the Department/Agency. (Except that within the Department of Social Services where seniority is equal, the length of state service will be used to determine seniority).

B.	Notice to Union
1.	In the event management becomes aware of an impending reduction in the work force, it will notify the Union at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the lay-off. Within five (5) days of notification of the impending lay-off, management shall meet with the union to discuss the impact of the lay-off on the affected employees, including, but not limited to, the availability of similar positions within the same Department/Agency or other Departments/Agencies within state service and including the availability of any training programs that may be applicable to the employees.

C.	Notice to Employees
In the event of actual lay-off, management will notify the least senior employee(s) in writing not less than ten (10) days in advance of the lay-off date. Both the union and management recognize the impact that lay-offs have on the clients served by the professionals who are to be laid off. Management will give employees and the union as much notice as practicable over and above the aforementioned minimums, whenever a lay-off is impending.
D.	Bumping Procedure
Any employee who has been notified that he/she will actually be laid off may file with his/her Appointing Authority within three (3) working days of such notice, a written request to bump to a bargaining unit position in the next lower title or titles in his/her bargaining unit for which he/she is determined qualified on the basis of objective standards by the Employer, provided that there is an employee junior to him/her in departmental years of service in such lower title or titles.

48
E.	Transfers Between Agencies
The employee who is to be laid off/bumped may file a request for transfer to any agency in state service. Upon approval of that agency, such employee may be appointed to any vacancy in the bargaining unit in the same grade and title or any similar title for which he/she might meet the necessary qualifications in the same or lower salary range as the position from which he/she was laid off. (Objective standards shall be used in determining qualifications.)

I.	Salary Schedule Placement Upon Recall
Any person who has been or is in the future laid off from a position in the service of the Commonwealth and who is subsequently hired, recalled, or reemployed within two years of his/her lay-off, into a position in one of the bargaining units within the jurisdiction of Local 509, shall be credited with his/her prior service for purposes of determining their salary upon re-entry under Article 12 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The provisions of this Section shall be retroactively applied to any person who has already been recalled and has not been credited with his/her prior service for the purpose of determining their salary.
Section 4
The following shall be applicable to all Unit 10 employees within the titles of Vocational Instructor A/B and Vocational Instructor C:
A.

C.	Within two (2) days of notification of lay-off, or bumping, an employee may bump to a lower title within the Bargaining Unit for which the employee is qualified if there is an employee in such title with less seniority.
D.	In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Section and the other sections of this Article, this Section shall prevail.
E.	In the event of recall, the order of lay-off and bumping described shall be reversed, and employees shall be returned to the title from which they were laid off or bumped in accordance with their seniority.
F.	Employees who are separated from employment as the result of the implementation of the lay-off, bumping procedures and who are subsequently recalled to employment pursuant to this Article shall for purposes of determining their salary upon recall under Article 12, be credited with their prior service and shall not upon recall be considered to be "hired, reinstated or re-employed" notwithstanding the provisions of Article 12 to the contrary.
ARTICLE 19
TRAINING AND CAREER LADDERS
Section 1	General
The Employer and the Union recognize the importance of training programs, the development of career ladders and of equitable employment opportunity structures and seeks here to establish a process for generating such program recommendations and their implementation.

An employee, having custody of a patient, or prisoner or rendering care or services to individuals, who is charged with a crime against the person, such crime alleged to have been committed while the employee was in the presence of the person alleging same and while such employee was performing his/her duties, and who, after hearing, is found by a court of law to be "not guilty" of such crime, shall be entitled to apply for reimbursement not exceeding $3,000.00 of the legal fees actually incurred and paid by him/her in connection with the legal defense of such alleged crime in court. This Section pertaining to reimbursement shall not apply in any case where the criminal complaint is disposed of in any manner other than an adjudication of "no probable cause", "not guilty", or similar adjudication indicating the employee is innocent. Dispositions by way of nolle prosequi, plea bargaining, dismissal for lack of prosecution or any other disposition other than one clearly exonerating the employee on the merits shall not qualify the employee for reimbursement pursuant to this Section; nor shall this Section apply if the crime is alleged to have been committed while the employee was off duty.
Section 2
The parties expressly recognize that this Article is intended to provide limited reimbursement to an employee who is the victim of a frivolous or malicious criminal charge related to the manner or means by which the employee performs his/her duties, and such employee has been required to employ an attorney to exonerate him/her in a criminal court.
Section 3
A.	An eligible employee as described in Sections 1 and 2 may apply for reimbursement to a special "Reimbursement Panel" to be made up of three (3) people: 1A) the departmental commissioner or his/her designee, 2A) either the Chairman or Secretary of the Alliance or his/her designee; and 3A) one other person selected by those persons in 1A and 2A. The panel shall evaluate the employee's claim for reimbursement and make a finding that either: 1) the employee is eligible for reimbursement as described in Sections 1 and 2; or that 2) the employee is not eligible.
B.	A determination of eligibility must be the result of a unanimous vote of all three panel members. Any non-unanimous vote must result in a finding of non-eligibility.
C.	The determination of the reimbursement panel shall be final and may not be appealed. The decision of the panel as to reimbursement shall not be subject to the grievance procedure contained in Article 23A.
Section 4
No application for reimbursement shall be entertained by the panel until such time as there has been a final adjudication in court. Nor shall any application be entertained if the Department has taken any disciplinary/administrative action against the employee which is based on the same factual allegations that gave rise to the criminal action, unless and until such disciplinary/administrative action is finally resolved in favor of the employee.
58
Section 5
This Article shall not apply if the employee's fees for his/her criminal defense have been provided by any legal defense funds, insurance policies or the like.
Section 6
Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Union from seeking legislative relief above and beyond the said $3,000.00.
Section 7
In addition to other issues concerning employee liability that the Committee chooses to address, the committee shall specifically consider the following issues:
a.	the relationships between M.G.L. c. 258, Section 2 and any higher insurance premium that may be charged to an employee who uses his/her private car in the course of his/her employment; and

If the Appointing Authority or his/her designee redetermines the rating then the employee will receive the increase retroactive to the date of original step increase due, or Article 12 increase, whichever is appropriate. If the Appointing Authority or his/her designee does not redetermine the rating then the employee may file through the Alliance/SEIU Local 509 within fourteen (14) days with the Human Resources Division a request for a review of the Appointing Authority's or his/her designee's determination by a tri-partite panel consisting of one person designated by the Alliance/SEIU Local 509, one person designated by the Personnel Administrator and one person designated by the Chairperson of the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration who shall be assigned on a rotating basis.

Section 4
Any employee who as a result of an evaluation pursuant to this Agreement receives an overall rating of "Below" shall have the right to appeal such rating pursuant to Supplemental Agreement D of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 25
STATE-WIDE AND DEPARTMENTAL LABOR/MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
Section 1
The parties acknowledge the important role each has in the provision of the highest quality services to the citizens of the Commonwealth, and hereby agree to address issues related to the provision of such services through the provisions of this Article.
Section 2
Therefore, the parties agree to the continuation of the State-Wide Labor/Management Committee. Said Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives from both the Human Resources Division (HRD) and/or the departments in which persons covered by this Agreement are employed, and from the Alliance. This Committee shall include representatives from each of the bargaining units comprising the Alliance.
Section 3
A.	In addition to continuing effective communication between the parties and promoting a climate of constructive employee relations, the Committee shall examine workplace practices and procedures and methods of promoting the quality and efficiency of services provided by state employees.

B.	Any DSDLMC's shall be comprised of equal representation between management and the unions constituting the Alliance, which shall report to the SWLMC on a regular basis.
C.	Where established, the Departmental Service-Delivery Labor/Management Committees will work to increase the quality and efficiency of delivery of service provided by state workers as well as methods for improving the capacity of the Department/Agency to accomplish its mission. Based upon their findings, the DSDLMCs may make appropriate recommendations for change to the Department/Agency Appointing Authority through the State-Wide Labor/Management Committee. Pilot programs will be mutually agreed to by the parties and carried out by the current work force.
D.	The parties acknowledge that the DSDLMC's efforts will be particularly appropriate where there has been a modification of the mission or goals of the agency as a result of statutory, budgetary, policy or technological change, reorganization, whether due to a change in state or federal law, due to a change in the location or logistics of the agency as well as where there has been above average staff turnover, changes in the method of
67
service delivery and also where there is evidence of need for review based on the experience of the Department management or the Department's employees.
E.	Employee participants on the Departmental Service-Delivery Labor/Management Committee shall be appointed by their Union and shall suffer no reduction of any benefit normally enjoyed by them as a result of serving on said Committee.
Section 4
A.	If the methods for the proposed increases in quality and efficiency warrant institution of new techniques or technology which require training or other employee development, the Employer will provide, from the appropriation established pursuant to this Article, the amount of training monies agreed to and recommended by the State-Wide Labor-Management Committee. However, in no event shall the amount of monies recommended exceed the balance of the appropriation. Where necessary, such training or development shall be provided prior to implementation of any proposed techniques or technology.
B.	To the extent possible, training options shall include programs offered by the Human Resources Division and the existing tuition remission program.
Section 5
A.	If there is any displacement as a result of the implementation of the changes recommended by the SWLMC, then the Employer agrees to provide displaced employees with prioritized options for placement in positions covered by this Agreement, for which the employee is qualified, elsewhere within the agency. If no positions are available within the agency, then the Employer agrees to provide displaced employees with prioritized options for placement in positions covered by this Agreement, for which the employee is qualified, in other state agencies. Every effort shall be made to place such employee in a comparably graded position. In such situations the displaced employee's contractual seniority shall be transferred across departmental lines. In no event shall this language be construed as limiting the Employer's rights under Article 18.
B.	Transfers stemming from the above-referenced displacement will be offered subsequent to the completion of all internal voluntary transfer/promotion processes in the affected agencies and shall be selected and offered to the employee so as to minimize geographic hardship, but will not result in the displacement of any other employee.
Section 6
The SWLMC shall monitor the activity of any and all DSDLMC's and shall receive a full report of any such Committee regularly.
Section 7
For the purpose of supporting employee retention, the SWLMC will make recommendations regarding the establishment of a state-wide job placement program and training/retraining opportunities for displaced and potentially displaced workers whether or not such displacement arises from the Committee's workplace quality recommendations.
Section 8
Also, in an effort to maintain consistent and high quality services to the citizens of the Commonwealth, the SWLMC shall examine the relationship between overtime and staffing
68
in twenty-four (24) hour facilities. Any proposed revisions will take into consideration agency mission, employee skills, performance and continuity of services.

Nothing herein shall be construed to, in any manner, abrogate or obviate the rights and obligations of either of the parties under M.G.L. c. 150E.
Section 11
The SWLMC shall be the sole forum for discussing issues of concern relating to Executive Office of Health and Human Services agency office relocations.
69
ARTICLE 26 HR/CMS
Section 1
The Alliance/SEIU Local 509 recognizes and acknowledges that HR/CMS (Human Resources/Compensation Management System) is the cornerstone of the Commonwealth's payroll and personnel system.
The Alliance/SEIU Local 509 will accept such changes to business practices, procedures and functions as are necessary to achieve the maximum utility of HR/CMS.
The Commonwealth and the Alliance/SEIU Local 509 will establish a special labormanagement committee comprised of an equal number of Alliance/SEIU Local 509 and management representatives. The committee shall be the sole forum for the parties to discuss any issues of impact to the bargaining units arising from HR/CMS and the committee will be convened in advance of changes to business practices significantly impacting the membership.
Section 2
The Commonwealth and the Alliance/SEIU Local 509 agree that employees will have their salaries directly transferred through electronic funds transfer (EFT). To address the Union concern that not all members would be able to avail themselves of the electronic funds transfer because of severe hardship, the parties agree as follows:
A.	In the extraordinary event that the Alliance/SEIU Local 509 alleges that an employee cannot comply with the Collective Bargaining Agreement relative to the electronic transfer due to severe hardship such as inability to access a bank or financial institution during off hours or, there is no ATM available within a reasonable geographic distance from an employee's worksite or home, the Union shall petition the Human Resources Division for a Direct Deposit Special Exemption.
B.	The Human Resources Division, in concert with the Office of the State Comptroller, shall review the request for the Direct Deposit Special Exemption filed by the Alliance/SEIU Local 509 and will notify the Alliance/Local 509 of its finding.
C.	The parties agree that no other appeal may be commenced by the employee or the Alliance/SEIU Local 509 relative to the Direct Deposit Special Exemption and further, that this Article is not grievable and is inarbitrable.

Section 2
The Union shall exert its best efforts to prevent any violation of Section 1 of this Article, and if such action does occur, to exert its best efforts to terminate it.
70
ARTICLE 28
TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES
The parties specifically agree that all hardware, software, databases, communications networks, peripherals, and all other electronic technology, whether networked or free-standing, is the property of the Commonwealth and is expected to be used only as it has in the past for official Commonwealth business. Use by employee s of the Commonwealth's technological resources constitutes express consent for the Commonwealth and its Departments/Agencies to monitor and/or inspect any data that users create or receive, any electronic mail messages they send or receive, and any web sites that they may access. The Commonwealth retains, and through its Departments/Agencies, may exercise the right to inspect and randomly monitor any user's computer, any data contained in it, and any data sent or received by that computer.
Notwithstanding the above, unless such use is reasonably related to an employee's job, it is unacceptable for any person to intentionally use the Commonwealth's electronic technology:
•	in furtherance of any illegal act, including violation of any criminal or civil laws or regulations, whether state or federal;
•	for any political purpose;
•	for any commercial purpose;
•	to send threatening or harassing messages, whether sexual or otherwise;
•	to access or share sexually explicit, obscene, or otherwise inappropriate materials;
•	to infringe upon any intellectual property rights;
•	to gain or attempt to gain, unauthorized access to any computer or network;
•	for any use that causes interference with or disruption of network users and resources, including propagation of computer viruses or other harmful programs;
•	to misrepresent either the Agency or a person's role at the Agency;
•	to intercept communications intended for other persons;
•	to distribute chain letters;
•	to libel or otherwise defame any person; or
•	to access online gambling sites.
The terms of this Section do not alter current practice regarding employee use of telephones.
The parties agree that the foregoing list and policy are not all-inclusive and will meet as needed to make appropriate modifications thereto.
The Department/Agency will disseminate this Section to its employees on an annual basis as part of the employee's performance evaluation and afford said employee the opportunity to request clarification should it be necessary.
This shall not infringe upon any rights within M.G.L. c. 150E or any other right legally granted to employees.
71
ARTICLE 29 PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS
Section 1	Introduction
This document constitutes a Handbook and Article of Professional Standards for all Bargaining Units 8 and 10 employees of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Article is designed to give all employees full and fair notice of their professional and ethical obligations.
We can maintain the public's trust only to the extent that all of our official activities and all of our contact with the public reflect the highest ethical standards. We must perform our duties with integrity and propriety. We must also do all in our power to ensure that none of your words or actions can be interpreted otherwise.
This Article is written for our own protection. It strives to impart three fundamental messages:
A.	every employee must scrupulously avoid any actual conduct which constitutes a conflict of interest or conduct which gives the reasonable basis for the impression of a conflict of interest between his/her private interests, usually financial, and the public interest. The public interest must always take precedence;
B.	every employee is prohibited from either taking some action, or failing to perform some duty, that would personally benefit himself/herself or give preferential treatment to any citizen; and
C.	every employee is prohibited from taking any action that would result in illegal receipt of public or private funds.
Guidance - both on what we are expected to do and on what we are prohibited from doing - should help all of us understand generally what is expected of us. It should also help resolve particular situations we are faced with in our daily work. Please read these rules carefully and abide by their spirit as well as their letter. Each of us can take pride in belonging to an organization that contributes so much to the growth, strength and quality of life of the Commonwealth.
Section 2	Definitions

Chapters 268A and 268B, Opinions of the Attorney General, Ethics Commission Rulings and applicable provisions of the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Section 4	General Rules
A.	The Article Generally
1.	Applicability of Article
The Article applies to all Bargaining Units 8 and 10 employees including those on any type of leave status.

73
in the employee's personnel folder.
Each Appointing Authority or his/her designee will be responsible for providing accurate information and guidance to his/her employees with regard to the specifics of the Article and may from time to time offer training sessions on the Article to his/her employees as the need arises.

B.	Conformance to Laws
Employees shall obey the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Any employee who is convicted of a crime relating to his/her employment shall be subject to discipline.
Any employee who has been indicted, charged or arrested for a serious crime supported by a judicial finding of probable cause in a preliminary hearing when the nature of the charge with its attendant publicity reasonably gives rise to legitimate fear for the safety of the citizens of the Commonwealth, its clients, consumers, or employees, the property of the Commonwealth, or jeopardizes the public trust in the ethical standards of Department/Agency employees or undermines the trust in the integrity of the Commonwealth’s system of tax administration or the administration of other laws of the Commonwealth, may be reassigned, or in the case of a serious crime as set forth in Section 11 (A) of this Article, be subject to suspension without pay or other employee benefits, pending resolution of the case.
If a guilty finding is entered against the employee, whether by plea, jury or bench verdict, or if the employee pleads nolo contendere, has his/her case filed or continued without a finding, is granted immunity from prosecution, further disciplinary action, including termination, may be taken if the crime was related to his/her employment. If the employee is found not guilty, or the case is nolle prosequi or dismissed, the employee shall be immediately reinstated to employment retroactive to the date of suspension without loss of wages or other employee benefits.
C.	Conformance to Policies, Procedures and Directives
Employees shall comply with all of the policies and operating procedures of the Department/Agency in which they work. This requirement includes all Department/Agency policies and procedures. Employees shall respond forthrightly to the work-related directives of their supervisors.
D.	Conduct, Attitude and Demeanor
Employees are expected to conduct themselves in their official relations with the public and with their fellow employees in a manner which will enhance public respect for, and confidence in the employee and in the Commonwealth as a whole. They must not only perform their duties in a wholly impartial manner, but must avoid any conduct that gives the reasonable basis for the impression of acting otherwise.
Specifically, all employees shall avoid any action that may result in or create the
74
reasonable basis for the impression of:
1.	using public office for private gain;
2.	giving preferential treatment to any citizen;
3.	making work-related decisions contrary to Department/Agency policy;
4.	using one's official position to harass, intimidate or exploit any person or entity outside the course of official duties; or
5.	using one's official position to obtain a private advantage to which the employee is not otherwise entitled or in disregard of the best interests of the Commonwealth and/or its clients or consumers.
. E. Administrative Inquiries
Employees must respond promptly and fully to all administrative inquiries as directed.
F. State Ethics Commission Financial Disclosure Requirements
Employees who are required to file a "Statement of Financial Disclosure with the State Ethics Commission, under the provisions of
M.G.L. Chapter 268B, shall do so in a timely manner as prescribed by the State
Ethics Commission. The State Ethics Commission will notify each employee who is required to file such a statement.
Section 5 Conflict of Interest
The necessity for the fair and impartial administration of state government and the enforcement of its laws makes the avoidance of any conflict of interest of primary importance. A conflict of interest is a situation in which an employee's private interest, usually financial, conflicts or raises a reasonable question of conflict with his/her official duties and responsibilities.
A.	Chapter 268A of the General Laws provides civil and criminal penalties for conflict of interest violations. The following three general categories of prohibitions are to be used as guidelines for your information. (Chapter 268A of the General Laws offers specific details).
1.	No employee may request or receive, in any manner whatsoever, compensation or any thing else of value, except from the Commonwealth: (a) for performance of his/her duties, or (b) for influencing or appearing to influence such performance.
2.	No employee may participate in any official action relating to any entity in which the employee or a member of his/her immediate family has a financial interest.
3.	No employee may participate in any official action relating to any individual with whom, or entity in which, the employee has a substantial personal interest.
Employees have an obligation to avoid scrupulously the potential conflicts of interest that exist in their employment. They have a duty to disclose and report promptly the existence or possible existence of a conflict of interest to their agency head or his/her designee. They should request from their supervisor the transfer from their caseload of any case which involves their immediate family, close friend or any person with whom, or entity in which, they have some personal or financial involvement.
75
In addition, they have a right under law to have any question relating to a possible conflict of interest confidentially reviewed and decided by the State Ethics Commission. Information regarding the filing of a conflict of interest request with the State Ethics Commission is available from the agency head or his/her designee or from the Ethics Commission directly.
B.	In addition to the sanctions referred to above, M.G.L. Chapter 268A, Section
23 also prescribes and describes certain "Standards of Conduct". Violations of these standards are subject to appropriate disciplinary action. All employees are required to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of these standards, which provide as follows: "No current officer or employee of a state, county, or municipal agency shall:
1.	accept other employment, which will impair his independence of judgment in the exercise of his official duties;
2.	use or attempt to use his official position to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for himself or others;
3.	by his conduct give reasonable basis for the impression that any person can improperly influence or unduly enjoy his favor in the performance of his official duties, or that he is unduly affected by the kinship, rank, position or influence of any party or person." M.G.L. c. 268A, § 23 (b).
"No current or former officer or employee of a state, county or municipal agency shall:
1.	accept employment or engage in any business or professional activity which will require him to disclose confidential information which he has gained by reason of his official position or authority;
2.	improperly disclose materials or data within the exemptions to the definition of public records as defined by Section Seven of Chapter Four of the General Laws, and were acquired by him in the course of his official duties nor use such information to further his personal interests." M.G.L. c. 268A, § 23 (c).
These rules with respect to conflict of interest are in addition to, and supplement state policies and Department/Agency rules, regulations and operating procedures that may otherwise apply to the official actions of employees.
In the event that the Appointing Authority, or his/her designee, at the request of the employee, approves a particular activity and the Ethics Commission subsequently determines that such activity is a conflict of interest, the Appointing Authority will not discipline the employee for such activity. However, only the State Ethics Commission, and formerly the Attorney General, have the authority to issue an opinion interpreting M.G.L. Chapter 268A, which is binding. Therefore, in any circumstance where they are unsure of the propriety of any activity that they wish to initiate, employees are encouraged to contact the Ethics Commission directly for an advisory opinion.
Section 6 Gifts and Gratuities from Outside Sources
A.	General Limitations
76
Employees shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value from a person who or entity which, the employee knows or has reason to know:
1.	has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with his/her Department/Agency;
2.	conducts business or other activities which are regulated or monitored by the department/agency, except as permitted by this Section or by departmental/agency directives; or
3.	has interests that may be or give the reasonable impression of being substantially affected by the performance or non-performance of the employee's official duties.
B.	Exceptions
The restrictions set forth in paragraph A of this Section do not apply to:
1.	Obvious family or personal relations when the circumstances make it clear that those relationships, rather than the business or the persons concerned, are the motivating factors behind any gift or gratuity.
2.	The acceptance of food or refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a breakfast, luncheon, dinner or other meeting attended for educational, information or other similar purposes. However, Department/Agency employees are specifically prohibited from accepting free food or other gratuity other than of nominal value in response to a recognized display of public hospitality while on official business.
3.	The acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans, automobile loans, personal loans, etc., provided that the employee does not deal with that institution in the course of his/her official duties. However, if dealing with such banks or financial institutions is unavoidable, the employee must disclose dealings to the appropriate authority in writing prior to engaging in such dealings.
4.	The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional materials such as pens, pencils, notepads, calendars, and other items of nominal value.
5.	The acceptance of an award or gift of nominal value for a speech, participation in a conference, or some public contribution or achievement given by a charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, public service or civic organization, if such organization falls within Paragraph A above.
6.	Acceptance of reimbursement, in cash or in kind, for travel subsistence and other expenses incident to attendance at meetings, provided such attendance and reimbursement is approved by the Appointing Authority or his designee. Such reimbursement can be
77
made directly to the employee. An employee's official business may not be reimbursed, and payment may not be made on his or her behalf, for excessive (e.g., reimbursement which exceeds actual cost) personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, travel or other benefits. At no time shall an employee accept reimbursement from both the Commonwealth and another source for the same expenses.
Section 7 Outside Employment and Business Opportunity
A.	Introduction: Principles
The Commonwealth seeks to give employees the maximum freedom possible to engage in outside employment or business activities consistent with the Commonwealth's responsibilities. However, the extremely sensitive mission of the Commonwealth and its employees necessitates certain restrictions. Employees may engage in outside employment or business activity provided such activity is not prohibited by this Article or by any statute, regulation or departmental order. An activity that is permissible for the occupant of one position may very well not be permissible for the occupant of another position. Therefore, in considering each case on its individual merits, the employee must satisfy the following principles:
1.	The outside activity would not place the employee in a situation where there is a conflict, or in a situation that gives the reasonable basis for the impression of a conflict, between his or her private interests and his/her official duties and responsibilities (see Section 5, above, "Conflict of Interest", for additional guidance).
2.	The outside activity would not result in use, dissemination or disclosure to others of confidential information obtained in connection with the employee's departmental duties or position.
3.	The nature of the employment or business activity or the employment or the hours to be devoted to such activity would not impair the employee's availability, capacity or efficiency for the performance of his/her official duties as an employee of the Commonwealth.
4.	Employees shall not engage directly or indirectly in financial transactions as a result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through their employment. In particular, they shall not use confidential information obtained in the course of their employment with the Commonwealth to obtain benefits, financial or otherwise, for themselves, their families or others.
B.	Activities Which Do Not Require Prior Notice
1.	Introduction
Employees are generally not required to submit written notice before engaging in outside activities, which are not considered to be employment or business related. Although it is not feasible to cover every specific activity of this nature, the general categories discussed below are furnished as basic guidelines.
2.	General Examples
78
a.	Membership and uncompensated services (including holding of office) in civic, scout, religious, educational, fraternal, social, community, veterans, or charitable organizations.
b.	Services as a notary public or justice of the peace.
c.	Rental of employee-owned property, real or personal, to
the extent such property is not rented to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any agency or subdivision thereof, or the lessee is not a subject of the employee's official duties.
d.	Minor services and odd jobs for friends, relatives, or
neighbors. These include a wide variety of activities, including repair or maintenance work such as painting, yard work, carpentry, or services such as babysitting and carpools involving payment for transportation.
e.	Temporary (thirty (30) days or less) assistance in a
family enterprise, in the event of an emergency such as the death or serious illness/accident to a member of the family engaged in that business.
f.	Where an employee takes an active part in or becomes an advocate on behalf of a professional society, and a conflict exists between that society and the agency/department, the employee must make clear that he/she is not speaking or acting for the Department/Agency.
Section 8	Attempts to Bribe
Bribery and attempted bribery are claims that strike at the core of state government. Employees should be constantly alert to solicitations to accept money, consideration, or anything of value in return for acts or omissions involving their official functions. Such solicitations may be indirect and subtle. Any attempt to bribe a departmental employee shall be reported immediately to the Appointing Authority or his/her designee.
Section 9	Other Standards of Conduct
A.	False Statement
Proper functioning of government requires that the Department/ Agency, the courts, other state agencies and the public be able to rely fully on the truthfulness of government employees in matters of official interest. An employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination for intentionally making false or misleading verbal or written statements in matters of official interest.
B.	Recommending Professional Assistance
Employees may not recommend or suggest, specifically or by implication, to anyone that he/she obtain the services of any particular
79
accountant, attorney or firm of accountants or attorneys, or any other person or professional or business organization in connection with any official business which involves or may involve the Department/Agency.
C.	Public Records
All requests for public records should be directed to the Appointing Authority or his/her designee, who shall determine whether the requested documents are public records in accordance with M.G.L. c. 4, Section 7, Cl. 26.
D.	Drugs and Alcohol
While on duty no employee shall consume or use alcohol, intoxicants, narcotics, or controlled substances in any form. Similarly, no employee shall report for work under the influence of intoxicants, narcotics or controlled substances in any form.

Employees are responsible for the safeguarding and proper use of Department/Agency identification cards, badges and access cards, for promptly reporting their loss and for surrendering them on termination or employment or demand by proper Department/Agency authorities.
Cards, badges or documents, or an employee's official position or status, are not to be used to exert influence or obtain, either directly or indirectly, personal privileges, favors or rewards for themselves or others. Photo identification badges must be worn while at work in any agency that requires them to be worn.
F.	Political Activities
Employees are prohibited from using their offices or official duties to interfere with, affect or influence the results of a nomination or election for public office.
No such elected or appointed official may vote or act on any matter which is within the purview of the agency by which he/she is employed or over which such employee has official responsibility and/or directly affects his/her financial interest arising from his/her employment with the agency.
80
No employee shall solicit or accept funds or anything of value for any party, political committee, agency, person or organization for political purposes.
Employees are not prohibited from contributing to the campaign committee or organization for nomination or election of any individual running for public office or to any committee, agency, or organization for political purposes.
Employees are prohibited from campaigning for political office for themselves or others during normal working hours.

G.	Testimonial Dinners
Employees are prohibited from selling or accepting payment for tickets, admissions or contributions for a testimonial dinner or function or any affair having a purpose similar to a testimonial dinner or function held on behalf of any employee of his/her Department/Agency. No employee shall participate in or accept contributions for or from any testimonial dinner or function or any affair having a similar purpose, held on his/her behalf while he/she is an employee if such dinner, function or affair is sponsored by a person or organization that is regulated by or has official business with the employee's department or agency.
This Section shall not prohibit the collection of sums of nominal value to cover the cost of small celebrations or other small events (such as birthday or holiday parties) held within Department/Agency offices.
H.	Legislative Requests and Inquiries
In the course of an employee’s official duties, all requests or inquiries from public officials or their staffs must be referred to the Department/Agency head or his/her designee before any action is taken, unless employees are directed to handle such requests otherwise by the Department/Agency head or his/her designee. No employee shall use his/her official authority directly or indirectly to coerce, attempt to coerce, command, advise or prevent any person or body to pay, lend or contribute anything of value to any party candidate or political committee.
I.	Firearm/Deadly Weapons
No employee shall carry a firearm or other deadly weapon on his/her person during the performance of official duties or on work premises, except as specifically authorized by the Appointing Authority. Employees seeking such authorization shall apply directly to his/her Appointing Authority.
J.	Requirement to Maintain Applicable License
81
All employees are required to maintain applicable professional or other licenses in good standing at all times. Employees are responsible for the purchase of any and all materials, educational or otherwise, which are necessary to maintain and update their knowledge and skills as required for the successful performance of their job duties and responsibilities.
Any employee whose license is required by statute, or is necessary to perform his/her normal job functions, has lapsed or otherwise been revoked is obligated to notify the Appointing Authority immediately. Failure to make such notification may result in disciplinary action, likely including termination.
After notification that his/her license has lapsed, the employee will take all appropriate steps to renew the license. Failure to take such steps may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. This Section does not apply to those employees whose license has been revoked or suspended due to a disability.
K.	Professionalism
Meetings with clients, community professionals and members of the public require employees to demonstrate professionalism at all times. Respect is shown not only in quality of work but also in how the employee presents him/herself. Therefore, it is imperative that employees create a professional presentation in the course of their official duties.
L.	Treatment of Clients and Consumers
1.	The primary responsibility of employees covered in this Article is to promote the well being of clients and/or consumers. Clients and Consumers receiving services from Commonwealth employees covered by this Article of Professional Standards are to be treated with respect, dignity, and fairness. Employees shall be strictly prohibited from using their official positions to improperly influence or exploit clients or consumers for their personal gain.

2.	Employees may purchase non-alcoholic beverages, snacks, and meals of nominal value for service recipients during working hours, provided the frequency is intermittent and occurs during the normal course of business. Employees are strictly prohibited from offering this gratuity when its acceptance is the primary focus of the employee-service recipient interaction.
3.	Employees are required to notify their supervisor of any repeated offers or offers of greater than nominal value of food and/or beverages made to a service recipient regardless of their acceptance or rejection.
82
4.	Employees will preserve the integrity of private information. They will neither seek data on individuals beyond that needed to perform their responsibilities nor reveal non-public data unless expressly authorized to do so by their Appointing Authority.
Section 10
The provisions of this Article shall not supersede any code of ethical conduct, Agency policy, rule or regulation or standard currently in place at any agency that employs persons covered by this Agreement.
Section 11	Self-Reporting of Criminal Convictions
A.	Overview
In the event an employee in a position title that is subject to Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) provisions has been convicted or has entered a plea of guilt to a serious criminal act, he/she shall report the conviction or plea of guilt to a committee designated by the Appointing Authority as the “Self-Reporting Committee” (“the Committee”). In addition, an employee charged or arrested for any serious criminal act is strongly encouraged to notify the Committee as soon as possible after the charge or arrest.
A serious criminal act shall be considered, but may not be limited to, any crime that falls within the following categories:
•	Murder, Manslaughter, Negligent or Motor Vehicle Homicide;
•	Sexual Assault (including forcible or non-consensual intercourse, assault with intent to rape and indecent assault; and in the case of a minor, statutory rape, incest, or soliciting sexual acts; in the case of a feeble-minded person, sexual intercourse or indecent assault);
•	Crimes involving the use or threat of force, including but not limited to, extortion, intimidation, assault and battery (with or without a dangerous weapon), kidnapping and intimidation of a witness;
•	Crimes including trafficking, distribution or intent to distribute controlled substances;
•	Any crime that resulted, through police, administrative or judicial order or condition, in the loss or restriction of a work-related prerequisite (e.g., loss of right to operate a motor vehicle, imposition of curfew or limitation on right to travel, etc.);
•	Crimes involving the carrying, possession or use of an unlawful weapon or firearm;
•	Crimes involving a civil rights violation (e.g. hate crimes, crimes against a protected class);
•	Crimes involving domestic violence, stalking, annoying/obscene telephone calls, kidnapping a minor by a relative;
•	Crimes involving fraud, theft or veracity (e.g. larceny, false statements, perjury, embezzlement, bribery, grand larceny, burglary, breaking and entering);
•	Arson (burning of a dwelling, building, motor vehicle or contents);
•	Crimes involving abandonment and/or non-support of a spouse and/or minor child.
83
The Employer is not limited in any way from obtaining information regarding arrest, charged by way of complaint, information or indictment, or conviction from any source other than the employee.
An affected employee shall notify his/her employer on the first business day following the conviction or plea of guilt, or immediately upon their return to work, whichever is earlier. The employee shall disclose the offense or offenses for which he/she has been convicted or has entered a plea of guilt, the investigating police department, the court of jurisdiction, and any terms and conditions resulting from his/her conviction or plea of guilt. Any offense falling within the categories set forth above shall be disclosed regardless of whether or not it has occurred in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
B.	Reporting Process
The affected employee shall, not later than three (3) business days after the conviction or plea of guilt, provide documentation of the conviction or plea of guilt to the Self-Reporting Committee (the Committee).
C.	The Committee
The Agency Self-Reporting Committee members shall include two Department officials who will be specifically trained in these matters. The third official shall be designated from the affected operational unit. The Committee’s responsibilities will be to ensure confidentiality, evenhandedness and consistency in handling self-reporting matters in order to ensure the situations are treated similarly. The Committee will be empowered to make timely recommendations regarding the employee’s status.
If, at any point, the Committee concludes that the nature of the employee’s offense does not create an unacceptable risk to clients and/or coworkers, or the public trust, then the Committee shall recommend to the Appointing Authority that no further action be taken.
Where the Committee determines the nature of the conviction or plea of guilt presents the possibility of an unacceptable risk to clients and/or coworkers, or the public trust, it may recommend one or more of the following actions:
•	Reassignment of the employee within the Appointing Authority’s jurisdiction;
•	Suspension without pay;
•	Termination.
The Committee shall have the authority to recommend immediate disciplinary action where the employee fails to comply with the notice requirements set forth above, or where he/she willfully provides information that is inaccurate or misleading.
If the Committee determines the reported event necessitates any of the actions enumerated above, it shall, upon the request of the employee, inform an appropriate union representative of the Appointing Authority’s decision and the manner in which the decision shall be effected.
84
The Committee will consider:
•	Whether the employee’s actions resulting in the conviction or plea of guilt is relevant to his or her employment;
•	Whether the employee has demonstrated any other behavioral concerns; or
•	Whether allowing the employee to remain performing his/her specific job duties could give rise to legitimate concern for the safety of other employees, and/or the individuals the agency serves, or could jeopardize the public’s trust in the Department/Agency.
The Committee will have access to the employee’s CORI report after the conviction or plea of guilt has been reported. The Committee will have authority to amend any recommendations with regard to the employee should new developments occur or if additional information is received.
D.	Confidentiality
No employee shall be required to reveal any information under this self-reporting procedure to any agency staff except designated members of the Committee. The Committee shall ensure confidentiality in its deliberations. To this end, the Committee shall only communicate directly to the Appointing Authority or his/her designee and with the Human Resources official for the affected agency.
Nothing in these procedures shall mitigate or abrogate any rights reserved to the employer or employee under the Collective Bargaining Agreement now in effect. Nothing in this procedure shall serve to mitigate any rights reserved to any Commonwealth Agency under any related Agency policy now in effect.
Section 12
A. The parties agree to establish a labor management committee which shall develop procedures by which management can verify that employees who use their automobiles on Commonwealth business have valid driver licenses and legally registered and inspected vehicles.
No employee shall be required to incur any additional expense by such procedures and no employee shall be required to provide verification more frequently than once per year. Employees shall be provided with 60 days advance written notice of the date such verification need to be provided.
The procedures agreed upon by the committee shall be effective July 1, 2009.

ARTICLE 29A
EFFICIENCY WORKING GROUPS
The parties acknowledge the shared value associated with enhanced service delivery and improved operational efficiency. Continued public confidence in government, and public support for governmental programs, requires an ongoing focus on continuous improvement, and corresponding results. The parties also acknowledge that more efficient service delivery can provide opportunities to reinvest savings to the benefit of those employees that contribute to such favorable outcomes.
In this light, the parties agree, in the course of this contract, to establish a working group that will be charged with identifying no fewer than four pilot programs focused on developing more efficient methods of service delivery in at least three selected service areas. The parties further agree that these pilot programs will complete their work six months prior to the end of this agreement, and will produce report(s) detailing each initiative; the iterative steps taken to accomplish its purpose(s); and the service impacts resulting from the initiative. Finally, the parties agree that a portion of any cost savings that result from these initiatives will be returned to employees in the affected bargaining unit, in accordance with a formula determined in advance by mutual agreement of the parties.
The Commonwealth and the Union each agree to designate seven persons to be named to this working group no later than 30 days from the date of execution of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 30 RE-OPENER
The Commonwealth and the Union acknowledge that the unique timing of the increases provided for in Year Two and Year Three of this Agreement is in direct recognition of the Union foregoing certain wage increases provided for in the predecessor Agreement. With this understanding, the Commonwealth agrees that in the course of this Agreement, should any other Executive Branch bargaining unit receive any across the board wage increases at any point earlier than one year following the end date of its preceding Agreement, the parties shall, at the request of the union, reopen the salary provisions of this Agreement for further bargaining.
ARTICLE 31 DURATION
This Agreement shall be for the three (3) year period from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 and the terms contained herein shall become effective January 1, 2009, unless otherwise specified.

This Memorandum of Understanding reflects a clarification of Articles 12 and 24A of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement concerning merit based pay for performance. It is agreed that:
1.	All EPRS evaluations shall be based on a three tiered rating system of “Excels", "Meets" and "Below".
2.	Disciplinary actions impacting on an employee's "ability to perform his/her normal duties" shall be considered for the purpose of a final overall rating on the performance review.
3.	Disciplinary actions not impacting on an employee's "ability to perform his/her normal duties" shall not have a greater impact than other areas of the employee evaluation for the purpose of an "Excels", "Meets" or "Below" rating.
4.	Any employee who has received a rating of "Below" will have his/her evaluation reviewed monthly by the Appointing Authority or his/her designee, who shall review all the circumstances of the rating. The Appointing Authority or his/her designee may redetermine the rating after reviewing the circumstances of the initial evaluation. If the Appointing Authority or his/her designee redetermines the rating the employee will receive the increase retroactive to the date of original step increase due, or Article 12 increase, whichever is appropriate. If the Appointing Authority or his/her designee does not redetermine the rating the employee may file, through the Alliance within fourteen (14) days with the Human Resources Division, a request for a review of the Appointing Authority's or his/her designee's determination by a tripartite panel consisting of one person designated by the Alliance, one person designated by the Personnel Administrator and one person designated by the Chairperson of the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration who shall be assigned on a rotating basis.
5.	A. Any appeal of a final "Below" rating shall be initiated at a Merit Arbitration Panel as designated below.
B.	Said appeal shall be filed within twenty-one (21) days with the Human Resources Division.

118
E.	The standard of review to be applied by the panel shall be solely limited to whether or not the final performance rating of "Below" was justified.
F.	The decision of the Merit Arbitration Panel shall be final and binding and any employee having a "Below" rating overturned shall be made whole in as prompt a manner as possible. Any costs associated with this process will be borne equally by the parties.
6.	Supervisors and managers shall not use performance evaluations to threaten or coerce employees in any manner.
7.	There shall be no pre-determined formula or ratio used to establish the number of "Below" or "Excels" ratings given.
8.	Job duties and performance criteria shall be observable and measurable to the extent practicable and in writing on the EPRS form.
9.	On and after the date of this Agreement, the Commonwealth shall evaluate bargaining unit employees no more strictly than it has historically evaluated such employees for the ratings of "Below" and "Meets".
10.	A.	Any employee who receives a "Below" evaluation shall be re-evaluated
thirty (30) days after the completion of his/her final evaluation. The Department/Agency shall file a remedial plan for an employee receiving a "Below" rating. Each re-review period shall be thirty (30) days in length to a maximum of six (6) months. The employee shall have his/her re-evaluations done each thirty (30) day period until a "Meets" rating is achieved or six (6) months pass, whichever is first.
B.	Employees that may be nearing a "Below" rating shall be counseled by his/her supervisor at least three (3) months in advance of their final stage of the evaluation as to the specific areas that must be improved and what they must do to attain a "Meets" rating.
C.	During the process of the re-review, the employee who continues to receive "Below" ratings shall be able to make a one-time appeal of that re-review rating to the Merit Arbitration Board. This appeal must be filed within ten (10) days of the last re-review rating. Any decision in favor of the employee will be from the month of the appeal forward. Such appeal may not be filed if the employee has already filed an appeal at the time of the final "Below" review.
11.	Once an employee receives a "Meets" or "Excels" evaluation during the re-review process, he/she shall be eligible for the denied step and/or denied salary increases effective from the date of receiving the "Meets" or "Excels" rating. An employee's anniversary date for step purposes shall not be retarded upon receiving the "Meets" or "Excels" rating.
12.	Any employee who may be adversely impacted by an untimely evaluation shall be made whole upon the completion of the performance review and upon achieving a final rating of "Meets".
13.	All performance merit ratings shall be based on the current EPRS system as found in Article 24A of the current Agreement and all payment of salary and/or step increases shall be based on current language found in Article 12 relating to pay for performance.
119
14.	All financial considerations (i.e., merit increases, step rate increase) shall be based on the employee’s most recent, final annual evaluation.
15.	When work-related circumstances occur over which the employee/Agency has no control, the employee shall not be prevented from attaining an overall rating of "Meets".

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT N covering BARGAINING UNIT 8 EMPLOYEES at the DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH
A.	Effective July 1, 2008, if the average (mean) number of clients served at a DMH Case Management Site deviates for a consecutive three month period by 20% or more from the statewide average (mean) for the same period of time (excluding deviations due to staff vacancies or leaves), the Union may request a meeting comprised of the DMH statewide Labor-Management Representatives, the Commissioner of DMH or designee, and designated 509 representatives to discuss the deviation. The meeting shall be convened within 30 days of such request to examine the possible factors contributing to the deviation. Either party may seek information from affected case managers, supervisors, the Site Directors and other relevant individuals through a request from a designated representative (Union or Management) to the Director of Labor Relations. All requested information shall be shared between the parties. If the parties agree that the deviation, whether high or low, is not justified by geography and differences in case manager travel time, differences in the availability of community or non-DMH resources for clients, differences in client needs, or other considerations, DMH will take steps to remedy the deviation. This may include, without limitation, reassigning clients or seeking additional funding. Any mutually agreed upon recommendations from such meeting will be reduced to writing within 15 days of meeting and a plan of implementation will be developed within 30 days. DMH will supply the Union with a quarterly report that will include a break down of the average (mean) number of clients served per month statewide, the average (mean) number of clients served by Site on a monthly basis, and the number of cases per case manager on the last day of the previous quarter.

The Committee shall meet as needed and make recommendations to the Commissioner of Mental Health no later than December 31, 2010.
122
Supplemental Agreement O
The Department of Mental Retardation recognizes the important work done by Service Coordinators and sees this work as one of its most essential functions in the community based service system.

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT Q covering
BARGAINING UNIT 8 EMPLOYEES
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES
I.	CASELOAD STANDARDS
The Department and the Union recognize that the ability to provide quality casework is directly related to the Department's having sufficient staff and adequate resources to meet its objective to strengthen families and to protect children. The Department and the Union recognize, that although the provisions of this Agreement do not provide optimal workload and caseload assignment standards, that the Agreement does represent the parties’ best efforts to effectively utilize currently available resources.
On a quarterly basis, when currently available resources are not sufficient to implement this Agreement, the Department shall prepare a request for additional staff and submit the request to the Executive Office of Human Services.
The caseload standards for Department workers with specialist functions are that Assessment Workers and Investigators are assigned twelve (12) cases per month and ongoing workers are assigned eighteen (18) cases per month.
The caseload standard for workers involved in the screening process should be 18:1 as describe below:
The caseload/workload shall be seventy-five (75) screening events per month.
The Department and the Union acknowledge that screening is a distinct function, but need not be staffed as a specialized function. The Department agrees to allocate staff according to the above-referenced formula for the screening function. The Department agrees to seek funding through the Executive Office of Human Services to establish the following caseload goals as caseload standards. When and if such funding is approved, these goals will be converted to caseload standards. The Department and the Union agree that staffing is a fundamental resource needed to meet the Department's primary objectives. Lacking adequate resources, the Department agrees to set as goals certain casework functions. These goals are:
Allocate staff according to the following formula:
(a)	family resources * 30:1 * (active foster homes)
(b)	duty worker/area 1/Area
The parties agree to begin to bargain, within ninety (90) days of the signing of the Agreement, the establishment of appropriate workload standards for technicians, assistant program development specialists, adoption workers, case reviewers, homeless workers, and program development specialists.
II.	ASSIGNMENT OF CASES
The Department recognizes that some cases are more complicated than others. It is the Department's intent that cases be consistently assigned in as equitable manner as intake permits. In an effort to ensure the equitable distribution of cases, supervisors are required to review the workload of a worker's currently assigned cases, as well as the worker's current workload as compared to the workload of other workers in the supervisory 124
unit. Supervisors shall also, prior to assigning cases, take into consideration other pertinent factors including, but not limited to: the number of cases in crisis, if any; the number of cases with court involvement; the number of placements; supervised visitations; the number of consumers; and bilingual cases. Ongoing workers will not be assigned more than three (3) assessments.
The Department recognizes a worker's ability to complete casework activities on assigned cases is dependent upon the time available to take the actions required by Policy and Regulations. The aforementioned factors may result in a worker's inability to complete all casework activities in a timely manner. In such situations, disciplinary action, formal or informal, shall not be initiated when based solely on a worker's failure to meet compliance goals.
III.	WEIGHTED WORKLOAD STANDARDS
The following points have been assigned to each listed function in order to establish a weighted workload standard:
Assessments in Process	-	1.5 points
Investigations Completed	-	1.5 points
Ongoing Cases	-	1 point
Assessments not completed within forty-five (45) working days from the date of assignment shall revert to ongoing cases at one (1) point.
IV.	WORKLOAD SUPPORT SYSTEMS
There shall be established Area, Field Support and Central Office workload support systems. Said systems shall include the following components:
AREA RELIEF COMPONENTS
•	Reassignment of cases within a supervisory unit
•	Reassignment of excess cases within an Area Office
•	Utilization of Area Office contracted resources
FIELD SUPPORT RELIEF COMPONENTS
•	Reassignment of excess cases to Field Support back-up units, if so established.
•	Reassignment of vacant positions within a Territory
•	Utilization of Field Support contracted resources to manage excess workload until an office has capacity to do so
•	Reassignment of excess cases to other Area Offices within a Territory
•	Reassignment of staff to offices with excess cases
125
CENTRAL OFFICE RELIEF COMPONENTS
•	Reassignment of State positions from other Territories to the affected Area Offices
•	Creation and deployment of Federal Temporary positions provided funds are available, to manage excess workloads.
•	Utilization of Statewide contracted resources to manage excess workload until an office has capacity to do so
•	Filing of a budget request (annual, deficiency or supplemental) to establish additional State funded positions.
The Area Office Relief Components shall be initiated and completed within five (5) working days upon receipt of a monthly ASSIST workload report, which identifies any worker(s), whose weighted workload for the reporting month exceeds a ratio of 20:1. If a monthly ASSIST workload report identifies a worker(s) with a weighted workload of more than twenty-two (22) for two consecutive reporting months, the appropriate Area, Field Support and Central Relief Components will be initiated.
In the event there are not sufficient Field Support Relief Components to relieve the workload excess within five (5) working days of implementation, the Department agrees to reassign State positions from other Territories and to utilize Statewide contracted resources, within ten (10) working days. The remaining Central Office Relief Components will be implemented as expeditiously as possible. The Department acknowledges that a workload, which exceeds the caseload goals and/or workload standard adversely, impacts a worker's ability to complete all casework assignments.
V.	SUPERVISOR TO WORKER RATIOS
The Agency staffing ratio of Supervisors to workers shall be 1: 5. An additional Supervisor shall be assigned to an Area Office when there are three (3) workers in excess of the supervisory staffing ratio.
VI.	CASE ASSIGNMENTS TO NEW WORKERS
Except in extenuating circumstances, the maximum number of cases that a new worker to the Department shall carry at any given time shall be gradually increased over a three (3) month period in the following manner:
•	One-third (1/3) of the total maximum cases at the completion of first month
•	Two-thirds (2/3) of the total maximum cases at the completion of second month
•	100% of the total maximum cases at the completion of third month.
Except in extenuating circumstances, new workers shall not be assigned the maximum number of cases until the completion of the Department's Pre-Service Training Program.
VII.	CASELOADS OF PART-TIME WORKERS
Part-time workers shall be assigned cases or supervisees proportional to the hours worked.
126
VIII.	FAMILY RESOURCE/SPECIALISTS STAFF
Except in extenuating and rare circumstances, homefinders, adoption workers, assistant program development specialists, program development specialists, nonvolunteering casework supervisors and technicians shall not be assigned ongoing cases, investigations or assessments.
IX.	VACANCIES
The Department recognizes its obligation to minimize the delays in the filling of vacancies. The Department will provide the Union, on a monthly basis, a list of all filled positions within the bargaining unit. Such list shall be by office, title and grade.
In further recognition that delays in the filling of vacancies contribute to worker overload, the parties agree that all Bargaining Unit 8 employees shall, whenever possible, submit written notice of separation at least four (4) weeks prior to the effective date.
X.	ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENT
The Department agrees that workers shall be required to complete only those forms and administrative documents which have been authorized and issued by the Central Office.
XI.	STATE VEHICLES
The Department agrees to actively seek a Departmental fleet of State vehicles to be deployed on a Central, Field Support and Area level. The Department further agrees to report to the Statewide Labor/Management Committee, within sixty (60) days from the signing date of this Agreement, the status of the efforts to secure and/or deploy said vehicles. The Department agrees to seek to obtain gas and toll cards for each vehicle.
XII.	STATEWIDE LABOR MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
It is mutually agreed by the parties that the Statewide Labor Management Committee will address factors, which arise during the life of the Agreement, which affect worker's abilities to meet their case responsibilities.
The Department further agrees to continue the Labor Management Casework/Paperwork Reduction Committee to discuss the reduction or elimination of social workers responsibility for tasks such as (but not limited to):
•	ASSIST forms
•	Transportation of clients
•	Filing
•	Medicaid card issuance
•	Medical passport and related documentation
•	Non-placement case reviews.
If changes in casework related tasks or additional tasks are anticipated, these changes will be made only after discussions have taken place between the parties.
127
All of the provisions of this Agreement shall be implemented upon signing. However, in recognition of the advance time necessary to modify the Department's ASSIST system the parties agree that the ASSIST related provisions of this Agreement will be implemented no later than ninety (90) calendar days from the signing of this Agreement.
The Department agrees to establish with the Union a sub-committee to assess the workload impact of bilingual/bicultural cases, and develop ways to reduce the workload impact (such as weighing them as more difficult).
XIII.	TRANSCRIPTION EQUIPMENT
The Department agrees to make a good faith effort to provide state-of-the-art transcription equipment for all social workers who wish to use it.
XIV.	TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
In recognition of the importance of ongoing education in providing effective services to clients, the Department agrees to provide a pre-service training program for all new employees and to allow each bargaining unit member a maximum of eight (8) days for educational experiences through the Social Work Training Institute, the Foster Training Institute, and/or other external workshops, conferences, courses.
XV.	GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROVISIONS
The provisions of this Agreement shall be subject to the grievance/arbitration procedure in Article 23A. The arbitrator shall have full authority to identify and decide violations of the Agreement. In fashioning a remedy, however, the arbitrator shall be limited to ordering the Department to undertake one or more of the specific remedial steps expressly outlined in the Agreement including those contained in Section I of this supplemental Agreement. It is agreed that the arbitrator shall have no authority to issue any order which results directly or indirectly in the inability of DSS to provide services to any case.
In an effort to facilitate the expeditious processing of grievances the parties agree that the provisions of Article 23A as they relate to Sections I, II, and IV of this Supplemental Agreement shall not require the Department to conduct a meeting on each Step II grievance. The parties agree to meet no later than six (6) months following the implementation of this Agreement to review the subject of Step II meetings in light of their experience. The parties shall by mutual agreement establish a provision of meetings which shall remain in effect for the balance of this Agreement.
In the event that a grievance is denied at Step II without a grievance meeting, the Department agrees to provide the grievant with specific reason(s) as to why a meeting was not held and the specific reason(s) as to why the grievance was denied.
128
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT R-1 covering
BARGAINING UNIT 8 EMPLOYEES AT THE
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSITIONAL ASSISTANCE
[1]	The Department shall assign work to employees based upon its assessment of current Federal, State and Departmental priorities, initiatives, and operational needs.
[2]	The Department shall maintain a caseload based system of work. The caseload system embodies the principle of continuity of services provided by a Transitional Assistance Social Worker (TASW) to a designated group of clients. In the event at a TASW is unavailable to perform work on assigned cases, or for other legitimate reasons, those cases or specific tasks on such cases may be temporarily assigned, consistent with current practice, to other TASW(s). This assignment shall not unreasonably burden the TASW(s) working on these cases.
[3]	There shall be established a Special Labor/Management Committee which shall consist of up to seven (7) persons designated by the Commissioner of the Department, and up to seven (7) persons designated by SEIU Local 509. The Committee will meet monthly to review and discuss the implementation of current and future projects and initiatives.

The Committee may also discuss priorities and timetables necessary to achieve appropriate implementation of these projects or initiatives.
[4]	The Department and the Union agree that in contemplating or reviewing the reasonableness of disciplinary action based on unsatisfactory work performance, potentially mitigating factors should be considered, such as: the actual work time the employee had available to do the job, the size, make-up and complexity of the employee's caseload as well as any special projects or other time sensitive work assignments or responsibilities. In any event, no discipline shall be imposed without just cause.
[5]	In the event that SEIU Local 509 believes that an employee has been disciplined for failure to meet work expectations - including formal warnings (s) - the Union may file a grievance and request that it be treated as an expedited grievance. This grievance shall be heard at Step 2 within sixty (60) calendar days of the request and the decision shall be issued within two (2) weeks of the close of the hearing.
In the event that the case involves suspension or discharge of the employee, either party may request expedited arbitration. This request shall be granted and the hearing shall be held within thirty (30) calendar days of the request and the decision shall be issued within two (2) weeks of the close of the hearing.
Arbitrations held pursuant to this section shall be heard by an Arbitrator drawn from a list of arbitrators agreed upon by the parties and pursuant to the provisions of Article 23A of the Commonwealth/Alliance SEIU Local 509 collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding on the parties and shall be enforceable in accordance with the provisions of M.G.L. Chapter 150C.

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT R-2 covering
BARGAINING UNIT 8 EMPLOYEES AT THE
DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
1.	The Division shall assign work to employees represented by SEIU, Local 509 based upon the operational needs of the Division.
2.	The parties agree that work responsibilities assigned to each employee shall not be greater than can reasonably be expected in the time available. The "time available" for a Unit 8 DMA employee shall be defined as the number of days in a given month (Monday through Friday) minus the time that a worker is away from the workplace on allowable paid leave under Articles 5, 8, 9 and 10 of the Agreement, or on an unpaid leave of absence.
3.	In the event that a Bargaining Unit 8 employee believes that his/her workload is excessive or unreasonable in comparison to other DMA Bargaining Unit 8 employees in the same functional job title, he/she may petition in writing to the Director of the MassHealth Enrollment Center or CPU to review his/her work assignments for the previous month within twenty-one (21) days of the month to be reviewed. The petition must be original and completed by the employee who alleges that his/her workload is excessive or unreasonable.
4.	The Director or his/her designee shall review the entire range of work assigned
to the petitioner during the requested month and return a determination to the petitioner no later than ten (10) business days from the date of receipt of the petition or, if a meeting is held to review the petition, no later than twenty-one (21) days from the date of receipt. A copy of the determination shall be forwarded to the Assistant Commissioner of Member Services, the Director of Human Resources and the SEIU Local 509 Chapter President.
5.	In the event the petitioner is not satisfied with the determination of the MEC
or CPU Director, he/she may appeal said determination within ten (10) calendar days from the date of receipt to the Director of Human Resources or his/her designee for a summary review and final determination by the Division. A copy of the final determination shall be forwarded to the petitioner no later than fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of said appeal.
6.	The Special Labor Management Committee shall consist of two (2) representatives designated by the Union and two (2) representatives designated by the Commissioner of DMA. The committee shall meet monthly to review and discuss the manner in which new mandates, initiatives, and procedures change Bargaining Unit 8 employee responsibilities and performance, and issues related to excessive work volume. Nothing would preclude the Division or the Union from inviting subject matter experts to attend committee meetings depending on
agenda items. The Committee will also discuss timetables for implementation of such mandates, initiatives, and procedures. DMA shall provide the Committee with such information to fulfill its agenda prior to the Committee meeting as soon as administratively feasible.
7.	When either the Union or DMA so requests, the Special Labor Management Committee shall be chaired by a neutral facilitator, who shall be selected by the parties, or, barring such agreement, designated by the Board of Conciliation and 130
Arbitration. Any costs associated with the neutral facilitator shall be equally shared by the DMA and the Union. If the DMA and the Union cannot agree, the neutral facilitator will actively facilitate the parties' attempts to reconcile the disagreement.
8.	In the event that a Bargaining Unit 8 employee believes that he/she has been unfairly disciplined because of productivity or quality of work which result in a suspension or discharge, and the employee has completed his/her probationary period, he/she may request that a grievance be expedited to Step III by waiving one or more steps of the grievance procedure. Both parties agree to explore Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as the final step of resolving such grievances.
9.	The Union will be allowed to have one per month members' meetings at DMA offices that employ Bargaining Unit 2 and 8 personnel to discuss issues of interest of its members. These meetings will be scheduled with the MEC/CPU Director or his/her designee at least one (1) week in advance of the meeting. Such requests shall not be unreasonably denied.
10.	The terms of this Agreement shall not be altered or amended without the written agreement of both parties or until rescinded through the execution of a mutually agreed upon successor to this Agreement.
131
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT S-1 covering
BARGAINING UNIT 8 EMPLOYEES at the
MASSACHUSETTS COMMISSION FOR THE BLIND
The parties recognize that the delivery of quality human services to the legally blind residents of the Commonwealth is of paramount importance and, towards this end, all reasonable efforts will be made to ensure that all expressed needs for service are met.
The parties recognize that such services can most effectively be delivered within the context of an efficient and equitable caseload management system maintained by skilled professional human service workers.
The parties enter into this agreement applicable to direct service Unit 8 employees of the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind including workers in the following job disciplines: Vocational Rehabilitation, Social Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation Teaching, Children, Mobility, Multihandicapped, Medical Assistance, Client Assistance and Elder Services, and their supervisors.
SECTION I
COUNSELOR WITH THE BLIND I, II, III.
A.	The following standards encompass the full range of work normally and currently performed by workers whose function is providing case management and/or support services in Vocational Rehabilitation, Social Rehabilitation, Rehabilitation Teaching, Children, Mobility, and Multihandicapped.
Whenever a worker is assigned other duties customarily perceived to be accepted responsibilities within the position's classification, her/his work standard shall be reduced in proportion to the time required to perform these duties. The parties recognize that client service is a worker's first priority and care will be taken to limit assignment of additional responsibilities to safeguard this commitment.
DISCIPLINE	STANDARD
Mobility	30
Vocational Rehabilitation	60
Social Rehabilitation	70
Rehabilitation Teaching	70
Children	90
Multihandicapped	55
In the event that it becomes necessary to assign more than the standard number of cases to any worker, the work expectation as reflected in the worker's performance appraisal shall be adjusted proportionately.
The parties agree to establish a Labor-Management Committee to review the standard for Children's Workers and to discuss the treatment of children’s cases across regions.
132
Further, the parties agree to establish a Labor-Management Committee to recommend a caseload/workload standard for Medical Assistance Workers, Client Assistance Workers and Elder Services Workers. The Committee shall submit its recommendations to HRD within three [3] months of the signing of this agreement.
B.	These standards shall serve as a goal for the purpose of assigning cases with the target of equalizing the number of cases per worker within disciplines. In order to equitably distribute the workload, the following practices shall be implemented in all service units impacted by this proposal:
1.	A case shall be counted in a worker's caseload upon face-to-face (client/worker) contact with the assigned worker.
2.	The monthly master list of cases shall be compiled by supervisors.
3.	Whenever the caseload size of any worker within a job discipline exceeds the
standard, intake cases may be assigned to workers covering contiguous towns, but not across regions or programs, in order to equalize the number of cases carried by workers within that supervisory unit.
4.	Whenever the caseload size of all workers within a supervisory unit exceeds the standard, it shall be the responsibility of the supervisor to screen new referrals accordingly and determine assignment.
5.	Whenever the caseload size of all workers within a region or program exceeds the standard, management will move to achieve parity by assigning priority consideration to that region or program when an appropriately funded vacancy occurs in the agency.
C.	In equalizing the number of cases per worker, management shall take into consideration geographic area and travel time, and job performance shall be judged consistent with this factor.
D.	Whenever caseloads in a service area continue to exceed the standard statewide, and all other remedies herein referred to have been exhausted, the parties will develop interim assignment criteria pending requests to the administration and legislature for new positions.
E.	Part-time workers shall be assigned cases in accordance with A through D above
and in proportion to hours worked.
SECTION II
COUNSELOR WITH THE BLIND IV.
A.	The agency staffing ratio of supervisors to workers shall be one [1] to five [5].
B.	Whenever a part-time supervisor supervises a number of employees greater than the proportional standard, management will make reasonable efforts to develop the supervisory resources necessary to supervise the excess.
133
CASELOAD STANDARDS
It is mutually agreed by the parties that the Statewide Labor-Management Committee will address factors which arise during the life of the Agreement which affect worker's abilities to meet their case responsibilities.
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
In the event that disputes arise, the provisions of this Agreement shall be processed through Step 2 of the grievance procedure set forth in Article 23A.
The terms of this agreement will not be precedent setting, nor are they applicable to any other agency or department of the Commonwealth. It is expressly agreed that said procedures shall remain in effect for the duration of the 1997-1999 Commonwealth/Alliance Agreement.
134

1.	Severely hearing impaired/deaf;
2.	Severely mobility impaired;

II.	CASELOAD SIZES/TRIGGER POINTS
A.	Specialty caseload size range:	60 - 90
B.	General/Mixed caseload size range: 80 - 150
Caseload sizes may go above or below stated ranges (see III-Caseload (Reviews).
C.	Trigger Points:
1.	General/Mixed caseloads will be automatically reviewed for appropriate size at 120. This Agreement may be waived upon mutual agreement between supervisor and counselor (see III-Caseload Reviews).
2.	Specialty caseloads will be automatically reviewed for appropriate size at 80. This Agreement may be waived upon mutual agreement between supervisor and counselor (see III-Caseload Reviews).
3.	A counselor, supervisor or manager may initiate a caseload review at any time or point prior to, at, or after the automatic review point.
III.	CASELOAD REVIEWS/PROCESS/ RESTORATION
A.	When a caseload review is conducted, the focus of such a review will be on the amount of direct administrative and service delivery time required of the counselor.
138
B.	It is recognized that there will be occasions when a caseload review is not indicated although the trigger point has been reached (e.g., when such a review has very recently been conducted). To allow for deferral to reviews under such circumstances, the supervisor and counselor will meet whenever such a trigger point is reached in order to discuss the situation. A caseload review will ensue unless the counselor, supervisor and area director agree that a review is not necessary. All three parties must agree to deferral of the review, and so signify via a sign-off.
C.	When a caseload review conducted by the counselor and the unit supervisor is deemed unsatisfactory by either party, such may be submitted to the area director and, if necessary, to the regional director for her/his consideration. If a review meeting is held at the regional director level, a Union representative may be present if so requested by the counselor. If a dispute still exists, the counselor may request that the issue be referred to the Labor-Management Caseload Committee (see IV). If the dispute remains unresolved after consideration by this Committee, the issue will be submitted as a third step grievance under Article 23-A, and not processed beyond the third step grievance.
IV.	LABOR-MANAGEMENT CASELOAD COMMITTEE
A. Labor-Management Committee composed of equal representation of labor and management will be formed to:
1.	Oversee the implementation of this Agreement;
2.	Consider and resolve disputes arising from caseload size issues and reviews.
V.	GOALS AND STANDARDS
Client service goals and caseload standards are established following discussions and negotiations between the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner; with regional directors; then with area directors; then with unit supervisors; then between unit supervisor and counselors. Disputes at any stage of the process shall be resolved by a meeting between the counselor, unit supervisor and, if necessary, the area director. If the issue remains unresolved, it shall be referred to the regional director. If a review meeting is held at the regional director level, a Union representative may be present if requested by the counselor. If the issue continues to remain unresolved, the Union may submit the issue to the Office of the Deputy Commissioner of Vocational Rehabilitation for review.
The process to establish client service goals and caseload standards is intended to be participatory in nature. The Union is encouraged to alert management regarding instances in which a participatory procedure is not being followed. Nothing herein shall be interpreted as diminishing any of the management's rights as set out in Article 2.
