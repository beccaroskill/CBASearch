L Board Policy
The Board recognizes the importance of an orderly process to arrive at negotiated settlements with the recognized exclusive representatives and bargaining agents of employee groups (certificated licensed and classified, excluding administrators). The Board, therefore, delegates to the Administration the responsibility of conducting good faith negotiations within the parameters set by the Board and reporting those negotiations to the Board.
II.	Administration Policy
The employee agent group is defined as the professional employee association with the largest membership based on full-time equivalent employees. The Administration will recommend to the Board a negotiating team to represent the Board in conducting negotiations with recognized employee groups according to approved guidelines.
Guidelines
A.	Formal negotiations meeting dates will be determined no later than May I of each contract year.
B.	Beginning with the first negotiating session, procedural agreements concerning negotiations will be mutually established.
C.	Employee agent group members will be provided a maximum of six (6) days to complete the negotiation process.
D.	After June 15, if agreement has not been reached in negotiations, the Board or the employee agent group or both parties together may declare an impasse.
E.	Immediately after declaration of impasse by either party, the Board will invite the employee agent group to participate in mediation using the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The role of the mediator will be to facilitate communication. All costs associated with mediation will be shared equally by the Board and the employee agent group.
F.	If mediation is not completed or otherwise terminated within forty-five (45) days after the appointment of a mediator, further mediation may continue at the discretion of the Board.
G.	A negotiated agreement entered into by the Board will be posted on the school district's Web site within ten (10) days of ratification of the agreement.
