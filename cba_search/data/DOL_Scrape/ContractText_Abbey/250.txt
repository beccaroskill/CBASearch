6.2	OVERTIME ALLOCATION
A.	Any regular employee regularly assigned to any designated job during the major portion of his or her regular shift on which it becomes necessary to work overtime, will be afforded the opportunity to do this job on overtime hours, the same as he or she would have normally done had it been during regular working hours. Any regular employee regularly assigned to any designated job during the major portion of the week on which it becomes necessary to work overtime on Saturday or Sunday, will be afforded the opportunity to do this job on overtime hours, the same as he or she would have normally done had it been during regular working hours; however, the Company shall have no responsibility to assign overtime to the employee who works the major portion of the week when such employee is absent on the day the overtime assignment is made. However, the above mentioned overtime selection provision for Saturday and/or Sunday' overtime shall not apply to incidental overtime work that takes less
11
than one (1) hour to perform during the overtime assignment, If such work exceeds the one (1) hour time limitation, the affected employee shall be retroactively adjusted for the length of the total scheduled overtime at the applicable overtime rate.
It shall not be a violation of this Article to assign an employee, who had accepted offered overtime, to other available work when machine breakdown occurs subsequent to the conclusion of the employees last regularly scheduled shift. Nor shall it be a violation of this Agreement to reassign an employee to perform overtime work originally offered and accepted by another employee who is subsequently absent and not available to perform that overtime work.
The plant Labor/Management committees will establish the appropriate method of allocating overtime for support departments.
B.	When the above is not applicable, the Company will make every reasonable effort to distribute overtime equally among regular employees regularly assigned to the department where work is available taking into consideration the work to be done and the ability of the employees. The following sequence shall be used in equalizing overtime under this section:
a.	Work group on the shift, all job classes
b.	Seniority department on the shift
c.	The work group on any other shift, all job classes
d.	Seniority department on any other shift
e.	Any other department within the plant
f.	Any other plant
Employees will be eligible for overtime under this section providing they have the skill and ability to perform the work, with minimal training. The work groups to be mutually agreed upon by the plant labor/management team.
When section 6.2 A. does not apply, then any rework activity that constitutes weekend overtime will be used to equalize overtime within a department, taking into consideration the work to be done and the skill and ability of the employee to do the work. The flow chart in Appendix G shall be used in determining eligibility for rework.
C.	The Company shall, on a quarterly basis, furnish a listing of all overtime worked and by whom.
D.	Any employee who has worked overtime at any time during the regularly scheduled work week shall be per
12
mitted to work his or her regular scheduled hours for the balance of the work week.
E.	The Union agrees and it is distinctly understood that there will be no pyramiding of overtime upon overtime.
E Probationary employees may work overtime on their job, in an emergency situation, provided that all employees in their department on their shift have been offered the opportunity to work. Should the Union feel that this provision is being abused then they will notify the management of the facility affected and a meeting will be arranged between the parties to attempt to resolve the situation. If the situation cannot be resolved then the Union will notify the management of that facility that probationary employees can no longer work overtime unless every employee in their department, regardless of shift, is offered the opportunity to work.
G.	All overtime work is optional on the part of the employee. When an employee without good cause fails to work overtime after promising to do so, the Company shall not be obligated to assign him or her to overtime work for a period of 15 days commencing on the next regular work day following the missed overtime.
H.	Overtime roster to be made available to all employees in a given cost center or department. Employees may request to not be afforded overtime opportunities by completing a form available in the employee’s local Human Resources Office. If the employee, at a later date wishes to be afforded overtime opportunities, it will be the employee’s responsibility to contact the Human Resources office and his/ her supervisor with this decision. The Company will provide the Union with a copy of the form.
Employees will be notified as far in advance as is reasonably practical when scheduled overtime is to be worked but not later than the end of the shift on Thursday for Saturday overtime work, unless an emergency arises which precludes giving such notice. Weekday overtime will be charged as “overtime asked” if the employee is offered overtime at least one (1) hour prior to the end of the shift. Weekend overtime will be charged as “overtime asked”, if an employee is offered overtime by the end of the shift on Thursday. If such notice is given as provided for above, the notified employee, if he or she accepts, will be required to perform the scheduled overtime work. Failure to work the agreed upon weekend overtime shall be treated as an unexcused absence, unless the employee notifies the Company during the first three hours of
13
the shift on Friday that they cannot work the agreed to overtime. Employees on all leaves of absence or vacation will be charged with being asked for the average amount of overtime worked in their work group during the period of their absence. All supervisors are responsible for keeping current, accurate overtime records of afforded overtime opportunities. The overtime records may be reviewed by Union representatives at the Union's request.
I.

CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REPAIR SUPPLEMENT - 1969
Employees working in the Customer Service and Repair Department shall be subject to the following terms and conditions in addition to the provisions of the Agreement to which this supplement is appended.
1.	Ah classifications covered by this supplement shall be subject to the Job Posting and Bidding provisions of the Agreement, excepting the Classification of Instructor.
Instructor vacancies will be filled by selection from the '‘A" and “R" mechanics in the department based on ability and seniority.
2.	Employees selected for the Instructor “C” classification shall be on trial for the first 160 hours of working as an Instructor. If during this 160 hour trial period the Company determines the employee is not performing for whatever reason. he or she shall be given a written notice stating the area or areas he or she must correct or improve upon. If no improvement of performance is demonstrated after the written notice, he or she shall be removed from the classification and returned to his or her former job (if available) or one of like pay,
3.	Having successfully completed the 160 hour trial period, and if his or her performance is satisfactory at the completion of 700 additional hours of instructing, the employee will progress to the next highest classification.
4.	Advancement to the Instructor “A" classification shall be awarded upon satisfactory completion of 860 hours of Instructing as an Instructor “B”.
5.	Field Service Trainee Schedule will be as follows:
Two (2) weeks school.
Sixty (60) days in Repair Section.
Four (4) weeks instructing.
This work schedule will be repeated for each prod-line. If any other products are added to the Mercury prod-line, this training program will apply. Field Service Reparatives will have the opportunity to accumulate sixty days of refresher training per year. Field Service Repre-ives shall at no time deprive regular employees of their 1 work assignment or overtime opportunity.
6.	Propeller repair work will be assigned to the classification mechanic.
67
7.	Tester will be hired as Class “C” Mechanic sub
ject to automatic progression.
8.	Instructors and mechanics will be told about
new
or changed products at a time that
the
be the opportune time,
Instructors
will,
Company
however,
feels to
be given this
classified information before other Customer Service and Re-
pair employees.
9.
Employees hired or bidding into “C’
mechanic
classification must pass a mechanic aptitude test with a mini-
mum score of 80 percentile.
10.
In
the
event that
Mercury
Marine produces
product foreign to reciprocating internal combustion
marine
engines, all service and repair mechanics will be given preference for service work on these products based on knowledge,
ability and seniority.
Letter of Understanding
The closing of the
service repair facility coupled
with the
fact that the service school is operated only approximately
seven (7) months out of the year, would normally result in the displacement for five (5) months of employees classified as Instructor A’s. Those employees would then be required to perform whatever work was available until the service school again began operating the following fall.
In an effort to more fully utilize the skills of employees classified as Instructor A, the Company and the Union mutually agree as follows:
That during those months that the service school does not operate the Company will have the right to utilize some or all of the employees classified as Instructor A to perform work that is traditionally non-bargaining. If it is necessary to reduce the number of Instructor A’s performing non-bargaining unit work then the least senior Instructor A will be reduced
and returned to the Distribution Plant.
It is specifically agreed between the Parties that the work to be performed is non-bargaining unit work. It is also specifically agreed that the performance of this work by bargaining unit instructors will not give rise to any future claim that the work they perform is bargaining unit work.
It is also agreed between the Parties that the employees selected will remain part of the current bargaining unit with, all rights and privileges granted to them under the current Labor Agreement. Employees selected will continue to receive the rate of pay that they received as Instructors.
68
It is also specifically agreed that the Company has the unilateral right at any time to discontinue the use of any or all Instructor A's in a non-bargaining capacity. Instructors whose services as a service training aide are discontinued will be returned to the bargaining unit and assigned work to which their seniority would entitle them.
Effective June 15,1992 the position of Service Instructor and the work performed by them shall become non-bargaining. Employees holding the classification of Service Instructor as of June 15,1992 will remain in the bargaining unit and hold the classification until they retire or bid out of the classification. All new instructors hired after June 15. 1992 will be non-bargaining unit employees.
69
APPENDIX E
MEASURED DAY WORK
1.	Application of Measured Day Work
1.1	Measured day work will be used in the areas and/or operations that the Company deems appropriate.
1.2	The production standards that are established for operations on measured day work in the Machining Department and Casting Plants will be appropriate for the work involved as determined by predetermined time value, standard data or stopwatch. The standards will represent a normal pace (100% = 3 mile per hour National norm) and will be used to gauge the performance of the employee and the work group.
1.3	The production standards that are established for operations on measured day work in the Assembly Department will be appropriate for the work involved as determined by predetermined time values, standard data or stopwatch, The standards will represent the pace of an average experienced operator working with good skills and effort (100% = 3.57 mile per hour) and will be used to gauge the performance of the employee and the work group.
1.4	When using the stopwatch method for setting production standards, the number of pieces to be studied will be sufficient to ensure a reasonable level of reliability.
2.	Practices To Be Observed For Measured Day Work The following work practices and procedures are to assure efficient and effective operations io meet the needs of employees and the business.
2.1	Employees are expected to meet production standards as assigned, and report to their supervisor any conditions or circumstances which prevent them from performing effectively or completing their assigned work.

and 1.3 of this Appendix, allowances will be added fo following factors for measured day work jobs.
70
3.1	Personal Allowance 5%.
3.2	Delay allowance for processed control opera
tions in accordance with the following formula:
2.5% Delay Allowance
3.0% Delay Allowance
3.5% Delay Allowance
4.0% Delay Allowance
4.5% Delay Allowance
5.0% Delay Allowance
0% - 49% Process Control 50% - 59% Process Control 60% - 69% Process Control 70% - 79% Process Control 80% - 89% Process Control 90% - 100% Process Control
When the Company makes the decision to invest in new capital equipment it must be able to operate in the most
efficient and cost effective manner. Delay allowances must be established that recognize the new technologies and ergonomic advances designed into the new equipment. During the first year of operating the new equipment the Company and the Union will study the delay allowances and by mutual agreement establish an appropriate standard.
3.3	Fatigue Allowance - To be applied in accordance with the following schedule when part is handled without the aid of mechanical devices.
Piece Weight	Under 1.00 Min.	1.00-2.00 Min.	2.01-3.00 Min.	Above 3.0 Min.

'die Parties recognize that increased operator flexibility reater operator impact on quality are essential to pro-* a quality product and that work rules which reduce ity and encourage inefficiency are contrary to the best ; of Company and employees. Therefore, it shall not ation of any provision of this Agreement to require 's to perform work such as inspection of prior opera-ine preventative maintenance, material handling or work that may cross former traditional departmen-lines where such work is performed incidental to ■ their normal duties.

It shall be incumbent upon the Company to provide employees with the training necessary to properly perform such work.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - NON-SCHED-ULED PRODUCTION DAYS

This Agreement specifically allows the Company to select by seniority the people who normally perform the work to continue to perform that work during Non-Scheduled Production Work Days which are specified as -- The Vacation Shut Down Period, Inventory Shut Down, Christmas Shutdown and short-term layoffs where normal production of the Manufacturing, Casting or Foundry Plants are individually or entirely canceled.
The method for determining who shall be requested to work during these non-scheduled production days shall be:
— Vacation Shutdown - Voluntary
— Christmas Holidays - Voluntary
- Inventory and/or short term layoffs - Volunteers will be requested in seniority order from among the employees who normally run the jobs needed. Failing to get sufficient volunteers the work assignment becomes mandatory in reverse seniority order.
This Agreement shall also apply to employees normally assigned to jobs involving the picking and distribution of parts or product.

76
work, when they bid to a different classification or when they volunteer to work outside their department during the vacation shutdown period.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - J.I.T. DRIVERS
J.I.T. Drivers shall be able to load and unload their trucks at other than their own seniority plant.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING - PRODUCTIVITY POOL
In recognition of the need to provide meaningful activity for employees displaced from their normal duties due to increased productivity in a specific manufacturing plant resulting from employee effort, a pool of employees will be created into which such displaced employees may elect to go. Such pool of employees will be designated the “Productivity Pool’’ and will operate as follows:
PooLCreatiOR
1.	Eligibility: Employees displaced by employee generated productivity gains in their operation who would otherwise be subject to layoff from their seniority department, are eligible to be assigned to the Productivity Pool. (Employees displaced for reasons other than employee generated productivity increases, i.e., capital investment, technology change, reduced production schedules in response to decreased demand, etc,, in their department will be handled under established provisions of the Labor Agreement, or the Letter of Understanding regarding Non-Competitive Situations.)
2.	Election: Employees who elect not to go into the Productivity Pool when first eligible will be laid off and recalled in accordance with Article XI of the Labor Agreement.
Pool-Operation
1.	Productivity Pool employees will be paid the rate of a Maintenance Helper or the “appropriate rate” of any higher established classification if Pool employee performs in that classification for eight (8) hours or more.
2.	Pool employees may be assigned work in any facility that does not displace another bargaining unit employee and may be assigned a variety of tasks. Prior to using Produc-ivlty Pool employees in any facility with employees laid off. he receiving plant’s labor/management committee will meet 5 determine if Productivity Pool employees are to be used, te type of work to be done and the duration of the assignent.
77
3.	Seniority has no application in the Pool for work assignment except for original shift preference where a shift preference is available.
4.	Work assignments may encompass work on any shift and, where a shift change is involved, advance notice will be given employees so assigned. (It should be recognized many projects will be done on off shifts.)
5.	Employees who perform unsatisfactorily in the Pool and/or do not adjust to the concept, will be placed on layoff and subject to Article XI Layoff & Recall provision.
6.	Disagreements arising under this arrangement shall be settled by the Parties without resort to the grievance procedure except for employees involuntarily removed from the Pool and placed on layoff status.
7.	Employees in the Pool may elect to go on layoff at any time and will thenceforth be covered by Article XI Layoff & Recall.
8.	Should there be a layoff resulting from other than employee generated productivity increases, employees with greater seniority in a specific plant may displace.Pool employees from that plant who have less seniority with the less senior employees from that plant being placed on layoff.
The intent of this arrangement is to provide work for employees who would otherwise be laid off due to employee generated productivity increases. It is expressly recognized that this is a special case falling outside the normal contractual guidelines, Problems and issues will be handled by a joint Management-Labor Committee.
It is expressly understood that the Productivity Pool will operate during the term of this Agreement.
