4.	Health And Welfare Re-write the following sections in the HW Article as indicated below and substitute the following in each contract covered by this Agreement.
HEALTH AND WELFARE
Section The Employer shall contribute to the established South Central United Food and Commercial Workers Union and Employers Health and Welfare Trust Fund for all hours paid, not to exceed forty (40) hours per week, after thirty (30) calendar days of employment. Effective April 1,2016 (March hours) the employer will begin making contributions on part-time fuel clerks. Such contributions shall be used to provide Health and Welfare benefits, for all enrolled Bargaining Unit Employees, subject to and in strict accordance with the terms of Section(“Funding Policy").
A. Contributions to Fund Benefits:
The Employer shall contribute to the Fund in the following amount provided that the Trustees of the Plan provide benefits and manage the Plan in accordance with their fiduciary responsibility and in accordance with the provisions of this Article:
Date	Amount
January 1,2011 (Dec. hours)	$2.32 per hour
Provided the Trustees have enacted modifications to the Plan consistent with the
provisions contained at the end of this section (A. Contributions to Fund Benefits),
the Employer further agrees to the following increases to its contribution rates to
the Fund;
3
1.	Effective the first of the month following adoption by the Trustees of a package of plan amendments conforming with the provisions detailed herein, the Employer will make a lump sum payment equal to $3,500,000, in the aggregate for all bargaining units of the employer covered under the South Central Funding Group effective for the employees of this Agreement. Effective March 1, 2017, provided hours are worked by employees covered by this agreement, the employer will make a second $3,500,000 lump sum payment in the aggregate for all bargaining units of the employer covered under the South Central Funding Group. In addition, should the fund reserves fall below $2,000,000 prior to February 28, 2017, the Employer agrees to accelerate one-half of the next months contribution payment to bring the cash flow above $2,000,000.
2.	Effective April 1,2016 (March hours), the employer’s contribution rate will be increased to $3.00 per hour.
3.	Effective April 1,2017 (March hours), the Employer’s contribution rate will be increased to $3.05 per hour.
4.	Effective April 1,2019 (March hours), the Employer’s contribution rate will be increased to $3.10 per hour.
a. In addition to the above rate increases, the Trustees (based on the advice of the Plan Consultants), not later than March 31, 2019, shall determine the Plan’s current reserve status and if such reserves are projected to be at 4 months or above as of March 31, 2020, the Employer and the employees will receive contribution holidays in an amount necessary to achieve a reserve level on March 31, 2020 no greater than 4 months of reserves.
As a condition of receiving the contributions provided above, the Trustees of the Plan will establish a Plan(s) of benefits consistent with the provisions herein, which can be supported by the contributions provided herein. The Bargaining Parties recommend that Trustees of the South Central Fund adopt said plan of benefits. Consistent with this provision, not later than the first of the month following ratification, to be effective July 1,2016 or January 1, 2017, the Trustees are directed to make the modifications to the Plan (which can include adjustments to the Plan(s) of benefits, eligibility rules and/or employee co-premium rates) of sufficient amount that when taking into account the contingent contribution increases detailed above will ensure that on April 1,2020 that the Plan will have a reserve equal to three (3) months reserves and to further ensure that on or after January 1,2019, the Plan will not drop below two months reserves.
With respect to the July 1,2016 or January 1,2017modifications contemplated in this provision, the union trustees will be allowed to take the laboring oar to make recommendations to the Trustees of the Fund with respect to benefit eligibility, benefit modifications, plan design and/or employee co-premium rates consistent with the objectives of this provision provided that such recommendations may not reduce the rate of employee co-premiums or delay the effective date of their implementation. The Employer trustees, consistent with their fiduciary duties, shall support the recommendations of the union trustees.
If the Union Trustees fail to tender a timely motion no later than 60 days, or Consent Resolution, to enact changes consistent with this provision or the Union Trustees motion to enact changes is inadequate according to the plan’s actuarial consultant to achieve the target discussed herein and as a result the Trustees deadlock motions on adjustments necessary to bring the Plan back in to compliance with this provision, then the deadlocked motions shall be submitted for resolution to arbitration in accordance with the trust's deadlock procedures. The arbitrator shall be considered a fiduciary and such arbitrator’s authority shall be limited to casting a vote for or against any pending deadlocked motion.
Eligibility
The Administrator will, on an annual basis, obtain all data necessary to enroll or re-enroll employees and their dependents as participants eligible for coverage under the Plan. To remain enrolled as a participant eligible for plan coverage, each employee who is currently enrolled, or who initially enrolls during the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, must re-enroll prior to the start of each succeeding plan year. Employees must make a positive election to enroll in the Plan. Enrollment is for the entire plan of benefits (except that Life Insurance and AD & D shall be provided to all eligible employees) for the Plan and an employee’s failure to make a positive enrollment into the Plan shall result in such employee being ineligible for all benefits of the Pian for the remainder of the calendar year or until there has been a qualifying life event, as defined by the Trustees, whichever occurs first.
The Employer may, upon reasonable notice and at its own expense, audit the Fund's enrollment data and claims records once each plan year. The Employer may arrange to have the audit conducted by a recognized auditing firm that it shall select.
Independent of the foregoing audits, the Fund will audit its enrollment and claims records at ieast once each plan year to ensure that no employees of the Employer, or the dependents of such employees, are participating in plan coverage for which they are not eligible.
Employees shall become eligible for benefits upon meeting the requirements of the Plan.
All employees must continue to meet all eligibility requirements of the Plan as a
condition of continued eligibility.
5
The Trustees shall establish a separate accounting of income and expenses for the "Funding group" of the Fund who agree in their Collective Bargaining Agreements to the same provisions as provided herein, unless otherwise approved by the Trustees. Only those Employers who adopt these provisions may share in the pool of income and expenses established herein. The Trustees are expressively prohibited from using the contributions of these employers for the payment of benefits to the employees of other employers.
Section . Funding Policy
This Funding Policy shall become activated and of full force and effect on April 1, 2016. The contributions provided for herein are with the parties’ understanding and agreement that the Trustees to the South Central Health and Welfare Fund will maintain the Plan in a fully funded and reserved status and will provide benefits in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
There are two purposes of this Funding Policy:
A.	Fully reserved status of the South Central Health and Welfare Fund
B.	Claims Payment Standards of the South Central Fund.
A.	Fully Reserved Status
It is agreed that the target fortuity reserved status shall be defined as reserves equal to a minimum of three (3.0) months of Health and Welfare expenses. In October of each year, the Fund Consultant will give a projection for the coming plan year as well as a projection of the remaining term of the Agreement.
The Consultant will provide the current status of the reserves at each quarterly meeting as well as a projection through the end of the current plan year.
It is understood and agreed that any projection showing reserves below two (2.0) months will cause the financial condition to be monitored closely by the Trustees and the Professionals of the plan. A projection showing reserves below two (2.0) months for two consecutive quarters, on or after January 1, 2019, will cause action to be taken by the Trustees to bring the level on reserves back to the desired level of three (3.0) months. Such actions may include a combination of benefit adjustments, eligibility changes and/or employee contribution rate increases.
B.	Claims Payment Standard
The Plan Administrator is responsible for payment of claims on a timely basis.
Payment schedules should comply with any vendor contractual obligations in order
to maintain the appropriate discounts provided by the vendor.
The Plan Administrator will make reports to the Trustees on compliance with these standards. Trustees are responsible for monitoring compliance of these standards and taking corrective action, as appropriate.
5.	The Union agrees to withdraw the following grievances and NLRB Board Charges:
a.	NLRB Charge #10-CA-168122
b.	Houston: General Grievance, Houston Clerks (case #1652625 / Tracking #192935)
c.	Issue: Fuel Center Clerks, Federal Mediation - 160128-52625-3
d.	Shreveport LA: General Grievance, Shreveport LA Clerks (case #1652646 / Tracking #192959), Issue: Fuel Center Clerks, Federal Mediation - 16012852645-3

Upon qualification, a monthly contribution will be made if the employee averages seventy two and one-half (72.5) hours per month. Each plan year, (July 1st through June 30th), the employee’s hours will be reviewed to determine if eight hundred and seventy (870) hours were worked during this time frame. If eight hundred and seventy (870) hours or more were worked, a retroactive contribution will be made for any months in which the employee did not initially receive a contribution in that plan year.
K.	If prior to April 1,2017, the National Pension Fund Trustees make the decision to reset the AUCR, and such reset requires a contribution increase to maintain the benefit level in effect on April 2, 2016, and the trustees further determine that such contribution increase must be made prior to the expiration of this agreement, then the employer agrees that the contribution rates in effect may be restored in an amount up to the rates in effect April 2, 2016.

This Agreement has been entered into by and between Kroger Texas L.P., hereinafter referred to as the "Employer" and the United Food and Commercial Workers Local No. 455, chartered by the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, hereinafter referred to as the "Union."
It is the intent and purpose of the Employer and the Union to promote and improve labor management relations between them and to set forth herein the basic terms of Agreement covering wages, hours, and conditions of employment to be observed.
In consideration of the mutual promises and agreements between the parties hereto, and in consideration of their mutual desires in promoting efficient conduct in business and providing for the orderly settlement of disputes between them, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE 3.	UNION SECURITY
Section 3,01 During the life of this Agreement, the Employer shall deduct an amount equivalent to dues and initiation fees weekly from employees who individually and voluntarily certify in writing on the check-off authorization form for such deductions. Such authorization shall be binding on the employees for the duration of this Agreement unless the authorization is revoked in accordance with the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, as amended. No deductions shall be discontinued until the Employer has verified through the Union that the employee's request for revocation is timely and proper. The Union shall certify in writing a list of its new members, together with signed authorization cards with an itemized list of such initiation fees and dues to be deducted from such members. The Employer shall promptly remit all sums deducted in this manner to the Union monthly. Timing for such deductions may be worked out locally between the Employer and the Union.
Section 3,02 If there should be a change in the law permitting a Union Security Clause, the following shall, to the extent permitted by law, be effective as part of this Agreement, beginning upon the earliest date permitted by such enabling legislation.
Section 3,03 The Employer will make deductions from employees according to the signed Active Ballot Club check-off authorization card and the monies collected will be forwarded promptly by separate check to the President of UFCW Local No. 455.
Section 3,04 It shall be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union in good standing on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing, and those who are not members on the effective date of this Agreement shall, on the thirty-first (31st) day following the effective date of this Agreement, become and remain members in good standing in the Union. It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after its effective date shall, on the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of such employment, become and remain members in good standing in the Union. For the purpose of this Section 3.04 only, the effective date of this Agreement, as referred to above, shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.02 above.
Section 3,05 The Employer may secure new employees from any source whatsoever. During the first sixty (60) days of employment, a new employee shall be on a trial basis and may be discharged at the discretion of the Employer.
Section 3,06 The Employer agrees to notify the Union in writing within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of employment of the name and address of each new employee, his social security number, position for which he will be employed, date of employment and starting rate of pay. The Employer agrees to apply to such new employees the wage scale, hours and other conditions of employment set forth in this Agreement.

The Employer agrees to notify the appropriate Union Representative the date, time and location of the Orientation Program within a reasonable time frame.
Within the Orientation Program, the store management or a designee shall explain to the new employees the right to join the Union and shall introduce the store steward and/or Union Representative and allow a reasonable uninterrupted amount of time, (to be mutually agreed upon), to explain the labor agreement, to answer questions and to sign up the new employee for Union membership. Such time shall not be an undue burden on the Employer.
Nothing in this Article is intended to preclude the application of Article 15.
ARTICLE 4.	CLERKS WORK
Section 4,01 To prevent the erosion of bargaining unit work, driver salesmen, book salesmen, or sales representatives shall not perform work or services in the Employer's retail establishments in excess of the prevailing practice in the industry in the areas covered by this Agreement at the time of this Agreement as follows:
It is agreed that the prevailing practice of work performed by driver salesman, book salesmen, or sales representatives in the area covered by this Agreement can further be explained as follows:
1.	Many outside sales personnel (as outlined above) perform the service of checking their merchandise, removing their outdated products from sale for credit, making out orders based on shelf inventory, etc., and this practice should not be construed to be a violation of the Agreement.
2.	It is further understood that the practice of outside sales personnel working in preparation of and assistance during new store openings, remodels or resets is a valuable contribution to the future success of a particular store and should not be construed to be a violation of the Agreement.
3.	In addition to the above, the established practice of stocking by certain vendors shall not be a violation of the Agreement. Those products in Conventional Stores are as follows: beverages, ice, bakery products (cookies, bread, cakes, etc.), snacks, chips, etc., dairy products, ice cream, tobacco and tobacco products, magazines, books, greeting cards, etc., party supplies, candles, etc., records, hosiery, baby food, specialty and ethnic foods, spices, dressings, floor care rental and supplies, brooms, mops, etc., candy, nuts, gum, pasta products, rack jobber (sewing notions, toys, pet supplies, window shades, food care products, garden supplies, shoes, soft goods, patterns, hardware, cosmetics), fire wood, produce

Section 4,04 Pharmacists and Pharmacist Interns shall not be permitted to perform work in the stores outside the area of the pharmacy, which is normally performed by employees in the Clerk Bargaining Union.
This would not in any way preclude pharmacists from conducting themselves in a professional manner to service a patients needs.
ARTICLE 5.	TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE
The parties recognize that automated equipment and technology is now available for the retail food industry. The Employer recognizes that there is a desire to protect and preserve work opportunities. At the same time, the Union recognizes that the Employer has the right to avail itself of modem technology. With this common objective, the parties agree as follows:
In the event the Employer introduces major technological change, which would have a direct material impact affecting bargaining unit work, sixty (60) days advance notice of such change will be given to the Union. In addition, the parties agree:
1.	The Employer has the right to install such equipment.
2.	Any training or necessary retraining will be furnished expense free by the Employer to affected employees.
3.	Where employees would be displaced by such installation, the Employer will make every effort to affect a transfer.
4.	If an employee is not retrained or transferred and would be displaced as a direct result of major technological change, as defined above, then the employee would qualify for separation pay if:
a.	The employee had two (2) or more year’s continuous service.
b.	Does not refuse a transfer within a twenty-five (25) mile radius.

4
a [or working America

Section 6,01 The Employer shall not discriminate against an employee for upholding Union principles, serving on a committee of the Union or any organization affiliated therewith.
Section 6,02 An employee may be discharged for proper cause and the Employer shall give notice in writing of such discharge to the Union. The Employer shall not discharge any employee without proper cause and shall give at least one (1) written warning notice of the specific complaint or complaints against such employee to the employee and to the Union, except that no warning notice need be given to an employee before discharge, if the cause of such discharge is dishonesty, drunkenness, falsification of application for employment (discharge for falsification of application for employment must be within sixty (60) days from date of hire), recklessness resulting in a serious accident while on duty, or refusal of any employee to accept a job assignment, possession of or use of an illegal controlled substance (such as marijuana, heroin, etc.) on Company premises, or a felony conviction of possession or use of an illegal controlled substance (such as marijuana, heroin, etc.), refusing to take a blood alcohol test or drug test where circumstances indicate an employee is under such influence, instigating a fight, assaults, sexual harassment, intentionally selling alcohol to a minor, maintaining or possession of any firearm on Company premises; an employee who fails to notify store management of his absence and reasons therefore within the first two (2) consecutive scheduled workdays of such absence; in the application of his understanding and agreement, it is understood that the employee will not be required to call in every two (2) consecutive scheduled workdays, after the required initial notification has been given. Such employee will be subject to discharge without a prior warning notice; or is covered by reasonable work rules agreed in writing between the Employer and the President of the Union, provided the Employer gives the Union President at least thirty (30) calendar days advance written notice of any proposed new work rules governing employee conduct for which a written notice will not be required before discharge. In the event that the Employer and the Union President cannot reach agreement upon the reasonableness of such proposed work rule(s) within the aforementioned time period, either party may refer that issue to the dispute procedure for final determination. Such a disputed proposed new work rule(s) shall not be implemented until such has been approved by an arbitrator.
Two (2) documented no call no shows within a 6 month period will be cause for discharge. Each no call no show will be documented by a written warning letter.
5
a [or working America
Labor Agreement
Section 6,03 Warning notices shall be void after six (6) months from date of issue.
Section 6,04 The Union may thereupon file a written complaint with the Employer within seven (7) days after the Union receives notice of such discharge. Said complaint must be taken up within fourteen (14) days from the date it is filed with the Employer, by the Union's representative and the Employer's designated representative, and it may be referred to the Board of Arbitration in the event the Union and the Employer's designated representative fail to reach an agreement. Should the Board determine that it was an improper discharge; the Employer shall reinstate the employee in accordance with the findings of the Board of Arbitration.
Section 6,05 Upon receipt by the Union from the Employer of a warning notice or Corrective Action Record, an employee who feels that such charge was unfair or unwarranted, shall have fifteen (15) days from receipt by the Union of such notice to file a grievance concerning the Employer's action.
Section 6,06 Cash Control
The Employer shall have the right to maintain and publish rules and regulations governing the operation of the cash register.

22
a [or working America
Labor Agreement
Eligibility
The Administrator will, on an annual basis, obtain all data necessary to enroll or re-enroll employees and their dependents as participants eligible for coverage under the Plan. To remain enrolled as a participant eligible for plan coverage, each employee who is currently enrolled, or who initially enrolls during the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, must re-enroll prior to the start of each succeeding plan year. Employees must make a positive election to enroll in the Plan. Enrollment is for the entire plan of benefits (except that Life Insurance and AD & D shall be provided to all eligible employees) for the Plan and an employee’s failure to make a positive enrollment into the Plan shall result in such employee being ineligible for all benefits of the Plan for the remainder of the calendar year or until there has been a qualifying life event, as defined by the Trustees, whichever occurs first.
The Employer may, upon reasonable notice and at its own expense, audit the Fund’s enrollment data and claims records once each plan year. The Employer may arrange to have the audit conducted by a recognized auditing firm that it shall select.
Independent of the foregoing audits, the Fund will audit its enrollment and claims records at least once each plan year to ensure that no employees of the Employer, or the dependents of such employees, are participating in plan coverage for which they are not eligible.
Full-time employees shall be eligible to enroll in Plan B, employee only, benefits on the first day after their 6th month of consecutive employment. Full-time employees shall be eligible to enroll in Plan A benefits on the first day after their 12th month of consecutive employment.
Part-time employees shall be eligible to enroll in Plan B, on the first day after their 9th month of consecutive employment and part-time employees hired prior to ratification (9/30/10) may become eligible for Plan A on the first day after their 24th month of consecutive employment.
Part-time employees hired after ratification (9/30/10) will only be eligible for Plan B and cannot migrate to Plan A, unless they become a full-time employee.
Employees shall continue to be eligible for benefits provided they enroll for coverage in accordance with this Article and provided they continue to average 60 hours per month for Plan B coverage (80 hours for new hires after ratification (9/30/10)) or 120 hours per month for Plan A coverage, in each month to maintain eligibility for benefits. All employees must continue to meet all eligibility requirements of the Plan as a condition of continued eligibility.
The Trustees shall establish a separate accounting of income and expenses for the “Funding group” of the Fund who agree in their Collective Bargaining Agreements to the same provisions as provided herein, unless otherwise approved by the Trustees. Only those Employers who adopt these provisions may share in the pool of income and expenses established herein. The Trustees are expressively prohibited from using the contributions of these Employers for the payment of benefits to the employees of other Employers.

Labor Agreement
Section 17.02 Funding Policy
This Funding Policy shall become activated and of full force and effect on October 1, 2010. The contributions provided for herein are with the parties’ understanding and agreement that the Trustees to the South Central Health & Welfare Fund will maintain the Plan in a fully funded and reserved status and will provide benefits in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
There are two purposes of this Funding Policy:
(A)	Fully reserved status of the South Central Health and Welfare Fund.
(B)	Claims Payment Standards of the South Central Fund.
A.	Fully Reserved Status
It is agreed that the target for fully reserved status shall be defined as reserves equal to projected incurred but not reported claims (IBNR) as determined by the Consultant through Fund Claims lag report plus a minimum of two (2.0) months of health and welfare expenses. In October of each year, the Fund Consultant will give a projection for the coming plan year as well as a projection of the remaining term of the Agreement.
The Consultant will provide the current status of the reserves at each quarterly meeting as well as a projection through the end of the current plan year.
It is understood and agreed that any projection showing reserves below IBNR plus two (2) months will cause the financial condition to be monitored closely by the Trustees and the Professionals of the plan. Beginning January 1, 2012, a projection showing reserves below IBNR plus one and a half (1.5) months for two consecutive quarters will cause action to be taken by the Trustees to bring the level of reserves back to the desired level of IBNR plus one and a half (1.5) months. Actions may include the increase in Employer contributions as outlined in this article and if needed any modifications as deemed appropriate by the Trustees. If the rate is not sufficient, this will cause action to be taken by the Trustees to bring the level of reserves back to a level sufficient to pay claims for the remainder of the Agreement.
B.	Claims Payment Standard
The Plan Administrator is responsible for payment of claims on a timely basis. Payment schedules should comply with any vendor contractual obligations in order to maintain the appropriate discounts provided by the vendor.
The Plan Administrator will make reports to the Trustees on compliances with these standards. Trustees are responsible for monitoring compliance of these standards and taking corrective action, as appropriate.
24
a [or working America
Labor Agreement
If the Trustees do not agree on actions to bring the claims payments to contractual levels, the bargaining parties shall have 30 days to agree upon a resolution. If they cannot do so, the issue shall be resolved by expedited arbitration.
Section 17,03 Cost Control Measures
The Trustees are directed to search for and adopt cost control measures that will aid the Fund in managing costs within the contributions provided by the Employer and employees herein. The parties agree to develop a Medical Management program that targets high-risk participants with chronic diseases such as diabetes, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Incentives to drive participation in the program are understood to be a key element to enhance quality health care.
There is recognition that incentives may take various forms and will likely evolve and change over time base on program experience with a goal of maximizing program effectiveness. The initial focus will be a thorough educational campaign in connection with program roll out. Such education will be reinforced by the Plan, the Union, and the Employer.
Section 17.04 National Health Care Reform
The Employer and the Union agree to meet and discuss, at the request of either party, the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and Federal regulations or any other legislation on this Health and Welfare article and to make modifications as necessary.
Section 17.05 Texas Occupational Injury and Disease Benefit Plan
The parties agree to meet once per quarter to continue discussions brought forth in bargaining regarding the Kroger Texas Occupational Injury and Disease Benefit Plan. Prior to any updating of the Plan, the Employer will give the Union the opportunity to submit recommendations for consideration.
The meetings will be co-chaired by the Manager of Operations for the Southwest Division and the President of UFCW Local 455 and/or his designate. It is understood that the parties may include other representatives as deemed necessary.
Section 17.6
Contribution to the trust fund shall be continued under the following conditions effective 1-1-08 for participants of Plan A: In the case of a compensable injury while on an approved leave of absence, six (6) months contributions for full time (three (3) months contributions for part time) following the month in which the compensable injury occurs.

An employee may be upgraded on a temporary basis to a higher classification only in emergency situations (such as absence of another employee due to sickness, etc. when no other arrangements can be provided), and the employee will be paid the rate for that particular classification.

In the event an employee is assigned as a Nature Market, then such employee shall be paid thirty-five (.35) above their current wage rate provided total store sales are at the Volume 2 or 3 level. This premium will become available the second Sunday following ratification (9/30/10).
R.	Marketplace: The Employer will continue to notify the union in each instance of classifying a store with the “Marketplace” designation.
The Home Hard Line Manager will be paid the Department Head rate established on the Schedule A wage page of this CBA, identical to other traditional store department heads. The Home Hard Line Manager Department Head position will not replace the Drug GM Department Head position.
A “Home Hard Line Manager” will be a department head to the following sub-departments:
•	Furniture
•	Home Decor
•	Expanded Toys
•	Expanded Kitchen Place
•	Baby World
Where the Employer deems it necessary, each of the sub-departments (furniture, home decor, expanded toys, and expanded kitchen) will have a lead position. These sub-departments lead positions will receive thirty-five cents (.35) per hour over the Employer’s current rate upon satisfactory completion of training and upon certification. Each individual will be trained at the Company’s expense and on the Company’s time table. After the training, each will be tested both on knowledge and work environment application. Each successful candidate will then be certified in the position and shall begin receiving the premium referenced herein. The Employer reserves the right to remove any employee from the lead positions for performance related reasons including the failure to maintain “best practices” measurements for the average group performance in the Division.

Labor Agreement
In addition to the sub-department leads, where the Employer deems it necessary a Marketplace store can appoint an additional “Scan Coordinator” who would also receive the additional “lead” premiums described above.
The Company retains its right to create the Home Fashion Manager designation, Marketplace Front End classification and Marketplace Specialty Clerk classification. The Company will assign to each Marketplace location a Home Hard Line Manager.
The parties agree to meet and negotiate rates for any new classification for any Market Place stores. If the parties cannot agree, it will be submitted to expedited arbitration.

Labor Agreement
1.	GENERAL CLERKS
There shall not be any limitation or restriction on either the nature or the amount of bargaining unit work that may be performed by employees that are employed in the "General Clerk" classification of employment except that such employees shall not be assigned the duties and responsibilities of a department head.
Employees that are employed in the "General Clerk" classification will neither be scheduled nor employed more than thirty-two (32) hours in a workweek except in the case of emergencies beyond the Employer's control, including but not limited to employee absences, temporary increases in business, etc., in which a store does not have sufficient qualified employees available to perform the work.
2.	OVER-RATIO
Effective January 4, 1987, the Employer will implement the hours’ ratio in Article 7, Seniority. No employee will be promoted to full-time until all stores have achieved a proper ratio and the Employer shall have the right to transfer employees by seniority to achieve ratio balance. Any employee who chooses not to transfer a reasonable distance to maintain a forty (40) hour schedule or refuses a fulltime job, such employee will be reclassified to the proper rate of pay (General Clerk, Prepared Food Clerk, Non-Food Clerk) with the next immediate schedule.
Over-ratio employees will retain their average of hours (which may fluctuate over a four (4) week period), which they worked during the calendar year 1986, unless such employee is replacing an employee on a leave of absence. Such assurance shall not apply if such employees are displaced due to store closings, fire, flood, loss of sales due to the opening of a major competitor, etc., beyond the control of the Employer.
Hours added to the store because of increased sales, resignation of another employee, etc., will be assigned to the General Clerk classification at the discretion of management until the ratio of hours has been achieved.

Mr. William H. Hopkins
President
UFCW Local #455
121 Northpoint Dr.
Houston, TX 77060
Dear Mr. Hopkins,
The following Agreements should be attached to and become part of the Agreement between Local No. 455, United Food and Commercial Workers and The Kroger Company, Houston, TX, effective April 4, 2010 through April 6, 2013.
Non-Food Work
This Agreement will confirm discussions which took place during our 1981 contract negotiations regarding the identification of Non-Food work in our stores. The concern of the Union at the time stemmed around an arbitration case between a Denver Company and the Denver Local of the UFCW which took place as a result of that company making wholesale transfers of items to their Non-Food departments.
As stated in those negotiations, it is not the intention of The Kroger Company to take the position of the Denver Company. We do not plan to declare everything non-edible as non-food for the purpose of classifying work. At the same time, as we have discussed, merchandising decisions from time to time dictate the greatest sales potential can be achieved on a particular product by changing location and merchandising responsibility from food to non-food or vice-versa. Therefore, we must maintain flexibility for some movement to achieve what is best for the Company, our employees, and members of the bargaining unit, that of maximizing sales achievement. Nothing contained in either the above agreement or this letter shall be construed or interpreted as limiting or impairing such flexibility.
I hope the above clarifications of intent will settle any concerns you may have.
San Antonio Jurisdiction
This Agreement will confirm the intent of the parties regarding the San Antonio Contract as it relates to the jurisdiction.
The intent of the parties is:
1.	The parties agree that Local #455 will retain jurisdiction coverage of the San Antonio Contract.
42
a [or working America
Labor Agreement
2.	Company and Union agree to bargain a new contract if a new store is opened in one of the jurisdiction counties.
Nacogdoches and Angelina Coverage
This Agreement will confirm the intent of the parties regarding coverage of Nacogdoches and Angelina Counties by UFCW Local #455, Houston, TX.
The intent of the parties is:
1.	The Employers present location, Store #990 & Store #566, Nacogdoches, TX, will continue to be covered by the Agreement between the parties known as the Houston Clerk Agreement.
2.	Future stores of the Employer in the above named counties would be covered by the Agreement between the parties known as the Out-state Clerk Agreement.
Electronic Dues
This agreement will confirm our discussion which took place during our 1993 Contract negotiations regarding Section 3.01 and Section 3.02.
The parties agreed that a computer program would be developed and implemented within ninety (90) days from the date of ratification. The new program would electronically make deductions in accordance with the above stated sections of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Preferred Schedules
The following agreement should be added as a further explanation of Section 7.03 (a):
The Company agrees to give a limited number of the most senior employees (employees with greater than 10 years service) reasonable preference of the choice of schedules, consistent with the needs of the business, thus allowing the most senior employee to work preferred shifts.
Sincerely,
Paul Glenn
Human Resources Manager

Letter of Agreement Between Kroger Texas L.P. And UFCW Local 455
During the course of negotiations the parties discussed a number of issues that involve the treatment of employees. After thorough discussions the parties agree to the following principles:
All employees in the Division deserve to be treated with professionalism, courtesy and respect.
The policies of the Company and the Division should be administered and applied uniformly and consistently.
Counseling and constructive advice for employees should be administered in the appropriate setting with professionalism, courtesy, respect and with union representation where applicable.
When employees have personal situations that are true emergencies, those situations should be handled with sensitivity.
In the event of store temperatures dropping to abnormally cold levels, employee needs will be considered. Employees in those situations may request and be allowed to wear warm clothing that is in keeping with the professional and neat appearance desired for our customers.
