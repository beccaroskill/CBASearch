5.	I f the third medical opinion deems the employee capable of regu-lar full-time employment or returning to the original job, the Company's backpay liability will be limited solely to basic wages actually lost, if any, from the date of the employee's appeal, offset by any other compensation.
6.	If the third medical opinion leads to modification or removal of the permanent/long term medical restrictions, deeming the employee capable of regular full-time employment or return to the original job. the employee, if off the active payroll, will be conditionally brought back on the active payroll with full wage credit at the employee's pre-restriction job title for a trial period of up to ten (10) weeks.

If at the end of such conditional period the Company determines, after consultation with the Union, that the employee has demonstrated both the employee as reliable (i.e., no chargeable tardiness or absence) and job performance is satisfactory. the employee will be unconditionally returned to the active payroll with full service credit or, if on the active payroll, will retain his or her pre-restriction job title.
7.	The Parties agree that if the employee fails the up to ten (10) week trial period as set forth in paragraph 6 above, the employee will resume the status he or she held prior to the rendering of the third medical opinion.

The physician selected shall be requested to agree or disagree with the Company's Medical Department opinion that the employee is incapable of returning to full-time active employment. The Company will bear the medical expenses for obtaining the third opinion.
11.	Results of the third medical opinion shall be binding on the employee, Company and Union if, after conducting a complete medical evaluation and examination of the employee, the third physician recommends that the employee is not work capable and is unable to return to full-time active employment with the Company.
12.	If the third medical opinion determines that the employee is work capable and therefore able to return to full-time active employment, the employee will be conditionally brought back on the active payroll with full wage credit at the employee's current job title for.a trial period of up to ten (10) weeks. If at the end of such conditional period the Company determines, after consultation with the Union, that the employee had demonstrated both the
147
Appendix A
employee's attendance as reliable (i.e., no chargeable tardiness or absence) and job performance as satisfactory, the employee will be unconditionally returned to the active payroll.
13.	The Parties agree that if the employee fails the up to ten (10) week trial period as set forth in paragraph 12 above, the employee will resume the status he or she held prior to the rendering of the third medical opinion.
