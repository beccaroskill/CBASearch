Section F.	Non-Bargaining Unit Employees
1.	The Employer agrees that salaried and other nonbargaining unit employees shall not perform work regularly assigned to Bargaining Unit employees, except in cases of emergency, job instruction, developmental work, or to alleviate production difficulties. This Section is not to be used to circumvent the integrity of the Bargaining Unit classifications or the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
-4-
2.	The Parties recognize that the company is engaged in a highly competitive, dynamic business, which necessitates
arrangements for the use of contract employees on a temporary basis to perform bargaining unit work. The company will not enter into such arrangements for the sole purpose of reducing the size of the bargaining unit, and shares with the Union a common long-term interest in providing job stability for the workforce to the extent reasonably practicable.
a.	The company will not lay off any Bargaining Unit employees as result of contract employees used to perform Bargaining Unit work. In the event of a layoff, all contract employees will be removed from the affected areas prior to the affected bargaining unit employee's notice of layoff.
b.	The Company will provide the Union by the 15th of each month a report of the occupations where contract employees are performing Bargaining Unit work, along with the names of the contract employees utilized in each department.
c.	No individual contract employee or series of contract employees, will be retained to perform Bargaining Unit work in a classification for longer than 90 calendar days in any facility covered by this agreement within the preceding 12 month period.

e.	The company will not use contract employees to perform duties normally performed by Bargaining Unit job classifications that have been affected by a layoff, without first offering recall to the laid off employees. Laid off employees who are offered recall for temporary work assignments of 90 calendar days or less may decline the offer without losing their recall rights. If a junior laid off employee subsequently accepts the assignment, and the assignment eventually exceeds 90 calendar days, the junior employee may be retained without the requirement to re-offer the assignment to any more senior employee who has previously declined recall to it.
-5-
f.	Overtime will not be offered to contract employees unless all Bargaining Unit employees in the appropriate classifications have been offered the overtime.
g.	Should the list of contract employees referenced in paragraph F2B not be provided to the Union as prescribed, the Union will so notify the company in writing and if the report is not provided within 48 hours the	Company shall, after a 2 month
implementation grace period, forfeit the right to add any additional contract employees for the next twelve month period in any facility covered by this agreement.
Section G.	Smoking Privileges
1.	The Employer shall establish regulations governing smoking privileges throughout the Plant. These regulations will be clearly communicated to all employees.
Section H.	Tools and Equipment
1.	When tools and equipment are issued and signed for by employees, they will be held responsible for their return.
Section I.	Government Controls
1.	All of the wages and benefits provided for in this Agreement shall be effective only to the extent they may be lawfully paid and are reasonably consistent with the standards and goals of the Economic Stabilization Program or similar governmental required programs and the regulations issued thereunder. Should any provisions of this Agreement not be placed into effect because of government wage regulations or controls, and should such controls be subsequently amended, relaxed or terminated during the term of this Agreement, then and in that event such provision (s) as has not been placed into effect because of said regulations or controls will be effectuated on the date on which it is determined that it is legally possible to do so, provided that the legality of such action is established during the term of this Agreement. The Employer and the Union agree to cooperate in the preparation and filing of any submission(s) which during the term of this Agreement are required by any agency responsible for the administration of government wage controls.

4.	Employees shall receive overtime premiums for work performed on the Saturday (1st day) and Sunday (2nd day) of the workweek, as provided for herein.
a.	If an employee works on the Saturday or Sunday of the workweek, but does not accumulate forty (40) straight time hours paid during the following regular workdays of Monday through Friday, the employee shall be paid straight time for additional hours worked on Saturday or Sunday until forty (40) straight time hours are accumulated and shall	be paid time and
one-half for	additional hours on	Saturday	and

Those graveyard shift employees beginning their workday starting the night of the Holiday, however, shal1 not be paid such Holiday premium pay.
7.	Two (2) overtime and/or premium rates shall not be paid for the same hours of work; i.e., there shall be no pyramiding or duplication of such rates.
Section F.	Apportionment of Overtime
1.	It is the Employer' s intention to give as much advance notice as possible when overtime is necessary. It is recognized that occasionally employees may not desire to work a particular assignment. Therefore, when overtime assignments are made, employees who do not desire to work such overtime shall make their reasons known to supervision.	If such reasons	are acceptable	to
supervision, in view of production requirements and other circumstances involved, such employees will be excused from the overtime assignment and will not be subject to discipline for declining the overtime, but will be credited on the overtime records for the time not worked. Additionally, if the affected employee is not given notice of an overtime assignment by the end of his/her shift on Thursday for a weekend overtime assignment, or the start of his/her lunch period for a weekday overtime assignment or 72 hours for a holiday assignment, and the employee is unable to work the overtime as a result, he/she will also be excused from the overtime assignment. Such employees will not be subject to discipline for declining the overtime, but will be credited on the overtime records for the time not worked up to a maximum of 4 0 hours per employee in a six (6) month overtime review interval.
2.	It is agreed that over a period of time the employer will apportion overtime equitably and fairly by job classification in the type of work requiring overtime. The overtime will be apportioned among the full-time active employees in such Job Classification, within the Section of the Department, and on the Shift, where the overtime is necessary; provided the employee is capable of performing such overtime work efficiently. Overtime records will subsequently be reviewed on the first Friday in May and first Friday in November of each year. When the number of hours charged* to the employee with the highest total overtime hours in the overtime group on the first Friday in May or first Friday in November exceeds that of another employee in his/her overtime group by more than seventy-five (75) hours, the employee(s) who has/have been charged with less overtime will be paid the number of hours in excess of seventy-five (75). An employee who is paid for overtime hours under this provision will then be charged with the number of hours paid.
* Charged Hours:	O/T equals 1.5
D/T equals 2.0
-10-
3.	Uniform overtime records will be maintained in accordance with the above paragraph in a manner determined by the respective overtime center. The overtime records will be posted in the overtime center and updated weekly. The Department Steward and the Supervisor will meet once a month to review overtime records in each overtime center.
4.	In connection with the apportionment of overtime, as agreed to above, employees who are hired, rehired, or recalled from layoff will be credited on the overtime records with the maximum number of hours credited to the employees in the work group to which they are assigned. Employees who are transferred from one work group to another will be credited on the overtime records with the average* number of hours credited to the employees in the work group to which they are assigned.
Employees who are absent from work for any reason for a period of time not exceeding two (2) calendar months will be charged for any overtime which they would have been offered had they not been absent. When an employee who is absent for more than two (2) calendar months returns to work, he/she will be charged with the average* number of overtime hours charged in his/her overtime group during the period of absence in excess of two (2) calendar months.
Employees returning from loan will be charged with their OT hours in effect at the time of loan, plus all additional hours charged to them while on loan. However, such hours will not be more than 50 hours less than the lowest OT hours, nor more than the 50 hours greater than the highest OT hours in the respective OT group to which they return. However, no employee will be returned with fewer hours than they had accumulated at the time they were originally loaned out. If such an employee, upon return to his/her overtime center, accumulated seventy-five (75) or more hours while on loan than the low person in his/her center, the Company will not be obligated for any apportionment payout provided such employee does not work any overtime that is not first offered to other employees in the employee's overtime center while he/she continues to have an apportionment imbalance of seventy-five (75) hours or more.
* Average: All charged overtime hours divided by the number of employees in the overtime center.
5.	Employees required to work mandatory weekend overtime on three (3) consecutive weekends shall not be required to work the fourth (4th) weekend, except in cases of National emergency.
6.	Employees will not be required to work mandatory overtime on the weekend, preceding or following a vacation of at least one (1) week, except in cases of National emergency.
7.	In the assignment of overtime during the normal workweek, an employee required to start work earlier than his or her normal starting time during his or her regular workweek, will be scheduled to work to the completion of his or her normal work shift.
8.	Employee classified as working leaders shall not be placed in separate overtime centers.

One (1) at straight time, one (1) at time and one-half, and one (1) at no pay. Payment at time and one-half will begin only after eight (8) hours of work at straight time in each such workday.
The cycle of eight (8) hour pay periods or parts thereof shall begin at the time the employees actually commence the sleeper-cab run, shall continue and repeat itself during the entire time of the run, and shall end at the time the employees are relieved from work duties after completion of the run. Fractions of hours will be included in the computation to the nearest tenth (10th) of an hour.
For the work performed on Saturday or Sunday, the eight (8) hour pay periods will be applied on the basis of two (2) pay periods of time and one-half and one (1) period at no pay.
8.	Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph seven (7) above, in the event a delay or layover occurs and an employee is relieved from duty he shall be on his own time without pay.

Dear Mr. Dodd:
This will confirm our understanding regarding travel on Company business and Domestic Field Assignments.
1.Employees driving their car to temporary work locations before or after their scheduled work shift will be compensated as follows:
FORMULA FOR COMPUTING COMPENSABLE TRAVEL PAY (Not requiring overnight absence}
Compensable mileage is the mileage from employee's home to temporary assignment less: a) mileage from employee1s home to normal work station (double for round trip) and b) 15 miles (30 miles for round trip).
TABLE FOR TRAVEL TIME ALLOWANCE FOR DRIVING COMPENSABLE EXCESS MILEAGE
Compensable		Compensable	
Mileage Increments	Travel Time Allowance	Mileage	I Increments	’ravel Time Allowance
1-3 miles	tenth of an hour	31-33 miles	1.1 hours
4-6 miles	2 tenths of an hour	34-36 miles	1.2 hours
7-9 miles	3 tenths of an hour	37-39 miles	1.3 hours
10-12 miles	4 tenths of an hour	40-42 miles	1.4 hours
13-15 miles	5 tenths of an hour	43-45 miles	1.5 hours
16-18 miles	6 tenths of an hour	46-48 miles	1.6 hours
19-21 miles	7 tenths of an hour	49-51 miles	1.7 hours
22-24 miles	8 tenths of an hour	52-54 miles	1,8 hours
25-27 miles	9 tenths of an hour	55-57 miles	1.9 hours
28-30 miles	1.0 hour	58-60 miles	2.0 hours
-87-
Supplemental Agreement #3
K. G. Dodd May 23, 2005 Page 2
If the compensable excess mileage is more than 60 miles round trip, the travel time allowance is to be determined on the basis of one tenth of an hour for each increment of three miles or portion thereof for the entire compensable distance.
The above applies only to time spent driving before or after the scheduled work shift, and is not used if travel takes place during the employee's work shift for which he receives his regular pay rate.
NOTE:	The normal Automobile Allowance, as defined in
Article XV, is paid in addition to'compensable travel pay and is computed on the basis of total mileage traveled less the normal distance traveled between the employee's home and his regular work location.
Examples of how the above formula would be applied are as follows:
Example No. 1
A.	Employee is assigned to temporary assignment which is 30 miles from his home. Employee normally travels 5 miles from home to regular work station.
30 miles less 5 miles = 25 miles
-15 miles
10 miles
B.	10 miles of compensable time (See Table) provides .4 of an hour.
C.	Assuming the employee works an 8 hour shift at the temporary site, he would be compensated .4 of an hour at time and one-half his pay rate (.8 of an hour for round trip).

Supplemental Agreement: #3

Example No■ 2
A.	Employee is assigned to temporary assignment which is 45 miles from his home. Employee normally travels 5 miles from home to regular work station.
45 miles less 5 miles = 40 miles
-15 miles
25 miles
B.	25 miles of compensable time (See Table) provides .9 of
an hour.
C.	Assuming the employee works 12 consecutive hours at the temporary site, he would be compensated .9 of an hour at double his pay rate (1.8 hours for round trip).
2.	Employees required to travel to a temporary work location on a common carrier will be compensated for hours of work and travel time to and from the temporary work assignment in accordance with the rulings of the Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Administrator. If premium pay is required under such rulings, then the provisions of Article III, Section E shall be followed. Whenever practicable, the travel schedule will be arranged so as to coincide with the employee's normal hours of work.
3.	Employees temporarily (more than 90 calendar days) assigned to a new duty station which is a) within the forty-eight (48) contiguous United States which is not designated a Company facility (Attachment A) ; and b) is fifty (50) or more miles from the employee's home and is at least twenty-five (25) miles further from home than the present duty station may be eligible to receive a Domestic Field Allowance while on such assignment in accordance with the following schedule:

Dear Mr. Dodd:
This Supplemental Agreement will confirm our mutual understanding with respect to participation by members of E.A.S.T., Local 1553 in the Raytheon Severance Pay Plan.
During the course of 2001 contract negotiations, the parties have agreed that, for the duration of this collective bargaining agreement, employees who are represented by E.A.S.T., Local 1553 will continue to participate in the Raytheon Severance Pay Plan as outlined in General Policy and Procedure No. 33-0003-110.
The Raytheon Severance Pay Plan contemplates that the affected employee be "permanently terminated" in order to be eligible for benefits under the plan.
Under the collective bargaining agreement between the parties, E.A.S.T. represented employees are contractually entitled to "recall" under Article XVIII and therefore, under normal layoff circumstances, are not necessary "permanently terminated" at time of layoff.
Participation in the Raytheon Severance Pay Plan by employees who are represented by E.A.S.T., Local 1553 will be on the same basis and under the same terms and conditions as that of Exempt and Non-exempt employees who participate in the program with the following understanding regarding employees who are not "permanently terminated", as contemplated and defined in the Raytheon Severance Pay Plan, but who are laid off with "recall" to employment with the Company under Article XVIII of the collective bargaining agreement.
Those Local 1553 represented employees who are laid off, and then "recalled" prior to, or after having exhausted, the full amount of severance pay they would be entitled to under the plan, will, in the event of a subsequent layoff, have available to them the balance of their full amount of severance pay, according to the plan design, less the number of weeks of severance pay already paid under the plan, while they awaited recall. Laid off employees who become reemployed by the Company, not through recall but through rehiring, will be treated as if they were "permanently terminated" and then rehired, in accordance with the plan.

This function is responsible for ascertaining that production contract items from vendors located within a fifty (50) mile radius of the facility meet the physical and dimensional requirements called out by the appropriate documentation. The tasks are final visual or mechanical measurement or non-subjective specification verification of end items.
This Agreement recognizes the Company's practice of inter-Group cross-utilization of Source personnel.
This in no way alters the Company's good faith understanding between the parties that Source Surveillance Engineers may occasionally perform a limited or incidental amount of inspection work during the course of their regular duties.

Dear Mr. Dodd;
This letter will confirm the parties' understanding concerning a drug-free workplace policy.
The Department of Defense has issued emergency regulations mandating a drug-free workplace including the requirement that the Company certify that its operations are drug-free. Accordingly, effective April 1, 1969, a drug-free workplace policy was implemented including testing based on reasonable suspicion applicable to all Company employees. In addition, the Department of Transportation requires employers to conduct drug and alcohol testing on covered employees in accordance with the Department of Transportation regulations. Employees are also subject to testing when recalled to work from layoff provided such employees have been on layoff for a minimum period of twelve (12) months. Further, employees on the recall list, who are offered a non-bargaining unit position, are subject to preemployment testing. If an employee tests positive either at the time of recall or rehire, he or she will not be eligible for recall for a twelve (12) month period after which time the employee will be recalled and retested when the first available opening occurs. Testing will be conducted in accordance with the elements outlined in Company Practice 3-0-17. Failure on the part of an employee to cooperate in the program can involve discipline up to termination of employment. Failure of the Company to follow the direction of the government (our customer) can result in the loss of contracts, suspension of progress payments and other penalties.
The Company and the Union are committed to providing a safe workplace and to promoting employee health. Consistent with this commitment, a drug-free workplace policy with a view to maintaining a work environment that is free of the harmful effects of drug use or alcohol abuse will be implemented.

Employees who use illegal drugs or who abuse legal drugs or alcohol, create serious safety and health risks for all employees, and tend to be less productive, prone to greater absenteeism, accidents, health insurance costs and quality control problems and present security risks. This Supplemental Agreement embodies the parties’ intention to cooperate in combating alcohol and drug abuse ("substance abuse") among employees.
The Company currently offers a non-punitive Employee Counseling Program which offers assistance to employees with substance abuse problems. If possible, both the Company and Union representatives will encourage participation to those needing assistance in order to strive for a drug-free workplace and to assist those dealing with addiction. However, the Program cannot protect those employees who have refused assistance or failed to cooperate in the Program or whose work or disciplinary record does not support a referral to the Program.
Where appropriate, the parties agree to emphasize rehabilitation, not punishment, as the first course in dealing with employees who have drug problems. Although the Company retains the right to discipline or discharge an employee for his/her first violation of the Company's Drug Free Workplace Program, discharge would normally not be in order unless the employee was already at a later stage of the disciplinary procedure or the initial incident relative to the disclosure of the drug problem was related to a dischargeable offense or the employee had previously participated in a rehabilitation program. Also, if the employee rejects an offer of rehabilitation, or if federal/state regulations preclude the retention of the employee in a covered position, the Company would be under no obligation to retain such employee.
If a Union member is to be questioned about substance abuse, the member, upon request, will have the assistance of a Union representative.
The program will be in compliance with applicable Federal and State laws and regulations.

Dear Mr. Dodd:
This letter shall confirm our mutual understanding on the issue of the separation of work in the California Engineering development laboratories defined as "Engineering" work and that work which shall be performed by E.A.S.T. bargaining unit classifications. It is the intent of the Parties, the Company, and the Union to make a collaborative effort to define the duties of the bargaining vs. non-bargaining work and to assign that work appropriately. That effort will require an attitude and atmosphere of trust, communication, and cooperation between the Parties in order to minimize future disagreements as to the appropriate assignment of work.
In an attempt to define the distinctions between the Bargaining vs. Non-bargaining technical support, the Parties agree that the following guidelines shall be established to assist in that effort and ultimately in the appropriate assignment of work. The following examples can be defined (but not limited to) engineering work:
a. Design, design validation and design of experiment b. Design of prime hardware and test procedures c. Analysis of designs
d.	Breadboard and breadboard validation
e.	Generation of test procedures, plans and schematics f. Test design and validation
g.	Software development
h.	First article robust design and product functionality i. Computer-Aided Design (CAD)
j.	Specialized or experimental component and materials analysis, reliability and qualification testing
k.	Troubleshooting of hardware where problems are beyond capability of non-engineering support
1.	Initial engineering assessment of non-standard field and factory returns
m.	Primary customer / supplier interface
n. Use of hands and automated tools / equipment to prove original designs

Within a structure that is more established, defined and detailed, bargaining unit personnel are expected to assist in all of the above with the direction and guidance of the engineer. In addition to assisting in the above, the primary responsibilities of the bargaining unit include:
A.	Testing where guidelines and standards have been established
B.	First order troubleshooting
C.	Fabrication and assembly of mechanical, optical and electrical designs
Methodology:
1)	As a basic criteria for distinguishing bargaining unit from non-bargaining unit work, the Company will identify salaried support engineers that appear to be spending the preponderance of their time doing A, B, or C above, within that defined structure
2)	Management will distribute these guidelines and train supervision on the above criteria and identify work and personnel that meet those criteria
3)	If the work is determined to be bargaining unit work, it will be appropriately assigned
4)	The parties agree that non-exempt technical support personnel will not perform bargaining unit work as described in this Memorandum of Understanding.
5)	All non-exempt technical support personnel as set forth in the attached appendix will be assigned to be a Bargaining Unit Job Classification. The necessary administrative tasks to convert the employees currently classified, as Engineering Support Specialists to bargaining unit status will be completed no later than December 31, 2001.
6)	The Company and the Union agree, where appropriate, to populate existing Product Development Technician classifications to accommodate personnel transferred to the bargaining unit as a result of this agreement. However, where such a fit does not exist, new classification(s) will need to be generated.
7)	All employees converted to Bargaining Unit classifications will be credited with Bargaining Unit Seniority equal to their individual benefit dates. The benefit date seniority will be used only in the classification entered as a result of this action. An employee who may later transfer to another job classification will be credited with seniority in accordance with the date they were transferred to the Bargaining Unit, pursuant to this agreement.

It is not the intent of the Company to use this Section to replace jobs on a full time basis with other classifications.
3.	The following are incorporated in each job classification description:
a.	Housekeeping and cleaning tasks in the work area as necessary for safety and cleanliness.
b.	Employees may assist fellow employees on a voluntary basis.
c.	involvement in	cont inuous	measurable improvement
activities such as, collection of data, development and display of metrics and process improvements associated with the employees normal job duties.
4.	Training for the purpose of obtaining certification in a higher labor grade shall not be the only basis for upgrade to the higher classification.
5.	The definition of integrity as used in this Classification Appendix includes the job duties as stated in each job description mutually agreed to in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
