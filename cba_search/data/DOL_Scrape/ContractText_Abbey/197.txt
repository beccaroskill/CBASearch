Disciplinary action will be taken when one of the following conditions occur:
absent 4 times in 3 months or less
absent 6 times in 6 months or less
absent 8 times in 9 months or less
absent 9 times in 12 months or less
When disciplinary action is taken, absences used for this discipline will not be counted towards future disciplinary action.

After verbal warning is given (Committeemen to be advised)
First Offense — written warning
Second Offense — second written warning
Third Offense — one week off
Fourth Offense — discharge (preceded by suspension pending final determination)

Article X SENIORITY
10.0	The following provisions constitute the seniority agreement except where modified. Seniority will be the primary and controlling factor in all cases, plant, mills and department, where applicable under other provisions of this Agreement subject to current written department rules and past practice agreements and where a job is involved, subject to reasonable considerations of the experience and ability of the individual employee for the particular job involved.
10.1	General
10.11	No partiality is to be shown to anyone.
10.12	In promotions within a department, the employee with the greatest seniority as calculated under paragraph 10.2, taking into consideration his experience and ability, will be given priority before advancing another employee or hiring from the outside. (This provision does not apply to the selection or advancement of foremen or supervisors.) In demotions (except for cause) the converse shall be applied.
10.13	In promotions and interdepartment, mills and plant transfers, the following rules will be observed.
10.131	Steel Mills employees will be given priority for permanent openings in Steel Mills departments, subject to paragraphs 11.0 and 11.1.
29
10.132	Wire Mills employees will be given priority for permanent openings in Wire Mills deportments, subject to paragraphs 11.0 and 1L1.
10.133	The following chart is intended to illustrate the application of the provisions of this Agreement and is subject to the provisions of paragraph 10.0 above and other appropriate provisions:
	Various Jobs In Department	New Jobs in fifipamnsni	New Hfijiailmfliii	
Department Employees	Priority	Priority	—	—
Mill Employees	Second Priority	Second Priority	Priority	—
Plant Employees	Third Priority	Third Priority	Second Priority	Priority
10.14	In compliance with paragraph 10.0, seniority shall apply in all new or changed jobs.
10.15	New departments shall not be set up by the Company without advance notice to, and consultation with the Union. Work presently performed will not be transferred from existing departments to new or current departmeni(s>-without notice and consultation with the Union in good faith effort to resolve any issues involved.
10.2 Calculation of Seniority. Plant seniority is an employee's continuous service with the Company since the date of his last hire, calculated in years, months, and days. Steel Mills seniority is the date upon which an employee began work at the Steel Mills, and Wire Mills seniority is the date upon which an employee began work at the Wire Mills (except men on involuntary transfer at all mills).
103 Probationary Employees. Newly hired employees shall be considered as probationary employees and shall not begin to build seniority until they have worked 60 actual working days. At the conclusion of the probationary period, probationary employees will be given a plant seniority date corresponding with the date upon which they entered the plant for work. Probationary employees newly hired into the Wire Mills shall not begin to build department seniority until completion of the probationary period. At the conclusion of the probationary period, probationary employees will be given a plant, mill, and departmental seniority date corresponding the date upon which they entered the plant, mill, or department for work. In the event a probationary employee in the Wire Mills is involuntarily transferred from his original, or home, department during his probationary period, he shall, nevertheless, build department seniority in his original department which shall become effective at the end of his probationary period and date
30
back to his date of beginning in this department In the event a probationary employee working out of his home department on involuntary transfer refused to return to his home department when called, time to begin to accumulate his seniority in his current department will startas of the date he refused to return to his home or first department he worked in, but his seniority in his current department will not be established until he has been in the department ninety (90) days.
104 All such probationary employees will receive weekly progress reports by their foremen for the first four (4) weeks of hire, and semimonthly reports for the remaining term of the probationary period. If during said probationary period, said employee is unsuitable to Management, his employment may be terminated, but he shall be eligible for Union representation if he so desires. The Secretary of the Union and department committee will be furnished copies of reports reflecting unsatisfactory progress.
103 Probationary employees will be displaced in case of slack work or layoff periods by older employees in plant seniority subject to paragraph 15.02.
10.	6 Seniority and the employment relationship shall be terminated by a voluntary quit, a discharge for proper cause or a layoff in excess of five (5) years subject to paragraph 10.9. An employee who has been employed after his termination of employment and seniority for any of the foregoing reasons shall be considered as a new employee.
10.	7 Each Steel Mills employee’s seniority (except probationary periods as previously defined, and Wire Mills employees on involuntary transfer, and employees governed by paragraph 12.3) in the department shall begin after performing work for sixty (60) days of which thirty (30) shall be consecutive working days after he enters such department for work. At the end of the sixty-day period, such employees will be given a departmental seniority date as of the date of their beginning to work such thirty (30) consecutive working days in that department. The last employee coming into a department is the youngest employee in that department, irrespective of how much Steel Mills seniority he may have, unless the job termination provisions referred to in paragraph 11.6 (for Steel Mills employees) apply or unless the comparison is between permanent versus temporary or probationary employees. No employee is considered coming from a department unless he has established seniority in that department. Unless an employee has established seniority as so described, he will not be considered as having come from a department for future job openings in that department. Exception: This does not apply to jobs that require break-in periods, crane, caster, and engine crew, plus any new starting jobs that require break-in. In such cases, employees who break in on such jobs will be called to fill the job provided seniority is established during a one-year period from the date of break-in.
10.	8 An employee on involuntary transfer in a mill other than the mill in which he has seniority may apply for voluntary transfer to the job then held by the involuntary transferee and he will be granted such transfer effective
31
immediately and will thereby terminate seniority in the previous department and mill.
10.	9 If an employee shall be absent because of layoff, mental or physical disability, he shall continue to accumulate continuous service during such absence up to a maximum of Eve (5) years, if the employee had accrued two (2) years of continuous service at the time of the previously referred to events). An employee with less than two (2) years of continuous service at the time of die event(s) will continue to accumulate continuous service during such absence up to a maximum.of two (2) years. In order to avoid a break in service within the above periods, an employee must report for work promptly upon termination of the mental or physical disability; in the case of layoff, the employee must promptly respond to a recall notice, sent by Certified Mail, to the most recent address furnished by him to the Company. Within thirty days of an employee ceasing to accumulate continuous service under this provision, the Company will notify the employee by certified mail of his termination date.
10.9	1 Effective May 3, 1984, the provisions of paragraph 10.9 shall not apply tq'an employee during the period he or she is absent due to being injured, on or after May 3, 1984, while on duty and such employee shall accumulate seniority and continuous service credit until the employee is no longer eligible to receive T.T.D. benefits under the Illinois Workmen’s Compensation Act. A break in continuous service and seniority will occur when such employee fails to report as available for work within thirty (30) days after the date be or she is no longer eligible to receive payment of T.T.D. benefits or after approval of agreement for lump sum settlement.
10.1	0 When two or more employees start working in a department on the same day, their respective seniority will be determined as follows:
10.10	1 If the employees have worked in any department at Keystone, their continuous plant service will be the controlling factor, subject to paragraph 10.13 above.
10.10	2 If the employees have not previously worked for Keystone, their department supervisor will, within one (1) week after they start working in any department, determine who should be placed on the seniority list first, using the employee’s birthdate to make this determination. In making this determination, no consideration will be given to the particular shifts the employees worked on their first working day in the department.
Article XI TRANSFERS FROM REGULAR DEPARTMENT
11.0	Voluntary transfers will be granted for no less than a thirty (30) day tryout period only when approved by the department head where the employee holds seniority and the appropriate operations manager/superin-
32
HU COM
tendent, whose decision will be governed by the general operating conditions and further prospects for the particular employees who are making such requests. Laborers and employees on starting jobs (except apprentices) in Steel Mills departments will be granted transfers as soon as practical when they are available. If, in the middle of the week, the transfer can’t be granted, then the following week the man will be granted the transfer and his date will be granted when the opening occurred. No transfer request for good cause will be arbitrarily denied. Probationary employees will not be allowed to voluntarily transfer until after the completion of their probationary period.
11.0	1 Company will make a good faith effort to release employees requesting transfers. Any employee whose transfer is delayed because of qualifications shall upon release be granted transfer to the new department or mill immediately and shall be granted the seniority date of the original opening.
11.1	All jobs in new departments will be posted. Employees interested in working other than their present promotional lines shall make written application at the Personnel Office. All applications for transfer wil] expire March 31 of each year. Employees will be granted no more than two transfers excluding posted craft jobs, during the transfer year. Union will be sent copy of all applications for transfer. In the event the posted craft job is not filled within 90 days after close of posted job. Company will repost the opening. Craft jobs will be posted before hiring from outside the plant.
11.2	No employee promoted to a job outside the bargaining unit shall continue to accumulate seniority when outside of the bargaining unit longer than an aggregate of 90 days.
113 In the event an employee retains a job outside of the bargaining unit, longer than an aggregate of 90 days, he shall be credited only with the plant seniority he had at the beginning of said period.
11.4	In the Wire Mills, employees working out of their regular departments on voluntary transfer who remain in the new department for more than ninety (90) calendar days and actually perform work at least forty-five (45) days in the new department, will forfeit their department seniority in their former department and will be granted a departmental seniority date in the new department as of the day they entered such department for work. An employee will continue to hold seniority in his regular department during the time he is out of such department on voluntary transfer, subject to the above time limits. It is understood that by mutual agreement the parties may lengthen these time periods.
11.5	Any Wire Mills employee temporarily transferred involuntarily because of slack operations or lack of work, by the Company to another Wire Mills department, shall have the right to return to his former job or department seniority status as soon as the conditions responsible for his transfer will permit such return. In neither of said events, however, sb
33
such right of return to a former job continue if the employee fails to accept the first such offer made. In the event the employee is a oon-probationary employee and he elects to remain in the department to which he had been involuntarily transferred, his seniority in the new department will date back to the day he was involuntarily transferred to it. If the employee is a probationary employee, his seniority will be established at the end of the probationary period as of the date he started work in the department.
1131 Wire Mill employees bumped out of their department and working on involuntary transfers shall have the right to use their plant seniority in the first week, provided employee has preference sheet on file to bump younger employees working out of their department or involuntary transfers in other Wire Mill departments. Such seniority may be used within the department for job and for shift preference in the first week.
11.6	In the Steel Mills only, if an employee has been transferred to another department and the job he is on terminates, he shall be eligible, beginning with the’next scheduled week, to return to any former job on which he has established seniority, providing there is no employee on layoff with more plant and department seniority. In the event that a job terminates after 7:00 a.m. Sunday and an employee is bumped out of his department and has seniority in dnothcr department to which he would be eligible to return except for this paragraph, he will be eligible to return to the Steel Mills Yard in line with his Steel Mills seniority and will be paid a minimum of the average earnings per hour for up to forty (40) hours on the starting job in the department he has left.
11.7	When the qualifications of two or more employees are relatively equal and either of their employment records are incomplete as to transfers, layoffs, etc., recommendations by duly appointed Union committees will be given special consideration in determining the seniority standing of the affected employees.
113 When posted records of the Company have been the basis for benefits or privileges of employees, the seniority dates appearing thereon shall be considered as correct if they have been in effect for five years or more after the date of such posting. This provision does not relieve the employee of the responsibility of reporting errors in posted seniority dates to the Company or to his Union representatives.
11.9	Employees who voluntarily transfer from the Wire Mill to the Steel Mill or from the Steel Mill to the Wire Mill and who remain in the mill voluntarily transferred to for more than ninety (90) calendar days will forfeit their mill and department seniority in their former mill. In the event the employee stays less than ninety (90) calendar days on the voluntary transfer, he will not acquire mill or any department seniority.
34
11.91	The following sets forth the understanding between the Union and the Company with regard to transfers between the two (2) mills and the correct interpretation of Plant Seniority as it applies to the transfers.
A Management employee, when returning to the Bargaining Unit, will have his/her Plant Seniority adjusted as prescribed in the agreement applicable at the time the employee left the Bargaining Unit. This Adjusted Plant Seniority date will be considered his/her plant seniority date wherever "Plant Seniority” is referred to in the Agreement regarding transfers.
Employees transferring from the Steel Works to the Wire Mill or from the Wire Mill to the Steel Works, will be transferred by using their Plant Seniority Date. Plant Seniority for transfer purposes is construed as the date of their last hire or their “Adjusted" Plant Seniority Date as defined above.
Article XII
PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS
12.0 Refusal or inability to take promotion, or a new job when offered, will not subject an employee to disciplinary action, bar him from future promotions or right to hold seniority in a department or in any other way affect his present job subject to the following:
12.01 In departments where the establishment of a line of promotion is not feasible, Company will give special consideration to recommendations made by the Union or any Union committee authorized by the employees in the department as to what may constitute a promotion, such as more pay or better working conditions.
12.02 If an employee of a Steel Mills department only has been promoted in his regular department and the job he is on terminates, he shall be eligible to return to any job in his regular department held by an employee with less seniority in his regular department, taking into consideration his experience and ability.
12.03 In Steel Mills departments, except where the bid system is in effect, or where department rules or past practices are to the contrary, an employee who refuses or is unable to take promotion will remain below the employee who accepts such promotion until such time as both employees are again working in the same job. Example: Employee A is senior to employee B; B takes move-up and A slays where he is. B is around A until A takes move-up and gets even or B comes down to A’s.level. A is back around B.
12.1 The present practice of employment for the Steel Mills Yard for all Steel Mills departmental starting jobs, and the promotion of such employees into other Steel Mills departments will be continued subject to paragraphs 11.0 and 11.1 Steel Mills employees who wish jobs at the Wire Mills may apply for such work. All employees who have been promoted through established lines of promotion, into other departments, shall be eli
35
gible to return to the job previously held by them for which they have established seniority in case, and when, their promotion might terminate. For all employees on departmental starting jobs (except those requiring break-in), seniority Ijhal! prevail in promotions and layoff and in~fehiring^
12.2 Applications for transfers filed in accordance with Paragraphs 11.0 and 11.1 will be processed before hiring directly into Wire Mill departments where vacancies occur.

Article XIII VOLUNTARY LAYOFF
13.0	Voluntary Layoff will be granted under the following provisions and conditions:
1.	When an incentive worker cannot hold an incentive job.
2.	When a less senior employee in the department with the same qualifications (as determined by the Company) is being laid off or is on layoff.
Employees must make request for voluntary layoff by 9:00 a.m. Wednesday of the preceding work week. Employees wishing to return to work voluntarily must notify Company by 9:00 a.m. Wednesday prior to the posting of the next work week schedule.
When additional manpower is needed in the department and/or mills, where the Company would otherwise be in a hiring situation, employees on voluntary layoff or subject to voluntary layoff will be called back by reverse seniority (least senior first), subject to qualifications (which will be deter- , mined by the Company).
13.1	If an employee is granted voluntary layoff and then forced back to work, he shall return to his home department whenever practicable. In the application of Article XIII, 13.1 of the Labor Agreement, the Company will make a good faith effort to return the employee to his home department, including displacing a junior employee in his home department, up to and including Friday of the scheduling week.
Article XIV

143 In case members of a department are laid off in order to provide forty (40) hours or less to senior members of the department, such laid-off members will be called back to work as soon as thirty-two (32) hours per week are available for them, without disturbing forty (40) hours of work per week for senior members of the department.
1431 Employees will not be added in any department until after all employees in that department are receiving forty (40) hours per week. However, if due to an emergency or to meet special shipping orders, or to complete emergency work, all extra time will first be offered to regular employees of that department who are working less than forty (40) hours of work per week for senior members of the department.
14.4 Steel Mills employees having five or more years of department seniority who are scheduled to work thirty-two (32) hours or less in any work week, exclusive of holiday weeks, in their regular department will be eligible to bump into the Steel Mills Yard only in accordance with Steel Mills seniority for at least one additional day of work in that work week.
143 To distribute available employment in the Steel Mills equitably, transfer of employees through regularly established lines of promotion will be made to fill vacancies, insofar as possible.

15.0 When it is necessary to lay off employees, the following provisions shall apply:
15.01 Employees having less than one year of plant seniority in Wire Mills or Steel Mills regardless of layoff status in other plant shall be laid off first
provided senior employees are available and qualified to do the work. No transfers between the Wire Mills and Steel Mills will be made of employees of less than one year of plant seniority, in case of layoff or reduction in force, except when hiring in one plant and laying off in another.
15,02 The above rules do not apply to the Mechanical, Electrical, Wire Mill Testing, Die Department, or maintenance departments, except that common labor jobs in such departments be governed by subparagraph 15.01.
15.1	When an employee absents himself due to illness or injury and said injury is noncompensable, if a reduction in plant or department operations occurs which would have resulted in his layoff in the normal course, pursuant to subsection 15.0 above, such layoff shall apply to him effective as of the date it would have been put into effect had he been working. If said injury is compensable at the time the Company doctor certifies the injured employee fit for duty and a reduction in plant operations is in effect to which employee would have been subjected on the basis of his seniority, such layoff shall apply on the date the Company doctor certifies the injured employee fit for duty.

• Steel Works Yard employees will be laid off by Plant Seniority Dates.
Recall to the Steel Works will be by Plant Seniority or Adjusted Plant Seniority Dates regardless of Department Seniority Date. Employees working in the Steel Works Yard will be treated in the same manner as a laid-off employee when departments are recalling employees; provided, however, that employees recalled from the yard to Steel Works departments should be called by department seniority.
Employees who use Job Termination to another department, (S.W. Yard excluded) will not be allowed to return to any previous department if a senior plant employee(s), with seniority in the department recalling employees, is laid off.
38
If the employee who used job termination has his/her job terminated, that person would be allowed to exercise normal job termination before recalling a senior plant employee who has less department seniority.
15.23	When all Wire Mills employees having more than one year of service with the Company are recalled to work and are receiving forty (40) hours or more of work per week, laid off Steel Mill employees having more than, one (1) year of service with the Company will be called to fill vacancies at the Wire Mills, assuming they are physically able to do the work, before recalling Wire Mills employees who have less than one (1) year of service with the Company.
15.24	In case Steel Mills employees are working at the Wire Mills under the provisions of subparagraph 15.23 above, and a change in working schedules results in some Wire Mills employees receiving less than forty (40) hours of work per week, such Wire Mills employees will not be allowed to displace Steel Mill employees on classified jobs.
15.25	When all Steel Mills employees having more than one (1) year of service with the Company are recalled to work and are receiving forty (40) hours per week or more, laid off Wire Mills employees having more than one (I) year of service with the Company will be called to fill vacancies at the Steel Mills, assuming they are physically able to do the work before recalling Steel Mills employees who have less than one (I) year of service.

16.1	Discussion of a Grievance: A grievance, for the purposes of this subsection, shall be defined as a claim by the Union that the Company has violated this agreement. Any employee who believes that he has a grievance shall discuss the request with his foreman at a mutually agreeable time, with or without the presence of the Union department committeemen, as the employee may elect, in an attempt to settle same; provided, however, that any individual settlement between a bargaining unit member and his foreman shall not be binding at any other time, unless authorized by the Union officers or committeemen in writing.
16.2	In order for a grievance to be considered any further in the grievance procedure, the request to discuss the matter must have been made within ten (10) days after the employee or a member of his Union department committee has knowledge or could reasonably be expected to have knowledge of the event complained of, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement.
16.21	Any authorized Union representative who loses time from his work while presenting grievances to authorized representatives of the Company at a mutually agreeable time will be paid his average rate of pay for the time so lost from his job.

16.41	Grievances which are not filed initially in the proper step shall be referred to the proper step for discussion and answer by the Company and Union representatives designated to handle grievances in such step. If the Company receives a grievance at Step I of the grievance procedure that can be reasonably assumed to involve the same issue or issues of a grievance already heard and answered in the grievance procedure, the Company may send the Union a letter citing such grievance along with a copy of Company’s last ^pswer to such grievance. Such letter will be considered a denial of the grievance and the Union may appeal the grievance to Step II as if the grievance had been heard and answered at Step I of the grievance procedure. Further, such grievance that is cited by the Company under this provision will be confined to a former grievance filed by the department involved.

This T&C incentive adjustment shall be paid to each man for hours worked under the applicable plan during a calculation period.
In the event an employee works on a recognized Leader (Head) job to a Trade and Craft journeyman job, the T&C incentive adjustment will be cal-
63
culaied in a similar manner as the basic craft using the BRCI (Base Rate for Calculating Incentives), for the respective Leader job class as the base from = which the job class differential will be determined.
This T&C adjustment shall not be used to adjust:
1.	The interim rate of any trade and craft job covered by an interim rate of the effective date of this adjustment.

The parties hereto agree that it may be in the best interests of the Company, Union and the Employees to modernize the incentive system currently'in use by providing for ways to reward factors in addition to production,
65

In’bfder to accomplish” the above, the” Company or the Unionmay propose new or changed incentives to cover a particular job or jobs that do not comply with the current language of Article 5 of the Agreement because of the manner and means of calculation, including the factors that are taken into account. However, it is understood that the Article V rights of either party are not diminished by this agreement.
If the Company agrees to a trial period as proposed by the Union for such an incentive plan, Employees shall be guaranteed the applicable interim rate for the trial period on a weekly or otherwise agreed to basis, but shall be entitled to receive the greater of what that interim rate produces or the earnings produced by the plan on trial. However, if an Employee or Employees produce less than the minimum standard for the covered job due to lack of effort, the Employee or Employees involved shall receive only what was actually earned under the new or changed incentive plan.
If the Company decides to put such new or changed incentive on trial, with or without the agreement of the Union, the same terms and conditions and guarantees shall apply with respect to the eamings opportunities of the Employees.
If such new or changed incentive is permanently installed by the Company, the Union may grieve and arbitrate the issue of whether the incentive is equitable. The same timetables now in effect for grieving and arbitrating such disputes, as well as the current procedures, shall apply. A new or changed incentive will be considered equitable if it provides eamings opportunities equal to or greater than those provided for under the incentive plan it replaced.
If the arbitrator should determine the new or changed plan is not equitable, the arbitrator may provide a make whole remedy for lost eamings but shall not have the authority to order the parties to adopt any particular incentive plan.
If an incentive plan is found by an arbitrator not to be equitable, the plan it replaced shall be placed back into effect unless and until a new or changed plan, pursuant to this Memorandum, is put on trial. If such new or changed plan is put into effect on a permanent basis, the Union may grieve and arbitrate the matter on the same basis and for the same reason as set forth above.
Once such a new or changed incentive is permanently put into effect in accord with this Memorandum and is either not challenged by the Union or is found to be equitable by an arbitrator, such permanently installed incentive may be changed or modified by the Company but the eamings opportunities provided may not be diminished as a result of the change or modification. The Union may grieve any such change or modification on the basis of its
66
belief that earnings opportunities have not been maintained and the arbitrator shall have the same authority to provide a remedy as set forth above.
