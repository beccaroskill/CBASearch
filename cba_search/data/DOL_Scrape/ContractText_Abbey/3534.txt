Purpose and Objectives
A.	The Alaska Nurses Association (AaNA) is the preeminent voice for nurses,
patients and recipients of healthcare services throughout Alaska. Its mission is to advance and support the profession of nursing through organizational integrity, advocacy, professionalism, representation and empowerment. While AaNA enjoys a proud record of accomplishment as an independent statewide association, ongoing changes in healthcare finance, hospital mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructuring and downsizing, technological change, and the shift in decsion making from the local level to distant corporate headquarters emphasize the necessity and urgency for increasing the capacity, influence, and reach of the AaNA in confronting these changes and threats to the nursing profession. Toward that end, following a deliberate process of rigorous research and due diligence, the AaNA hereby seeks to increase its capacity to achieve its mission, goals and objectives by entering into an organizational affiliation with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).
B.	The 1.6 million member American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is the largest and most experienced union of professionals in the AFL-CIO, with a national health care division (AFT Nurses and Health Professionals) comprised of 113,000 members working in the health professions, including 85,000 registered nurses, in 19 states. AFT, as defined through its official mission statement, “is a union that champions fairness; democracy; economic

opportunity; and high quality public education, health care, and public services for our students, their families, and our communities. We are committed to advancing these principles through community engagement, organizing, collective bargaining, and political activism, and especially through the work our members do.” AFT welcomes affiliation with the AaNA as an opportunity to amplify the voice and increase the effectiveness of nurse members in the systems (Providence and Peace Health) where AaNA and AFT share representation, grow membership in AaNA and AFT through new organizing in Alaska, and increase the numbers, influence and effectiveness of organized nurses throughout the country.
C.	This agreement is designed to create a strong partnership between AaNA and AFT for the purpose of enabling registered nurses in Alaska and throughout the United States to achieve and enjoy the voice, professional recognition, dignity, rewards and respect to which they are entitled. An important purpose of this affiliation is to enhance the resources available to AaNA for success in contract negotiations, legislative and policy advancement, workplace advocacy, public and community outreach, and new organizing. . Through this affiliation the partners affirm their commitment to advancing a solution-driven unionism in which the needs and interests of our members and those of the people and communities we serve are unshakably aligned.
