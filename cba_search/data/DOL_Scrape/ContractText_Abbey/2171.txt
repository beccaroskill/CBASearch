AGREEMENT made this 17th day of September, 2015 between Television Stations KYW-TV and WPSG-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Employer” or the "Stations" or hereinafter referred to separately as "KYW-TV" or “WPSG-TV”), owned and operated by CBS Broadcasting Inc.(KYW-TV) and Philadelphia Television Station WPSG Inc. (WPSG-TV), and Local 804 of the INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OF THEATRICAL STAGE EMPLOYES, MOVING PICTURE TECHNICIANS, ARTISTS AND ALLIED CRAFTS OF THE UNITED STATES, ITS TERRITORIES AND CANADA, AFL-CIO, CLC (hereinafter referred to as the "Union" or "Local 804") covering the bargaining unit employees of KYW-TV as defined in ARTICLE I, SECTION 1.01 - RECOGNITION below.
ARTICLE I - KYW-TV RECOGNITION
SECTION 1.01 - KYW-TV RECOGNITION: The Employer recognizes the Union as the exclusive representative for collective bargaining for all television operators including operator-supervisors, technicians, camerapersons, and all other employees who operate equipment at the studio, transmitter, relay and remote pick-up stations, all scenic and title artists, property-persons, grips, floor managers, make-up persons, employees who inspect, clean, splice and tear down already prepared film, and those employees who operate any motion picture or still picture projector which is used in the reproduction of a picture, slide, chart, or title upon a television monitor, or receiver, whether for the purpose of preview, line show, or actual broadcast, and operator-trainees, excluding administrative assistants, chief operating engineer, transmitter engineers, television program managers, television program correlators, studio engineer, remote engineer, director of special events, television program directors, employees who make, produce or prepare original film, janitors, guards, receptionists, all clerical employees and all supervisory employees with authority to hire, promote, discharge, discipline or otherwise effect changes in the status of employees, or to effectively recommend such action.
ARTICLE ILA - KYW-TV JURISDICTION
SECTION 2.01 - TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION: Neither the Employees nor the Union shall have any jurisdictional rights, as provided in this Article, beyond a radius of fifty (50) miles (as hereinafter defined) except in the area of any city limits lying outside of fifty (50) miles of a city which may be bisected by a circle drawn on such fifty (50) mile radius and except any program originations from Atlantic City, N.J. "Miles" as used herein shall mean "statute" miles (measured in the air) from the main studio building of the Station to the point of origin of any program.
SECTION 2.02 - PROGRAMS COVERED: Further subject to the exclusions and limitations on jurisdiction set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, only local programs originating exclusively for KYW-TV produced by KYW-TV shall be within the jurisdiction as defined in this Article.
- 1 -
However, the Company agrees that if Eyemark Entertainment is producing a syndicated program wholly within one of KYW-TV’s two main studios at 1555 Hamilton Street, that KYW-TV will make its best efforts to convince Eyemark Entertainment to utilize bargaining unit employees, who are qualified and readily available in the Company’s opinion, to perform technical work on behalf of that syndicated program. Furthermore, pick-ups (defined as live/tape program inserts) for the network (CBS) or other stations, within the territorial jurisdictional area, shall be operated by Employees only if production responsibility for such pick-up is assumed by KYW-TV. In the event KYW-TV does not retain control over a production, e.g., simulcasts produced by another broadcaster or cable service, sports events produced by the local team, etc., then such productions shall not be within the jurisdiction as defined in this Article. It is understood that in the event the Employer retains control over the production of a program segment aired exclusively over KYW-TV in conjunction with a simulcast as defined above, the Employer shall assign Employees to cover such program segment.
Notwithstanding the above or any other provisions in this Agreement, the production of any material that is not broadcast by KYW-TV through its transmitter exclusively on its original/traditional public reception frequency for direct public reception or any technological means that directly replaces this transmitter delivery system of KYW-TV’s original/traditional public reception frequency for direct public reception in the future, such as but not limited to fiber optics, shall not be under the exclusive jurisdiction of this Agreement. Therefore, the exclusive jurisdiction of this Agreement shall not extend to the production of broadcast material which is produced by KYW-TV and is transmitted by KYW-TV on other than KYW-TV’s original/traditional public reception frequency, e.g., other public reception frequencies (television, radio, data, etc.) that may be granted to or acquired by KYW-TV or some other Company entity, cable, UHF signals, other VHF signals, AM/FM signals, digital program services, etc. As used in this Agreement, the term “broadcast by KYW-TV through its transmitter exclusively on its original/traditional public reception frequency for direct public reception” means the traditional analog program service or the single digital program service that directly replaces it. During the transition period from analog to digital television, this term shall refer to both the traditional analog program service and the digital program service which directly replaces it. After such transition period, this term shall only refer to the single digital program service which directly replaced the traditional analog program service.
SECTION 2.03 - TRADE JURISDICTION: The Employer agrees that, except as specifically set forth otherwise in this Agreement, only KYW-TV Employees within the bargaining unit, hereinafter referred to as "Employees", shall perform the duties listed below, so long as such duties are performed within the territorial jurisdictional area defined in SECTION 2.01 - TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION, and so long as such duties are performed directly in connection with the broadcast of programs as defined in SECTION 2.02 - PROGRAMS COVERED, or for auditions and rehearsals in connection with such broadcasts. "Broadcast" as used herein means any ethereal broadcast or rebroadcast by KYW-TV through its transmitter on its assigned public-reception frequency for direct public reception. The duties are:
-2-
1.	Operate, maintain, and repair equipment including television lighting facilities of the Employer used in transmitting, recording on any type medium (including shooting and recording sound on film), converting and/or conducting audio, video, FM, and/or radio frequencies.
2.	MCR Audio/Video Switching; Subject to SECTION 2.06, Paragraph 1., Electronic/Computer Equipment, Operation, Control and Data Transfer, MCR audio and MCR video switching, and remote starting of VTR machines, film projectors and audio producing equipment.
3.	Electronic Graphics/Art Work: The Union shall have jurisdiction over all electronic graphics/art work prepared specifically for any broadcast, rebroadcast, audition or pilot produced or controlled by KYW-TV. (Not meant to include commercial art, graphics and photos. Not meant to include original art or reproductions necessary to program content. Exceptions will be made for religious or charitable programs.)
Furthermore, notwithstanding the above or any other provisions in this Agreement, individuals not covered by this Agreement may generate text, and assemble, composite and manipulate pre-produced graphic elements and/or animation/electronic graphics/art work without restriction in conjunction with editing material on "non-linear/digital" editing equipment. Such individuals shall not be subject to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a result of performing such work.
In addition to the above, the Employer shall have the right to utilize outside contractors (such as, but not limited to employees of traffic/weather services, graphics/art software producers, etc.) and consultants to produce electronic graphics/art work covered by this Agreement, either within the Employer's facilities or outside those facilities. Outside contractors and consultants shall be free to create electronic graphics/art work, work-ups, story boards, etc., and such material may be used for broadcast by KYW-TV. However, reproduction, replication and/or modification of such work shall remain the exclusive jurisdiction of the Union. Such individuals shall not be subject to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a result of performing such work. Moreover, an Employee will be assigned to work with such outside contractors/consultants described above, where in the sole opinion of the Employer, the opportunity to train and/or assist with such outside contractors/consultants exists.
4.	Scenic Construction: Scenic construction, except the Employer shall have the right to utilize outside contractors to construct sets (either within the Employer’s facilities or outside those facilities) and to assemble such scenic material that they have constructed. The Employer agrees, however, that when such an outside contractor is to perform the final assembly of a newly constructed set within either of the Employer’s two main studios at Independence Mall East, that at least one bargaining unit employee will be assigned to assist the outside contractor. Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that outside contractors may construct/decorate sets within the Employer’s facilities without restriction, the Employer agrees to discuss in advance with a representative of the Union whether consideration can be given to utilizing qualified bargaining unit Employees to perform some of the set construction/decoration work

that is performed within the Employer’s facilities. However, the Employer’s decisions shall be final and shall not be subject to grievance and/or arbitration.
In addition to the above, it is agreed that an electrical wiring of sets or set pieces may be performed by building maintenance employees or outside contractors.
5.	Previewing of Broadcast Material, Editing/Post-Production of Broadcast Material:
(a)	Individuals other than bargaining unit Employees may operate any technical equipment for the purposes of previewing any film or tape material for content, concept, timing, continuity, or for preparing editing instructions which can include time references to minutes and seconds and/or references to specific frame count.
(b)	The Union shall not have jurisdiction over the editing and/or post production of material the original production (filming/taping) of which is not the Union’s exclusive jurisdiction, e.g., public service announcements, demo-commercials, commercials, material not broadcast on KYW-TV’s assigned public reception frequency for direct public reception, etc.
(c)	Linear/Analog Editing Equipment: Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, the editing of any news/sports/weather material, including "voice-overs" and "voice-overs to sound" but not "packages", as these terms are understood in the trade, may be performed on "linear/analog" editing equipment by employees of the KYW-TV/KYW-AM News Department(s) (excluding interns and news production assistants). Such employees shall not be subject to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a result of performing such work. Notwithstanding the above, the Employer agrees that no more than a total of five (5) news/weather "voice-overs"/"voice-over to sound", in addition to unlimited sports "voice-overs"/"voice-overs to sound", that initially air in KYW-TV newscasts from Monday through Friday, may be edited by employees not covered by this Agreement. The Employer agrees that the above referenced editing shall not be assigned to the above referenced employees to the extent it becomes the majority of such employee’s work time in any calendar week.
(d)	Non-Linear/Digital Editing Equipment: Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, the editing, production and/or post-production of any material, including but not limited to any news, programming, commercial or promotional material, may be performed without restriction on "non-linear/digital" editing equipment, by employees not covered by this Agreement. Such employees shall not be subject to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement as a result of performing such work.
However, the Employer agrees that with respect to the employees not covered by this Agreement who may be assigned to the editing, production or post-production of any news/sports/weather material under this subparagraph (d) that the following limitations shall apply:
-4-
i.	Only employees of the KYW-TV/KYW-AM News Department(s) and television directors (but excluding interns and news production assistants) who are not covered by this Agreement may perform such work in connection with news/sports/weather material covered by this Agreement.
ii.	KYW-TV/KYW-AM talent shall only be assigned to perform such work in connection with material they have either gathered and/or written. Also, KYW-TV/KYW-AM talent shall not be assigned to perform such work to the extent it becomes the majority of such employees’ work time in any calendar week.
iii.	No more than three (3) designated managers, in addition to show or newscast producers employed by the KYW-TV News Department(s), may perform such work in connection with news/sports/weather material covered by this Agreement in any calendar week. Such designations shall change upon notice being given to the Union. However, the Employer agrees that the above referenced three (3) designated managers shall be allowed to edit no more than a total of eighteen (18) news/sports/weather “packages” in their entirety on “non-linear/digital” editing equipment in any calendar month. Editing/re-editing a news/sports/weather “package” that has been partially edited or entirely edited by another employee(s) shall not count against the above numerical limitation of eighteen (18) news/sports/weather “packages”. Also, the above referenced three (3) designated managers shall not be assigned to perform such work to the extent it becomes the majority of such employee’s work time in any calendar week. The employer shall keep a monthly accounting on the I-News System, available for viewing by the Union shop steward.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict individuals not covered by this Agreement from dubbing/recording any audio/video material into or out of "non-linear/digital" editing equipment.
6	.a. Studio Operations: Handle all cue cards and cue talent while on camera. Cuing talent while on camera shall be defined as cuing as to camera direction, cuing talent as to movement on the set, and cuing talent by giving a continuous countdown by consecutive seconds going into or out of a program segment, e.g., five, four, three, two, one. Nothing in this Section, however, shall preclude the direct communication (and any equipment, if necessary, to do so) between producer, director, talent, and/or studio crew for the purpose of giving any information, including the above specifically referenced cuing directions, to the talent. A stage manager will be assigned to "studio operations" (except for News/Sports/Weather updates/inserts/cut-ins or News/Sports/Weather promotional announcements that do not exceed six (6) minutes in length) any time the above cuing functions are being performed, except as provided in SECTION 2.07 -MISCELLANEOUS JURISDICTIONAL PROVISIONS, Paragraph 1. Unmanned Cameras of this Agreement. [When a stage manager is required to be assigned as provided above, the above described cuing functions shall be performed by a Local 804 represented Employee in conjunction with his/her other assigned duties.] "Studio Operations" for purposes of this Section shall be defined to mean any time studio cameras are used within Studios "A" and "B" and hard wired to KYW-TV Control rooms.
- 5 -
6	.b. Non-Studio Operations: Handle all cue cards and cue talent while on camera as defined above, when and only when, two (2) or more cameras at the same location are used in a shooting configuration which utilizes both talent and a director, and the video signal is switched between those two (2) or more cameras at the same location for that particular talent on a continuing or alternating basis. A stage manager will be assigned to non-studio operations only when the above conditions and functions exist. [When a stage manager is not assigned, the above described cuing functions shall be performed by a Local 804 represented Employee in conjunction with their other assigned duties.] Nothing in this Section, however, shall preclude the direct communication (and any equipment, if necessary, to do so) between producer and/or director and the talent for the purpose of giving any information, including any cuing information, to the talent.
6	.c. Remote Cuing Devices: Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude directors from activating remote cuing devices, such as, but not limited to countdown clocks, etc., for News/Sports/Weather updates/inserts/cut-ins or News/Sports/Weather promotional announcements that do not exceed six (6) minutes in length.
7	. Make-up: The application of make-up shall not be under the exclusive jurisdiction of this Agreement.
8.	Scenery, Sets and Props: The placement, handling (except the assembly of scenic material described in SECTION 2.03, Paragraph 4.), and maintenance of scenery and sets shall be performed by Employees. The maintenance of props owned by KYW-TV shall be performed by Employees. The placement and handling of props may be performed by individuals other than Employees. The Employee assigned to perform the functions of a stage manager shall be informed about props to be used on a show, and shall be responsible for the staging of such props.
9.	Video Switching: Regardless of any other provisions in this Agreement, the Union shall only have exclusive jurisdiction over the functions performed by the video switcher for the following listed KYW-TV newscasts so long as they continue to be produced by KYW-TV within KYW-TV studios and they are for initial broadcast on KYW-TV's assigned public reception frequency:
(i)	The newscast airing between the hours of 5:30 a.m. and 8:00 a.m., Monday
through Friday.
(ii)	The newscast airing between the hours of 12:00 noon and 12:30 p.m., Monday
through Friday.
(iii)	The newscast airing between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., Monday

(v)	The newscast airing between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on Sunday.
(vi)	The newscast airing between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 11:35 p.m., Sunday
through Saturday.
The above exclusive switching jurisdiction shall apply to the above identified newscasts when the above "airing" times are moved on a particular day due to temporary, unanticipated program changes.
The Employer, in its sole discretion, may assign on a non-exclusive basis, an employee represented by the Director's Guild, to both switch and direct any programs or program materials other than the above listed KYW-TV newscasts. Such employees represented by the Director's Guild who can switch material for other than the above listed KYW-TV newscasts may also perform all related and associated functions to such switching, e.g., beta playback, etc. Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Agreement, including but not limited to ARTICLE II-A, Section 2.03, Par. 2. MCR Audio/Video Switching, individuals not covered by this Agreement who can switch video material under this Paragraph 9. may perform such work on any switching equipment, including but not limited to any production type switchers that may be located in the master control room, but not the Master Control Room switcher commonly referred to as the "auto switcher". In addition, the Employer, in its sole discretion, may assign a bargaining unit Employee on a non-exclusive basis to both switch and direct programs or program materials.
The Union agrees that notwithstanding any language set forth above in this ARTICLE II, Section 2.03, Paragraph 9. Video Switching, that traffic reporters/anchors may perform traffic related video switching during newscasts.
SECTION 2.04 - CERTAIN NON EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION: In addition to those provisions specifically set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, the Employer shall have the right to assign Employees on a non-exclusive basis to perform work not under the exclusive jurisdiction of this Agreement. Such work includes, but is not limited to, the following:
1.	Work in connection with the production of material not to be broadcast exclusively by KYW-TV; work in connection with the production of non-broadcast material (e.g., sales presentations; dubs for non-air use where such dubs are recorded to a non-professional format such as, VHS, Super VHS, Video 8mm, Beta-max, etc., and are recorded in areas where Employees are not routinely assigned to perform work which is exclusive under this Article (such as Newsroom Editing Booths), and are recorded for purposes such as for previewing, responding to subpoenas, courtesy copies provided to individuals or outside entities, etc.; recording material from any outside sources if such recording is not to be thereafter aired on KYW-TV; courtesy services to other stations or networks - either inside or outside the facilities of KYW-TV); etc. However, Employees shall continue to perform the work in connection with the production of awards presentations.
-7-
2.	Installation, Maintenance and Instructional Training: The Employer shall have the right to have equipment manufacturers or outside contractors perform installation, repairs, overhauls and/or retrofit on any equipment.
Engineering management personnel may work with Employees in testing and trial adjustment provided that the number of Employees that would be normally assigned to such testing and adjustment is not reduced.

SECTION 7.06 - POSTING SCHEDULES AND SCHEDULING CHANGES; Daily work schedules will be posted at noon on the eleventh (11th) day prior to the work week involved. Posting of work assignments in a computer system such as I-News shall meet the posting requirements in this Section. Any subsequent changes shall be "flagged" in the I-News computer system and shall include the time such change was made. The Employer reserves the right to change the Employee's scheduled days off as late as ninety-six (96) hours prior to the time the days off were originally scheduled provided such newly scheduled days off shall not fall within that ninety-six (96) hour notice period, unless prevented by an unanticipated program change, emergency or other reason beyond the control of the Employer. Employees on vacation will be notified by a letter mailed to their home of any schedule changes. In the event the Employee’s scheduled regular work week is changed without the required notice having been given, an overtime premium shall be paid at the rate of one-half (1/2) of the Employee’s regular straight time rate for each hour of work performed outside of the regular schedule, subject to the right of the Employer to change the daily starting time as hereinafter provided.
The Employer will not arbitrarily change an Employee's daily starting time schedule during the scheduled regular work week and will, unless prevented by an unanticipated program change, emergency or other reason beyond the control of the Employer, give a twelve (12) hour notice of any change or by the end of his/her prior shift, whichever is less. In the event the commencement of an Employee’s daily schedule of hours is changed without the required notice having been given (except for reasons herein specified) an out-of-schedule premium shall be paid at the rate of one-half (1/2) of the Employee’s regular straight time rate for all hours of work performed outside of the regular schedule for that day; provided, however, that hours beyond eight (8) in any such work day shall be paid at overtime rates but not out-of-schedule premium. Notwithstanding the above, the Employer may require an Employee to report to work earlier than his/her schedule start time without the above notice provided that the Employee works overtime on that day, in which case no schedule change penalty shall result in such circumstances. In addition, the Employer agrees to notify the Employee by e-mail or phone when a change is made to a posted schedule which requires the Employee to work overtime.
The Employer and the Union agree that all of the penalties and/or premiums provided in this Section shall be waived for all schedule changes that occur due to the scheduling, cancellation or postponement of a parade, sporting event, sports celebration, or other remote or special program, where circumstances not within the control of the Employer affect the scheduling of such events. It is further agreed that any/or all of the penalties and/or premiums provided in this Section may be waived in other circumstances by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Union. The Employer may establish a method of indirect notice to change schedules in connection with special event coverage, parades, etc.
SECTION 7.07 - WORK PERFORMED ON SCHEDULED DAYS OFF; If work is performed on any of the two (2) days of the regular work week outside the basic five (5) days work week, said work shall be paid for at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2) the Employee's regular straight time rate.
-36-
SECTION 7.08 - STARTING DAY S WORK BEFORE TEN HOURS' REST HAS ELAPSED BETWEEN DAILY SCHEDULE: There shall be at least a ten (10) hour break between termination of work in one (1) day's work period and commencement of work on the next day, and any Employee who shall be required to commence his/her next day's work before the completion of the ten (10) hour break shall receive time and one-half his/her regular straight time rate for all hours elapsed from the start of work on said next day within such ten (10) hour break. It is understood and agreed that this provision is applicable even though the reduction of the ten (10) hour break was caused by daily overtime worked the previous day. However, the above short-turnaround penalty shall not apply where the work performed within the ten (10) hour break period resulted from Employee absences, e.g., sickness, from breaking news stories; or from other reasons outside the control of station management.
SECTION 7.09 - REPORT-IN PAY ON SCHEDULED DAYS OFF: If the Employer notifies an Employee to report for work on a scheduled day off and then cancels such tour with at least twelve (12) hours' notice prior to start time, the Employee shall not receive any compensation in such circumstances. In the event that the Employer notifies an Employee to report for work on a scheduled day off and then cancels such tour upon less than twelve (12) hours' notice prior to start time, the Employee shall be paid eight (8) hours at time and one-half (1-1/2) the Employee's regular straight time rate. However, where the Employer notifies an Employee to report for work on a scheduled day off in connection with the scheduling, cancellation or postponement of a parade, sporting event, sports celebration, or other remote or special program, where circumstances not within the control of the Employer affect the scheduling of such events, the Employer may cancel such tour upon less than twelve (12) hours' notice, prior to start time, without any overtime or penalty/premium payment. The Employer may establish a method of indirect notice to cancel such tours in connection with special event coverage, parades, etc.
SECTION 7.10 - CALL-BACK: In the event an Employee is called back to work after completion of his/her assigned shift for that day, such call-back hours shall be compensated at the overtime rate of one and one-half (1-1/2) times the Employee's regular straight-time hourly rate, with a minimum of four (4) hours. However, where the Employee has completed the call-back assignment within a time period less than four (4) hours from the completion of his/her assigned shift, the Employer can pay for the actual time elapsed from the completion of the assigned shift and the completion of the call-back assignment rather than the above reference four (4) hour minimum.
SECTION 7.11 - NIGHT DIFFERENTIAL: A supplement of fifteen percent (15%) of the Employee's regular straight time rate will be paid for all hours worked between 12:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.
SECTION 7.12 - PYRAMIDING OVERTIME: It is understood and agreed that time for which a premium has been paid shall not be included in calculating time worked for the purpose of ascertaining whether any other time worked shall be paid at a premium, and in no instance shall any premium be more than double time.

ARTICLE X - HOLIDAYS
SECTION 10.01 - PAID HOLIDAYS: New Year’s Day (January 1), Martin Luther King’s Birthday, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas Day (December 25th) shall all be paid holidays. Work performed on the above mentioned holidays shall be compensated for as follows:
-39-
1.	If the holiday falls on an Employee's scheduled work day and the Employee is scheduled to work, the Employee shall receive compensation at the rate of an additional half (1/2) time for all work performed on such day.
2.	If the holiday falls on an Employee's first scheduled day off and the Employee is required to work on such day, the Employee would receive an additional half (1/2) time payment plus a penalty payment of seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50). If the holiday falls on an Employee's second scheduled day off after having been required to work on such Employee's first scheduled day off immediately preceding, the Employee will receive an additional ftill-time payment plus a penalty payment of seven dollars and fifty cents ($7.50).
In both of the above examples, the Employee will receive an additional day off within a period of twelve (12) months. In the event such a day off is not given to the Employee within twelve (12) months, they shall receive one (1) day's pay in lieu of such day off.
3.	It is agreed that Employees may elect to substitute Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, January 6th or other religious holidays in lieu of these special holidays.
If a holiday specified above falls on an Employee's day off and they are not required to work on such day, they shall receive one (1) extra day off within a period of twelve (12) months or one (1) day's pay in lieu of such extra day off.
Requests for an additional day off (a "payback day") must be selected and taken within twelve (12) months, plus fourteen (14) days, following the particular holiday (e.g., New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King’s Birthday, Easter, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day). If within the twelve (12) months, plus the fourteen (14) days following the holiday, the Employee elects payment in lieu of an additional day off, he/she may request such payment on the appropriate form. If the Employee has not selected and taken the day off or requested payment in lieu of an additional day off, as outlined above, the Employee will automatically receive payment in lieu of an additional day. It is the Employee’s responsibility to keep a record of these "payback days" and how they were used; payment in lieu of, or as an additional day off.
With regard to holidays covered by the terms and conditions of this Article, the Company shall be under no obligation to schedule these payback days so that they are contiguous with vacation, days off, or other payback days. All reasonable requests for days off (including for religious holidays) will be considered subject to reasonable notification and subject to the Employer's operating necessities. The Company agrees it will make a good faith effort to accommodate such requests for days off. However, the granting of payback days is on a "first come, first serve" basis, subject to the Employer's operating necessities. The Company will make a good faith effort to approve or reject such requests by no later than twelve (12) days prior to the date requested. One payback day per calendar year may be used on an emergency basis. The Employee is expected to request the emergency payback day on a timely basis within the same guidelines for calling out for an illness. While approval of an emergency payback day will be subject to manager approval, for this one emergency day per year the Company will endeavor to accommodate such requests unless it presents a significant strain on the operating necessities of
-40-
the Station. It is understood that a request for an emergency payback day during the weeks of Thanksgiving Day and the two weeks that contain Christmas Day and New Year’s Day will be a significant strain on the operating necessities of the Station. Therefore, only emergencies of a demonstrable, extraordinary nature will be considered during these three weeks. Once approved a scheduled payback day shall not be revoked except in cases of Station emergency.
SECTION 10.02 - OTHER HOLIDAYS: In lieu of the five (5) following holidays: Washington's Birthday (February 22), Memorial Day (May 30), Independence Day (July 4), Labor Day, and Veterans Day, each Employee will receive an additional week off with pay, and such five (5) days shall not be deemed holidays under this Agreement. In the event the Employee is hired or terminated during a calendar year, such holiday allowance shall be pro-rated, based on the number of such "holidays" occurring within the individual Employees period of employment, provided the Employee has not received any other time off with pay for such "holidays".

SECTION 11.05 - VACATION SCHEDULING: The Employer agrees to meet with the Union prior to the start of vacation scheduling for the purpose of discussing vacation scheduling.
Thereafter, the Employer shall prepare a vacation schedule which shall provide each Employee who is entitled to at least two (2) weeks of vacation with the opportunity to select no less than two (2) weeks of vacation, within their own separate functional area, during the "prime vacation period".
No later than September 1st of the given calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the vacation being selected shall actually be taken, the Employer will provide the Union with the vacation schedule.
Thereafter, the Union, through the shop stewards, will have the Employees complete their total vacation selection and return the completed list to the Employer not later than December 1 st of the given calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the vacation being selected shall actually be taken.
-42-
Thereafter, no Employee shall have the right to change a vacation selection, even if the Employee is assigned to a different functional area after the Employee's vacation selection, without prior Company approval in writing.
The Company and the Union agree that an Employee, with a minimum of our (4) weeks notice, may schedule earned payback days contiguous with a scheduled vacation week in order to allow that Employee to connect his/her scheduled vacation week with the Employee's scheduled off days that are not contiguous with his/her scheduled vacation week.
The Employer thereafter shall post the vacation schedule by no later than December 15th of the given calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year during which the vacation being selected shall actually be taken.
Vacations are subject to the Company's operating necessities, e.g., limits can be placed on the number of Employees on vacation at the same time who perform the same particular job function, or during "rating" periods; except that at least one (1) week of vacation must be available throughout the calendar year for each functional area set forth in Section 11.04 above.
Employees who have two (2) mid-week days off (Monday-Friday) and who have all of their vacations scheduled as seven (7) day blocks (5 days of vacation and 2 off days) [or multiples of that for multiple contiguous weeks of vacation] may have at least (3) of those vacation weeks (only two (2) in “prime”) scheduled to start mid-week after the Employee’s second day off to enable such Employee to get nine (9) consecutive days off for a week of vacation [two (2) days off, five (5) days vacation, two (2) days off] or sixteen (16) days off in the case of two (2) contiguous weeks of vacation. Those weeks that an Employee wishes to have covered by this provision shall be so designated at the time such weeks are selected by the Employee. Once designated these weeks cannot be changed thereafter unless management approves such requested change.
Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict an Employee from volunteering to change his/her scheduled vacation week due to the operating necessities of the Station. The Station agrees to cover all reasonable, demonstrable costs incurred by an Employee as a result of such change.
SECTION 11.06 - RECALL FROM VACATION; No Employee may be called to duty for any reason during the Employee's vacation period.

ARTICLE XII - LAYOFF, SEVERANCE, RECALL, SENIORITY, ETC.
SECTION 12.01 - LAYOFF:
1.	Regular full-time Employees shall be classified by the Employer as being on one of five (5) separate seniority lists. The Employer may classify an Employee as being on any seniority list which represents a job function which is being performed by the Employee. Each seniority list shall be considered a separate seniority classification for layoff and re-call purposes, and Employees shall have seniority as defined in SECTION 12.06 - SENIORITY only among the other regular full-time Employees on their respective seniority list. The Employer may transfer an Employee from one seniority list to another seniority list which represent a job function which is being performed by the Employee. Employees who are transferred from one seniority list to another shall retain their seniority as defined in SECTION 12.06 - SENIORITY for the purpose of placement on the new seniority list, but shall not retain such seniority on the seniority list from which the Employee was transferred. However, such transfers shall not be effective for layoff purposes until three (3) months after written notice of such transfer is given to the Union. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as in any way restricting the Employer's right to assign any Employee to perform any and all of the functions covered by this Agreement including performing such functions simultaneously, as provided for in Section 3.03 of this Agreement. The following are the five (5) seniority lists:
1)	News Photographers/News Editors/Post-Production Editors
2)	Maintenance Technicians
3)	Core Employees
4)	Studio Employees
5)	Electronic/Graphic Artists
2.	Regular full-time Employees who are on the payroll as of May 2, 1991, shall be laid off by inverse order of seniority within the Employee's respective seniority list.
3.	Employees who are initially employed as regular full-time Employees after May 2, 1991, shall be laid off according to the following:
In the event a layoff is necessary in the opinion of the Employer within any one of the above seniority classifications, layoffs shall be made based on the Employer's assessment of the Employees within the affected seniority classification as concerns their relative skill, training, efficiency, versatility, ability to perform the functions which will remain to be performed following the layoff and other abilities, job performance issues (including performance evaluations), and the disciplinary record of the Employees. Where, in the judgment of the Employer, the above factors are not equal between or among Employees within the affected seniority classification, the Employer may layoff Employees within the affected seniority classification other than in inverse order of seniority. Where, in the judgment of the Employer, the above factors are equal between or among Employees within the affected seniority classification, seniority shall govern, such that layoffs shall occur in the inverse order of seniority among those Employees. In the event the Employer, based on its assessment of the above
-44-
referenced criteria, has laid off an Employee other than in inverse order of seniority within the affected seniority classification, the Employer's decision with respect to such layoffs shall not be subject to ARTICLE XVI - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION, except as provided for in this Section 12.01.
4.	In the event of a layoff within any one of the above seniority classifications, the Employer shall not layoff any Employee within the affected seniority classification who is on the payroll as of May 2, 1991, until all Employees who are initially employed after May 2, 1991, and who are within the affected seniority classification, have been laid off in accordance with Section 12.01, Par. 3. above.
5.	Either party desiring arbitration of an issue concerning a layoff shall have the right, upon written notification to the other party, to proceed directly to arbitration under the terms of ARTICLE XVI - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION of this Agreement, and, in such an event, either party may request the American Arbitration Association to conduct the arbitration in accordance with the Voluntary Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
In any arbitration proceeding where an issue concerns a layoff of a regular full-time Employee initially employed after May 2, 1991, other than in inverse order of seniority within the affected seniority classification under the above referenced criteria, the authority of the Arbitrator shall be limited to a determination of whether the Employer's decision was arbitrary and capricious. Therefore, the Arbitrator shall not have the power to substitute his or her judgment for that of the Employer, and must sustain the Employer's decision unless the Union has established beyond any doubt that there is no factual basis in the record to support the Employer's decision.
SECTION 12.02 - SEVERANCE ALLOWANCE; An Employee involuntarily laid off as a result of a reduction in force shall receive severance pay in an amount equal to two (2) weeks’ pay at his/her applicable base rate of pay for each full year of service with the Station, with a maximum of forty two (42) weeks’ severance pay.
All notice/severance pay under this Agreement shall be paid in weekly installments of one (1) week's pay each, commencing with the first week following severance. If an Employee is recalled or re-hired by the Employer, or by any part of CBS, Inc., before receiving all the notice/severance pay installments for which he/she would otherwise be eligible, he/she shall not receive any further notice/severance pay installments after such recall or re-hiring. Employees on layoff with recall rights who work as a Casual or Relief Employee shall have their severance pay suspended for periods in which they work in this capacity (e.g., severance pay will not be paid during periods such Employee works as a Casual or Relief Employee) but such suspended severance pay shall be reinstated when they cease working as a Casual/Relief Employee. An Employee recalled under this Article, as well as any former Employee re-hired by the Employer, shall not be given credit for severance purposes for any period of prior employment for which severance pay was previously granted. Any Employee who waives any recall rights in writing
-45 -
that he/she may have at the time of his/her involuntary layoff shall be paid severance pay in a lump sum.
The granting of severance pay as outlined in this Section 12.02 above is expressly conditioned on an Employee having executed a complete release agreement on a form determined and provided by the Employer prior to receipt of such severance pay. The Employer has the unilateral right to determine the provisions of the release agreement.
SECTION 12.03 - RECALLS; Only regular full-time Employees shall have recall rights. A regular full-time Employee shall have recall rights for a period of time after the date of his/her layoff equal to the length of the laid off regular Employee's seniority, up to a maximum period of twelve (12) months of recall rights, and only for openings within his/her applicable seniority list at the time of his/her layoff.
Regular full-time Employees who are on the payroll as of May 2, 1991, with recall rights, shall be selected for recall for openings within their former seniority classification in inverse order in which they were laid off.
Employees who are initially employed as regular full-time Employees after May 2, 1991, with recall rights, shall be selected for recall of openings within their former seniority classification based on the Employer's assessment of the Employees, with recall rights, within the seniority classification which is the subject of the recall as concerns their relative skill, training, efficiency, versatility, ability to perform the functions which will be performed following the recall and other abilities, job performance issues (including performance evaluations), and the disciplinary record of the Employees. Where the above factors are equal, in the sole opinion of the Employer, seniority shall govern with respect to recalls. In no event shall any Employer decisions with respect to recalls be subject to grievance and/or arbitration.
When a laid off regular Employee is offered re-employment, he/she shall notify the Employer in writing, within seven (7) calendar days, of his/her intention to accept and shall report for work within two (2) calendar weeks of his/her notification to the Employer. Any Employee with recall rights has the right of refusal unless the Employer guarantees seven (7) calendar months continuous employment. Should such Employee fail to fulfill his/her obligations hereunder, the Employer shall have no further obligation to employ him/her.
SECTION 12.04 - SENIORITY STANDING: The Employer agrees to furnish the Union annually with a list of all regular Employees within the bargaining unit, indicating on such list the seniority standing of such Employees.
SECTION 12.05 - PROBATIONARY PERIOD: Each new Employee shall become a regular Employee upon completion of his/her six (6) month probationary period, and shall have seniority based upon continuous service within the bargaining unit.
SECTION 12.06 - SENIORITY: An Employee's seniority shall be based on his/her most recent period of continuous full-time employment at KYW-TV as a regular full-time
-46-
Employee working under this Agreement, including employment with former owners of the Station, less any days of unemployment and leaves of absence without pay except as indicated in SECTION 13.01 - LEAVES OF ABSENCE and SECTION 13.02 - LEAVES OF ABSENCE - UNION ACTIVITY.
SECTION 12.07 - TECHNOLOGICAL LAYOFF: The Union recognizes that the broadcasting industry is undergoing significant technological changes and improvements and gives the assurance that it will not prevent or impede such progress. The Company recognizes that employment of individuals covered under this Agreement, who have attained long years of service, may be affected by the new methods of operation. To this end, the Employer agrees that when layoffs due to technological changes or improvements are required, Employees who are laid off as a direct result of such technological changes or improvements due to such reduction in force will be given a special severance allowance as follows:
Years of Service Special Severance Allowance
2-3 years	$ 500.00
3-4 years	600.00
4-5 years	700.00
5-6 years	800.00
6-7 years	900.00
7-8 years	1,000.00
8-9 years	1,100.00
9-10 years	1,200.00
For each year thereafter a sum of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) shall be added per year to extend the schedule up to a maximum of four thousand two hundred dollars ($4,200.00) for 29-30 years of service.
Such special severance allowance shall be in addition to the severance pay provided for in SECTION 12.02 - SEVERANCE ALLOWANCE and shall be disbursed in installments of two hundred dollars ($200.00) per week. Payment of such special severance allowance, however, is subject to the following qualifications and limitations:
1.	If the Employee is recalled for employment prior to the end of the special severance allowance period, and he/she accepts such recall, the special severance allowance installments shall cease as of the time of such recall. If the Employee refused such recall, the special severance allowance installments shall cease as of the time of such refusal; however, if the job for which the Employee is recalled is specified as for a period equal or less than the unused portion of the Employee's special severance allowance period, he/she may refuse the recall and still be entitled to the remaining portion of his/her special severance allowance installments.
2.	When an Employee has received the total special severance allowance to which he/she is entitled and is re-employed at any time thereafter, he/she shall not be entitled to a
-47-
second special severance allowance unless subsequent to his/her re-employment, he/she accumulates sufficient years seniority to qualify him/her for another special severance allowance and is laid off. Service prior to his/her re-employment shall in no event be counted for this purpose.
3.	When an Employee has received a portion of the total special severance allowance to which he/she is entitled and is re-employed at any time thereafter, he/she shall be entitled to the unused portion of his/her special severance allowance upon layoff subsequent to his/her re-employment, plus a second special severance allowance if he/she accumulated sufficient years seniority, subsequent to his/her re-employment, to qualify him/her for the special severance allowance. Service prior to his/her re-employment shall in no event be counted for the purpose of a second special severance allowance.
The granting of severance pay as outlined in this Section 12.07 above is expressly conditioned on an Employee having executed a complete release agreement on a form determined and provided by the Employer prior to receipt of such severance pay. The Employer has the unilateral right to determine the provisions of the release agreement.
SECTION 12.08: Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Employer to employ an Employee as a replacement for a laid off Employee.
ARTICLE XIII	- LEAVES OF ABSENCE
SECTION 13.01 - LEAVES OF ABSENCE - SENIORITY: In the event a regular Employee takes a leave of absence because of illness and returns to the unit within two (2) years, his/her seniority, for purposes of layoff and vacation seniority selection only, upon returning shall include the period of such leave of absence. No service credit shall accumulate towards the amount of vacation an Employee is entitled to when he/she is out on disability or a leave of absence.
SECTION 13.02 - LEAVES OF ABSENCE - UNION ACTIVITY: The Employer will arrange a leave of absence for Union activity for not more than two (2) Employees at any one time for specific periods up to two (2) years in duration. Any additional requests for extension of such period shall be granted provided that the total period of the original leave of absence and any extension thereof shall not exceed three (3) years in duration. An Employee granted a leave of absence pursuant to this Section shall accrue seniority, for purposes of layoff and vacation seniority selection only, during such leave of absence or any extension thereof granted pursuant hereto.
With respect to temporary leaves of absence for union activity, the Employer shall not be required to allow more than one (1) Employee to be on such a leave at the same time except for once every three years to attend the IATSE national convention; and for the week of the annual NAB Convention for which no more than two (2) Employees shall be allowed to be on such a leave.
-48-
SECTION 13.03 - LEAVE OF ABSENCE: Leaves of absence, including but not limited to leaves of absence under the Family Medical Leave Act, shall be granted to Employees in accordance with Company policy. Unpaid leaves of absence shall proportionately reduce an Employee’s vacation eligibility in accordance with Company policy.
ARTICLE XIV	- DISCHARGES
SECTION 14.01 - DISCHARGES: The power to discharge and discipline remains with the Employer. The Employer shall have the right to suspend or discharge any of its Employees for just cause, without notice and/or severance pay. In the event of a discharge of an Employee pursuant to this Section 14.01, the Employer agrees to meet with the Union within seven (7) days from the discharge date to give the Union the opportunity to persuade the Employer to reconsider its decision to discharge such Employee. Just cause shall be deemed to include: gross insubordination, theft, repeated lateness or absenteeism, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs while on the job, disorderly conduct on the premises, being physically or mentally unfit to work, failure to comply with previously written Station wide or Company regulations/policies, creating a fire or a safety hazard, or the unauthorized/improper use of Company equipment.
The Parties agree that also included within the meaning of "just cause" is "unsatisfactory performance". For purposes of discharge or discipline under this Agreement, "unsatisfactory performance" means inability or unwillingness to perform the particular work required by the Employer, irrespective of the length of employment of the Employee involved.
The Employer shall continue to follow a process of progressive discipline of Employees.
Should an arbitrator conclude that an Employee who has been discharged by the Employer without notice and/or severance pay under this Section 14.01 should have been discharged instead under Section 14.02 below, the sole remedy that may be awarded by the arbitrator shall be the payment of two (2) weeks' salary, as set forth in Section 14.02.
SECTION 14.02 - DISCHARGES: The Employer shall have the right to discharge any of the Employees for any justifiable reason other than as set forth in Section 14.01 above on two (2) weeks' notice or on the payment of two (2) weeks' salary.
SECTION 14.03 - DISCHARGES - DURING PROBATIONARY PERIOD: The Employer shall have the right to discharge any Employee for any reason without any notice or severance pay during the first six (6) continuous months of his/her employment, and such discharges shall not be subject to grievance or arbitration.
SECTION 14.04 - SUSPENSIONS: The Employer will notify the Union immediately upon the suspension of an Employee and will be accessible to discuss and review the matter with the Union promptly thereafter.
SECTION 14.05: Nothing in ARTICLE XII - LAYOFF, SEVERANCE, RECALL, SENIORITY, ETC, of this Agreement shall be construed as limiting in any way the Employer's
-49-
right to discipline and/or discharge an Employee in accordance with this Article, and other applicable provisions of this Agreement.
SECTION 14.06: Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Employer to employ an Employee as a replacement for a discharged Employee.
ARTICLE XV - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS, ETC.
SECTION 15.01 - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS: Except as specifically restricted in this Agreement, the Employer's management rights shall include, but shall not be limited to, the right to direct, control and manage its operations; to require Employees to work in job classifications other than the specific job classification of the Employee; to hire, suspend, or layoff Employees; to maintain proper discipline and efficiency; to direct the working force; to discipline, demote, suspend, terminate or otherwise relieve Employees from duty for just cause; to assign or reassign the work to be performed by Employees; to determine the material to be broadcast; to select those with whom the Company will do business, to extend, maintain, curtail, sell or terminate all or any part of the operations of the Company's facilities; to test new methods or facilities; to establish and maintain regulations, including reasonable rules and regulations relating to safety. While the above rights are vested exclusively in the Employer, the Employer agrees it will not exercise any of its management prerogatives for the purpose of discriminating against any Employee because of his/her membership in or activities on behalf of the Union.
SECTION 15.02 - PERFORMANCE REVIEW SYSTEM: The Employer's management rights include the right to design, create, and implement a job performance evaluation system. The Employer has the right to require Employees to attend job performance reviews. The Employer and the Union agree that if an Employee disagrees with any written job performance review, that either the Employee and/or the Union shall have recourse thereafter to attach a written rebuttal to the Employee's performance review which shall be attached thereto in the Employee's personnel file.
SECTION 15.03 - COMPANY POLICY MANUAL, CONFLICT OF INTEREST QUESTIONNAIRES, CODE OF ETHICS & CONDUCT, ETC.:	The Union and the
Employees covered by this Agreement agree that all Employees shall review the standard Company Policy Manual, the standard Company Code of Business Ethics & Conduct, the Company Conflict of Interest Questionnaire, the Company Rules of Conduct, and other similar standard Employer policies/directives including but not limited to regulatory, safety and/or operational policies and procedures and acknowledge both receipt and that he/she has read such standard Company policies/directives. If any Employee has any questions or concerns as to the interpretation or application of such standard Company policies/directives, he/she shall have the obligation to seek a resolution to such questions or concerns by seeking clarification from appropriate Station management. Failure to comply with the requirements of this provision shall be deemed just cause for disciplining an Employee, up to and including discharge. Such disciplinary action taken by the Company shall be subject to the provisions of ARTICLE XIV -DISCHARGE and ARTICLE XVI - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION of this Agreement.
-50-
SECTION 15.04 - MONTHLY MEETINGS; The Employer and the Union, through their respective designated representatives, shall meet once each month to discuss working conditions and the improvement of the Employee-Employer relationship. Two (2) Local 804 Union representatives will be released from duty to attend without loss of pay. Grievances may be discussed during such meetings.
SECTION 15.05 - UNION GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE; Representatives of the Union Grievance Committee will be paid at the straight time or overtime rate, whichever is applicable, for meetings specifically requested by the Company.
SECTION 15.06 - DRUG/ALCOHOL TESTING: Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way limit the Employer’s management rights to unilaterally establish a drug/alcohol testing program for Employees covered by this Agreement. Nothing in connection with the creation or implementation of such a drug/alcohol testing program shall be subject to grievance and/or arbitration under this Agreement including any decision to require an Employee to take such a test or the validity and/or accuracy of the results of any such test. However, the Union may grieve or arbitrate the sole issue of whether any disciplinary action that may subsequently directly arise out of the results of any such drug/alcohol test followed a policy of progressive discipline.
ARTICLE XVI - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION
SECTION 16.01 - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION:
1.	In the event there is any grievance, dispute or difference between the Union and the Employer with respect to the interpretation or application of this Agreement, notice will be given by the aggrieved party, to the appropriate management or labor representative, within fifteen (15) calendar days from when the Union or Management representative becomes aware of the act or commission regarding which the individual is aggrieved. An earnest effort will be made to settle such grievance promptly by the designated representatives of the Union and the Employer.
2.	Each grievance shall first be discussed between the appropriate Union steward and the supervisor in charge of the location involved in the dispute (or their substitute if they are unavailable because of illness or on vacation) in an effort to reach an amicable settlement. If no such settlement can be reached, either party wishing to process the grievance further must give specific notice in writing of the grievance to the other within thirty (30) calendar days from when the Union or Management representative initially became aware of the act or omission regarding which the individual is aggrieved.
3.	Within fifteen (15) calendar days after the written presentation of the grievance, the duly authorized representatives of the Union shall meet with the duly authorized representatives of the Employer and the parties shall proceed with due diligence to settle the grievance. Should no agreement be reached within fifteen (15) calendar days from the first meeting of the said representatives, either party desiring arbitration shall within fifteen (15)
-51 -
calendar days thereafter submit the matter to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association with appropriate notice to the other party of such submission. Except by mutual agreement in writing, only one grievance dispute shall be submitted to an arbitrator in the same proceeding. The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association except that the parties agree to abide by the award of a single arbitrator to be selected by the parties from a list to be submitted by the American Arbitration Association.
No arbitrator shall be appointed by the Association who has not been approved by both parties unless and until the parties have had submitted to them at least three (3) lists of arbitrators from the Association's panels, and have been unable to select a mutually satisfactory arbitrator therefrom.
4.	The arbitrator shall not have the power to add to, modify, or change any of the provisions of this Agreement. The decision or award of such arbitrator shall be in writing and a copy sent to the Employer and the Union and it shall be final and binding upon the parties. All expenses of the arbitration (e.g., the costs of the arbitrator and stenographic record, but not lawyers costs or witness costs) shall be borne by the losing party of the arbitration, except that if both parties agree to a settlement of the grievance or the arbitrator's decision is not a clear cut victory for either side (e.g., discharge is reduced to suspension without pay, etc.), the expenses shall be shared equally. Any dispute as to which party should bear the expenses of the arbitration shall be determined by the arbitrator deciding the arbitration at issue based on the above criteria. (Both parties shall continue to pay half of the expenses until a decision is reached then the losing party shall reimburse the other).
a.	The Arbitrator shall not have the power in any arbitration proceeding where the issue concerns discharge or discipline for unsatisfactory performance to substitute his or her judgment for that of the Employer, and must sustain the discharge or discipline imposed by the Employer, unless the Union has established the following: (1) that the Employer failed to define for the Employee, through job descriptions, performance reviews and/or other communications, the criteria under which performance would be measured, or (2) that the Employer failed to follow a process of progressive discipline of the Employee for unsatisfactory performance. The Arbitrator shall not have the power, in determining whether the Employer failed to follow a process of progressive discipline, to substitute his or her judgment for any judgment exercised by the Employer during the process of progressive discipline prior to that instance of discipline or discharge which is the subject of the grievance before the Arbitrator.
b.	The Arbitrator shall not have the power in any arbitration proceeding where the issue concerns discharge or discipline for unsatisfactory performance, and where the Employer's decision concerning performance involves a subjective determination (such as a creative or artistic determination), to substitute his or her judgment for that of the Employer, and must sustain the Employer's subjective determination, unless the Union has established that the Employer's subjective determination was arbitrary or capricious.
5.	By mutual agreement, each step of the above-mentioned grievance and arbitration procedure may be extended or modified in writing.
-52-
6.	It is the express understanding and agreement of the parties that the grievance and arbitration provisions of this Agreement are the sole, exclusive, final and binding method chosen by the parties to resolve grievances of Employees and the Union arising out of the interpretation or application of this Agreement.
ARTICLE XVII - NO STRIKE, NO LOCKOUT CLAUSE
SECTION 17.01 - NO STRIKE, NO LOCKOUT CLAUSE:
1.	The Union agrees that, during the existence of this Agreement, the Union and the Employees shall not call, support or participate in any strike, sympathy strike, work stoppage, picketing, sit-down, slow-down, or any refusal to enter the Employer's premises, or any other interference with any of the Employer's services or operations wherever situated, whether or not the prohibited conduct is caused by a dispute with the Employer, is in sympathy for a dispute with the Employer or any other employer by employees of the Employer not covered by this Agreement or employees of any other employer, or is caused by any other reason. The Union will order the Employees not to engage in the conduct proscribed in this Article XVII and will order its members to perform this Agreement. The Employer agrees that during the existence of this Agreement, it will not engage in a lockout.
2.	In no case shall any Employee engage in the prohibited conduct described above by reason of the reception, broadcast, and transmission by the Employer of television programs on which persons are used who are employed by an employer other than the Employer, irrespective of whether such programs originate at the point at which IATSE or others are striking, are transmitted to a point at which IATSE or others are striking, or are broadcast over the Employer's facilities on behalf of a sponsor or agency against whom IATSE or others are striking.
3.	The Union waives the rights of the KYW-TV/WPSG-TV Employees within the bargaining unit to engage in a strike or honor a picket line. If an Employee encounters a strike or picket line in any circumstance, whether it is located at KYW-TV/WPSG-TV or elsewhere, including at the site of a news or program event, and whether it is established by the Union or some other union or other employees, and whether it involves some other operation of the Employer or not, the Employee shall not strike or engage in any other work stoppage and shall cross the picket line and perform his/her assigned duties.
4.	The Union and the Employer agree that any alleged violation of this Article may be immediately submitted to arbitration pursuant to ARTICLE XVI of this Agreement.
5.	The Union and the Employer further agree that any alleged violation of this Article may be the subject of judicial action, without reference to ARTICLE XVI of this Agreement, to maintain the status quo and compel arbitration.
-53 -
6.	The Employer will not assign, transfer or require Employees in the bargaining unit to go to any radio or television station, transmitter, studio or property to perform duties of Employees on strike who performed such duties at such location.
ARTICLE XVIII	- TARDINESS/ABSENTEEISM
The Union recognizes the right of the Employer to expect regular and punctual attendance at work by its Employees and the Employer's right to discipline an Employee for excessive absenteeism/tardiness. Discipline for excessive absenteeism/tardiness shall be applied in the form of progressive discipline. Progressive discipline will be administered in the following manner as it relates to this absenteeism/tardiness program:
Station management will monitor the attendance of all Employees on a regular basis in order to determine whether an Employee has an absenteeism/tardiness problem. In making such determination, Station management will consider the Employees total work record, the circumstances of specific absence/tardiness, and the seriousness of each incident of absence/tardiness.
Once a determination has been made by Station management that an Employee has an absenteeism/tardiness problem, Station management shall orally warn the Employee of his/her excessive absenteeism/tardiness. If the absenteeism/tardiness problem continues, the oral warning shall be followed by a written warning. In the event that the absenteeism/tardiness problem continues following this step in the disciplinary process, the Employee may be subject to further disciplinary action up to and including suspension or discharge.
Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, the Employer shall have the right to require any Employee who has received an oral warning from the Employer that he/she has an absenteeism/tardiness problem to provide to the Employer a doctor's certificate explaining in detail the nature of the Employee's illness in the case of any absence/tardiness from work. Any failure to produce a doctor's certificate under such circumstances may be treated by the Employer, in its sole discretion, as just cause for further progressive disciplinary action. Moreover, since the Employer has the right to expect regular and punctual attendance, providing a valid doctor's certificate that states that an Employee's absence/tardiness for a legitimate illness shall not preclude the Station from making a determination that such Employee has an absenteeism/tardiness problem.
The above disciplinary procedures shall in no way limit the Employer's management right to discipline Employees as recognized elsewhere in this Agreement and nothing shall prevent the Employer from determining on more than one occasion that an Employee has an absenteeism/tardiness problem. Absenteeism/tardiness shall be construed as unsatisfactory performance under this Agreement and the Union shall have the right to grieve each incident of discipline for absenteeism/tardiness in accordance with the grievance and arbitration procedures set forth in ARTICLE XVI, Section 16.01, Paragraph 4,a. of this Agreement.
-54-
In connection with the progressive discipline program described above, the Employer has the unrestricted right to require all Employees to participate in any programs which may be designed and implemented to monitor absenteeism/tardiness, including but not limited to a card key monitor system to be utilized upon entry and exit from the Employer's premises. Nothing in connection with the creation or implementation of any such program shall be subject to grievance and/or arbitration under this Agreement.
ARTICLE XIX	- EXTENDED ABSENCES (SICKNESS OR DISABILITY)
To the extent permitted under Federal, state or local law, the Company may hire a regular full-time Employee to replace any Employee absent from work for longer than six (6) months, due to his/her own sickness/disability, in accordance with Company Policy. If an Employee is replaced by the Company and advises the Company he/she is capable of returning to full-time employment, he/she shall at that time be eligible for reinstatement for the first opening of a regular full-time position that becomes available after the Employee's sickness/disability ends within the functional area covered by that Employee's respective seniority list at the time of his/her sickness/disability, provided he/she is capable of performing the functions covered by the next available position. If the above conditions have been satisfied, he/she shall be offered such position, prior to that position being offered to any other individual. Refusal to accept such position shall terminate such Employee's eligibility for reinstatement.
If an Employee is replaced by the Employer because his/her sickness/disability extends beyond the above time limit but he/she is thereafter offered re-employment at the conclusion of the Employee’s sickness/disability, his/her seniority shall not be deemed to have been "broken" for purposes of layoff under ARTICLE XII - LAYOFF, SEVERANCE, RECALL, SENIORITY, ETC.
ARTICLE XX	- SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS
SECTION 20.01 - SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS: This Agreement shall be known as the KYW-TV/WPSG-TV-IATSE Local 804 Agreement, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors and assigns.
ARTICLE XXI	- NO DISCRIMINATION
SECTION 21.01 - NO DISCRIMINATION: Both parties hereto affirm their intentions to continue to adhere to and support a policy which affords equal opportunity in accordance with applicable Federal, state and local laws.
ARTICLE XXII-	TERM OF AGREEMENT
SECTION 22.01 - INITIAL TERM: This Agreement shall be effective as of July 16, 2015, and shall remain in full force and effect up to and including July 15, 2018, unless automatically extended as provided in SECTION 20.02 below.

Notice of a desire to change this Agreement shall not be deemed to be notice of a desire to terminate this Agreement.

In the event only one party gives timely notice of a desire to change this Agreement, the other party shall have the right thereafter to submit proposals during the negotiations. Where no notice of a desire to terminate this Agreement is given, then, for so long as the parties thereafter fail to agree on all the terms and conditions proposed to be changed, this Agreement shall be deemed to continue in effect, unless and until either party thereafter gives notice in writing by hand delivery to the other party of its desire to terminate this Agreement. In the event such a notice of desire to terminate this Agreement is given, this Agreement shall terminate seventy-two (72) hours after receipt by hand by the other party of the notice, or on July 15, 2018, or on July 15 of the appropriate year if the Agreement has extended automatically from year-to-year, whichever time and/or date is later.

SIDELETTER #5 - Performance Reviews
SIDELETTER AGREEMENT made this 17th day of September, 2015 between Television Stations KYW-TV and WPSG-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Employer” or the "Stations" or hereinafter referred to separately as "KYW-TV" or “WPSG-TV”), owned and operated by CBS Broadcasting Inc.(KYW-TV) and Philadelphia Television Station WPSG Inc. (WPSG-TV), and Local 804 of the INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OF THEATRICAL STAGE EMPLOYES, MOVING PICTURE TECHNICIANS, ARTISTS AND ALLIED CRAFTS OF THE UNITED STATES, ITS TERRITORIES AND CANADA, AFL-CIO, CLC (hereinafter referred to as the "Union" or "Local 804") covering the bargaining unit employees of KYW-TV as defined in ARTICLE I, SECTION 1.01 - RECOGNITION below.
During the 2001-2002 negotiations the Company grudgingly agreed to a Union proposal to change the then existing system of giving Employees their increases on their anniversary dates, to giving all increases on a set date for the entire unit. Therefore, effective January 1, 2003, the Company will no longer give regular full-time Employees their increases effective on their anniversary dates. Instead, all regular full-time Employees shall be paid the compensation provided in SIDELETTER #4 effective the first full work week following July 15 in each calendar year, commencing in July, 2003.
In these negotiations the Company expressed to the Union its concerns about changing from the former system of doing performance reviews and giving salary increases throughout the year. This system allowed management to spread out its performance review work load over a twelve month period. While the Union acknowledged that going to a set date for all increases will make it more difficult to accomplish the review process, it insisted on such a change due to the problems in getting Employees their increases in a timely fashion under the former system. The Union agreed that as a result of this change the Company may, in its sole discretion, revise the performance review process and such changes shall not be subject to grievance or arbitration. Such changes may include, but shall not be limited to, the Company’s right to review only a portion of the bargaining unit in any given year.
Nothing in connection with the performance review system or merit pay is subject to grievance or arbitration.

The Station believes that since its work load is more intensive Monday through Friday than on weekends, a five (5) day work week is better suited to meet its scheduling needs. However, on an experimental basis, the Station agreed during the negotiations that culminated in the 2007-2011 KYW-TV/IATSE Agreement to consider on a case-by-case basis the option of a four (4) day, ten (10) hour (exclusive of any unpaid meal period if assigned) work week (4/10 week) where mutually agreed upon by the Station and the Employee. This agreement is subject to resolving the various work week issues this 4/10 week will create, e.g., overtime, short-turnaround, meal periods, vacation, sick leave, consecutive days off, etc.
The Union agreed that any Station decisions regarding the 4/10 week shall not be subject to grievance or arbitration under any circumstances, including but not limited to the denial of a request for a 4/10 week or the reversal of the Station’s decision to grant a 4/10 week

Re: Helicopter Insurance
Dear Jim:
This letter is to confirm that during the 1998/1999 collective bargaining negotiations the Station agreed to provide, either directly or through the helicopter service, additional accidental death insurance in the amount of $500,000 to be paid over and above the normal Company insurance (but not to exceed a total of $ 1,000,000) in the event a news photographer is killed in a helicopter accident while working for KYW-TV. During the 2001/2002 collective bargaining negotiations the parties agreed that this additional insurance is not required to be obtained where it is not available for some reason, or where it becomes cost prohibitive in the Company’s opinion.
Very truly yours,
Joseph P. Gerstner
