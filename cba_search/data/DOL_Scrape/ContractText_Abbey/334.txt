An employee that is eligible for Medicare because of SSDI entitlement must provide documentation and a signed release form whenever requested by the BIW benefits administrator regarding continued eligibility for SSDI and/or Medicare. BIW will coordinate benefits under the BIW Healthcare Plan as a secondary payor to Medicare and reimburse the employee Medicare Part B premium. Any employee terminated as a result of Section C during the life of this agreement who is Medicare eligible will be reimbursed their Part B premium for a combined leave of absence and termination period equal to their prior length of service. An employee that does not qualify for SSDI and/or Medicare shall continue to be covered by healthcare in accordance with the healthcare terms of this agreement and Section 2C.
For a period equal to length of service, employees terminated as a result of Section 2C will be offered employment to a position within the bargaining unit with reinstated seniority upon release for work through medical certification from primary care physician. IfBIW's Medical Director disagrees with the decision, a third party (medical physician) will be called in and selected by mutual agreement between the employee’s medical primary care physician and Yard Medical Director. The third party physician will decide the issue.
If you are laid off, your healthcare coverage will continue as follows:
Years Service	Healthcare Coverage
Beyond Month of Layoff
Less than 10	3 months
10 or more	6 months
Your seniority will be fixed as of the first day of involuntary layoff. All time on involuntary layoff will accrue for seniority purposes upon your return to work.
Your seniority will be fixed as of the first day of leave of absence. All time on leave of absence will accrue for seniority purposes upon your return to work for a minimum of 30 hours of work within 15 working days of return to work from that medical LOA. New injuries or illnesses incurred during this time frame shall not preclude an employee from having his seniority accrue under this provision.
All leave of absence for sickness, injury or mental or physical disability will be granted with medical certification acceptable to BIW.
Seniority will be accumulated when you are elected to a Local (City council, town selectman position only), State, or Federal Government office that requires your full-time presence.
22
Should you incur a yard injury that prevents you from working within your job classification and accept work within your limits in another bargaining unit at BIW and be subsequently involuntarily laid off prior to linking up your full seniority, you will be transferred back into Local S6 to protect your seniority rights in your prior classification and rate of pay.
For purposes of determining occupational and non-occupational leave of absence time limits only, any controverted worker’s compensation case being actively pursued by any employee who is covered by this agreement will be treated as occupational until such time as a formal decision is received.
If BIW prevails in controverting the claim, we will treat the entire time on leave of absence as non-occupational. If the employee prevails, it will continue as occupational. In the event that an employee files claims under both State and Federal law, the initial formal decision in either forum shall serve to determine whether seniority will be controlled by non-occupational or occupational time limits, subject to final determination.

Article 18 COMPENSATED TIME OFF
Entitlements:
Compensated time off is for vacation and sick leave. When used for vacation, Compensated Time Off will be taken at the convenience and discretion of the Company, with due regard for your wishes. Your annual compensated time off allowance, which will be accrued monthly during the year, is as follows:
Years Service		■	Annual Allowance (In Hours)	Monthly Accrual (In Hours)	
1-2		48		4.0	
2-3 . .		96			8.0

Accrual:
The Compensated Time Off allowance accrues during any calendar month in which you received payroll compensation for 80 or more hours in that month. During the calendar year in which you complete a service anniversary that brings you to a higher allowance, you accrue compensated time-off at the higher rate for the entire year. Any unaccrued compensated time off used during a calendar year will be debited from your allowance at the start of the next calendar year. Effective January 2,2001, for any hours not paid that are covered by an absentee code not held against perfect attendance (refer to Article 49) those hours will be credited for the accrual of your compensated time.
Usage:
You may use the following at any time during the calendar year: Accrued Compensated Time-off, Banked Compensated Time-off, and Accrued Compensated Time-off you anticipate for that year. Compensated Time-off will be at the convenience of the Company.

26
Payment:
You will receive payment for compensated time off at your current base hourly wage rate.
In the event you separate employment from BIW, you will be paid for all your unused Accrued Compensated Time-Off and Banked Compensated Time-Off at your regular base rate. Any Compensated Time-Off taken in excess of your Accrued Compensated Time-Off and Banked Compensated Time-Off will be deducted from your final paycheck.

Article 20 WELLNESS BENEFIT
The Wellness Program provides reimbursement for two categories of wellness items: physical fitness services and medical!preventive services.
The Company will reimburse you and your spouse up to a combined total of $125 per year, subject to required Federal and State tax withholdings, upon the submittal of a Wellness Benefit Request form accompanied with a paid invoice to the BIW Benefits Department for approved wellness program(s). Refer to the Wellness Program Reimbursement Guidelines for detailed instructions. The Guidelines and Wellness Benefit Request form may be obtained at the BIW Benefits Department.
In addition to the reimbursement program described above, effective January 1,2001, BIW will establish a more comprehensive program that will offer employees and their spouses a variety of programs to improve their health. These programs will be run by outside organizations and will respect employee privacy and personal choice.
Article 21 EMPLOYEES’ BENEFIT PROGRAM
Your Benefits Program consists of plans that provide you financial security and policies that provide you paid time-off away from work.
Health and welfare plans include healthcare, accident and sickness (A&S) insurance, basic life insurance, supplemental life insurance (effective January 1,2001), vision care (effective January 1,2001), and business travel accident insurance. Retirement plans include pensions and 40l(k). All of these plans require you to be a full-time employee. All of the health and welfare plans require you to complete a probationary period of360 hours from date of hire before you can participate. For the I AM Pension Plan, that eligibility period is 60 calendar days from date of hire. The 401(k) plan does not have a service requirement for eligibility. BIW pays the full cost of your pensions, A&S insurance, basic life insurance and business travel accident insurance, and pays most of the cost of your healthcare. BIW also matches a portion of your contributions to your 40l(k) account. These plans are ERISA plans and their terms and conditions are governed by plan documents and!or insurance contracts, all of which are available through the BIW Benefits Department. Therefore, the language contained in this Agreement for these plans isjntended to represent only highlights of the plans. You will receive a summary plan description for each of these plans which will give you further information in addition to these highlights.
In addition to the ERISA plans above, BIW sponsors a wellness program and on or before January 1,2001, will offer a program where you can obtain insurance for personal property.
Policies that provide you paid time-off away from work include compensated time-off, bereavement, jury! military {witness pay, and holidays.
30
Additionally, LS6 sponsors a dental plan, a long-term disability plan, and an A&S plan which, supplements the A&S that BIW sponsors for you. Each of these plans requires you to make contributions if you choose to participate in them. The language contained in this Agreement is limited to the terms and conditions that BIW and LS6 have agreed to so that if you elect to participate in them, your contributions to these plans will be deducted from your pay check. To the extent permitted by law, effective the first paycheck in 2001, your contributions for the dental plan will be deducted from your paycheck on a pre-tax basis. Your contributions for the supplemental A&S and long-term disability will be deducted on a post-tax basis. For information on the benefit provisions of these plans, contact the LS6 Union Hall.
HEALTHCARE PROGRAM
For eligible employees, the Healthcare Program that was in effect on August 27,2000 will be restarted on the effective date of this Agreement and run through December 31, 2000, including but not limited to employee contributory premiums and plan co-payments. Effective January 1, 2001, there will be several changes to the Program. The highlights of this new Program are described below.
Choice:
Effective January 1,2001, you will be eligible for BIW’s Healthcare Program once you have completed a period of 6 months from your date of hire. You may choose between three healthcare options. The three options include:
•	Premier Health Maintenance Organization (Premier HMO)
•	Premier Plus Health Maintenance Organization (Premier Plus HMO)
•	Point of Service (POS)
All three options cover doctor visits, hospitalization, surgery, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, routine physical exams, child immunizations and check-ups, mammograms, routine eye exams, and other services. The options differ in the amount you must contribute from your weekly paycheck and the amounts you pay when you obtain services.
' With the Premier HMO option or the Premier Plus HMO Option, you and your covered family members each select a participating Primary Care Physician (PCP) who oversees your medical care. To be eligible for most covered services under the Premier or Premier Plus HMO options, you must choose a PCP who will coordinate your care by treating you or referring you to specialty services. With the exception of a few services, the only way you're covered is if you seek care through your PCP.
The POS option offers different levels ofcoverage depending upon whether you or a covered family member receive care through a medical care network with authorization of your participating Primary Care Physician (PCP) or receive care that has not been authorized by your participating PCP. It offers flexibility in receiving health care for yourself and your covered family members. You usually have the choice of going outside the network for any care you need.
31
You will receive a booklet for the healthcare option you participate in that provides a detailed description of that option including eligibility and enrollment information, covered services, co-payment and co-insurances, when coverage ends, continuation ofcoverage and conversion information, and the member satisfaction process.
Other options may be available to you if your primary residence is outside the Network Area.
Enrolling in ike Healthcare Program:
Once you have completed your 6 month eligibility period, you must have medical coverage through BIW, unless you are covered under another healthcare plan (such as your spouse's employer) and complete, sign and return a "Waiver of Coverage" form during the annual open enrollment process by the due date specified. If you are not waiving coverage as specified in the previous sentence, you will automatically be enrolled in the Program as specified below.
Choosing Your Healthcare Option and Coverage Level:
You will be able to choose the healthcare option you want to participate in and your coverage level each year through the annual open enrollment process. If you and your spouse are both employed by BIW, then one of you must choose a healthcare option and cover the other as a dependent.
During the Fall 2000, an open enrollment package consisting of information that will be helpful for you to make your choice effective January 1,2001 will be provided to you. Because the Healthcare Program has changed, you must enroll for 2001 by completing, signing and returning the appropriate enrollment forms by the due date specified. If you do not complete, sign, and return the appropriate enrollment forms by the due date specified, you will automatically be enrolled in the Premier HMO at the same coverage level you have as of December 31,2000, and you will not be eligible for the non-smoking discount.
Subsequent annual enrollments beginning with the Fall 2001 (effective January 1,2002) will also provide you the opportunity to change your healthcare option or coverage level, and to register for the non-smoking discount. If you do not complete, sign, and return the appropriate enrollment forms by the due date specified, you will automatically be re-enrolled in the same option and at the same coverage level you had as of the last day of that calendar year, and you will not be eligible for the non-smoking discount.
Contributory Premiums for Employees:
Although BIW pays the majority of the cost of the Healthcare Program, you share in the cost through your employee contributions which are deducted from your paycheck. To the extent permitted by law, these contributions will be deducted before taxes are withheld. If you are not receiving a paycheck, (for example, certain leave of absences) you will be responsible to make payment within fourteen calendar days from the time the deductions would have been made from your paycheck.
32
The amount of your contribution will depend on the healthcare option and coverage level you select, and whether you or your covered family members are non-smokers and have signed up for the non-smoking discounts for that calendar year. Your spouse and unmarried children under the age of 21 (age 25 if full-time student) are eligible dependents that you may enroll in the Program. Also, children who are totally disabled at the time that they would no longer be eligible for healthcare coverage because of the age limits, may be eligible for continued coverage under the Program. Weekly contributions for each coverage level for each healthcare option are shown in the last part of the section that explains that particular option.
Additionally, non-student, unmarried children who were enrolled as "Plus-19” as of December 31,2000, and are age 21 but not yet age 23 as of December 31,2000 may continue to be enrolled as a "Plus-19" until they reach age 23 by paying a cost of one-half the single subscriber rate in addition to weekly contributory premiums. Thereafter, "Plus-19" coverage will not be available.
Eligibility for Non-Smoking Discount:
The Open Enrollment forms you receive each year will provide you with an opportunity to declare your eligibility for the non-smoking discount.
You are eligible for the non-smoking discount if: 1) you and your covered dependents have not used tobacco products more than 3 times in the month before you complete the application, 2) you are committed to remaining smoke-free, and 3) you declare yourself and your dependents non-smokers.
If you do not complete, sign and return the appropriate form by the due date specified, you will not be eligible to receive the non-smoking discount for that entire year.
Premier HMO:
The Premier HMO option provides comprehensive coverage for most medically necessary services at 100% after a co-payment fee. Listed below is a summary of some co-payment fees for commonly used services:
PCP Office Visit Specialist Office Visit Physical Therapy Office Visit Chiropractic Office Visit Emergency Room Urgent Care Facility Inpatient Hospital Stay Outpatient Surgical Facility Prescription Drugs	$15 $15 $15 $15 $50 $25 $200 $100 $10/$20/$35 (generic!preferred!non-preferred)

Point of Service (POS):
In-Network Coverage:
The In-Network coverage level available through the POS option is very similar to the Premier Plus HMO option. Medically necessary care that your PCP oversees and arranges for through a network of specialists, hospitals, and other healthcare providers, is covered at the In-Network level.
Most forms of outpatient care managed and authorized by your PCP will be paid at 100% after a $10 co-payment. Prescription drugs are covered at 100% after a $10 copayment fee for generic drugs, a $15 co-payment for preferred drugs and a $30 co-payment for non-preferred drugs. Emergency room visits for life- or limb-threatening care are covered In-Network at 100% after a $25 co-payment fee. As long as your PCP makes arrangements for any hospitalization, inpatient care is covered at 90%, and your coinsurance is 10% with a calendar year maximum of $1,000.
Out-of-Network Coverage:
Medically necessary care that your PCP does not authorize or that is received through non-participating physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers is covered at the Out-of-Network level.

Employee Only:
Employee Plus Spouse:
Employee Plus (Child(ren):
Employee and Family:
$ 50 $100 $100 $150
This is a special account where the money in the account may be used on a taxfree basis for almost any un-reimbursed expense related to medical, dental, or vision coverage for you, your spouse, or your dependents. For example, you can use the money to be reimbursed for co-payments under an established plan (like the BIW healthcare program, or the LS6-sponsored union dental plan, or a plan through your spouse’s employer), or for out-of-pocket expenses you have if you are not covered under an established plan. Contributions you make as a requirement to participate in a benefits plan, like payroll deductions for healthcare or dental coverage, are not eligible. Any money remaining in your account by the end of the year will be forfeited.
Effective January 1,2002 and each year thereafter, BIW will no longer fund the account. However, effective the first paycheck of the 2002 calendar year and each subsequent calendar year, BIW will allow all employees to establish their own account by setting aside a portion of their wages on a pre-tax basis, through an annual open enrollment process conducted each Fall preceding the calendar year. If you elect to participate in this account, you must indicate so during the open enrollment and decide how much to contribute during that year. The minimum contribution is $100 and the maximum is $5,000.
To make sure you put the right amount of money in your account during open enrollment, you need to estimate your expenses for the next year. If you put more money into the account than you have expenses for, any money remaining in your account by the end of the year will be forfeited. See the BIW Benefits Department for a complete list of eligible and ineligible expenses.
You can only make changes outside of the open enrollment process during the year under certain rules. For those rules, see the "Changes During The Year" section under the Healthcare Program.

Article 42 SKILL AND ABILITY
Skill and Ability:
It is not the intention of BIW Management to utilize skill and ability for other than necessary business needs. Skill and ability will be handled on a need basis. Management will determine what skills are needed for an assignment and notify the Chief Steward in writing prior to assigning an employee with the skill and ability to accomplish the job. This notice shall identify:
•	Which employees are being selected by management for a skill and ability assignment.

Article 44 MANNING/DEMANNING
Manning/Demanning Facilities:
Assignments between the Main Plant, Portland, EBMF, Harding Plant, and Consolidated Warehouse (which includes Maine Yankee and Bissons) will be as follows:
•	Volunteers by seniority by classification (most senior).
•	Assignment by seniority by classification (least senior).
Assignments to fill an absence from work are considered temporary. The absent employee maintains the position upon return providing the facility has not been demanned beyond his seniority date.
Assignment for three (3) days or less at offsite facilities is considered temporary (except Portland). Temporary assignments for longer than three (3) days in duration require utilization of the joint agreement process in Article 39. Temporary employees will be demanned first regardless of their classification seniority. This policy also applies to facilities work that needs to be supported by the Maintenance Department from Bath.
In identifying volunteers for assignment to all facilities, standing lists will be used as follows:
•	Employees may add their name to, or remove their name from, the facility volunteer list at anytime prior to the assignment. An employee adding their name to the facility volunteer list may not displace an employee who has already been advised of their assignment to a facility. Facility assignments will not be made on shift preference.
54
•	Shift assignments may be made prior to sending people between facilities by utilizing a separate standing list, provided both groups (volunteers and assignees) are treated as one group.
Travel Allowance:
Either travel mileage allowance from the BIW Main Plant in Bath or Company transportation to the Portland Facility will be provided for up to two days, in the event four full days notice cannot be provided. For dual assignments where four days notice was not provided, travel mileage allowance will be paid for actual days assigned (maximum two days).
Article 45
SUPER SENIORITY
Super seniority will be granted to all shop stewards within classification. The President, Vice President, three (3) Chief Stewards, and three (3) Grievance Committees will have top seniority in the yard.

Article 46 NEW TECHNOLOGY
Purpose:
We recognize that significant changes to our present manner of producing ships are required for us to become globally competitive and ensure jobs for our people at BIW. Together, through the Joint Agreement Process, we must seek out new technology in order to achieve maximum efficiency and the preservation of jobs. As we find better ways to accomplish our work, we will train the people affected so we can build ships more efficiently and broaden our horizons for the future.
Definitions:
New technology shall be defined as technologies not previously utilized at BIW that are significant modifications in the manner that BIW manufactures!maintains its products!property where the outcome would directly result in staffing reductions. Such modification may involve new or changed processes, equipment, machines, and facilities.
Commitment/Trainins:
* ■*
We are committed to seeking out new technologies to achieve maximum efficiency in the interest of remaining competitive and preserving jobs for the long term. When the Company anticipates that new technologies may have an impact on the work performed by Union represented employees, the Company will, as early as possible, so advise the Union, and at the time describe the location and nature of such technological changes and the extent to which they may affect the work performed by represented employees. In the event it becomes necessary to train you to qualify for new technology or other available jobs, BIW will institute the necessary programs.
Technological Change Procedure:
The Joint Agreement Process will apply to new technologies and must be worked through in a timely manner prior to making a technological change taking into consideration lower overall cost, increased quality, increased capacity, improved safety, improved competitive position, increased capability to build, reduced risk, support customers' desires/demands, strategic significance and a plan to deal with impacted employees. If an agreement cannot be reached within ten (10) days after notice of intention of technological change, the Company may implement its decision, which may be subject to the accelerated arbitration process in Article 24. The arbitrator will be obligated to hand down a decision taking into consideration the technological change procedure and also the good faith efforts of either party to reach resolution under the Joint Agreement Process in Article 39.
Issues that pertain to this article that are significant will be reviewed by the President of Local S6 or his designee.
