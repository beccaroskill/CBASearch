ADDENDUM A - JOB BIDDING
LOCAL 483, IBEW
WATER POLLUTION CONTROL UNIT
Sr. Operator, Operator Position Seniority Bidding Procedure
This Addendum will attempt to give employees, by seniority, a chance to work at the plant and shift they prefer and will enable management to operate the plants efficiently with as little disruption as possible. This Addendum is intended to bid for positions and not for tasks or job assignments within positions.
Management has the right to add or delete positions within this policy due to changes in the plant system or staff levels so as to properly manage the division. For example, at Plant 3, positions were added and deleted in the past for a change of staff levels. The new upgrade at Plant 3 may create some staff level changes.
1.	A seniority list will be established for the Senior Operator and Operator.
2.	The seniority list will be established on the basis of time spent in the City service while on a permanent appointment within a classification, less any time off work in a non-paid status. Time off non-paid status for voluntary Leave Without will not be included as a deduction to determine seniority.
3.	Bidding on the positions will be in order of the most senior person first on a yearly basis unless so noted below.
4.	Permanent vacancies in a position will be offered to the next senior person on the bid sheet who bid for that position. If no one who bid for that position wants the open position then the least senior person will be assigned the vacant position.
5.	Some positions may be complex and require extensive training for the Senior Operator and Operator to become proficient. In sucii cases these positions will be restricted or not be biddable because of the lost time and efficiency. The present positions under this rule are:
A.	Senior operator in computer area This is a highly skilled job with training in a specific area. This position is not biddable and if the person in this position wishes to bid another position, the person needs to give a year's notice in writing on the bid sheet so training can start with the replacement. If a vacancy should occur, the position shall be filled following the normal bidding procedure. (Refer to #4 above.)
B.	Operator in the computer area. This position is a restricted bid and does not have the level of training the Senior Operator does in this area. Because it takes so long to become proficient in this area, there are bidding restrictions on this position. Persons bidding on this posfljon need to bid one year in advance and stay at least two years in the position. Persons in this position also need to give a year's notice, in writing on the bid sheet, to bid for another position. If qualified people have bid for this position and the incumbent wants to leave, a year's notice may not be necessary.
483 WPC - 2018-2019.FINAL
Page 32
6.	Bidding will be done on a yearly basis. Bid sheets will be distributed to all employees in early November for the next year's bidding. Bid sheets will be due 15 days after distribution and the next year's schedule will be posted by the first week in December. If a person does not turn in their bid sheet within the 15 days, they will be given whatever position is left after the regular bidding is assigned.
7.	Layoff of workers covered under this agreement shall be as provided in Section 1.24.900 of the City of Tacoma Personnel Rules.

ADDENDUM B- OPERATIONS OVERTIME PROCEDURE
LOCAL 483, IBEW
WATER POLLUTION CONTROL UNIT
Operations Overtime Procedure
The City of Tacoma's Treatment Plant Operators, who are members of L ocal 483, IBEW have developed this Overtime Procedure together with Sewer Utility Operations Division management and agree to its adoption and implementation.
1.	Overtime shall be allocated first to those employees working within the specific work section in which the overtime occurs. The specific work sections are defined as follows:
Treatment Plant #1 Shift Operations
Treatment Plant Laboratory
Facility Services
Treatment Plant #3
All employees shall have a designated work section assignment, chosen by the annual bid process.
2.	An Overtime Callout List will be maintained on the Treatment Plant #1 network by the Operations Supervisor. This list will be ranked by number of overtime hours worked with the smallest number having the highest ranking. In the event that two or more individuals have the same number of hours, seniority will be the determining factor. No distinction will be made between hours worked at time-and-one-half and those worked at double-time rate. Scheduled holiday overtime and overtime accrued for education and training will not be included in this total.
Whenever possible, overtime, excluding scheduled holiday overtime and overtime accrued for education and training will not be included in this total, shall be offered to those employees with the lowest total hours overtime worked, according to the most recent Overtime Callout List. Documentation of actual and attempted offers to work overtime wiH be maintained.
3.	During shift operations, when unscheduled overtime is necessary, the in-place Senior Operator or applicable Operator may remain on overtime duty until their replacement arrives, such duty not to exceed sixteen total hours without approval.
4.	Any Operator involved in a special task may remain on duty until the completion of such task, at the discretion of the applicable Senior Operator. A Senior Operator in like circumstances may remain on duty at the discretion of the Operations Supervisor.
5.	In the last four hours of an operations shift, that is an A Shift, B Shift or Relief Shift, when replacement personnel are required, an attempt will be made to contact the applicable Operators or Senior Operator of the oncoming shift prior to using the Overtime Callout List.
483 WPC - 2018-2019 FINAL
Page 36
Addendum C
2010 Wage Adjustments
Page 37
6.	A 'B Shift' Senior Operator leaving duty before the completion of the shift may decide, at his or her discretion, to call in another Senior Operator or upgrade a qualified on-duty Operator.
7.	Relief Operators, when working outside their designated work section in replacement of routinely scheduled relief status, shall be afforded the same overtime consideration as their counterparts within the work section to which they have been temporarily assigned.
Unscheduled relief assignments will be based on the Overtime Callout List with exceptions as determined necessary by the Operations Supervisor.
8.	At Treatment Plant #3, the Senior Operator and the Operators will be in the same overtime pool.
9.	Treatment Plant Step 3 OIT’s will qualify tor Operator overtime, only if no Operators are available.
The Labor/Management Committee will review the performance of this procedure and make recommendations for changes and updates periodically.
In the case of a difference of interpretation of this policy, the Committee should be used as a forum to resolve the difference. The purpose of the Committee is not to give a stamp of approval or disapproval, but to attempt to settle differences without using the Grievance Procedure.
In the case where the wrong person is called out and works overtime, the person (one only) who should have been called will be given an overtime opportunity equal to the time missed. This overtime opportunity shall be created for the purpose of settling the missed call out and shall not harm another member.

Letter of Understanding
By and Between The City of Tacoma and Local 483 IBEW Water Pollution Unit
Subject: Shift Operator Vacation Leave on Holidays
In the interest of clarifying procedures and meeting the needs of the employees and the City, the following understanding is reached regarding Shift Operators scheduling of vacation leave for holidays:
When a Shift Operator or Shift Senior Operator is scheduled to work on a City recognized holiday and he/she would like to request accrued time off for that holiday, the employee shall make his/her request for the holiday off as early in the year as possible, but in no case later than four (4) weeks prior to the holiday in question.
The Shift Operator or Shift Senior Operator must make a good faith effort to find a qualified volunteer replacement from among employees in the relief Operator pool. Absent a volunteer, the relief Operator/Senior Operator with the lowest seniority amount of those relief Operators available will be assigned to work the holiday.
Nothing in this document abrogates management’s right to disapprove vacation leave. Any grievances arising out of the procedure will be denied.
This Letter of Understanding may be terminated by mutual agreement of the Union or the City, or unilaterally by either party with written thirty (30) day notice to the other party. Otherwise this Letter of Agreement will expire with the adoption of a successor collective bargaining agreement. It is not to be used as a precedent with respect to any other contracts for any other Sections or Divisions in any Department represented by this Union or other employees employed by the City of Tacoma and represented by any other Union. .
