Section 3.2
An employee may consent in writing to the authorization of the deduction of dues from his/her wages and to the designation of MOSES as the recipient thereof. Such consent shall be in a form acceptable to the Employer, and shall bear the signature of the employee. An employee may withdraw his/her MOSES dues check-off authorization by giving at least sixty days notice in writing to his/her department head, and by filing a copy thereof with the Treasurer of MOSES.

6
Section 3.4
The Employer shall deduct dues or an agency fee from the pay of employees who request such deduction in accordance with this Article and transmit such funds in accordance with Departmental policy as of July 1, 1976 to the Treasurer of MOSES together with a list of employees whose dues or agency fees are transmitted provided that the State Treasurer is satisfied by such evidence that he may require that the Treasurer of MOSES has given to MOSES a bond, in a form approved by the Commissioner of the Department of Revenue, for the faithful performance of his/her duties, in a sum and with such surety or securities as are satisfactory to the State Treasurer.
ARTICLE 4 AGENCY FEE
Section 4.1
Each employee who elects not to join or maintain membership in MOSES shall be required to pay as a condition of employment, beginning thirty days following the commencement of his/her employment or the execution of this Agreement, whichever is later, an agency service fee to MOSES in an amount not to exceed the amount of periodic dues paid by employees who are members of MOSES.
Employees electing to pay an agency service fee shall receive a year-end rebate from MOSES. Said rebate shall consist of the percentage of the agency service fee paid which is equal to the percentage of total annual revenue expended for the following activities:
(1)	contributions to political candidates or political committees formed for a candidate or political party;
(2)	publicizing of an organizational preference for a candidate for political office;
(3)	efforts to enact, defeat, repeal or amend legislation unrelated to wages, hours, standards of productivity and performance, and other terms and conditions of employment, and the welfare or the working environment of employees represented by the exclusive bargaining agent or its affiliates;
(4)	contributions to charitable, religious or ideological causes not germane to its duties as the exclusive bargaining agent;
(5)	benefits which are not germane to the governance or duties as bargaining agent and available only to the members of the employee organization.
MOSES will pay for an independent audit which will include verification of the aforementioned expenses on an annual basis.	If an employee challenges the
7
computation of the rebate, MOSES agrees to submit the issue to an arbitrator chosen through the American Arbitration Association’s mutual selection process.
Section 4.2
This Article shall not become operative as to employees in any statewide bargaining unit certified to MOSES until this Agreement has been formally executed, pursuant to a vote of a majority of all employees in that bargaining unit present and voting.
Section 4.3
MOSES shall reimburse the Employer for any expenses incurred as a result of being ordered to reinstate an employee terminated at the request of MOSES for not paying the agency service fee. MOSES will intervene in and defend any administrative or court litigation concerning the propriety of such termination for failure to pay the agency service fee. In such litigation the Employer shall have no obligation to defend the termination.
Section 4.4
Disputes between the parties concerning this Article shall be resolved in accordance with the grievance procedure contained in this Agreement. In the event such a dispute is submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to order the Employer to pay such agency service fee on behalf of any employee. If the arbitrator decides that an employee has failed to pay or authorize the payment of the agency service fee in accordance with this Article the only remedy shall be the termination of the employment of such employee if the employee continues to refuse to pay or authorize payment of the required agency service fee after having sufficient time to do so.
Section 4.5
Neither the Commonwealth nor MOSES shall discriminate against an employee on the basis of membership, non-membership or agency service fee status in the employee organization or its affiliates.
Employees electing to pay an agency service fee will be provided with the same representation as union members under the Unit 9 Collective Bargaining Agreement. Accordingly, MOSES may not refuse to process a grievance based on an employee’s non-membership in the union. Non-members are also eligible for the same dental and vision coverage as union members under the Health and Welfare Trust Fund outlined in Article 13B.

Section 6.2
MOSES and the Employer agree that when the effects of employment practices, regardless of their intent, discriminate against any group of people on the basis of race, religion, age, sex, national origin, mental or physical handicap, specific positive and aggressive measures must be taken to redress the effects of past discrimination, to eliminate present and future discrimination and to ensure equal opportunity in the areas of hiring, upgrading, demotion or transfer, recruitment, layoff or termination, rate of compensation, and in-service or apprenticeship training programs. Therefore the parties acknowledge the need for positive and aggressive affirmative action.
13
Section 6.3
The Statewide MOSES/Management Committee established pursuant to Article 26 shall give priority to the area of affirmative action. The Committee shall review affirmative action programs and shall devote its best efforts to alleviating any obstacles that are found to exist to the implementation of the policy and commitments contained in the Governor's Executive Order No. 227 dated February 25, 1983 or as subsequently amended.

The term sexual harassment as used herein is conduct such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which constitutes sexual harassment when:

ARTICLE 7
14
WORKWEEK AND WORK SCHEDULES
Section 7.l	Scheduled Hours, Workweek, Workday
A.	Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, the regular hours of work for full-time employees shall be thirty-seven and one-half hours per week excluding meal periods or forty hours per week excluding meal periods, as has been established for that job title at the particular job location. Any employee whose regular workweek has averaged more than forty hours excluding meal periods in the past shall have a forty-hour workweek.
B.	The work schedule, both starting times and quitting times, of employees shall be posted on a bulletin board at each work location or otherwise made available to employees and MOSES stewards.
C.	When the Employer desires to change the work schedule of an employee he shall give the affected employee at least ten days' written notice of such contemplated change, except in cases of emergency involving the protection of the property of the Commonwealth or involving the health and safety of those persons whose care and/or custody have been entrusted to the Commonwealth. However, a declaration of emergency shall not be used for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime.
D.	To the extent practicable, the normal workweek shall consist of five consecutive days, Monday through Friday, with the regular hours of work each day to be consecutive except for meal periods. Similarly, to the extent practicable employees in continuous operations shall receive two consecutive days off in each seven-day period. This subsection should not apply to employees in authorized flexible hours programs.
E.	The parties acknowledge the benefit of establishing alternative work schedules, including but not limited to flexible hours, staggered hours, part-time and job sharing where such programs contribute to the efficient delivery of state services. The MOSES/Management Committee established pursuant to Article 26 of this Agreement shall meet to determine the feasibility of establishing such options where they do not currently exist, to monitor existing programs, and to recommend changes where appropriate. Upon the written request of either party, MOSES shall meet with local and central office representatives relative to developing and implementing flex-time/alternative-work schedules where feasible for an individual worksite/facility or for the department/agency. Following said meetings where there continues to be any unresolved issues the areas of dispute may be brought at the request of either party to the Human Resources Division to work toward a possible resolution. All agreements reached pursuant to the above paragraph shall be submitted to MOSES and the Human Resources Division for approval.
15
Section 7.2
Overtime
A.	Overtime shall be voluntary except in an emergency. There shall be no discrimination or discipline taken against any employee who declines to work overtime in a non-emergency situation.
B.	An employee shall be compensated at the rate of time and one half his/her regular rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of forty hours per week. A part-time employee shall be compensated at the rate of time and one half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of eight (8.0) hours in his/her regular workday except that a part-time employee whose regular workday is more than eight (8.0) hours shall be compensated at the rate of time and one-half his/her regular rate of pay for authorized overtime work performed in excess of his/her regular workday.
C.	An employee whose regular workweek is less than forty hours shall be compensated at his/her regular rate for authorized overtime work performed up to forty hours per week that is in excess of his/her regular workweek.
D.	The Employer shall not, for the purpose of avoiding the payment of overtime, curtail the scheduled hours of an employee during the remainder of a workweek in which the employee has previously worked hours beyond his/her normally scheduled workday. This paragraph shall not apply to employees who, because of the nature of the duties of their positions, work an irregular workday, nor shall it apply to employees who have been permitted by the Employer to participate in an approved voluntary flexible hours program that has been duly authorized by the appointing authority and by the Personnel Administrator.
Where operations such as hazardous waste spill cleanup, medical emergency, safety control, bituminous concrete placement, cement concrete placement, steel erection or other critical operations that require continuous monitoring requiring an employee to work through his/her lunch period, he/she shall be granted compensatory time at the rate of one and one-half his/her regular hourly rate of pay for the lunch period work.
E.	With the exception of paid sick leave, all time for which an employee is on full pay status shall be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime compensation. However, paid sick leave used by an employee during the same work week in which he/she is required to work overtime because of an emergency shall be considered time worked for the purpose of calculating overtime compensation for that work week, provided that nothing herein shall interfere with the Employer’s right to request satisfactory medical evidence under the terms of Article 8, Section 8.1(K).
16
F.	There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of the premium pay for overtime work provided for in this Agreement.
G.	The Employer shall make every effort to send out checks for overtime no later than the second payroll period following the payroll period of the overtime worked.
H.	Overtime shall be distributed as equitably and impartially as practicable among persons in each work location who ordinarily perform such related work in the normal course of their workweek to meet the operational needs of each department/agency at each work location. Department heads and MOSES representatives at each location shall work out procedures for implementing this policy of distributing overtime work.
I.	The provisions of this Section shall not apply to employees on full travel status to the extent permitted by law.
J.	Upon the request of an employee, an appointing authority may grant at its discretion compensatory time in lieu of payment for overtime at a rate not less than one and one-half hours for each hour of employment for which overtime compensation would be required under this Article. Such compensatory time shall not be accumulated in excess of one hundred and twenty hours and may be used in one half-hour increments. An appointing authority shall permit the use of compensatory time at the employee's request, provided the use of compensatory time does not unduly disrupt the operation of a department or agency. Upon termination an employee shall be paid for all unused compensatory time at the final regular rate of pay.
Section 7.3	Regular Meal Periods
A meal period shall be scheduled as close to the middle of the shift as possible considering the needs of the department/agency and the needs of the employee.
Section 7.4	Rest Periods
Employees may be granted a rest period of up to fifteen minutes per workday, except that employees who have received more frequent rest periods as a matter of past contract or practice shall continue during the term of this contract to enjoy the same rest period benefits so received in the past.
Section 7.5
Call Back Pay
17
An employee who has left his/her place of employment after having completed work on his/her regular shift and is called back to a work place prior to the commencement of his/her next scheduled shift shall receive a minimum of four hours pay at his/her regular hourly overtime rate. This Section shall not apply to an employee who is called in to start his/her shift early and who continues to work that shift.
An employee who is called back to work as outlined above but is not called back to a work place shall receive a minimum of two hours pay at his/her regular overtime rate. For the purpose of this Section, a "work place" is defined as any place other than the employee's home to which he/she is required to report to fulfill the assignment.
Section 7.6	Stand-by Duty
A.	An employee who is required by the department head to leave instructions as to where he/she may be reached in order to report to work when necessary shall be reimbursed at a rate of ten dollars pay for such period.
B.	The stand-by period shall be fifteen hours in duration for any night standby duty including Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, and shall be nine hours in duration for any daytime stand-by duty including Saturday, Sunday or holiday.
C.	Stand-by duty shall mean that a department head has ordered any employee to be immediately available for duty upon receipt of a message to report to work. If any employee assigned to stand-by duty is not available to report to duty when called, no stand-by pay shall be paid to the employee for the period.
D.	Should a department head require coverage of a work location on a 24-hour basis, such department head will establish a list of employees to be available for duty. The least senior employee in the work location shall be first on the list. Having once been put on stand-by duty, the next junior employee will be placed on stand-by duty, etc. With the approval of the department, employees may substitute for one another under this Section.
E.	Stand-by duty shall be voluntary except in the case of an emergency. There shall be no discrimination or discipline taken against any employee who declines stand-by in a non-emergency situation. Should no volunteer be available and the department head determines that an emergency exists, the department head will assign an employee to such stand-by duty.
F.	When the practice has been for the Employer to provide the employees on stand-by with a beeper, this practice shall continue.
Section 7.7	Shift Differential
18
A.	Employees rendering service on a regular basis whose regular workday is on a second or third shift as defined in Paragraph C shall receive a shift differential of $0.75 per hour.
B.	The above shift differential shall be paid in addition to regular salary for employees when their entire workday is on a second or third shift or when the employee works any portion of a second or third shift replacing a worker who normally works such second or third shift. The overtime rate for employees who are entitled to a shift differential shall be computed based on the following method: the regular hourly salary rate plus the hourly shift differential times one and one-half equals the overtime rate.
C.	For the purposes of this Section only, a second shift shall be one that commences at 1:00 P.M. or after and ends not later than 2:00 A.M. and a third shift shall be one that commences at 9:00 P.M. or after and ends not later than 9:00 A.M.
ARTICLE 8 LEAVE
Section 8.1 Sick Leave
A.	A full-time employee shall accumulate sick leave with pay credits at the following rate for each full calendar month of employment:
Scheduled Hours per Week	Sick Leave Hours Accrued/Month
37.5 Hours per Week	9.375 Hours
40.0 Hours per Week	10.000 Hours
An employee on any leave with pay or industrial accident leave shall accumulate sick leave credits.
B.	A regular part-time employee shall be granted sick leave credit in the same
proportion that his/her part-time service bears to full-time service.
C.	Sick leave shall be granted, at the discretion of the appointing authority, to an employee only under the following conditions:
1.	When an employee cannot perform his/her duties because he or she is incapacitated by personal illness or injury;
2.	An employee may use up to a maximum of thirty (30) days per calendar year for the purposes of:
19

b.	family leave due to the birth, adoption or placement of a child, to be concluded within twelve (12) months of the date of the birth, adoption or placement. Employees utilizing sick leave under this section shall not be required to submit a medical certification, unless the appointing authority has reason to believe that the birth, adoption or placement claim was not genuine. This leave benefit shall be in addition to the ten (10) days of paid leave set forth in section 8.7.A.7. Of the thirty (30) days per calendar year provided herein, an employee may use a maximum of ten (10) days per calendar year to attend to necessary preparations and legal requirements related to the employee’s adoption of a child.
3.	An employee shall be entitled to use up to ten (10) days per calendar year for necessary preparations and/or legal proceedings related to foster care of DSS children, such as foster care reviews, court hearings and MAPS training for pre-adoptive parents. HRD may approve a waiver of the ten (10) day limit if needed for difficult placements. In addition, an employee may use the one-day per month of paid leave available to employees for volunteer work under the Commonwealth’s School Volunteer or Mentoring programs for the above cited foster care activities.
4.	When through exposure to contagious disease, the presence of the employee at his/her work location would jeopardize the health of others; and
5.	When appointments with licensed medical or dental professionals cannot reasonably be scheduled outside of normal working hours for purposes of medical treatment or diagnosis of an existing medical or dental condition.
D.	A full-time employee shall not accrue sick leave credit for any month in which he/she was on leave without pay or absent without pay for a total of more than one day.
E.	Upon return to work following a sick leave in excess of five consecutive workdays, an employee may be required to undergo a medical examination to determine his/her fitness for work. The employee, if he/she so desires, may be represented by a physician of his/her choice.
F.	Sick leave must be charged against unused sick leave credits in units of one-half hour or full hours, but in no event may the sick leave credits used be less than the actual time off.
20
G.	Any employee having no sick leave credits, who is absent due to illness, may be placed at the discretion of the appointing authority on vacation leave or leave without pay. Such leave shall be charged on the same basis as provided in subsection (F).
H.	An employee who is reinstated or reemployed after an absence of less than three years shall be credited with his/her sick leave credits at the termination of his/her prior employment. An employee who is reinstated or reemployed after a period of three years or more shall receive prior sick leave credits, if approved by the Personnel Administrator, where such absence was caused by:
(1)	Illness of said employee;
(2)	Dismissal through no fault or delinquency attributable solely to said employee; or,
(3)	Injury while in the employment of the Commonwealth in the line of duty, and for which said employee would be entitled to receive Worker's Compensation benefits.
I.	A regular part-time employee shall not accrue sick leave credit for any month in which he/she was on leave without pay or absent without pay in the same proportion that his/her service bears to one day of service of a full-time employee.
J.	Employees requesting sick leave under this Article must notify the designated representative of the Appointing Authority at least one (1) hour before the start of his/her work shift on each day of absence. In single shift agencies, employees requesting sick leave under this Article must notify the designated representative not later than fifteen (15) minutes after the start of work on each day of absence. Repeated violations of these procedures may result in denial of sick leave. Such notice must include the general nature of the disability and the estimated period of time for which the employee will be absent. Where circumstances warrant, the Appointing Authority or designee shall reasonably excuse the employee from such daily notification.
K.	Where the Appointing Authority has reason to believe that sick leave is being abused, the Appointing Authority may require satisfactory medical evidence from the employee. This request shall be reduced to writing and shall cite specific reasons for the request. When medical evidence is requested, such request shall be made as promptly as possible. To the extent possible, the employee shall receive prior notice that the Appointing Authority believes s/he is abusing sick leave and that s/he may be required to produce medical evidence for future use of sick leave.
In order to clarify existing practice, satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by a licensed Physician, Physician’s Assistant, Nurse Practitioner, Chiropractor, or Dentist that he/she has personally examined the employee and shall contain the nature of the illness or injury, unless identified as being of a confidential nature; a statement that the employee was unable to perform his or her duties due to the specific illness or injury on the days in question; and a prognosis for the employee’s return to work. In cases where the employee is absent due to a family
21
or household illness or injury, as defined in Section 1(C)2 of this Article, satisfactory medical evidence shall consist of a signed statement by medical personnel mentioned above indicating that the person in question has been determined to be seriously ill and needing care on the days in question. A medical statement provided pursuant to this Article shall be on the letterhead of the attending physician or medical provider as mentioned above, and shall list an address and telephone number. Failure to produce such evidence within seven (7) days of its request may result, at the discretion of the Appointing Authority, in denial of sick leave for the period of absence.
L.	In extraordinary circumstances, where the Appointing Authority, or the designated person in charge if the Appointing Authority is unavailable, has sufficient reason to believe that an employee has a mental or physical incapacity rendering him/her unfit to perform his/her job or which jeopardizes workplace safety or stability, the Appointing Authority or the designated person in charge may authorize the removal of such employee from the workplace. It is understood that the employee might not recognize or acknowledge such unfitness.
The employee shall be required to undergo a medical examination to determine his/her fitness for work. The employee, if he/she so desires, may be represented by a physician of his/her own choice, in which case such verification and cost shall be the responsibility of the employee. However, the Appointing Authority shall reserve the right to obtain a second opinion from a Commonwealth designated physician to determine fitness for work. Such cost shall be borne by the Appointing Authority.
M.	No employee shall be entitled to a leave under the provisions of this Article in excess of the accumulated sick leave credits due such employee.
N.	Employees whose service with the Commonwealth is terminated shall not be entitled to any compensation in lieu of accumulated sick leave credits. Employees who retire shall be paid twenty percent (20%) of the value of their unused accrued sick leave at the time of their retirement. Upon the death of an employee who dies while in the employ of the Commonwealth, twenty percent (20%) of the value of the unused sick leave which the employee had personally earned and accrued as of the time of death shall be paid in the following order of precedence, as authorized by the Personnel Administrator upon request of the Appointing Authority of the deceased employee: first, to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries, if any, lawfully designated by the employee under the state employees' retirement system; and second, if there be no such designated beneficiary, to the estate of the deceased. It is understood that any such payment will not change the employee's pension benefit.
O.	Sick leave credits earned by an employee following a return to duty after a leave without pay or absence without pay shall not be applied to such period of time.
P.	An employee who while in the performance of his/her duty receives bodily
injuries resulting from acts of violence of patients or prisoners in his/her custody, and who
22
as a result of such injury would be entitled to benefits under Chapter 152 of the General Laws, shall, if entitled under Chapter 30, Section 58 of the General Laws, be paid the difference between the weekly cash benefits to which he/she would be entitled under said Chapter 152 and his/her regular salary without such absence being charged against available sick leave credits, even if such absence may be for less than six calendar days' duration.

1.	An Appointing Authority shall grant to a full time or part time employee who has completed her/his probationary period, or if there is no such probationary period, has been employed for at least three consecutive months, an unpaid leave of absence for up to twenty-six (26) weeks in conjunction with the birth, adoption or placement of a child as long as the leave concludes within twelve (12) months following the birth or placement.
2.	At least thirty (30) days in advance, the employee shall submit to the Appointing Authority a written notice of his/her intent to take such leave and the dates and expected duration of such leave. If thirty (30) days notice is not possible, the employee shall give notice as soon as practicable. The employee shall provide upon request by the Appointing Authority proof of the birth or placement or adoption of a child.
3.	If an employee has accrued sick leave, personal leave, compensatory leave, or vacation credits at the commencement of her/his family leave, the employee may use such leave credits for which s/he may be eligible under the sick leave, personal leave or vacation provisions of this Agreement. The Appointing Authority may, in his/her discretion, assign an employee to temporarily backfill for an employee who is on family leave. Such assignment may not be subject to the grievance procedure.
4.	At the expiration of the family leave, the employee shall be returned to the same equivalent position with the same status, pay and length of service credit as of the date of his/her leave. If during the period of the leave, employees in an equivalent position have been laid off through no fault of their own, the employee will be extended the same rights or benefits, if any, extended to employees of equal length of service in the equivalent position in the department.
5.	Employees taking an unpaid leave of absence under this provision will accrue sick and vacation leave benefits only for the first eight (8) weeks of such unpaid leave.

7.	During family leave taken in conjunction with the birth, adoption, or placement of a child, the employee shall receive his/her salary for ten (10) days of said leave, at a time requested by the employee. The ten days of paid family leave granted under this Section may be used on an intermittent basis over the twelve months following the birth, adoption, or placement, except that this leave may not be charged in increments of less than one (1) day. In addition, if the employee has accrued sick
26
leave, vacation leave, or personal leave credits available, the employee may use such credits for which he/she may otherwise be eligible under the sick leave, personal leave, or vacation leave provisions of this Agreement.
B.	Medical Leave
1.	An Appointing Authority shall grant to any employee who has completed his/her probationary period or, if there is no probationary period, who has been employed at least three (3) consecutive months, an unpaid leave of absence for up to twenty-six (26) weeks to care for a spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition, or for a serious health condition which prevents the employee from being able to perform the functions of her/his position.

3.	Intermittent leave usage and modified work schedules may be granted where a spouse, child or parent has a serious medical condition and is dependent upon the employee for care.

4.

5.	At the expiration of the medical leave, the employee shall be returned to the same equivalent position with the same status, pay and length of service credit as of the date of her/his leave. If during the period of the leave, employees in an equivalent position have been laid off through no fault of their own, the Employer will extend the same rights or benefits, if any, extended to employees of equal length of service in the equivalent position in the department.

The appointing authority may reasonably determine the positions in which employees must be employed and/or the requisite related work experience the employee must possess in order to be eligible to apply for a given promotion. The job posting shall include the job title, salary grade and other pertinent information. The appointing authority may receive and consider applications from persons outside the department/agency simultaneously with applications from employees for a vacancy posted under these provisions. All positions to be filled shall be posted throughout the appointing authority wherever employees covered by this Agreement are employed.
B.	An employee promoted in accordance with this Article whose performance is unsatisfactory may be returned to his/her previous job title under the jurisdiction of the appointing authority. If an employee's performance is determined to be unsatisfactory at any time during the six months probationary period, such determination shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

MOSES may negotiate with the Employer over whether such new titles shall be subject to the provisions of this Article. If the parties are unable to agree as to whether a new title(s) should be covered by this Article, MOSES may submit its request for inclusion of specified title(s) to arbitration in accordance with the grievance procedure provided for in this Agreement. All new titles on the Employer's list shall be excluded from the promotion procedure under this Article until such time as an arbitrator determines that such titles should be covered by the provisions of this Article. Any titles which are not on a list of excluded titles shall be covered by the provisions of this Article.

46
selected or he/she rescinds the request in writing. When such a position in job group 21 or higher becomes available to be filled on a permanent basis, employees holding permanent status in the classification who have requested reassignment to the location of the available vacancy shall be considered for such position and notified. Employees may upon notification rescind their request for reassignment. Employees who rescind their request after selection may not request reassignment for a period of one year. In the event that there is a civil service certified list available for such permanent vacancy, applicants appearing on such certified list may be considered in conjunction with those applicants seeking reassignment and such selection shall be based on the following factors in priority:
1.	Ability to do the job as determined by:
(a)	Experience and competence (job performance) in the same or related work
(b)	Education and training related to the vacant position
2.	Seniority, as measured by length of state service from date of permanent appointment
3.	Work History

If an employee's performance is determined to be unsatisfactory at any time during such probationary period, such determination shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
B.	Whenever a reassigned employee is found to be unsuitable and returned to his/her former duties, further consideration shall be given to the list of initial applicants under the factors enumerated in Section 14.4(A).

Section 14.6	Temporary Transfers
For the purposes of easing short term personnel shortages in various state agencies, HRD shall maintain a list of bargaining unit employees who have volunteered to accept a temporary transfer to another state agency for a maximum period not to exceed six (6) months. Since such temporary transfer would allow the Employer to better utilize available expertise to meet short term needs, service would be creditable for seniority purposes and the employee’s job status would not be adversely affected.
Any such transfer shall require the prior approval of both departments/agencies and the employee. In addition, any party may terminate the temporary transfer without prejudice with 7 days notice.
ARTICLE 15 CONTRACTING OUT
Section 15.1

The Committee shall examine both cost effectiveness of such contracts and their impact on the career development of MOSES members. In the case of 03 contracts with individuals, the Committee shall review them to determine whether the work to be performed is long term in nature and whether it should more appropriately be performed by regular employees. If the Committee can not reach an Agreement, the matter will be submitted to expedited fact-finding.

This Article shall not apply to working in a higher grade when the holder of the higher grade is absent on vacation leave.
A Committee shall be established consisting of 3 members designated by HRD and 3 members designated by MOSES.

Section 17A.1
Class reallocation may be requested by MOSES whenever it believes a reallocation is justified by the existence of an inequitable relationship between the positions covered by the reallocation requests and other positions covered by this Agreement.

Upon request, HRD will meet with MOSES and the affected department/agency and other departments/agencies with similar positions to discuss available positions and training programs.
Prior to notifying employees of the reduction in force the appointing authority will first solicit volunteers for layoff within the department/agency. However, nothing contained in this article shall preclude the appointing authority from rejecting a volunteer based on the operational needs of the department/agency. During the reduction in force process, the appointing authority may also consider the termination of consultant contracts.
B.	Actual Layoff - Seniority is based on service within the department/agency except that all provisional employees in a title must be laid off before any employee with temporary-from-certification status in the same title.
In the event of an actual layoff, management will notify the affected employees in writing not less than ten (10) working days in advance of the layoff date
52
and will send a copy of such notice to MOSES. Where notices are sent by first class mail, the time shall begin to run on the date of the mailing of the notice.
Section 18.2
Within five (5) workdays of receipt of notification of layoff, the employee shall elect to either transfer or bump in accordance with the following sections.
A. Lateral Transfer and Bumping Procedure - Any employee who has been notified that he/she will actually be laid off may file with his/her appointing authority, within five (5) working days of receipt of such notice, a written request to laterally transfer to a position in the same title and/or bump to a lower title in accordance with the provisions in this subsection:
1.	An employee whose position is being eliminated shall have the opportunity to exercise his/her seniority rights by transferring laterally to a position in the same title within the jurisdiction of his/her appointing authority for which the employee is determined qualified to perform the duties of the position, provided there is an employee junior to him/her in departmental years of service.
2.	The first employee displaced by the lateral transfer of the more senior employee may exercise his/her seniority rights by transferring laterally to a position in the same title for which the employee is determined qualified to perform the duties of the position, occupied by an employee junior to him/her in departmental years of service within his/her appointing authority.
3.	The second employee displaced by the lateral transfer referred to above may exercise his/her seniority rights by displacing the least senior employee in departmental years of service in the same title with the appointing authority.
4.	Notwithstanding the above, no employee exercising his/her rights under 18.2(A) (1) or (2) above shall be denied an opportunity to displace the least senior employee in the same title in the affected employee’s facility, departmental unit, district, region, appointing authority, or statewide.
5.	A displaced employee or one whose position is eliminated may exercise
his/her seniority right by either transferring laterally or by bumping to a Bargaining Unit 9 position within the jurisdiction of his/her appointing authority in the next lower title or titles occupied by an employee junior in departmental years of service and for which the employee is determined qualified by the Employer.
6.	Any lateral transfer or bump occurring as the result of a reduction in force shall be limited to three transactions per title with a transaction being defined as the displacement of an employee by an employee senior in departmental years of service.
53
7.	An employee being displaced from his/her position by a lateral transfer of a more senior employee in the same title shall notify the department/agency of his/her intentions within the third working day of being notified by the department/agency of the displacement.
B.	Other Transfers
1.	Within the Department/Agency - the employee who is to be laid off shall also have the opportunity to transfer laterally to a fillable, vacant, Bargaining Unit 9 position, in any other title within the jurisdiction of his/her present appointing authority, for which he/she is qualified.
2.	Between Agencies - the employee who is to be laid off may file a request for transfer to any agency in state service. Upon approval of that agency, such employee may be appointed to any vacancy in Bargaining Unit 9, in the same grade and title or any similar title for which he/she might meet the necessary qualifications in the same or lower salary range as the position from which he/she was laid off. Seniority shall be the determining factor in the event one or more such employees are seeking the same position in another state agency.
3.	Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, employees may exercise their bumping and transfer rights under these provisions provided there is a Bargaining Unit 9 position available under the jurisdiction of the appointing authority.
Section 18.3	Department/Agency Recall Procedure
A.	Where recall is to the job title from which layoff occurred, recall shall be in the reverse order of layoff.
B.	The department/agency shall maintain a recall roster from which laid-off employees will be recalled, to positions to be filled, in accordance with their seniority and in accordance with their qualifications to perform the work.
C.	If the position of an employee is abolished as the result of the transfer of the functions to another department/agency, such employee may elect to have his/her name placed on the recall roster or to be transferred, subject to the approval of the appointing authority, to a similar position in such department/agency without loss of seniority, retirement or other rights.
D.	The department/agency shall appoint employees on the recall roster, prior to the appointment of any other applicant, to fillable vacant Bargaining Unit 9 positions for which the laid-off employee is determined qualified by the Employer.
54
E.	A laid-off employee will remain on the recall roster for two years except an employee who is offered recall to a position in the same job grade as the position from which he/she was laid off and who refuses such offer shall be removed from the recall list and his/her recall rights shall terminate at that time, provided that employees presently working for the Commonwealth who are on a recall roster as of the effective date of this Agreement shall remain on the recall roster for one additional year.
Notwithstanding the above, a laid-off employee who fails to respond in writing to a notice of recall within seven (7) calendar days of the receipt of such recall offer or who upon acceptance of the recall offer fails to report for work on the appointed date, shall forfeit any further recall rights.
Notices of recall sent by the appointing authority to a laid-off employee and the employee's notice of acceptance or rejection of said recall offer shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested.
Section 18.4
In computing seniority as defined in this Agreement any break in service for two (2) years or less due to an involuntary layoff shall be included in total seniority as with military, maternity, educational and industrial accident leave.
Section 18.5	Expedited Grievances
Whenever an employee is denied lateral transfer, bumping or recall rights based on a determination he/she is unqualified, a grievance may be filed at Step III and if unresolved, expedited arbitration will commence inside of thirty (30) days.
Section 18.6	State Wide Recall List
A Joint MOSES/Management Committee will be established to discuss the implementation of Statewide Recall by January 1, 1998. This Committee shall consist of four (4) members selected by MOSES and four (4) members selected by HRD.

Step II - In the event the employee or MOSES wishes to appeal an unsatisfactory decision at Step I, the appeal shall be presented in writing to the person designated by the agency head for such purpose within ten calendar days of the receipt of the Step I decision. The agency head or his designee shall meet with the employee and/or MOSES for review of the grievance and shall issue a written reply to the employee and/or MOSES by the end of the fourteen calendar days following the day on which the appeal was filed.

69
It is acknowledged that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, MOSES had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to all proper subjects of collective bargaining. Therefore, for the life of this Agreement, this Agreement shall constitute the total agreement between the parties and MOSES agrees that the Employer shall not be obligated to any additional collective bargaining.
Section 25.4

ARTICLE 26
EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION PROGRAM
Section 26.1	General
The Employer and MOSES recognize that the employees who perform the work are one of the most valuable sources of information concerning the methods and means of improving the delivery of services to the public. Therefore, the parties agree to establish an employee participation program which shall be under the direction and control of the Special MOSES/Management Committee set out in Section 26.2.
Section 26.2	Committee
The Employer and MOSES agree to establish a Special Statewide MOSES/Management Committee, consisting of four representatives appointed by MOSES, and four representatives appointed by the Personnel Administrator. The Committee shall develop recommendations for policies and procedures for agency programs. Such Committee shall function continuously throughout the life of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 27
NO STRIKES
Section 27.1
Neither MOSES nor any employee shall engage in, induce, support, encourage or condone a strike, work stoppage, slowdown or withholding of services by employees.
Section 27.2
70
MOSES shall exert its best efforts to prevent any violation of Section 27.1 of this Article and, if such action does occur, to exert its best efforts to terminate it.
ARTICLE 28 SAVING CLAUSE
In the event that any Article, Section or portion of this Agreement is found to be invalid or shall have the effect of loss to the Commonwealth of funds made available through federal law, rule or regulation, then such specific Article, Section or portion shall be unenforceable, and the parties shall meet to discuss amending the provision to the extent necessary to conform with such law, rule or regulation, but the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If no agreement is reached within thirty days of the date the problem arose, then disputes arising under this Article may be submitted by MOSES to expedited arbitration.
ARTICLE 29 DURATION
This Agreement shall be for the three-year period from July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2006 and terms contained herein shall be effective upon execution unless otherwise specified. Should a successor agreement not be executed by June 30, 2006 this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until a successor agreement is executed. At the written request of either party, negotiations for a subsequent agreement will be commenced on or after November 1, 2005.
ARTICLE 30
APPROPRIATION BY THE GENERAL COURT
The cost items contained in this Agreement shall not become effective unless appropriations necessary to fully fund such cost items have been enacted by the General Court in accordance with M.G.L., C. 150E, § 7 in which case the cost items shall be effective on the date provided in the Agreement.

APPENDIX B
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT I
The parties agree that All Unit 9 employees are covered by the provisions of Paragraphs A and B below:
A.	Any employee who resigned or was granted a leave of absence to enter service in the armed forces of the United States, under the provision of Chapter 708, Acts of 1941, as amended, and who, upon honorable discharge from such service in said armed forces has returned or returns to the service of the Commonwealth, shall be paid an amount equal to the vacation allowance earned in the vacation year prior to his/her entry into such service in said armed forces which had not been granted prior to military leave and, in addition, that portion of the vacation allowance earned in the vacation year during which he/she entered such service, up to the time of military leave, provided, that no monetary or other allowance has already been made therefor.
B.	Employees who are reinstated after military leave as referred to in Paragraph A may be granted one full year’s vacation allowance for the year in which they returned or return; provided, that prior to such military leave, vacation had not been used or compensation paid in lieu thereof for the same year. If an insufficient period of time remains in that vacation year to permit the granting of a full allowance, the entire period remaining may be so used. Neither the above usage, nor absence due to military leave shall, in any way, affect vacation credits earned by such employees in the vacation year in which they return from military service.

APPENDIX B
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT III
This Memorandum of Understanding is entered into between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, acting through the Human Resources Division, and the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists, Unit 9. This Memorandum of Understanding reflects a clarification of Articles 12 and 24A of the collective bargaining agreement concerning merit based pay for performance. It shall be agreed that:
1.	All EPRS evaluations shall be based on a “below”, “meets”, “exceeds” system. Such system shall commence on July 1, 2000.
2.	Disciplinary actions impacting on an employee’s “ability to perform his/her normal duties” shall be considered for the purpose of a final overall rating on the performance review.
3.	Disciplinary actions not impacting on an employee’s “ability to perform his/her duties” shall not have a greater impact than other areas of the employee’s evaluation for the purpose of any rating.
4.	A. Any appeal of a final “unsatisfactory” or “below” rating shall be initiated at a Merit Arbitration Panel as designated below.
B.	Said appeal shall be filed within 21 calendar days with the Human Resources Division.
C.	Only employees receiving a rating of “unsatisfactory” or “below” shall be able to appeal the rating.
D.	The appeal shall be considered by a Merit Arbitration Panel consisting of one person designated by the Personnel Administrator, one person designated by the President of MOSES and one person designated by the Chairperson of the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration who shall be assigned on a rotating basis.
E.	The standard of review to be applied by the panel shall be solely limited to whether or not the final performance of rating of “unsatisfactory” or “below” was justified.
F.	The decision of the Merit Arbitration Panel shall be final and binding and any employee having an “unsatisfactory” or “below” rating overturned shall be made whole in as prompt a manner as possible. Any costs associated with this process will be borne equally by the parties.
5.	Supervisors and Managers shall not use performance evaluations to threaten or coerce employees in any matter.
85
6.	There shall be no pre-determined formula or ratio used to establish the number of “unsatisfactory” or “below” ratings given.
7.	Job duties and performance criteria shall be observable and measurable to the extent practicable.
8.	On and after the date of this Agreement the Commonwealth shall evaluate bargaining unit employees no more strictly than it has historically evaluated such employees.
9.	Any employee who receives an “unsatisfactory” or “below” evaluation shall be reevaluated thirty days after the completion of his/her final evaluation. The Department/Agency shall file a remedial plan for an employee receiving an “unsatisfactory” or “below” rating. Each re-review period shall be thirty days in length to a maximum of six months. The employee shall have his/her re-evaluations done each 30 day period until a “satisfactory” or “meets” rating is achieved or six months pass whichever is first.
Employees that may be nearing an “unsatisfactory” or “below” rating shall be counseled by his/her supervisor at least three months in advance of their final stage of the evaluation as to the specific areas that must be improved and what they must do to attain a “satisfactory” or “meets” rating.
During the process of the re-review, the employee who continues to receive an “unsatisfactory” or “below” rating shall be able to make a one-time appeal of that rereview rating to the Merit Arbitration Board. This appeal must be filed within ten days of the last re-review rating. Any decision in favor of the employee will be from the month of the appeal forward. Such appeal may not be filed if the employee has already filed an appeal at the time of the “unsatisfactory” or “below” review.
10.	Once an employee receives a “satisfactory” or “meets” evaluation during the rereview process he/she shall be eligible for the denied step and/or denied salary increases effective from the date of receiving the “satisfactory” or “meets” rating. Any employee’s anniversary date for step purposes shall not be retarded upon receiving the “satisfactory” or “meets” rating.
11.	An employee who may be adversely impacted by an untimely evaluation shall be made whole upon the completion of the performance review and upon achieving a final rating of “satisfactory” or “meets”.
12.	All performance merit ratings shall be based on the current EPRS system as found in Article 24A of the current Agreement and all payments of salary and/or step increases shall be based on current language found in Article 12 relating to pay for performance.
13.	All financial considerations (i.e., merit increases, step rate increases) shall be based on the employee’s most recent, final annual evaluation.
86
14.	When work related circumstances occur over which the employee/agency has no control, the employee shall not be prevented from attaining an overall rating of “satisfactory”, “meets” or “exceeds”.

As such, the Commonwealth agrees to grant up to thirty-five (35) hours per week in paid leave to one (1) MOSES official, as designated by MOSES, who conduct approved union activities as described below. Such approval will be based on timely submission to HRD of requests for paid leave on a weekly basis. Such submission shall be made prior to the beginning of the week in question and shall not be unreasonably denied. MOSES will forward to HRD a description of the approved union activity for the week prior on the Wednesday following the leave. For the purpose of this Agreement, the following shall be deemed approved union activities:
1.	Attendance at Statewide, departmental/agency, facility and local LaborManagement committee meetings, including reasonable travel and preparation time;
2.	Investigation and processing of grievances, including reasonable travel time;
3.	Attendance at grievance and arbitration hearings, including reasonable travel and preparation time;

B. Additionally, the MOSES official identified by MOSES pursuant to paragraph A, above, shall be authorized to utilize up to five (5) hours of unpaid union leave for any of the purposes identified above or for the purposes delineated in Article 5, Section 4 of the parties’ Collective Bargaining Agreement.
90
Signed this 30th day of June 2005.

Electronic Transfers
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, through the Human Resources Division (HRD), and the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists, (MOSES), are parties to a Collective Bargaining Agreement which provides for employees covered by the terms and conditions of the Agreement to have their salaries transferred electronically by means of direct deposit. Whereas MOSES has expressed concern that not all employees would be able to avail themselves of the electronic transfer because of severe hardship, the parties agree as follows:
1.	The Commonwealth and MOSES agree that all employees will have their net salary checks electronically forwarded to an account or accounts selected by the employee;
2.	In the extraordinary event that MOSES alleges that an employee cannot comply with the Collective Bargaining Agreement relative to the electronic transfer due to severe hardship such as inability to access a bank or financial institution during off hours or, there is not an ATM available within a reasonable geographic distance from an employee’s worksite or home, or in the case of domestic violence where a person purposely does not want to have an account for safety reasons, MOSES shall petition the Human Resources Division for a Direct Deposit Special Exemption;
3.	The Human Resources Division, in concert with the Office of the State Comptroller, shall review the request for the Direct Deposit Special Exemption filed by MOSES and will notify MOSES of its finding;
4.	The Parties agree that no other appeal may be commenced by the employee or MOSES relative to the Direct Deposit Special Exemption and further, that this Memorandum is not grievable and is inarbitrable.
The Provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be coterminous with the duration of this collective bargaining agreement as provided in Article 29.

Regarding Out-of-Title Assignments at the Massachusetts Highway Department
1.	When it has been determined by the Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD), or through the grievance process, that an employee is working in a higher classification, that employee shall be compensated for said out-of-title assignment via the normal payroll cycle if the out-of-title assignment is reasonably expected to last longer than six months.
2.	The determination whether or not an assignment will last longer than six months shall be the exclusive responsibility of MHD or its agent and said determination shall not be subject to the grievance process. However, when a determination has been made by MHD that an out-of-title assignment will not last longer than six months, and in fact said out of title assignment is subsequently paid for the six month period, the parties agree to hold a Step III hearing to ensure compliance with the terms of this memorandum. The results of this hearing shall not be subject to arbitration.
3.	Employees working out-of-title who do not fall under the provisions of this Memorandum shall continue to be paid according to past practice.
4.	Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude MHD, or its designee, from making the determination that an employee has been assigned responsibilities out of his/her classification.

7.	Neither MOSES nor the employee waives any right to file a grievance regarding disputed dates or grade for the out-of-title assignment.
8.	MOSES does not waive any right to file a grievance alleging that the work in a higher classification violates Article 14 or other provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
The Provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be coterminous with the duration of this Collective Bargaining Agreement as provided in Article 29.

CODE OF CONDUCT
Commonwealth of Massachusetts/Unit Nine Employees
“No responsibility of Government is more fundamental than the responsibility for maintaining the highest standards of ethical behavior by those who conduct the public business. There can be no dissent from the principle that all officials must act with unwavering integrity, absolute impartiality, and complete devotion to the public interest. This principle must be followed not only in reality but in appearance. For the basis of effective government is public confidence, and that confidence is endangered when ethical standards falter or appear to falter.”
President John F. Kennedy April 27, 1961
1.	INTRODUCTION
This document constitutes a Handbook and Code of Conduct for all Bargaining Unit 9 employees of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This Code is designed to give all employees full and fair notice of their professional and ethical obligations.
We can maintain that confidence only to the extent that all of our official activities and all of our contacts with the public reflect the highest ethical and moral standards. We must perform our duties with integrity and propriety. We must also do all in our power to ensure that none of our words or actions can be interpreted otherwise.
This Code is written for your own protection. It strives to impart three fundamental messages:
a.	Every employee must scrupulously avoid any actual conduct, which constitutes a conflict of interest, or conduct, which gives the reasonable basis for the impression of a conflict of interest between his/her private interests, usually financial, and the public interest. The public interest must always take precedence;
b.	Every employee is prohibited from either taking some action, or failing to perform some duty, which would personally benefit himself/herself or give preferential treatment to any citizen;
c.	Every employee is prohibited from taking any action, which would result in illegal receipt of public or private funds.
Guidance--both on what we are expected to do and on what we are prohibited from doing-should help all of us understand generally what is expected of us. It should also help resolve particular situations we are faced with in our daily work.
97
Please read these rules carefully and abide by their spirit as well as their letter. Each of us can take pride in belonging to an organization, which contributes so much to the growth, strength and quality of life of the Commonwealth.
2.	DEFINITIONS
As used in this Code, unless the context requires otherwise:
a.	"administrative inquiries" - means those occasions when an employee is required to respond to questions of importance to the agency/department when directed to do so by his/her appointing authority or that authority’s designee.
b.	“disciplinary action" - means any action taken by the appointing authority to discipline an employee, and where applicable, in accordance with the provisions of the collective agreement or civil service law.
c.	“employee" - means any person in Bargaining Unit 9 on the current personnel roster of the agency/department. This shall include all bargaining unit workers; those who are on any form of leave of absence; and workers who are serving a suspension.
d.	“immediate family" - means the employee and his/her spouse and their parents, children, brothers and sisters.
e.	“nominal value” - means monetary worth not exceeding twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
f.	“official action” - means any activity performed or required to be performed by an employee in the course of his/her official duties.
3.	REGULATORY BASIS
This Handbook and Code of Conduct is issued pursuant to the powers of the Commissioner of Administration, as set forth in Chapter 7, Section 4 of the General Laws, and in accordance with, but not limited to M.G.L. Chapter 268A, Opinions of the Attorney General, Ethics Commissions Rulings and applicable management rights provisions of the relevant collective bargaining agreements.
4.	GENERAL RULES
A.	The Code Generally
1.	Applicability of Code
The Code applies to all Bargaining Unit 9 employees including those on any type of leave status ( e.g. leave without pay, military leave, civic-duty leave, etc.) except that it shall not apply to employees in Unit 9 who are on unpaid union leave of absence to the extent allowed by law.
98
2.	Scope of Code
This code is not to be considered all-inclusive. The absence of a specific published rule of conduct does not mean nor imply that any act of misconduct tending to discredit an employee is condoned or permissible or would not result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
3.	Knowledge of Code
Each employee is required to know the Code of Conduct and rules contained herein, to seek information from his/her appointing authority, the appointing authority’s designee or personnel office in case of doubt or misunderstanding as to their application.
Decisions in personnel matters involving disciplinary action will be based on the presumption that each employee has familiarized himself/herself with this Code and that he or she is aware of the obligation to abide by it.
4.	Effect of Code
Employees whose conduct does not conform to the rules and guidelines contained in this Code may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Any disciplinary action taken will conform to civil service law and/or the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.
5.	Distribution of Code
Each appointing authority or his/her designee will see that each employee receives a copy of this Code. Employees will acknowledge receipt of the Code by signing the attached Receipt of Code Form (Form CC-3) in the space provided. In each instance, the signed Receipt Form will be returned to the employee’s appointing authority or his/her designee within ten days of receipt, and filed in the employee's personnel folder. The employee’s signature on the Receipt Form is notice of his/her obligation to familiarize himself/herself with the contents of the Code of Conduct and to abide by it.
Each appointing authority or his/her designee will be responsible for providing accurate information and guidance to his/her employees with regard to the specifics of the Code and may from time to time offer training sessions on the Code to his/her employees as the need arises.
6.	Effective Date of Code
99
The effective date of the Code shall be ten days after the Code of Conduct is distributed and the Code of Conduct Receipt Form is received by the employee.
B.	Conformance to Laws
Employees shall obey the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Any employee who is convicted of a crime relating to his/her employment shall be subject to discipline.
Any employee who has been indicted or arrested for a serious crime, supported by a judicial finding of probable cause in a preliminary hearing when the nature of the charge with its attendant publicity reasonably gives rise to legitimate fear for the safety of other employees, the property of the Commonwealth, or jeopardizes the public trust in the ethical standards of agency/departmental employees or undermines the trust in the integrity of the Commonwealth's system of tax administration or the administration of other laws of the Commonwealth, may also be subject to suspension without pay or other employee benefits, pending resolution of the case.
If the employee is found guilty, pleads nolo contendere, has his/her case continued without a finding, is granted immunity from prosecution or has his/her case filed, further disciplinary action, including termination, may be taken if the crime was related to his/her employment. If the employee is found not guilty, or the case is nolle prosequi or dismissed, the employee shall be immediately reinstated to employment retroactive to the date of suspension without loss of wages or other employee benefits.
C.	Conformance to Policies, Procedures and Directives
Employees shall comply with all of the policies and operating procedures of the agency/department in which they work. This requirement includes, but is not limited to, all agency/departmental policies and procedures. Employees shall respond forthrightly and promptly to the work-related directives of their supervisors.
D.	Conduct, Attitude and Demeanor
Employees are expected to conduct themselves in their official relations with the public and with their fellow employees in a manner, which will enhance public respect for, and confidence in, the employee and in the Commonwealth as a whole. They must not only perform their duties in a wholly impartial manner, but must avoid any conduct, which gives the reasonable basis for the impression of acting otherwise.
Specifically, all employees shall avoid any action, which may result in or create the reasonable basis for the impression of:
a.	using public office for private gain;
b.	giving preferential treatment to any citizen;
100
c.	making work-related decisions contrary to agency/departmental policy;
d.	using one's official position to harass or intimidate any person or entity outside the course of official duties.
E.	Administrative Inquiries
Employees must respond promptly and fully to all administrative inquiries when directed to do so.
F.	State Ethics Commission Financial Disclosure Requirements
Employees who are required to file a "Statement of Financial Disclosure” with the State Ethics Commission, under the provisions of M.G.L. Chapter 268B, shall do so in a timely manner as prescribed by the State Ethics Commission. The State Ethics Commission will notify each employee who is required to file such a statement.
5.	CONFLICT OF INTEREST
The Necessity For The Fair And Impartial Administration Of State Government And The Enforcement Of Its Laws Makes The Avoidance Of Any Conflict Of Interest Of Primary Importance. A Conflict Of Interest Is A Situation In Which An Employee's Private Interest, Usually Financial, Conflicts Or Raises A Reasonable Question Of Conflict With His/Her Official Duties And Responsibilities.
Chapter 268a Of The General Laws Provides Criminal And Civil Penalties For Conflict Of Interest Violations. The Following Three General Categories Of Prohibitions Are To Be Used As Guidelines For Your Information. (Chapter 268a Of The General Laws Offers Specific Details).
1.	No employee may request or receive, in any manner whatsoever, compensation or anything else of value, except from the Commonwealth: (a) for performance of his/her duties; or (b) for influencing or appearing to influence such performance.
2.	No employee may participate in any official action relating to any entity in which the employee or a member of his/her immediate family has a financial interest.
3.	No employee may participate in any official action relating to any individual with whom or entity in which the employee has a substantial personal interest.
Employees have an obligation to avoid scrupulously the potential conflicts of interest, which exist in their employment. They have a duty to disclose and report promptly the existence or possible existence of a conflict of interest to their agency head or his/her designee. They should request from their supervisor the transfer from their caseload of any case which involves their immediate family, close friend or any person with whom or entity in which they have some personal or financial involvement.
101
In addition, they have a right under law to have any question relating to a possible conflict of interest confidentially reviewed and decided by the State Ethics Commission. Information regarding the filing of a conflict of interest request with the State Ethics Commission is available from the agency head or his/her designee or from the Ethics Commission directly.
In addition to the sanctions referred to above, M.G.L. Ch. 268A, Section 23 also prescribes and describes certain “Standards of Conduct”. Violations of these standards are subject to appropriate disciplinary action. All employees are required to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of these standards, which provide as follows:
"No current officer or employee of a state, county, or municipal agency shall:
(1)	accept other employment which will impair his independence of judgment in the exercise of his official duties;
(2)	use or attempt to use his official position to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for himself or others;
(3)	by his conduct give reasonable basis for the impression that any person can improperly influence or unduly enjoy his favor in the performance of his official duties, or that he is unduly affected by the kinship, rank, position or influence of any party or person.”
“No current or former officer or employee of a state, county or municipal agency shall:
(1)	accept employment or engage in any business or professional activity which will require him to disclose confidential information which he has gained by reason of his official position or authority;
(2)	improperly disclose materials or data within the exemptions to the definition of public records as defined by Section Seven of Chapter Four of the General Laws, and were acquired by him in the course of his official duties nor use such information to further his personal interests.” (See M.G.L. Ch. 268A, S. 23).
These rules with respect to conflicts of interest are in addition to, and supplement, state policies and agency/departmental rules, regulations and operating procedures that may otherwise apply to the official actions of employees.
(In the event that the appointing authority, or his/her designee, approves a particular activity and the Ethics Commission subsequently determines that such activity is a conflict of interest, the appointing authority will not discipline the employee for such activity. However, only the Ethics Commission, and formerly the Attorney General, have the authority to issue an opinion interpreting M.G.L. Chapter 268A, which is binding.)
6.	GIFTS AND GRATUITIES FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES
102
A.
General Limitations
Employees shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a person who or entity which, the employee knows or has reason to know:
(1)	Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with his/her agency/department;
(2)	Conducts business or other activities which are regulated or monitored by the agency/department, except as permitted by this section or by agency/departmental directives; or
(3)	Has interests that may be or give the reasonable impression of being substantially affected by the performance or non-performance of the employee’s official duties.
B. Exceptions
The restrictions set forth in paragraph A of this section do not apply to:
(1)	Obvious family or personal relations when the circumstances make it clear that those relationships, rather than the business or the persons concerned, are the motivating factors behind any gift or gratuity.
(2)	The acceptance of food or refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a breakfast, luncheon, dinner or other meetings attended for educational, informational or other similar purposes. However, agency/departmental employees are specifically prohibited from accepting free food or other gratuity except non-alcoholic beverages (coffee, tea, etc.), while on official business, from persons with whom they have contact in the performance of their official duties.
(3)	The acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans, automobile loans, personal loans, etc., provided that the employee does not deal with that institution in the course of his/her official duties. However, if dealing with such banks or financial institutions is unavoidable, the employee must disclose dealings to the appropriate authority in writing prior to engaging in such dealings.
(4)	The acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional materials such as pens, pencils, notepads, calendars, and other items of nominal value.
(5)	The acceptance of an award or gift of nominal value for a speech, participation in a conference, or some public contribution or achievement given by a charitable, religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational, 103
public service or civic organization, if such organization falls within paragraph A above.
(6)	Acceptance of reimbursement, in cash or in kind, for travel, subsistence and other expenses incident to attendance at meetings, provided such attendance and reimbursement is approved by the appointing authority or his/her designee. Such reimbursement can be made directly to the employee. An employee on official business may not be reimbursed, and payment may not be made on his/her behalf, for excessive (e.g., reimbursement which exceeds actual cost) personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, travel or other benefits. At no time shall an employee accept reimbursement from both the Commonwealth and another source for the same expenses.
7.	OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
A.	Introduction: Principles
The Commonwealth seeks to give employees the maximum freedom possible to engage in outside employment or business activities consistent with the Commonwealth’s responsibilities. However, the extremely sensitive mission of the Commonwealth and its employees necessitates certain restrictions. Employees may engage in outside employment or business activity provided such activity is not prohibited by this Code or by any statute, regulation or departmental order.
An activity that is permissible for the occupant of one position may very well not be permissible for the occupant of another position. Therefore, in considering each case on its individual merits, the employee must satisfy the following principles:
104
(1)	The outside activity would not place the employee in a situation where there is a conflict, or in a situation which gives the reasonable basis for the impression of a conflict, between his or her private interests and his or her official duties and responsibilities (see section 5, above, "Conflict of Interest", for additional guidance).
(2)	The outside activity would not result in use, dissemination or disclosure to others of confidential information obtained in connection with the employee's departmental duties or position.
(3)	The nature of the employment or business activity or the hours to be devoted to such activity would not impair the employee's availability, capacity or efficiency for the performance of his/her official duties as an employee of the Commonwealth.
(4)	Employees shall not engage directly or indirectly in financial transactions as a result of, or primarily relying on, information obtained through their employment. In particular, they shall not use confidential information obtained in the course of their employment with the Commonwealth to obtain benefits, financial or otherwise, for themselves, their families or others.
B.	Activities Which Do Not Require Prior Notice
(1)	Introduction
Employees are generally not required to submit written notice before engaging in outside activities which are not considered to be employment or business related. Although it is not feasible to cover every specific activity of this nature, the general categories discussed below are furnished as basic guidelines.
(2)	General Examples
(a)	Membership and uncompensated services (including holding of office) in civic, scout, religious, educational, fraternal, social, community, veterans, or charitable organizations.
(b)	Services as a notary public or justice of the peace.
(c)	Rental of employee-owned property, real or personal, to the extent such property is not rented to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any agency or subdivision thereof, or the lessee is not a subject of the employee’s official duties.
(d)	Minor services and odd jobs for friends, relatives, or neighbors. These include a wide variety of activities, including: repair or maintenance work such as painting, yard work, carpentry, or services such as babysitting and
