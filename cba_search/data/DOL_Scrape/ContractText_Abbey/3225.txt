Article 2
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
A.	A FACULTY MEMBER is entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his/her other academic or administrative duties.
B.	A FACULTY MEMBER is entitled to freedom hi the classroom in discussing his/her subject, but he/she should be careful not to introduce into his/her teaching controversial matter which has no relation to his/her subject.
C.	A University FACULTY MEMBER is a citizen and a member of a learned profession. When he/she speaks or writes as a citizen, he/she should be free from University censorship or discipline, but his/her special position in the community imposes special obligations. As a person of learning he/she should remember that the public may judge his/her profession and his/her University by his/her utterances. Hence, he/she should at all tunes be accurate, should exercise appropriate restraint, should show respect for the opinions of others, and should make every effort to indicate that he/she is not a spokesperson of the UNIVERSITIES. Acts which interfere with the activities of the UNIVERSITIES, acts which interfere with the freedom of movement on the campus, or acts which interfere with the freedom of all members of the academic community to pursue their rightful goals, are the antithesis of academic freedom and responsibility. So also are such acts which, in effect, deny freedom to speak, to be heard, to study, to teach, to administer and to pursue research.
D.	1. FACULTY MEMBERS are entitled to freedom in the selection of textbooks, audio-visual aids and other teaching aids.
3
2.
There shall be no censorship of library materials.
3.	With respect to subsections 1. and 2. above, budgetary limitations may restrict the quantity of items to be purchased.
E.	Since certain aspects of the information obtained by a FACULTY MEMBER in the course of his/her work can be considered privileged, no FACULTY MEMBER shall be required to disclose such information unless he/she deems it to be in the best interest of his/her student or his/her profession. The University will immediately advise the FACULTY MEMBER of any effort, by action of law or otherwise, to secure records or other information obtained by the FACULTY MEMBER. In no event shall the University exercise any disciplinary action against a FACULTY MEMBER because of his/her assertion of privilege with regard to information under his/her control.
F.	The provisions of this Article shall not be construed so as to deprive the University or its designees of its right of access to and/or possession of files, records or materials maintained by FACULTY MEMBERS on behalf of the University, provided, however, that grade books shall remain in the possession of the FACULTY MEMBER so long as he/she remains on the campus.
Article 3
FAIR PRACTICES
A.	Neither party hereto nor any FACULTY MEMBER shall discriminate against any other FACULTY MEMBER or candidate for employment on the basis of race, creed, color, sex (including discrimination by sexual harassment), handicap or disability, life style, family status, age, national origin, APSCUF membership or activity or lack thereof, political belief and/or affiliation, or on account of any other basis prohibited by law. Where existing laws against discrimination require accommodation, the STATE SYSTEM will accommodate to the extent required by law.
B.	There shall be no discrimination by either of the parties hereto or any FACULTY MEMBER against members of the same family regarding concurrent employment at any University.
C.	If any provision of this Agreement is hi conflict with Federal Executive Orders 11246 and 11375, as amended, or the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, or the laws and rules relating to the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education Equity Plan, Excellence and Equity, hereinafter known as the STATE SYSTEM Equity Plan, the provisions of such orders, laws and rules shall prevail; provided that any rule not consistent with this Agreement adopted by the STATE SYSTEM subsequent to the signing of this Agreement shall not prevail against the terms of this Agreement.

Article 4
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FACULTY MEMBERS
A.	The concept of academic freedom must be accompanied by an equally demanding concept of academic responsibility. The concern of the UNIVERSITIES and its members for academic freedom safeguards must extend equally to requiring responsible service, consistent with the objectives of the UNIVERSITIES. The universal responsibility of the teaching FACULTY MEMBER is effective teaching.
B.	A proper academic climate can be maintained only when members of the FACULTY
meet their fundamental duties and responsibilities regularly. These duties and responsibilities include but are not limited to: reporting promptly, and in advance if possible, any changes in class hours or classrooms assigned; preparing for and meeting their assignments, which would include timely notification of the proper authority and making a reasonable effort to insure that assignments can be covered in case of absences; making a reasonable effort to notify students of any changes in class hours or classrooms assigned; keeping current in their academic disciplines through continuing scholarly activity; keeping office hours in accordance with Article 23, WORKLOAD AND WORKLOAD EQUIVALENTS, and conferring with and advising students and advisees; evaluating fairly and reporting promptly student achievement; rendering service to the University which would include participating in group deliberations which contribute to the growth and development of the students and the UNIVERSITIES; and reporting promptly, and in advance if possible, absence from any assigned duty in accordance with the provisions of Article 17, SICK LEAVE.

If the most senior of those FACULTY MEMBERS being considered for transfer from the department, program or administrative 'unit does not have the necessary qualifications to perform the duties of the available position, the next most senior FACULTY MEMBER being considered for transfer who has the necessary qualifications will be transferred.
D.	The President of the receiving University may make the appointment at any step within the rank held by the transferred FACULTY MEMBER which the President deems appropriate.
E.	The following procedure shall be utilized in the transfer process for FACULTY MEMBERS:
1.	When a FACULTY MEMBER is transferred, the regular full-time FACULTY
MEMBERS of the receiving University department shall have the right to determine by a simple majority vote the acceptability of the FACULTY MEMBER being transferred. Such vote shall be taken in accordance with the accepted voting practice or procedure of the affected department unless it is in conflict with this Agreement, in which case the procedure shall be revised to conform with this Agreement.
2.	The initial vote on acceptability by the receiving department shall be held before the end of the semester immediately prior to the semester in which the transfer is to be effective. This vote shall be held and the results determined in sufficient time to allow the President of the receiving University to notify the FACULTY MEMBER being considered for transfer of the results of that vote at least forty-five (45) days before the end of the semester in which the vote is taken. The FACULTY MEMBER being considered for transfer shall notify the Presidents of both the current University and the receiving University of his/her acceptance or rejection of the transfer within ten (10) days of the receipt of the results of the vote or at least thirty-five (35) days before the end of the semester in which the vote is taken, whichever comes first. A reasonable effort shall be made to insure that the FACULTY MEMBER is given the fall ten (10) days in which to make his/her decision to accept or reject transfer. Failure by the FACULTY MEMBER to notify the Presidents of the Universities involved of his/her decision on acceptance or rejection by the end of the ten (10) day period shall be considered a rejection of transfer. The time limits of this subsection may in individual cases be
100
modified by mutual agreement, in writing, of the parties to this Agreement. The acceptance of a transfer by a FACULTY MEMBER shall be final and binding and shall preclude any right of return to the former University by that transferred FACULTY MEMBER.
3.	The department of the receiving University shall have the following options in considering and voting on the acceptance of the FACULTY MEMBER proposed for transfer into the department:
a.	The department can approve the transfer of the FACULTY MEMBER into its department.

If the FACULTY MEMBER is tenured, his/her tenure status shall be carried over to the receiving University and he/she shall receive University-wide seniority credit at the receiving University of three (3) years or, where the President and the receiving department agree, additional University-wide seniority may be granted, up to the fall amount accrued at the former University. A probationary non-tenured FACULTY MEMBER shall receive full credit for prior service toward tenure but shall receive no University-wide seniority credit, unless the President and the receiving department agree, in which case University-wide seniority may be granted up to the full amount accrued at the former University. Sabbatical leaves shall be granted, and credit for sabbatical leaves shall be earned in accordance with Article 18, LEAVES OF ABSENCE, Section A. hi addition, the FACULTY MEMBER shall retain accumulated sick leave and he/she shall not be considered a new employee for purposes of fringe benefits or other benefits provided to FACULTY MEMBERS covered by this Agreement; or
b.	The department may provisionally approve the transfer of the FACULTY MEMBER into its department. Transfers, which have been given provisional approval by the department, shall be for an interim period of one academic year (2 semesters). Prior to the end of the interim academic year, the department shall vote either to fully accept the transferred FACULTY MEMBER or to reject the transferred FACULTY MEMBER. If a provisionally approved transferred FACULTY MEMBER fails to receive a vote of approval at the end of the first interim academic year, the President of the receiving University shall not be barred from retaining the transferred FACULTY MEMBER hi the position in the department to which he/she was transferred for not more than one (1) additional academic year (2 semesters). This does not obligate the President to find another position for the transferred FACULTY MEMBER at the receiving University after the end of this second year. If the provisionally approved FACULTY MEMBER is tenured, his/her tenure status shall be carried over to the receiving University. A provisionally approved probationary non-tenured FACULTY MEMBER shall receive full credit for prior service toward tenure. Sabbatical leaves shall be granted and credit for sabbatical leaves shall be earned in accordance with Article 18, LEAVES OF ABSENCE, Section A. hi addition, the provisionally approved FACULTY MEMBER shall retain accumulated sick leave and he/she shall not be considered a new employee for purposes of fringe benefits or other benefits provided to FACULTY MEMBERS covered by this Agreement.

c.	The department may rej ect the transfer of the FACULTY MEMBER into its department. Although the department has voted to reject the FACULTY MEMBER being considered for transfer, the President of the receiving University may at his/her discretion, and where he/she believes that the FACULTY MEMBER being considered for transfer meets the credential requirements of the available position, convert the rejection to a provisional approval. Where the President converts the rejection to a provisional approval, the transfer shall be for an interim period of one (1) academic year (2 semesters). Prior to the end of the interim academic year, the department shall vote either to accept fully the transferred FACULTY MEMBER or to reject the transferred FACULTY MEMBER. If a provisionally approved transferred FACULTY MEMBER fails to receive a vote of approval at the end of the first interim academic year, the President of the receiving University shall not be barred from retaining the transferred FACULTY MEMBER in the position in the department to which he/she was transferred for not more than one (1) additional academic year (2 semesters). This does not obligate the President to find another position for the transferred FACULTY MEMBER at the receiving University after the end of this second year. If the provisionally approved FACULTY MEMBER is tenured, his/her tenure status shall be carried over to the receiving University. A provisionally approved probationary non-tenured FACULTY MEMBER shall receive full credit for prior service toward tenure.

ASSOCIATION OF PENNSYLVANIA STATE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY FACULTIES and
STATE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION
SENIORITY POLICY
I. A miiform seniority reporting system to be applied at each university should be easy to understand and to administer and consistent with the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
H. A positive accrual system be used hi reporting seniority. Specifically, each tune a seniority list is prepared, additional seniority credit must be added to the previous listings.
HI. Semesters of service be the smallest unit of seniority credit. A faculty member will accrue one unit of credit for each semester completed according to the terms of Item IV. Each faculty member will earn a maximum of two units of credit per year. Summer sessions will not count for additional seniority credit.
IV.	The following method be used to determine whether a faculty member accrues seniority credit for a partial semester of service:
A.	Completion of less than five full pay periods—no credit.
B.	Completion of five or more full pay periods—1 credit.
V.	The tie-breaker system is to be employed as follows:
A.	For faculty with different original appointment dates but the same length of service, the individual with the earliest appointment date would have the most seniority and be ranked ahead of others with the same length of service.
B.	All regular, full-time faculty members hired after May 31, 1984 will have a six (6) digit seniority number which will be the number used as the third tie-breaker when two faculty members have the same seniority credit and the same date of appointment. The seniority number will be derived as follows:
1.	The first two (2) digits of any faculty member's seniority number will reflect the last two (2) digits of the calendar year of his/her initial date of appointment on the University's payroll.
2.	The last four (4) digits of any faculty member's seniority number will be determined by a computer-generated random number. The lowest four (4) digit number will be the most senior faculty member appointed that year, and the highest four (4) digit number will be the least senior faculty member appointed for that year.
3.	The computer will be programmed to reject any duplicate numbers and substitute a new random number.
124
4.	The local APSCUF president will designate a member of the faculty and the University President shall designate a member of his/her administration to observe the computer-generation of the random numbers for the last four (4) digits of the faculty members' seniority numbers.
C.	When it is necessary to insert a person into an existing department, an insertion drawing will be held.
VI.	The format found in Appendix A be used for reporting seniority on each campus.
VIL	Guidelines for preparing seniority lists are described in Appendix B.
VIH. The rules for determining seniority are described in Appendix C.

APPENDIX B
Guidelines for Preparing Seniority Lists
I.	Retroactive Applications
A.	The most recent date of appointment presently listed in the campus seniority list for each faculty member will remain unless it has been formally contested prior to January 1, 1983.
Explanation: Adoption of this Guideline will settle finally this date for all faculty currently employed.
B.	All seniority credit for full-time temporary and regular service accrued from the most recent date of appointment prior to the 1971 fall semester shall count. (Note: Educational leaves without pay granted prior to August 1, 1970, shall accrue seniority credit.)
Explanation: Adoption of this Guideline will cut through the tangle of temporary and regular service appointments made prior to the implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
C.	Beginning with the 1971 fall semester, only regular, full-time service from the most recent date of appointment will count for accrual of full-time seniority credit.
Explanation: This Guideline is based on terms of the CBA which went into effect in the 1971 fall semester and does not conflict with the provisions for tenure found in Article 15, Section B. of the CBA.
D.	Any local .APSCUF/Management agreement made prior to July 1, 1981, recognizing departmental seniority as opposed to college/university-wide seniority for retrenchment purposes shall be recognized when verified by appropriate documentation. Beginning July 1, 1981, the provisions of the applicable CBA shall apply.
Explanation: This Guideline resolves the problem created by such good-faith agreements even though they may have modified the tenns of the CBA prior to July 1,1981. It recognizes the good-faith in these arrangements and avoids the trauma and hardship that would result from reversing these actions.
E.	Any local APSCUF/Management agreement made prior to September 1, 1983, granting a full-time, regular faculty member a partial leave of absence without pay to minimize retrenchment of faculty at the college/university will not result in a reduction in the seniority credit for the faculty member taking the leave. These agreements must be verified by appropriate documentation. Effective September 1, 1983, the provisions of the CBA shall apply.
Explanation: This Guideline protects faculty who took such leaves to help colleagues from the loss of seniority credit and the possible penalty that might result from this reduction hr service credit.
127
U. Prospective Application
Effective with the 1983-84 academic year, the original date of appointment and the accrual of seniority credit will begin with the first day on the payroll in regular, full-time status during the academic year.
Explanation: This Guideline establishes a uniform starting date for all future faculty throughout the State System of Higher Education.
128

The pro-rated seniority credit for that semester will be equated to the proportion of the normal workload which the faculty member worked. For example, a faculty member who worked a one-half (1/2) workload and took a one-half (1/2) LWOP would earn one-half (1/2) credit for that semester.
3.	Beginning in the fall of 1985, a full seniority credit will be granted for up to eight (8) semesters for any semester that a regular, full-time faculty member is on a full or partial LWOP granted by the President of his/her University.

Such partial seniority credit shall be calculated pursuant to paragraph 2 of tins Section.
5.	Beginning in the fall of 1993, any faculty member employed at any State System of Higher Education University, who accepts a leave without pay from his/her institution and then accepts employment as a manager at any of the universities hi the State System of Higher Education or the Office of the Chancellor, will accrue one-half (1/2) seniority credit per semester during the time period as a manager.
B.	Educational Leave Without Pay— Seniority does accrue for ELWOP granted prior to August 1, 1970 and subsequent to fall 1985 pursuant to Section A above.
C.	Military Leave—Seniority does accrue during periods of military leave.

who returns to the bargaining unit within three (3) years of his/her appointment to a management position.
2.	Seniority does not accrue for the time spent as a manager.
3.	A faculty member who has served three (3) or more years as a manager shall
begin his/her service in the bargaining unit with no seniority credit. This manager will also receive a date of appointment corresponding to his/her first day on the payroll as a faculty member subsequent to his/her service as a manager and will also receive an appropriate seniority number for that year.
4.	Seniority does accrue for service as an acting manager.
M.	Resignation—Seniority terminates upon resignation.
