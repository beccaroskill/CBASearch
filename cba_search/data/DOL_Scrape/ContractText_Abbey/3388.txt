AGREEMENT
THIS AGREEMENT made and entered into this_____day of OCTOBER , 2002, by
and between the CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT, an Illinois municipal corporation (herein referred to as the “District”), and the SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 73, SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, AFL-CIO (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”).
PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, the District has voluntarily endorsed the practices and procedures of collective negotiations as a fair and orderly way of conducting its relations with its employees insofar as such negotiations, practices and procedures are appropriate to the primary obligation of the District to operate effectively in a responsible and efficient manner, and,
WHEREAS, the Union has traditionally represented District employees and the District is convinced that a substantial majority of the employees covered by this Agreement desire the Union to represent them for purposes of collective bargaining and contract administration matters; and,
WHEREAS, the District recognizes its obligations to bargain collectively with the Union under the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (IPLRA); and
WHEREAS, this Agreement is entered into to prevent strikes and lockouts and to help ensure that District costs are as low as possible consistent with fair wages and conditions for employees; and,
WHEREAS, it is the intent and purpose of the parties to set forth herein their entire Agreement covering rates of pay, wages, hours and conditions of employment, to increase the efficiency and productivity of employees in the District, to provide for managerial flexibility, and to provide for prompt and fair settlement of certain grievances, without interruption or other interference with the operations of the District; and
WHEREAS, both parties mutually agree that their objective is for the good and welfare of the District and its employees alike; that in the interest of collective bargaining and harmonious relations, and to promote a professional working environment in which the parties treat each other with dignity and respect, they will, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions as hereinafter set forth and agreed upon; and that all personnel covered by this Agreement will seek to maintain public trust as persons governed by the high ideals of honor and integrity in all their public and personal conduct.
200626.4
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties do mutually covenant and agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
Recognition
Section 1.1.	Description of Unit. The District recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the purpose of establishing wages, hours and conditions of employment for all employees of the District who occupy positions in the job classifications described in Appendix 1 of this Agreement. The parties agree that such recognition and the terms of this contract exclude all other employees, all supervisors (as defined in the IPLRA) not historically recognized or included by job classification in Appendix 1, confidential employees, shortterm employees and executive heads of a department. The parties agree that the bargaining unit shall include regularly employed part-time employees, provided that the following provisions of this Agreement shall not apply to part-time employees who are regularly scheduled to work less than twenty (20) hours per week: Articles XX to XXII, and XXVI and Sections 28.1 (b) and 28.1 (c).
Section 1.2.	New Classifications. The District agrees that if any new classification(s) should be established for the same or similar work presently being performed by those classifications identified in Appendix 1, it will notify the Union prior to implementation of the new classification and will meet with the Union to discuss the nature of the duties of the newly established position(s) and the appropriateness of the inclusion of the title in the Local 73 bargaining unit. The District and Union agree to continue their discussions regarding the creation of the merged classifications of Recreational Specialist I, II and III, Maintenance Specialist I, II and III, and Aquatic Safety Specialist I, II and III and accompanying salary schedules in the TQLMC. The District agrees that it will not implement such merged classifications and salary schedules during the term of this Agreement without the written agreement of the Union.
Section 1.3.	Active Titles. The job classifications set forth in Appendix 1 are for descriptive purposes only. Their use is neither an indication nor a guarantee that these classifications or titles will continue to be utilized by the District. If a title has not been filled for over five years, it will be eliminated from Appendix 1, Schedule B, but not from the bargaining unit. If the title or substantially equivalent job is subsequently resurrected and/or renamed, it is understood that such title or job will be part of the historical bargaining unit provided the duties are substantially the same as the former title.
2
200626.4
ARTICLE II
Gender
Wherever the male gender is used in the Agreement, it shall be construed to include both male and female employees.
ARTICLE III
Dues Checkoff and Indemnification
Section 3.1.	Checkoff. Upon receipt of a signed authorization from an employee (in a form approved by the District), the regular monthly dues of the Union shall be forwarded each calendar month to the appropriate officer of the Union together with a list of the names and amounts for whom deductions have been made. If the employee has no earnings due for that paycheck, the Union shall be responsible for collecting said dues.
Section 3.2.	Union Indemnification. The Union shall indemnify and save harmless the District and its officers, agents and employees against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability(monetary or otherwise) and for all legal costs that may arise out of, or by reason of, any action taken or not taken by the District, its officers, agents, and employees in the course of or for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this Article. If an improper deduction is made, the Union shall refund any such amount directly to the involved employee.
ARTICLE IV
Agency Shop and Fair Share
Section 4.1.	Duty and Amount of Fair Share Payments. It is recognized that the Union owes the same responsibility and duties to all employees, that is, to provide equal rights, representation and services to all persons covered by this Agreement, Whether or not they are members of the Union, and to represent all such persons fully and fairly. Consequently, all employees covered by this Agreement shall, as a condition of continued employment with the District, either (1) become a member of the Union and pay to the Union regular Union dues and fees; or (2) pay to the Union agency fees in the amount of 85% of the Union’s regular monthly dues as the non-member’s proportionate share of the Union’s costs of collective bargaining, contract administration and pursuit of matters concerning employee wages, hours and conditions of employment. Fair share contributions shall be deducted from such employee’s pay and forwarded to the Union at the same time and in the same manner as set forth in Section 3.1 herein.

The same shall apply to fair share fee payers who have deductions based upon their employment status.
Further, the District agrees to provide the Union with a list or disk which reflects promotions from hourly to monthly status for Local 73 titles on a quarterly basis. The disk shall include: 1) employee’s name; 2) previous employment status; 3) previous dues or fair share deduction amount; 4) present deduction amount; 5) present work location; 6) social security number; 7) date of hire; 8) date of change in employment status; and 9) date of adjustment in dues or fair share deduction amount.
It is expressly understood and agreed that the Union is obligated to timely advise the District of changes in dues or fair share rates.
Section 4.3.	Failure to Pay Dues or Fees. Payment of Union dues or agency fees shall commence upon the date of hire or the effective date of this Agreement, whichever shall occur later. Employees who fail to comply with the requirements of this Article shall be discharged by the District within twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of a written notice from the Union to the employee with a copy to the District, indicating that such dues or fees are owed and have not been paid. If the employee makes the required payment, discharge shall not occur.
Section 4.4.	Bona Fide Religious Belief. Employees who are members of a church or religious body having a bona fide religious tenet or teaching which prohibits the payment of an agency shop or fair share contribution to a Union shall be required to pay an amount equal to their fair share of Union dues, as described in Section 4.1, to a nonreligious charitable organization mutually agreed upon by the Union and the affected, involved employee, as set forth in the IPLRA.
Section 4.5.	Indemnification. The Union shall indemnify and save harmless the District and its officers, agents and employees against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability (monetary or otherwise) and for all legal costs that may arise out of, or by reason of, any action taken or not taken by the District, its officers, agents and employees against any and all claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability (monetary or otherwise) and for all legal costs that may arise out of, or by reason of, any action taken or not taken by the District, its officers, agents and employees or the Union, its, officers,

The Union and the District agree that Stewards must obtain their supervisor’s approval when they intend to leave their work area to represent bargaining unit members. The Stewards shall log in and out of their own location, and/or any other location, if their business takes them out of their own location, and indicate the time they are leaving and the nature of their business (including the name of the member, if applicable) and the time they return.

Subcontracting
Section 10.1.	General Policy. It is the general policy of the District to continue to utilize its employees who are covered by the terms of this Agreement to perform work they are qualified to perform. The District may subcontract where circumstances warrant.
Section 10.2.	Notice and Discussion. Except where an emergency situation exists, before the District changes its policy involving the overall subcontracting of work in a general area, where such policy change amounts to a significant deviation from past practice, the District will notify the Union at least fourteen (14) days prior to the issuance of a RFP or RFQ relating to the subcontracting out of any work traditionally within the jurisdiction of the Union and the District will notify the union at least thirty (30) days prior to the final approval of any change-order to an existing agreement if the change-order involves additional subcontracting out of work traditionally within the jurisdiction of the Union. Notice will be given to afford the Union an opportunity to meaningfully discuss the matter. Nothing in this section is intended to affect the Union's right to bargain the effects of subcontracting work within the jurisdiction of Local 73. Discussions between the Union
8
200626.4
and District pursuant to this Section shall be held in the context of the Total Quality Labor/Management Committee under Article XI. The District and the Union shall examine subcontracting situations to determine how such work could alternatively be, or continue to be, performed by the District. The Committee shall meet in accordance with Section 11.6 to examine those contracts, including, but not limited to, JOC contracts and subcontracts involving bargaining unit work currently in progress or planned. The District will work cooperatively with the Union so that the Union may submit proposals on such matters.
ARTICLE XI
Total Quality Labor/Management Committee
The District and the Union agree to the implementation of a Total Quality Labor/Management Committee ("TQLMC"). This Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives from management and the Union, but the total number shall not exceed ten (10) employees. In addition, to promoting effective communication between the parties and a climate of constructive employee relations, the committee shall examine workplace practices, procedures and methods of promoting the quality and efficiency of services provided by Local 73 bargaining unit members.
Section 11.1.	Quality of Service. The parties acknowledge the important role each has in the provision of the highest quality of services to the citizens and residents of Chicago and hereby agree to address issues related to the provision of such services through the provisions of this Article.
Section 11.2.	Composition of Committee. Therefore, the parties agree to the implementation of a Total Quality Labor Management Committee (TQLMC). Said committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives from both management and the Union. Employees who serve on this committee shall not suffer loss of pay or benefits as a result of their participation. The District’s Director of Human Resources and the Union’s Director of the Park District Division shall be members of the Committee.
Section 11.3.	Communication, (a) In addition to continuing effective communication between the parties and promoting a climate of constructive employee relations, the Committee shall examine workplace safety, practices and procedures and methods of promoting the quality and efficiency of services, including staffing allocations, provided by Local 73 bargaining unit members. The parties also agree to continue their discussions regarding the feasibility of implementing the SEIU COPE Deduction in the TQLMC.
9
200626.4
(b) The parties acknowledge that the TQLMC's efforts will be particularly appropriate where there has been a modification of the mission or goals of the District as a result of statutory budgetary, policy or technological change or reorganization and also, where there is evidence of need for review based upon the experience and/or needs of Park Patrons, management or the employees. In the event the District desires to change the maximum accumulation of compensatory time under Section 19.7, the District shall submit the issue to the Total Quality Labor/Management Committee in accordance with this Article and obtain the Union’s agreement before implementing such a change.
Section 11.4.	Priority Placement for Displaced Employees. If there is any displacement of bargaining unit employees as a result of the implementation of the changes recommended by the TQLMC, and/or any other re-engineering efforts by the District, the District agrees, where possible, to provide displaced employees with prioritized options for placement in positions covered by the Local 73 Agreement for which the employee is qualified, elsewhere within the system.
Section 11.5.	Employee Retention and Other Recommendations. For the purpose of supporting employee retention, the TQLMC will make recommendations regarding the establishment of a job placement program and training, or retraining, opportunities for displaced workers whether or not such displacement arises from the Committee's workplace quality recommendations. Said recommendations shall be submitted to the District's General Superintendent for consideration and response. The Superintendent shall report to the Committee on the status of a recommendation within thirty days of receiving the recommendation. Decisions on recommendations by the TQLMC shall be reasonable and accompanied by supporting rationale.
Section 11.6.	Schedule of Meetings. Meetings of the TQLMC shall be scheduled at regular intervals (at least monthly). The first meeting shall take place on 4-30-96, and it is agreed that the topic to be addressed at the first meeting shall be subcontracting of bargaining unit work. The District further agrees that it will work cooperatively with the Union at that time to determine how such work could alternatively be, or continue to be, performed by bargaining unit employees of the District.
io
200626.4
ARTICLE XII
Employee Discipline
Section 12.1.	Employee Discipline. The District agrees that an allegation of the misapplication of its rules and regulations shall be subject to the grievance procedure. The District shall not discharge, suspend or otherwise discipline any post-probationary employee without just cause. The District further agrees to follow the progressive discipline principle when disciplinary action is taken. Progressive discipline is defined herein as a process by which disciplinary action is applied in several steps of increasing severity and shall culminate, if warranted, in dismissal. The usual sequence of progressive discipline is oral reprimand, written reprimand, suspension and dismissal. However, the District may determine that an act is sufficiently severe to warrant a departure from the progressive discipline principle. In such cases, progressive discipline will not apply.
Section 12.2.	Disciplinary Measures. Oral and written reprimands are not grievable. Instead, they may be appealed to the supervisor's immediate supervisor for review and final determination. Appeals must be made within fifteen (15) consecutive business days after the employee is notified of the oral or written reprimand. The supervisor's supervisor, or his designee, shall arrange a meeting to discuss the appeal within ten (10) business days after receipt of the appeal. Employees must be made aware of the issuance of oral and/or written reprimands within fifteen (15) business days of the alleged infraction. Failure to do so shall void said discipline and it shall be expunged from the employee's record.
Oral reprimands that are more than six (6) months old shall not constitute prior disciplinary action if there are no repeated infractions of the same or similar offense within that time period. Written reprimands that are more than one (1) year old shall not constitute prior disciplinary action if there are no repeated infractions of the same or similar offense within that time period. Suspensions that are more than eighteen (18) months old shall not constitute prior disciplinary action if there are no repeated infractions of the same or similar offense within that time period. Such discipline shall be removed from the employee’s file after the designated period has expired.
If a suspension or discharge may be warranted, a Corrective Action Meeting (“CAM”) is scheduled. The District shall notify, in writing, the Union and the employee at least five (5) business days in advance of the meeting date. Upon a showing of good cause, the Union or the employee may request an extension of not more than three business (3) days. Extensions shall not be unreasonably denied.

If the District cannot make a discipline decision within thirty (30) calendar days following an emergency suspension, the District will convene a status meeting with the Union and the employee, on or before the forty-fifth (45th) calendar day following the suspension. The District will make reasonable efforts to limit emergency suspensions to thirty (30) calendar days and, in any event, no more than ninety (90) calendar days before the discipline decision is made. It is understood that in all disciplinary hearings by the Personnel Board, the accused shall not be required to testify prior to the presentation of all evidence relied upon by the District to support its charges.

Safety
The District will continue to make reasonable provisions for the maintenance of safe working conditions and health protection for all employees, including those covered by Local 73.

It will be the responsibility of both employees and supervisors to report unsafe and unhealthy work conditions. Employees shall comply with safety work rules and regulations and supervisors and employees shall report accidents promptly to their supervisors and to the Medical Department. Supervisors shall assist employees in seeking medical attention and shall complete accident reports within twenty-four (24) hours of the incident.

Each employee has the responsibility for following the correct safety procedures at all times and for informing his supervisor if further training will be helpful. The District will issue the appropriate safety equipment for each job. The District will instruct employees on the use of safety equipment. Employees are required to wear the prescribed safety equipment at all times, where such equipment is required. The District will impose sanctions on any employee who does not wear the safety equipment or on the supervisor who does not follow the procedures herein. These sanctions may include one of the following: oral reprimand, written reprimand, suspension or discharge.
It is agreed that when and where a District employee is required to wear safety shoes or boots, they will be provided by the District on an "as needed" basis, but not to exceed one pair every year for full time year round employees and one pair every two years for seasonal employees. Whether or not a new pair of safety shoes or boots is needed shall be reserved to the discretion of the District, however, the District shall not exercise its discretion in this regard in an arbitrary manner.
It is understood and agreed that employees will properly maintain their safety shoes or boots, and that employees must follow the reasonable procedures the District will implement for procuring new safety shoes and/or boots.

200626.4
Further, a safety committee shall be formed no later than one (1) month following the execution of this Agreement and shall be comprised of a representative number of bargaining unit employees (not to exceed five (5), and management personnel. There shall be a chairperson designated by both the Union and the District. All applicable Union and management participants shall be notified, in writing, of the names, work locations and work telephone numbers of committee members, as well as the work address of the designated chairperson.
It shall be mandatory for the committee to meet at a minimum of once per quarter for the purpose of addressing employee safety concerns. The District will review all safety concerns and/or complaints and work in good faith to resolve the issues in a reasonable and timely fashion. All written complaints shall be addressed to the designated chairperson and responded to, in writing, within twenty (20) business days of their receipt. If the committee is unable to resolve safety disputes, said disputes shall be subject to the grievance procedure, provided they involve an alleged violation of the express language or intent of any express provision of this Agreement. The time limit for filing a formal grievance shall not begin until the parties agree that an impasse is reached. Time limits may be extended by mutual agreement for good cause.
ARTICLE XIV
Residency
All employees are required, as a condition of their continued employment with the District, to comply with the residency requirements as set forth in Chapter 5, Section C of the Chicago Park District Code.
ARTICLE XV
Secondary Employment

Grievance Procedure
Section 16.1.	Definition. A grievance is a dispute or difference of opinion raised by an employee or the Union against the District involving an alleged violation of the express language or the intent of any express provision of this Agreement.
Section 16.2.	Informal Attempt at Resolution. An employee may, prior to filing a formal grievance, discuss any complaint or concern relating to his employment with his supervisor in an effort to resolve the matter. The informal discussion may include a Union Representative, upon the employee's request and the supervisor's approval. It is understood that the time limit for filing a formal grievance shall not begin until the informal process is concluded.
Section 16.3.	Time limits for Filing. No grievance shall be entertained or processed unless it is submitted, in writing, within fifteen (15) business days after the employee concerned became aware, or should have become aware through the use of reasonable diligence, of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the alleged grievance. If a grievance is not presented within the time limits set forth above, it shall be considered "waived." If the grievance is not appealed to the next step within the specified time limits set forth above, or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof, it shall be considered settled on the basis of the District's last answer. If the District does not answer a grievance or an appeal thereof within the specified time limits, the Union may elect to treat the grievance as denied at that step and immediately appeal the grievance to the next step. The time limits in each step may be extended by mutual written agreement of the District and the Union Representative involved in each step. Requests for extensions shall not be unreasonably denied. The term "business days" used in this Article shall mean the days Monday through Friday, inclusive, and shall exclude Saturdays, Sundays and those holidays on which the District's Administration Building is closed.

All arbitration hearings shall be held in Chicago, Illinois unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.
(b) Limitations On Authority of The Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall act in a judicial, not legislative, capacity and shall have no right to amend, modify, nullify, ignore, add to, or subtract from the provisions of this Agreement.

The arbitrator may consider more than one grievance at a time if mutually agreed by the parties.
In the event the arbitrator finds a violation of the terms of this Agreement, he shall fashion an appropriate remedy so long as the remedy is not beyond the scope of the parties' contractual agreement. The arbitrator shall be without power to make a decision contrary to, inconsistent with, modifying or varying in any way the application of laws and rules and regulations having the force and effect of law on the District or any District ordinance. The arbitrator shall submit, in writing, his decision within sixty (60) calendar days following the close of the hearing or the submission of briefs by the parties, whichever is later, unless the parties mutually agree to a written extension. The arbitrator's decision shall be based solely upon his interpretation of the meaning or application of the express terms of this Agreement to the facts of the grievance presented. A decision rendered consistent with the terms of this Agreement shall be final and binding on all parties.

In the case of a settlement or "split decision," the parties shall equally share the fees and expenses of the arbitrator. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall include the cost of a written transcript for the arbitrator. The party seeking a continuance or postponement of an arbitration shall bear the related fees and expenses. The parties may mutually agree to continue or postpone an arbitration for good cause, in which case the fees and expenses shall be divided equally between the parties.
Section 16.7.	Personnel Board. It is expressly understood and agreed that, except as provided in Section 12.3 hereof, suspensions and discharges shall not be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in this Article and shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Personnel Board of the District as provided by the Illinois Compiled Statutes (1992) and the Illinois Revised Statutes (1991) and the applicable provisions of the Personnel rules and procedures as such rules and procedures may be adopted or from time to time be modified, and the provisions for appeal set forth in Section 12.3 herein.

200626.4
ARTICLE XVIII
Seniority
Section 18.1.	Definition. Seniority shall, for the purpose of this Agreement, except as provided below, be defined as an employee's length of continuous service in that title since the employee's last entry in that title. Park District seniority (District seniority) shall be defined as an employee’s length of continuous service with the Park District.
Section 18.2.	Application of Seniority.
a)	In the application of seniority for promotions, District seniority shall be the determining factor when, among bargaining unit employees involved, the qualifications, skills and abilities to perform the work in question is relatively equal. The application of seniority (time in title) shall also be the determining factor when scheduling vacations.
(b	) For purposes of layoff, recall and bumping rights, seniority shall be as defined above except when an employee has worked in the same title with Career Service on more than one occasion, in which case the employee's seniority for purposes of layoff, recall and bumping rights shall be the employee's single longest period of Career Service in the title. Seniority, as thus defined, shall be applied in all cases of layoff and recall in that the least senior employee(s) in the affected job classification shall be laid off first and the most senior employee in the affected job classification shall be called back first.
Section 18.3.	Termination of Seniority. Seniority shall be terminated for any of the following reasons:
(a)	Resignation or retirement;
(b)	Discharge for cause;
(c)	Failure to return to work upon the end of a leave of absence or vacation;
(d)	Absence from work because of layoff for a period of time in excess of twenty-four (24) months or the length of the employee's seniority, whichever is shorter;
(e)	Failure to notify the District within one (1) week of the employee's intent to report to work upon recall from layoff, provided that a notice to report for work is sent by registered or certified mail or by telegram to the employee's last known address.
19
200626.4
(f)	Absence from work for any reason other than layoff, including but not limited to work related and non-work related injuries and illnesses, for a period in excess of twelve (12) months.
(g)	Absence from work without notification to the Department Head or Supervisor for two (2) consecutive workdays for security guards and employees in the Beaches and Pool unit and three (3) consecutive workdays for all other employees, except for just cause.
Section 18.4.	Probationary Period. (a) All new employees and those hired after loss of seniority shall be considered probationary employees until they have completed one hundred eighty (180) days. During the employee's probationary period, the employee shall not have access to the grievance procedure. There shall be no seniority among probationary employees. Upon successful completion of the probationary period, an employee shall acquire seniority which shall be retroactive to his last date of hire with the District in a position covered by this Agreement. Probationary employees can be discharged without the right to appeal, except where allegations are made regarding discrimination as described in Article VIII, Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, in which case employees shall have the right to take their claim to the District's EEO Administrator who will investigate the complaint pursuant to the Human Rights Ordinance, as it would for any post-probationary employee. No complaint alleging a violation of Section 8.1, 8.2 or both shall operate as a stay or otherwise prevent the discharge of a probationary employee in accordance with this Section.
(b) Employees who are promoted may be demoted back to their former job title during the first one hundred twenty (120) days in their new position without the right to grieve the demotion.
Section 18.5.	Filling of Vacancies.
A.	Determination of Permanent Vacancies
(1)	The District shall determine if there is a permanent vacancy to be filled and at any time before said vacancy is filled whether said vacancy shall be filled. If the District determines not to fill a vacancy, the District shall so notify the Union and all bargaining unit applicants and provide a reason.
(2)	A vacancy is defined as an opening in a position that the District decides to fill. An opening may result from various factors, such as the addition of new positions and/or classifications, reassignments, promotions, bidding out or separation for any reason.
20
200626.4
(3)	It is the goal of the District, and the purpose of this Section, to provide employees of the District with the opportunity to compete for promotional vacancies, to provide for upward mobility for employees and to enhance the District’s ability to fully and effectively utilize currently qualified and skilled personnel throughout the organization.
(4)	For purposes of this Section, seniority shall be defined as an employee’s length of continuous service with the District.
B.	Transfer Request Procedure
(1)	For purposes of this Section, a transfer is defined as a permanent change in the payroll cost center or location code to which the employee is assigned.
(2)	The District maintains the right to transfer employees where it is necessary to increase efficient operations and production. The District shall give employees written notification of the intent to transfer five (5) business days prior to the effective date of said transfer. At no time shall employees be involuntarily transferred for disciplinary reasons. With the exception of employees in supervisor, instructor and lifeguard classifications or titles, the District shall select the least senior employee for transfer within the employee’s region from among qualified employees in the same classification or title. With respect to employees in supervisor, instructor and lifeguard classifications or titles, an involuntary transfer of such an employee shall be limited to no more than twice per calendar year and shall not result in loss of pay, unless the transfer is for performance based reasons.
(3)	An employee may request a transfer by completing and submitting a copy of a transfer request, on a form provided by the District, to his supervisor and the Director of Human Resources. Transfer requests are effective for one (1) calendar year. Employees shall submit transfer requests by December 1 of each year for transfers desired in the following calendar year. Employees filing multiple requests and accepting or rejecting a transfer shall only be allowed a single transfer in the twelve (12) month period. Employees shall receive a copy of all requests filed with date of receipt noted on the copy.
(4)	Transfer requests by incumbent employees shall take precedence over nonbargaining unit applicants.
(5)	When filling a vacancy, the District shall select the most senior employee in the job classification who has a valid transfer request on file prior to any notice of posting being sent to the Union, provided the employee has the present ability to perform the required work with reasonable orientation without further training. The District shall give the Union a list of newly transferred employees by department once a quarter.
21
200626.4
C.	Recall
(1)	When filling a vacancy and there are no said employees who have transfer requests on file prior to any notice of posting being sent to the Union, the District shall select the employee in the job classification from the recall list, if any, in accordance with Section 18.8 of this Agreement.
D.	Posting and Bidding
(1)	When filling a vacancy and there are no said employees who have transfer requests on file prior to any notice of posting being sent to the Union, and there are no eligible employees on said recall or reinstatement lists, the District shall post the job for bidding.
(2)	Employees may bid on jobs the District determines to be permanently vacant for promotion. The notice of a District-determined permanent vacancy shall be posted at the Administration Building, each Regional Office and other appropriate locations including the Park District web site as determined by the District for a minimum of 14 days. The posting shall contain at least the following: job title, qualifications, work location, if known, and rate of pay and shall include all additional duties and qualifications reasonably required to fulfill the needs of the District for hiring into the particular position. The Union shall receive notice of such posting at least one (1) day prior to the opening of such posting. The District shall also maintain a telephone recording listing all permanent vacancies and update the recording on a weekly basis. The telephone number shall be posted in the same manner as vacancy notices. Each work site and service yard shall post a list of such permanent vacancies. If a posting is rescinded or re-posted after rescission, the Union and all bidders shall be notified in writing.
(3)	All applicants for District-determined permanent vacant jobs must meet the minimum qualifications for the job in order to be considered for selection by the District.
(4)	In making selections, the District shall give a priority to employee applicants over non-employee applicants, unless the non-employee applicants have demonstrably greater skill and ability to fulfill the needs relevant to the job as reasonably determined by the District. Among employee applicants, monthly and hourly employees shall have a priority over seasonal employees who have worked a minimum of two seasons in two consecutive years in every instance; and seasonal employees who have worked a minimum of two seasons in two consecutive years shall be given a priority over all other seasonal employee applicants and non-employee applicants. In the event such other current or former seasonal employees apply for vacant positions for which they are qualified, their previous seasonal experience with the District will be a factor taken into consideration by the District, provided they reach the final phase of the selection process.
22
200626.4
(5)	Where employee applicants are relatively equally qualified to perform the work required, the District shall select the most senior employee of those applying. “Relatively equally qualified” shall be based upon only bona fide job-related criteria including skill, experience, performance, training and education. Once an employee received a job under the bid procedure, he/she shall receive no further bid preference under this subsection for 12 months. Nothing herein shall require the District to interview less senior bidders for a vacancy if the District determines during the selection process that a more senior bidder should be awarded the vacancy.
(6)	Applicants who are not selected shall be so notified by the District within ten (10) business days after the vacancy is filled and provided a reason. If the employee desires to discuss further his/her candidacy for the position that was filled, the employee may contact the Director of Human Resources for a meeting. A copy of the bid list, with seniority dates and the name of the successful bidder identified, shall be sent to the Union. A successful bidder may not bid for another District determined permanent vacancy for one (1) year.
(7)	During the bidding and/or selection process set forth in this Section, the District may temporarily fill said vacancy for no more than ninety (90) days.
E.	Retreat
(1)	During the first 45 days in the new position, the District may return the employee who is transferred, appointed or the successful bidder to his former job classification or location for cause.
(2)	An employee who is voluntarily transferred, appointed or promoted shall, for a period of 14 days, be permitted to return to his/her former job classification in the bargaining unit.
Section 18.6.	Working Out of Classification. Any employee covered by this Agreement who is directed or permitted to perform substantially all of the duties and responsibilities of a higher paid classification for more than ten (10) consecutive work days, shall be paid at the higher pay rate retroactive to the first day of the consecutive ten-day period for as long as they continue to perform the higher rated duties. If the District continues to direct or permit an employee to perform substantially all of the duties and responsibilities of a higher paid classification for more than 120 days, except where the regular incumbent is on a leave of absence, in which it shall be six (6) months, the District shall post and fill the position as a permanent vacancy under this Article. If the employee who has been paid for acting in a higher paid classification is also the successful bidder when the position is posted as a permanent vacancy, the said employee’s seniority date for purposes of time-in-title shall be the date the employee initially was paid for acting in the higher-paid classification, provided the employee has continued to perform the higherrated job without interruption.
23
200626.4
All bargaining unit employees shall have the right to request, from their immediate non-bargaining unit supervisor, that an audit be performed by the Department of Personnel to determine if their position is appropriately classified. The request shall be in writing, dated and shall include the employee's name, the employee's supervisor's name, the work location, the employee's current job classification, a description of the duties currently performed and the requested job classification. The supervisor, in conjunction with the department head, shall review the request and determine whether such request shall be submitted to the Department of Personnel for processing. The denial of an employee's request to process a job audit shall not prohibit an employee from filing a working out of classification grievance. Approved requests shall be processed as expeditiously as possible, but not more than forty-five (45) calendar days after the request is received. Time limits for processing working out of classification audit requests or grievances may be extended for good cause by written mutual agreement between the District and the Union. Such requests may be initiated by the bargaining unit employee or the Union. The District may institute a job audit without a request. The Department of Personnel shall, upon receipt of a request initiated by an employee, forward a copy of the request to the Union office.
Section 18.7.	Seniority Roster. The District shall maintain and keep current a seniority roster noting the employee's date of hire, current position by job title and date entering the title. Any objection to the seniority roster as provided shall be reported in writing to the District within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the seniority roster is provided to the Union or the roster shall stand approved as provided.
Section 18.8.	Layoff and Recall. The District, in its discretion, shall determine whether layoffs are necessary, unless it is clearly established that such a determination is arbitrary. Employees who are affected by layoffs shall be notified as soon as possible, but not less than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the layoff date. When employees are laid off, the order will be as follows:
(a)	Any seasonal employees in the affected job classification will first be separated;
(b)	Next, hourly employees in the affected job classification will be laid off
in reverse order of seniority. When two (2) or more hourly employees have the same seniority, the employee(s) regularly scheduled to work the lesser (least) number of hours will be laid off first.
(c)	Finally, monthly employees, in reverse order of seniority, will be the last to be laid off.
Employees who are laid off after January 29, 1996, shall be placed on a recall list for a period of two years. If there is a recall, employees in the affected job classification 24
200626.4
who are still on the recall list shall be recalled, in the reverse order of their layoff, provided that they are presently qualified to perform the work in the job classification without further training.
Employees who are eligible for recall shall be given fourteen (14) calendar days notice of recall and notice of recall shall be sent to the employee by certified or registered mail with a copy to the Union. The employee must notify the department head of his intention to return within one week after receiving notice of recall. The District shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligation by mailing the recall notice by registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by telegram to the mailing address provided by the employee, it being the obligation and responsibility of the employee to provide the department head with his latest mailing address.
Section 18.9.	Bumping Rights. An employee who would otherwise be laid off but has Career Service rights in any other title may, to avoid layoff, exercise bumping rights as set forth in the Personnel Board Rules, by displacing the most junior employee then occupying a position in that other title, who either lacks Career Service in the title, or who appears lower on the seniority list for that title than the employee who is exercising bumping rights. However, as set forth in the Personnel Board Rules, an employee may bump back only into the highest rated grade or title in which he or she has sufficient seniority to bump and displace an employee. If an employee elects not to bump back into that title, as set forth in the Personnel Board Rules, that employee's name then shall be stricken from the seniority list in that title, and he/she then forfeits further Career Service rights in that title.
ARTICLE XIX
Hours of Work and Overtime
Section 19.1.	Application. This Article is intended to define the normal hours of work per day or per week in effect at the time of the execution of this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week or as preventing the District, after notice to the Union and an offer of any opportunity to discuss the matter, from restructuring the normal workday or workweek, establishing new work schedules for employees or establishing part time positions; provided, however, that any employee qualified to do the work, as determined by the District, and who is covered by this Agreement, has been afforded an opportunity to perform the work before new employees are hired.
Section 19.2.	Normal Workweek and Workday. The normal workweek shall be five (5) consecutive days of employment and the normal workday shall be eight (8) consecutive hours for each day for all employees.
25
200626.4
Section 19.3.	Rest Periods. All employees shall receive at least one fifteen (15) minute rest period during each full workday. During work beyond the normal hours in a workday, employees shall receive breaks in the same intervals as received during a normal workday.
Section 19.4.	Meal Period. All employees, except upon mutual agreement, shall be granted a thirty (30) minute non-paid meal period during each regular workshift, but outside the normal eight hours of work time. Travel time is included in their lunch period. Whenever possible, the meal period shall be scheduled at the middle of each shift.
Section 19.5.	Changes in Normal Workweek and Workday. The shifts, workdays and hours to which employees are assigned shall be stated on a monthly work schedule. Should it be necessary, in the interest of efficient operations, to establish schedules departing from the normal workday or workweek, the District shall give notice of such change to the affected bargaining unit employee as far in advance as is reasonably practical, but not less than five (5) business days prior to the effective date of said change, except in unusual or emergency situations. Employees shall be notified in writing prior to any schedule change.
Section 19.6.	Overtime Authorization. Generally, overtime is not to be incurred. Under special or emergency conditions, overtime may be incurred, but only if specifically authorized by the Department head or his designee. Such overtime will result in compensatory time off and not in monetary payment to the extent permitted by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1985 in regulations issued pursuant to implementation by the U.S. Department of Labor.
Section 19.7.	Compensation for Overtime and Compensatory Time off. Any employee who is authorized to work overtime outside the normal workday or workweek, as defined in Section 19.2 of this Agreement, shall be compensated for such overtime as in the manner provided for below in this Section; provided, however, that payment for work performed on holidays shall be governed by the holiday pay provisions of Section 21.4 of this Agreement.
Any employee who works authorized overtime, as defined herein, shall be granted compensatory time off at the rate of 1.5 hours for each hour of overtime worked up to 240 hours (or 480 hours if the employee's work includes public safety, emergency response or seasonal activity within the meaning of Section 7(0) of the Fair Labor Standards Act as amended "FLSA"). Payment for overtime worked in excess of the above maximum shall be made in cash at 1.5 times the employee's regular rate of pay in effect at the time the employee earns the overtime.
The parties understand and agree that some bargaining unit employees accumulated compensatory time for overtime worked prior to April 15,1986, (the effective date of Section 7(0) of the FLSA). Therefore, the parties agree that all compensatory time 26
200626.4
earned by an employee at any time prior to April 15, 1986, shall be credited to the employee. However, said time will be available for use on an hour per hour basis, but is not compensable in the manner set forth by the FLSA regulations.
Any employee who has accumulated overtime may elect to use compensatory time for segments of less than one full workday upon written request. If an employee uses compensatory time after exceeding the FLSA limits, the time used will be deducted from the hours which are below said limits. Employees shall request compensatory time off as far in advance as is reasonably possible. Compensatory time off will be scheduled, insofar as possible and practical, at those times requested by each employee. However, because of the nature of the work, and the need to maintain orderly performance and continuity of District services, it may be necessary to limit or prohibit the taking of compensatory time during a particular period or at the same time. Under no circumstances shall such requests be discriminatorily denied.
It is understood further that the District may require any employee who has accumulated in excess of one hundred twenty (120) hours to take compensatory time off provided the following procedures are followed:
(a)	The District shall first notify employees in writing of the amount of time to be taken off within ninety (90) days;
(b)	The employees shall then be given thirty (30) days within which to select particular day(s) or time(s) the employees' desire to take time off within the ninety (90) day period. Such requests shall be submitted, in writing, by the employee. A writtenjresponse to said request shall be provided to the employee by his or her supervisor within five (5) business days from the date of the request. During the months of October to and including April, absent emergency or extraordinary circumstances, employee requests shall be granted. During the months of May through and including September, such requests shall be granted if consistent with the operational needs of the District. Under no circumstances shall such requests be unreasonably or discriminatorily denied.
J

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT AND
SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 73
RE:	Credit Checks
All applicants for a position in the Finance department or for a playground or park supervisor position must pass a credit check before obtaining the position.
The District will comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and with all applicable state and federal laws in reviewing credit reports. When evaluating a credit history, the District is principally concerned with past due obligations, foreclosures, active collection proceedings and pending judgments. The amount or number of such delinquent obligations is weighed against the access the employee would have in the new position to cash, check stock, or other liquid assets of the District.
A history of past credit problems (with no current issues) is generally not considered relevant depending upon the amount of time that has passed between the most recent problem and the date of application.
A pattern of bad debt, judgments, foreclosures or bankruptcies over the course of several years is considered when the employee is seeking a position requiring the management of District assets or budgeting, or if the employee would have access to District cash or check stock.
The District is not concerned with the amount of outstanding obligations or debt of any applicant, so long as all obligations are current.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 73
RE:	Job Qualifications

There shall be a temporary waiver for the requirement of a bachelor’s degree for the playground supervisor position for a period of six (6) years for applicants that have been employed by the Park District as an instructor for at least six (6) years. This temporary waiver may be extended for extenuating circumstances.
Also, effective upon the execution of this Agreement, a bachelor’s degree in physical education, recreation and leisure, social services, education, special education, child development or comparable major shall be required for new hires in the position of monthly instructors. However, this requirement shall not apply to those applicants for monthly instructor positions who were hourly instructors on the date of the execution of this Agreement. There also shall be a temporary waiver for the requirement of a bachelor’s degree for the monthly physical instructor position for a period of four (4) years for applicants that have been employed in a year round Park District recreation position for at least five (5) years. This temporary waiver may be extended for extenuating circumstances.

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 73
RE: DISCIPLINE
I.	CORRECTIVE ACTION MEETING
The parties agree that the following replaces the Procedures section of the Chicago Park District Code of Conduct.
The parties agree that employee misconduct or performance issues shall be approached in the following manner: a supervisor of the employee shall respond to the misconduct or poor performance by inquiring into the matter. After the inquiry, a determination shall be made if an oral or written reprimand shall be issued, or if greater disciplinary action is warranted. If an oral or written reprimand is issued, then the appropriate section of the collective bargaining agreement shall govern.
If a suspension or discharge may be warranted, a Corrective Action Meeting (“CAM”) is scheduled. The District shall notify, by fax the Union and either verbally or by fax, the employee at least five (5) business days in advance of the meeting date. Upon a showing of good cause, the Union or the employee may request an extension of not more than three business (3) days. Extensions shall not be unreasonably denied.
The CAM shall be facilitated by the HR manager or his/her designee from the HR department. The goal of the meeting is for the HR representative to reach an agreed resolution of the situation. The CAM process shall be as follows: the HR representative gathers the facts regarding the situation. Based on the facts elicited, a Corrective Action Plan (“CAP”) shall be drafted. The CAP is an agreement signed by the parties that sets forth agreed future behaviors the parties will engage in to avoid this situation in the future. CAP agreements do not constitute discipline.
In addition, the HR representative shall determine if any disciplinary action, including but not limited to a suspension or termination, is appropriate pursuant to the Code of Conduct and the polices and procedures of the Park District. If a determination is made that a suspension or termination is warranted, the HR representative shall propose a Pre-Disciplinary Agreement to the employee and if applicable, his/her Union representative to resolve the matter. If an agreement is reached, the employee shall have seventy-two (72) hours thereafter to serve written notice of decision to revoke said agreement with his/her HR manager. If the agreement is not revoked by the employee, the matter shall be closed.
If the parties do not reach agreement or the employee revokes the agreement, discipline shall be promptly imposed on the employee and the matter shall be scheduled for an appeal. The procedures for appeals are outlined in Section 12.3 of the Agreement. The parties shall exchange the documents that they intend to use for the appeal within three business days of the CAM or the decision to revoke the Pre-Disciplinary Agreement. If, after the CAM, any party intends to use any other documents at the appeal, that party shall provide those documents to the other side at least three (3) business days before the appeal hearing.
200626.4
IL TABLE OF PENALTIES
The parties agree that the following table replaces Part 2 - Table of Penalties of the Guidelines for Discipline of the Chicago Park District Code of Conduct but shall not be applicable to emergency suspensions:
Group A - Termination for first offense, absent mitigating circumstances justifying a less serious penalty.
Group B - 1st offense: 3-5 day suspension; termination may be called in for appropriate cases
-	2nd offense: 5 day suspension or termination
Group C - 1st offense: oral, written, or 1 - 3 day suspension

MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CHICAGO PARK DISTRICT AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION, LOCAL 73
RE: Drug and Alcohol Policy
Section 1: Policy Statement
The Chicago Park District's essential mission is to provide services to its citizens and residents in a safe and economic manner. The parties to this Agreement recognize that drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace has a deleterious effect on the health and safety of employees, as well as their morale and productivity, all of which creates an undue burden on the persons which the Chicago Park District and the employees under this Agreement serve. Furthermore, the economic cost of providing health care services to employees who abuse drugs and alcohol has put an increasing burden on the Chicago Park District's finances.
The Employer and the Union maintain a strong commitment to protect people and property, and to provide a safe working environment. To this end, the employer has also established its confidential Employee Assistance Program for employees with personal problems, including alcohol and substance abuse, and the parties to this Agreement urge employees who have such problems to utilize the Program's services.
To maintain a workplace which provides a safe and healthy work environment for all employees, the following drug and alcohol program is also established.
Section!: Definitions
(a)	Alcohol: Ethyl alcohol.
(b)	Prohibited Items & Substances: All illegal drugs and controlled substances, alcoholic beverages, and drug paraphernalia in the possession of, being used by, an employee on the job or the premises of the Employer.
200626.4
(c)	Employer Premises: AU property, facilities, land, buildings, structures, automobiles, trucks and other vehicles owned, leased or used by the Employer as job sites or work locations and over which the Employer has authority as employer.
(d)	Employee: All persons covered by this Agreement.
(e)	Accident: An event resulting in injury to a person requiring medical attention or causing significant damage to property to which an employee contributed as a direct or indirect cause.
(f)	Reasonable Suspicion: Erratic or unusual behavior by an employee including but not limited to noticeable imbalance, incoherence and disorientation, which would lead a person of ordinary sensibilities to conclude that the employee is under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
(g)	Under the Influence: Any mental, emotional, sensory or physical impairment due to the use of drugs or alcohol.
(h)	Test: The taking and analysis of any body component sample, whether by blood, breath, urine, or in any other scientifically reliable manner, for the purpose of identifying, measuring or quantifying the presence or absence of drugs, alcohol, or any metabolite thereof.
Section 3:	Disciplinary Action
(a)	All employees must report to work in a physical condition that will enable them to perform their jobs in a safe manner. Further, employees shall not use, possess, dispense or receive prohibited items or substances on or at the Employer's premises, nor shall they report to work under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
(b)	When the Employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that an employee is under the influence of a prohibited substance, the Employer shall have the right to subject that employee to a drug and alcohol test. At the Employer's discretion, the employee may be placed on an emergency suspension with pay
200626.4
until test results are available. If the test results prove negative, the employee shall be reinstated. In all other cases, the Employer will terminate all employees who:
(i)	test positive for drug and/or alcohol use;
(ii)	refuse to cooperate with testing procedures (who will be subject to an emergency suspension until they are terminated);
(iii)	are found to be under the influence of alcohol, drugs or drug paraphernalia, or are found selling or distributing drugs or drug paraphernalia, on the Employer's premises.
Section 4:	Drug and Alcohol Testing
(a)	The Employer may require drug and/or alcohol testing under the following conditions:
(i)	where there is a reasonable suspicion that an employee has reported to work under the influence of or is at work under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
(ii)	a test may be required if an employee is involved in a workplace accident or fighting;
(iii)	a test may be required as part of a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for
substance abuse for up to a one-year period.
(iv)	where testing is required by state or federal government regulations or otherwise required by law.
(v)	random testing may be required of employees in the beaches and pools unit and security guards. The random testing shall be conducted in a manner consistent with the guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Transportation regulations for over the road truck drivers.
(vi)	a test may be required whenever an employee returns from an extended leave of absence or layoff of three months or longer.
(b)	Employees to be tested will be required to sign a consent form and chain of custody form, assuring proper documentation and accuracy. If an employee refuses to sign a consent form authorizing the test, he or she will be subject to termination.
(c)	Drug and alcohol testing will be conducted by an accredited independent laboratory and may consist of either blood or urine tests, or both. The Employer reserves the right to utilize a breathalyzer to test for the presence of alcohol, in lieu of other clinical testing.
200626.4
(d)	Initial and confirmatory test results which meet or exceed the cutoff levels for drugs set forth in the NIDA guidelines (and as they may be amended) shall be regarded as “positive," and shall presumptively establish that the tested employee was under the influence of drugs.
(e)	Initial and confirmatory (or breathalyzer) test results which meet or exceed the level of blood alcohol established in the Illinois Motor Vehicle Act as legal intoxication shall establish that the tested employee was under the influence of alcohol.
(f)	The cost of initial and confirmatory testing will be borne by the Employer.
(g)	Drug and alcohol test results shall be reported to the Director of Human Resources or his
designee in the manner to be prescribed by the Director of Human Resources. The Employee shall be notified of the test results in writing. The Director of Human Resources will inform the applicable department head of any employee who tests positive for alcohol or drugs, who in turn will initiate disciplinary proceedings under Section 3 above.
(h)	All urine or blood samples shall be taken in sufficient quantity as to allow for retesting. Any employee whose test result is positive may elect, at his or her expense, to be retested by the same or other laboratory satisfactory to the Director of Human Resources, provided that the Employer’s testing laboratory shall arrange for transmitting said sample to the second laboratory. Employees electing to be retested shall not be paid for the time between the initial positive test and the time of the retest. Positive results of said retesting shall be conclusive as to the presence of alcohol or drugs. The failure to take a sufficient sample, or to preserve such sample, to allow for retesting, shall not affect the removal from eligibility of an applicant or personnel action, including discharge, of any employee. If the retest is negative, the District shall reimburse the employee for the cost of the test and any loss of pay.
200626.4
(i)	No laboratory report or test results shall appear in the Employee's personnel file unless they are part of a personnel action under this program, but shall be placed in a special file maintained by the Director of
Human Resources, except as such disclosure may be required by this policy, law or ordinance.
Section 5:	Employee Assistance Program
Employees are encouraged to seek help for a drug or alcohol problem before it deteriorates into a disciplinary matter and may participate if they wish in a voluntaiy Employee Assistance Program. This article will not diminish any language to the contrary to the parties’ collective bargaining agreement.

RE: Orientation for Seasonal Employees
Dear Cathy:
This memorializes our agreement that, effective thirty (30) days after the signing of our 1995 -1998 Agreement, the Chicago Park District will begin deducting Union dues or fees from seasonal employees' pay in accordance with the Agreement from the first day of each such individual's employment. To the extent practicable, the District will schedule orientations for seasonal employees on the days designated for beaches and pools processing. Region orientations will be conducted to the extent practicable in large groups and the District will provide the Union with advance notice of the dates for orientation. The schedules for orientations will be worked out prior to the beginning of the session.
Where the Union is unable to attend the above orientations, the Union will have reasonable access to employees on the worksite, e.g., at the beginning or the end of the shifts or during lunch hours on pay days. The Union will train its Stewards so they can assist Business Representatives in this process.
When a signed dues authorization card already is on file with the District from a prior season for a returning seasonal employee, the District will continue to honor that card in the new season, unless the card is duly revoked.
Very Truly Yours,
Pamela A. Munizzi
Superintendent of Employment

RE: SALARY RANGE FOR PARK AND PLAYGROUND SUPERVISORS
Dear Cathy:
The parties have agreed to create a salary pay range up to an additional $10,000.00 for Park and Playground Supervisors, based upon certain criteria. The parties have bargained over the criteria. The parties will continue to discuss establishing similar salary ranges for other bargaining unit titles, only to occur on the mutual agreement of the parties. This subject will be on the agenda of the third TQLMC meeting.
If an agreement to include additional titles is reached, the District has agreed to accept the Union's recommendations regarding the inclusion of those titles in the order the Union submits them.
Very Truly Yours,
