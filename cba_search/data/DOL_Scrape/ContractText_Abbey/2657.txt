ARTICLE 3
DUES DEDUCTION
Section 1.	The Employer agrees to deduct the Union bi-weekly membership dues, initiation fees and assessments, if any, only from the bi-weekly pay of those employees who individually authorize in writing that such deductions be made. The amounts to be deducted shall be certified to the Employer by the Union, and the aggregate deductions of all employees shall be remitted together with an itemized statement thereof, to the Union by the last day of the succeeding month after such deductions are made. This authorization shall be irrevocable by the employee during the term of this Agreement except as provided for in Article 2.
When an authorization to deduct dues is revoked by the employee in accordance with Article 2, the Agency shall halt the check-off of dues effective the first full pay period following the expiration of this Agreement.

Section 1.	The workweek shall consist of five consecutive workdays in a pre-established work schedule except for employees in seven-day operations.
Section 2. The workday shall consist of any 24 hours in a pre-established work schedule, beginning with the scheduled reporting time for the employee's shift. In the event of an early a.m. or late p.m. community health activity in the Department of Health, the Employer may flex the starting and quitting time for an employee without incurring an overtime liability. In the event of a training program at an institution or facility, the Employer may flex the starting and quitting time for an employee who so volunteers without incurring an overtime liability. In all cases, the flex schedule must be posted two weeks in advance. The Employer agrees to consider concerns raised by the employee about the impact of the scheduled “flex”.

Section 4.	The regular hours of work for any shift shall be consecutive except that they may be interrupted by a meal period.
Section 5.	Except for emergencies, work schedules showing the employees' shifts, workdays, and hours shall be posted on appropriate bulletin boards at the employee's work site two weeks in advance.
An employee's request to schedule a certain day off due to an appointment with a physician or dentist or other personal business which is submitted four or more weeks in advance shall not be unreasonably denied.
Customary shift times and schedule patterns will not be arbitrarily changed. When changes are to be made by the Employer for other than emergency reasons, the Employer will meet and discuss with the Union prior to the implementation of such changes.
5
When work schedules are to be adopted for new programs, the Employer will meet and discuss with the Union prior to the implementation of such schedules.
A Department of Health employee whose regular work schedule is Monday through Friday throughout the year shall not have that work schedule changed to other than a Monday through Friday work schedule except for a legitimate operational reason which is not arbitrary or capricious.
Section 6.	Employees engaged in seven-day operations are defined as those employees working in an activity for which there is regularly scheduled employment seven days a week. For such employees, the work schedule shall consist of any ten days within any consecutive l4 calendar day period. Employees will not be scheduled for more than eight consecutive days or more than two consecutive weekends except in cases where the Employer and the employee mutually agree. Upon request of the Union, the parties shall meet and discuss at the local level issues relating to scheduling every other weekend off.
Employees who are employed at an MH or MR facility within the Department of Public Welfare will not be scheduled to work for more than seven consecutive days, nor will such employees be scheduled to work consecutive weekends, except in cases where the Employer and the employee mutually agree. In cases where the current established practice at a specific MH or MR facility is to schedule employees to work fewer consecutive days or fewer weekends, such practice shall be maintained.
Section 7.	The number of consecutive days and consecutive weekends set forth in Section 6 above is maximum and should be reduced where such a reduction is feasible. The parties agree that the general practice of scheduling consecutive weekends and/or more than seven consecutive days and/or split days off should be avoided wherever and whenever it is feasible. Whether or not such a reduction is feasible is grievable through the Joint State Committee of the grievance procedure and the decision of the Joint State Committee shall be final and binding.
Section 8.	The Employer will attempt to equalize scheduled weekend work among bargaining unit employees within the same functional unit at each institution whenever this can be accomplished without interfering with efficient operations. The Employer will meet and discuss upon request at the local level about the definition of functional units.
Section 9.	Upon request of the Union, the Employer shall meet and discuss with the Union, at the
agency level, concerning the time of beginning or ending a work shift.
Section 10.	In the event of a change in shift, employees must be off work for a minimum of three shifts or their equivalent unless a scheduled day or days off intervene between such shift change. Employees shall not be required to work more than two different shifts in a work week, except for emergencies. Exceptions to this Section may be made upon mutual agreement between the Employer and the employee.
Section 11.	Where the practice of rotating shift assignments in institutions now exists and where
6
the Union believes that fixed schedules are feasible and desirable the following procedure will apply:
a.	The Union will engage in "meet and discuss" at the institution level.
b.	If no agreement is reached at the local level a "meet and discuss" session will be
scheduled at the agency level.
c.	If no agreement is reached at the agency level, the Union may process a grievance to the Joint State Committee. In considering and deciding the grievance, the Joint State Committee will take into consideration the practices in effect at other institutions where rotating shifts do not exist. The decision of the Joint State Committee shall be final and binding.
Section 12.	Non-standard schedules of work may be established by mutual agreement at the local level and with the approval of the Union and the Agency and the Office of Administration. If discussion of a proposed plan is not resolved in a manner satisfactory to both parties at the local level, a meet and discuss meeting will be scheduled upon request with representatives of the Union, representatives of the Office of Administration, Bureau of Labor Relations, and representatives of the Agency within 30 days and a decision will be reached within 90 days. Implementation and continuation of non-standard schedules will be by mutual agreement.
It is further agreed that the purpose of the proposed non-standard schedules of work shall be to improve the Employer's operational efficiency and/or service to its clients and quality of work life of employees. It shall not cause an increase in the overall cost of affected operations, nor cause an increase in current overall complement at affected operations, nor adversely affect the Employer's ability to meet criteria for accreditations and/or certification, nor adversely impact on the efficiency of affected operations or standards of service, nor shall there be an unreasonable number of schedules at any one location.
A task force consisting of representatives of the Commonwealth and District 1199P, SEIU will be established upon request at the agency level to attempt to develop mutually agreed upon model language for non-standard schedules of work. District 1199P, SEIU will be represented on this task force by a total maximum of three bargaining unit members.
Section 13.	It is agreed that the provisions of this Article cannot be rigidly applied to part-time employees. When changes are made in schedules of part-time employees, such changes will be made on the basis of past practice, hardships involved for individuals and fairness to part-time and full-time employees, subject to the operating requirements of the institution. Part-time employees are defined as employees who are not regularly scheduled to work at least 37 l/2 hours in a normal work week or, in the case of employees in seven-day operations, who are not regularly scheduled to work at least 75 hours in a l4 day period.
Section 14.	It is further agreed that the relative number of full-time and part-time employees at a work location may be an appropriate topic for meet and discuss.

Where rest periods are scheduled, the Employer shall be able to vary the scheduling of such period when, in its opinion, the demands of work require such variance.

Payment specified in Section 5 of this Article shall be applicable only if the employee works on the day on which the minor holiday has been rescheduled.
Section 3.	A permanent full-time employee on a Monday through Friday work week shall be paid for any holiday listed in Section l of this Article, provided the employee was scheduled to work on that day and if the employee was in an active pay status on the last half of the employee's scheduled work day immediately prior and the first half of the employee's scheduled work day immediately subsequent thereto.

If a holiday is observed while a permanent full-time employee is on sick leave, annual, or other paid leave status, the employee will receive holiday pay and the day will not be charged against sick, annual, or other paid leave credits.
An employee who is scheduled to work on a holiday and is absent from work for an unauthorized reason on that day shall be ineligible to receive the holiday, holiday pay or compensatory time off.

If such scheduling is not possible because of the demands of the work, the scheduling period shall be extended 30 calendar days.
If the employee makes no attempt to schedule such paid time off within the 60 calendar day period succeeding the holiday, such time will be scheduled by the Employer.
Section 6.	After mutual agreement between the Employer and the employee, the employee may be compensated at the employee's regular rate of pay in lieu of such paid time off as provided for in Section 5 or in lieu of paid time off for a holiday that occurs on an employee's scheduled day off.
Section 7. Permanent part-time employees will be compensated at one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked on all holidays set forth in Section l. No compensatory time will be granted for such hours. Monday shall be recognized as a holiday for all holidays occurring on a Sunday and Friday for all holidays occurring on a Saturday for permanent part-time employees of the Community Health Service. For other than these employees the holiday will be deemed to fall on the day on which it actually occurs.
Permanent part-time employees shall receive holidays on a pro rata basis. This additional paid leave is to be scheduled and granted in the same manner as personal leave.

Amounts in excess of the maximum allowable amount will be paid to the employee in cash.
Section 9.	Whenever the Employer declares a special holiday or part holiday for all employees under the Employer's jurisdiction, all permanent employees who are required to work on the day on which such holiday hours occur shall receive time off with pay for all hours worked up to the number of hours in the employee's normal work shift if a full holiday is declared, or up to a pro rata share of the normal work shift if a partial holiday is declared. The Employer shall have the option of paying the employees their regular hourly rate of pay in lieu of such equivalent time off with pay.
11
Section 10.	When an employee's work shift overlaps the calendar day, the first shift of the employee in which 50% or more of the time occurs on the applicable holiday shall be considered in the holiday period and the holiday period shall end 24 hours after the commencement of that shift.

Section 12.	There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of any premium pay provided for under the provisions of this Agreement for the same hours worked.
Section 13.	The Employer shall attempt to equalize leave on the recognized major holidays among permanent full-time employees in each scheduling unit at state institutions unless the employee requests otherwise.
When a holiday listed in Section 1 occurs during a week in which an employee has a prescheduled vacation, priority will be given over other requests for holiday leave to scheduling such employee for holiday leave.
Section 14.	Employees who are scheduled to work in offices of the Commonwealth which are closed on the Day after Thanksgiving will utilize an annual or personal leave day or be charged leave without pay for the Day after Thanksgiving, unless the employee and their supervisor agree on an appropriate field assignment.

If the employee had qualified, other than through disability retirement, for Employer paid coverage in the REHP prior to the most recent rehire period, this three year requirement will not apply,
(d)	an employee who leaves State employment subsequent to superannuation age and is subsequently rehired and then retires must have 15 or more years of credited service (20 or more years of credited service if retired on or after July 1, 2008) in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems with at least three years of credited service from the most recent date of reemployment. However, if the departure from State employment was due to furlough and the employee returns during the recall period, this three year requirement will not apply. If the employee had qualified, other than through disability retirement, for Employer paid coverage in the REHP prior to the most recent rehire period, this three year requirement will not apply.
(2)	Disability retirement, which requires at least five years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems, except that, if an employee had previously qualified based on an approved disability retirement, then returns and retires under a normal or early retirement, he or she must retire at or after superannuation age with 15 or more years of credited service (20 or more years of credited service if retired on or after July 1, 2008) in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems or 25 years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems or
(3)	Other retirement with at least 25 years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems, except that an employee who leaves State employment, is subsequently rehired and retires must have at least 25 years of credited service in the State and/or Public School Retirement Systems with at least three years of credited service from the most recent date of reemployment. However, if the departure from State employment was due to furlough and the employee returns during the recall period, this three year requirement will not apply. If the employee had qualified, other than through disability retirement, for Employer paid coverage in the REHP prior to the most recent rehire period, this three year requirement will not apply.
(4)	All employees who are age 60 or over on March 1, 1992 and also have at least five years of credited service under the Retirement Code, whether it has been purchased as of that date or eligible to be purchased as of that date, will be "grandfathered in" and the total years of service requirement for fully state paid REHP coverage for those employees will be ten years of credited service rather than fifteen. The three-year rehire rule will not apply to such employees.
Section 7. When an employee dies as a result of a work-related accident, the Fund shall continue to provide medical plan benefits and supplemental benefits, as determined and extended
42
by the Fund, to the spouse and eligible dependents of the employee until the spouse remarries or becomes eligible for coverage under another employer's health plan. Annual certification of noncoverage will be required.
The medical plan benefits and supplemental benefits will be converted to the REHP at the time when the employee would have reached age 60.
ARTICLE 22 WORK-RELATED INJURIES
Section 1.	An employee who sustains a work-related injury during the term of this Agreement as a result of which the employee is disabled, if so determined by a decision issued under the operation of the Workers' Compensation Program, shall be entitled to use accumulated sick, annual, or personal leave or injury leave without pay. While using accumulated leave, the employee will be paid a supplement to Workers' Compensation of full pay reduced by an amount that yields a net pay, including Workers' Compensation and Social Security Disability Benefits, that is equal to the employee's net pay immediately prior to the injury. Net pay prior to injury is defined as gross base pay minus federal, state, and local withholding, unemployment compensation tax, Social Security and retirement contributions. One full day of accumulated leave (7.5 or 8 hours as appropriate) will be charged for each day the supplement is paid. Accumulated leave and injury leave without pay may be used for an aggregate of l2 months or for the duration of the disability, whichever is lesser, except that, if only accumulated leave is used, it may be used beyond 12 months until exhausted or until the disability ceases, whichever occurs sooner. In no case however will the aggregate of l2 months extend beyond three years from the date the injury occurred. If no leave is available under this Section, the provisions of Section 12 may apply.
For temporary employees, accumulated leave and injury leave without pay shall be available for an aggregate of up to 12 months, for the duration of the disability or for the scheduled duration of the temporary employment, whichever is the least. In no case, however, will the aggregate of 12 months extend beyond three years from the date the injury occurred.
The employee election to use or not use accumulated leave under this section cannot change more than once.
Section 2.	An employee who works a reduced number of hours (part-time) due to partial disability may use leave in accordance with Section 1. Pay for accumulated leave used will be calculated in accordance with Section 1, based on the net amount of lost earnings.
Section 3.	Retirement credited service for the period of time that the employee is using leave under this Article, shall be determined in accordance with the State Employes' Retirement Code.
Section 4.	At the expiration of the leave under Section 1, if an employee continues to receive Workers' Compensation, the employee will be placed on leave without pay in accordance with
43
Section 7 below and will not be entitled to receive state-paid coverage for life insurance and state payments toward coverage for health benefits.
Section 5.	An employee is required to refund to the Employer the amount of any overpayment. In no case shall an employee be entitled to full pay and Workers' Compensation and/or Social Security for the same period. The Employer shall recover any amount in excess of the paid supplement to workers' compensation as described in Section 1. Failure to apply for or report Social Security or other applicable disability benefits to the Employer will result in the termination of the leave under Section 1.
Section 6.	State-paid coverage for life insurance state payments toward coverage for health benefits as provided in Articles 20 and 2l, will continue for the period of time that the employee is on leave under Sections 1 and 12.
Section 7.	An employee has the right to return to a position in the same or equivalent classification held before being disabled, for a period of up to three years from the date the injury occurred provided the employee is fully capable of performing the duties of that position, subject to the furlough provisions of Article 25, Seniority. This guarantee expires if the disability ceases prior to the expiration of the three year period and the employee does not return to work immediately or if the employee retires or otherwise terminates employment. During the period of time between the end of the leave under Section 1 or Sections 12, where applicable and the end of the guarantee in this section, the employee will be on leave without pay.
Disabled employees receiving Workers' Compensation will be notified 90 days prior to the expiration of the three year period. The notification will include information concerning the employee's right to apply for disability retirement, if eligible. If the employee does not receive 90 days notice, the employee's right to return will not be extended. However, the leave without pay will be extended for 90 days from the date of notification to enable the employee if eligible to apply for disability retirement.
The right of return for temporary employees shall be limited to the scheduled duration of the temporary employment.
Section 8.	The compensation for disability retirement arising out of work-related injuries shall be in accordance with the State Employes' Retirement Code.
Section 9.	An employee who sustains a work-related injury, during the period of this Agreement, if so determined by a decision issued under the operation of the Workers' Compensation Program, may use sick, annual, or personal leave for the purpose of continued medical treatment of the work-related injury in accordance with Articles 8, 10, and 11. If no paid leave is available, an employee may use leave without pay. Each absence shall not exceed the minimum amount of time necessary to obtain the medical treatment. Employees shall make reasonable efforts to schedule medical appointments during non-work hours or at times that will minimize absence from work. Verification of the length of the medical appointment may be required. This section is not applicable to any absence for which Workers' Compensation is payable.	When Workers'
44
Compensation is payable, the provisions of Section 1 shall apply.
Section 10.	Sections 4, 6, and 8 of this Article shall not apply to temporary employees.
Section 11.	Sections 1 through 10, and 12 of this Article shall not be applicable to employees whose injuries are within the scope of either Act l93 of l935, P.L. 477, as amended, or Act 632 of l959, P.L. l7l8, as amended.
Section 12.	An employee who is disabled due to a recurrence of a work-related injury after three years from the date the injury occurred, or before three years if the leave entitlement in Section 1 has been depleted, shall be entitled to use accumulated leave and injury leave without pay while disabled for a period of up to 12 weeks. To be eligible to use injury leave without pay, the employee must have been at work at least 1250 hours within the previous 12 months. The 12 week period will be reduced by any other leave used within the previous 12 months that was designated as leave under the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act. If only accumulated leave is used, it may be used beyond 12 weeks until exhausted or until the disability ceases, whichever occurs sooner. While using accumulated leave, the leave will be charged and paid in accordance with Section 1.
Section 13.	It is understood by both parties that the provisions of this Article are consistent with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, USC Section 2601 et seq. and that leave granted in accordance with Sections 1and 12, shall be designated as leave under the provisions of the Act.
Section 14.	It is understood by both parties that the provisions of this Article are consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
ARTICLE 23
CLASSIFICATION
Section 1.	The position classification plan, as established and maintained by the Employer, consists
of a schedule of classification titles with classification specifications for each classification which define and describe representative duties and responsibilities and set forth the minimum requirements and qualifications essential to the work of the classification. Only in those instances where there is a substantial change in permanent job duties or job content during the term of this Agreement which justifies a change in job classification or where a claim of a longstanding misclassification exists may the employees process an appeal for a reallocation of their position through the grievance procedure as set forth below:
STEP I. The employee shall present the grievance in writing to the head of the employee's institution, community health district or agency central office unit or their designee. For grievances seeking the reallocation of a position, the employee shall attach to the grievance a description of the job. Grievances under Section 4 below shall be filed within 15 working days of the occurrence of the action giving rise to the grievance or knowledge of its occurrence.
The institutional or local management designee shall attempt to resolve the matter and report a decision to the Local Union Representative and/or the employee within 15 working days.
STEP II. An appeal from an unfavorable disposition at Step I shall be presented in writing by
45
the employee or the Union representative to the agency head within 15 working days after the response from Step I is due. The agency head or designee shall respond in writing to the employee and Union representative within 15 working days after receipt of the appeal.
STEP III. In the event the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved in Step II, written appeal may be made by the employee or Union representative within 15 working days of the Step II decision to the Bureau of Personnel, Classification and Pay Division, Office of Administration. The appeal shall contain a copy of the grievance, including a description of the job and a copy of the Step I and Step II decisions. The Bureau of Personnel, Classification and Pay Division, Office of Administration, shall issue a decision in writing to the Union within 15 working days after receipt of the appeal.
Employer determinations prior to Step 3 can be reversed by the Office of Administration.
If a determination is made by the Employer in the course of an employee appeal that a position should be upgraded, the employee shall be promoted retroactively to the date the grievance was filed in writing.
If a final determination is made by the Employer in the course of an employee appeal or an Employer-initiated classification review that a position should be downgraded, the employee shall be demoted to the proper classification and pay range at the nearest level (step) not greater than the employee's current salary. If the employee's salary is greater than the maximum level (step) of the lower pay range, there shall be no reduction in salary. The effective date of the classification change shall be the first day of the first pay period subsequent to the response.
If a final determination is made by the Employer in the course of an employee appeal or an Employer-initiated classification review that a position should be reclassified to another class in the same pay range, the effective date of the classification change shall be the first day of the first pay period subsequent to the response.
Section 2.	An employee shall be permitted to have a representative of the Union at each step of the grievance procedure up to and including Step III. Regardless of whether or not an employee wants Union representation, a Union representative will be given an opportunity to be present at the adjustment of the grievance and such adjustment will not be inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement.
Upon request by an employee or Union representative, a grievance meeting may be scheduled at Steps II and/or III. Requests for such meetings shall not be unreasonably denied. Such
46
meetings may be rescheduled, if necessary if Union representation is temporarily unavailable to the employee. Where rescheduling occurs, the time limits for response to the grievance will be suspended during the postponement period.
The Union shall furnish the Employer representative with the names and work locations of grievance representatives/delegates and shall notify the Employer of any changes.
A reasonable number of witnesses, when required, shall be allowed to participate in the grievance procedure.
An aggrieved employee and Union representatives, if employees of the Employer, shall be granted reasonable time during working hours, if required, to process grievances in accordance with this Article without loss of pay or leave time.
Nothing in this Article shall interfere with the rights of individual employees or a group of employees to present grievances and to have them adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Section 606 of the Public Employe Relations Act.
Section 3.	The Union, in response to an unfavorable decision at Step 3, may submit classification appeals to an arbitration panel. The panel shall consist of three members; one member appointed by the Employer, one member appointed by the Union, and a third member selected by the parties jointly from a list of five names to be mutually agreed upon by the Employer and the Union. The third member shall not be affiliated, directly or indirectly, with any labor organization or be an employee of the Commonwealth and must be knowledgeable in the field of position classification.
The panel shall neither add to, subtract from, nor modify the provisions of this Article nor recommend any alterations or revisions to the Commonwealth's classification and compensation plans. The panel shall be confined to deciding the proper classification in the then existing classification plan for the position in dispute.
The findings of the panel shall be submitted to the parties within 30 days after the hearing or receipt of transcript when taken. The determination of the panel shall be final and binding in those cases where an employee's position is downgraded as a result of an employee appeal or an Employer-initiated classification review. In all other cases the decision of the panel shall be advisory only as to the Employer.
The panel shall meet monthly if necessary for the purpose of hearing appeals under this section.
A grievance that has been appealed to arbitration will be deemed withdrawn six months after the date the grievance was appealed to arbitration unless the case has been scheduled or this timeframe has been extended by mutual agreement. Grievances that are pending arbitration on the effective date of this Agreement will be considered withdrawn six months from the date this Agreement is signed by the parties unless the case has been scheduled or this timeframe has been extended by mutual agreement. The Office of Administration will notify the Union in writing 30 days prior to the expiration of the six month period set forth above and prior to any case being considered withdrawn.
Section 4.	The Union recognizes the right of the Employer to direct its working forces, which includes the assignment of work to individual employees, and it further recognizes that such assignments 47
may include work outside an employee's classification. However, it is understood that assignments outside of classification shall be made in a manner consistent with the Employer's operations and organizational requirements.
Whenever an employee within the bargaining unit is temporarily required by the Employer or the circumstances of the situation to perform in general the duties and responsibilities of a position in a higher rated classification that are separate and distinct from those of the employee's own position for a period of any five full cumulative days or ten full one-half cumulative days in a calendar quarter, the employee shall be compensated, retroactive to the time the assignment took place, at an amount equal to four and one half percent of the employee's current rate of pay or at the starting rate of the pay range for the higher classification, whichever is greater. Such employee, while temporarily working and being paid in a higher class, will also be paid at the higher rate for a holiday provided the employee is charged to perform the higher level duties on the employee's scheduled workday immediately before and immediately after such holiday and is paid at the higher rate on those days. The holiday shall not count toward the requirement for five full cumulative days in a quarter. Employees who are charged to perform higher class work for a full day or a full half day and who take leave for a portion of that day will be compensated in increments of one-quarter hour for the partial day worked in the higher class after the five full day or ten full half day threshold has been met. Furthermore, employees who work out of class for less than a full day as a result of overlapping shifts with a higher level position will be paid out of class for all hours worked in the higher class after the five full day or ten full half day threshold has been met. Once the requirement for the five full cumulative day threshold or the ten full one half cumulative day threshold has been met, payment will be included in the bi-weekly paycheck. If the position in the higher rated classification is filled permanently by other than the person temporarily filling the position, the person temporarily assigned shall be returned to the person's previous position and compensation, but shall receive any increments and service credits for such increments to which the person would have been entitled had the person remained in the person's normal assignment.
The duties and responsibilities that are separate and distinct from those of the employee's own position means that the work in a position in a higher rated classification includes duties or responsibilities that are different from the work the employee does in the employee's own position, but also means that pay at the higher rate is payable even though both positions may include overlapping duties and responsibilities.
An employee or employees shall not be temporarily assigned to perform in general the duties and responsibilities of a position in a higher rated classification for more than nine continuous months or the length of the leave of absence of the employee being replaced, whichever is greater.
48
In addition, if the Employer assigns an employee on a temporary basis to a lower classification or if an employee performs some duties and functions assigned to a lower classification, the employee so assigned shall receive the compensation of the higher level to which the employee is regularly assigned. The Employer, however, at any individual work site shall make such assignments on a non-discriminatory basis so as to equalize the same among the employees within the classification from which assignments are made, so long as such equalization does not interfere with efficient operating procedures.
Grievances arising from the provisions of this section shall be submitted in writing and the employee shall attempt to include the dates on which the alleged out of class work occurred and a description of the alleged higher level work performed. The failure of the employee to provide the required information will not affect the validity of the grievance. Grievances pertaining to this section may be processed through an arbitration panel consisting of one Union staff member, one staff member of the Employer, and one permanent arbitrator jointly selected by the parties who is knowledgeable in the field of position classification. The decision of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding.
For the purpose of this Section, the calendar quarters shall be defined as beginning with the first full pay period in January through March 31, April 1 through June 30, July 1 through September 30, and October 1 through the last full pay period of the leave calendar year, which is the pay period that includes December 31.
Section 5. Under Sections 3 and 4 above, all fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the parties except where one of the parties of this Agreement requests a postponement of a previously scheduled arbitration meeting which results in a postponement charge. The postponing party shall pay such charge unless such postponement results in a settlement of the appeal in which event the postponement charge shall be divided equally by the parties. Each party shall bear the costs of preparing and presenting its own case. Either party desiring a record of the proceedings shall pay for the record and make a copy available without charge to the arbitrator.
Section 6. The Employer shall notify the Union of class specification revisions to all classes that are presently in the certified bargaining unit for which the Union is the representative and of class specifications and pay ranges of proposed classes that the Employer may reasonably anticipate will be placed in the certified bargaining unit, prior to the submission of these changes to the Executive Board of the Commonwealth. The Union will submit its comments, in writing, to the Employer within l5 working days of receipt of the notification. If written comments are not received from the Union within l5 working days, the Employer will contact the Union, by telephone, before submitting the proposals to the Executive Board. Reasonable written requests by the Union for time extensions will be granted. In addition, the Employer shall notify the Union of the commencement of classification studies of classifications in this bargaining unit.
49
ARTICLE 24
DISCHARGE, DEMOTION, SUSPENSION AND DISCIPLINE
Section 1.	The Employer shall not demote, suspend, discharge or take any disciplinary action against an employee without just cause. An employee may appeal a demotion, suspension, or discharge beginning at the first step of the grievance procedure within 15 working days of the date of its occurrence. The Union shall be notified promptly by the Employer of any demotion, suspension, or discharge.
Section 2.	Any action instituted under Section l of this Article shall be implemented within a reasonable period of time after the event giving rise to such disciplinary action or knowledge thereof.
Section 3.	In the event any action is taken by the Employer under the provisions of this Article which involves patient/resident/inmate/client abuse and a grievance is filed by an employee, the
arbitrator shall not consider the failure of the patient/resident/inmate/client to appear as prejudicial.
Section 4.	The Employer will attempt to discipline employees in such a manner so as not to embarrass the employee before the public or other employees. It must be kept in mind, however, that where insubordination or flouting of authority by an employee in public and in the presence of other employees takes place, the Employer shall not be restricted by the operation of this section. The Employer will not take any disciplinary action against employees for appropriately advocating or appropriately attempting to bring about improvements in standards of patient care.
Section 5.	The provisions of this Article shall not apply during an employee's probationary period which shall be the initial 180 calendar days of employment except for employees in trainee classes whose probationary period shall coincide with the trainee period. The probationary period can be extended by mutual agreement between the Union and the Employer for an additional period during which time Section l shall not apply. Periods of leave without pay and periods of time during which an employee is using paid leave to supplement Workers' Compensation shall not count toward the initial probationary period or any extension period.
Section 6.	This Article shall not apply to demotions resulting from an employee appeal, an Employer-initiated classification review or unsuccessful completion of a probationary period upon promotion.
Section 7.	After a period of two years, a written reprimand or reference to an oral reprimand shall be removed from the employee's official personnel folder if no intervening incidents of the same or a similar nature have occurred.
Section 8.	The Employer and the Union agree to continue the alternative forms of discipline in lieu of suspension actions program in accordance with the side letter.
50
ARTICLE 25 SENIORITY
Section 1. a. Under the terms of this Agreement, the term "seniority" means a preferred position for specific purposes which one employee within a seniority unit may have over another employee within the same seniority unit because of a greater length of service within the state government or a particular organizational or occupational segment thereof.
(1)	The seniority unit for lateral transfer and furlough shall consist of that group of employees in an institution or a Department of Health District or the Department of Health Central Office within which seniority preference is exercised.
(2)	Unless otherwise stated herein, seniority refers to Bargaining Unit seniority.
(3)	Bargaining Unit seniority standing shall be determined by the length of unbroken (as
defined in Section 2) service with the Employer subsequent to July l, l973, in bargaining unit classifications covered by this agreement and service prior to July 1, 1998, in classifications covered by the nursing and medical supportive services first-level supervisory unit. For employees who occupied a bargaining unit classification covered by this agreement on July l, l973, all unbroken service with the Employer prior to July l, l973, will be counted toward Bargaining Unit seniority including leaves of absence without pay of one year or less. Employees who did not occupy a bargaining unit classification on July l, l973, but did so prior to that date, will have such service counted toward Bargaining Unit seniority, if there has been no break in service, including leaves of absence without pay of one year or less.
Effective July 1, 1991, employees will accrue Bargaining Unit seniority during legal strike absences.
(4)	Employees who served in the Armed Forces of the United States during periods of time listed below shall be responsible for providing proof of military service to their human resource officer within 60 days of their first day of work in order to receive seniority credit in accordance with the Veterans' Preference Act, 51 Pa. C.S. 7107 et seq. Failure to provide the required proof of service during the time period shall bar the employee or Union from claiming credit for such service at a later date.
Applicable periods are as follows:
l.	World War I - April 6, l9l7 - November ll, l9l8
2.	World War II - December 7, l94l - September 2, l945
3.	Korea - June 25, l950 - July 27, l953
4.	Vietnam - August 5, l964 - January 28, l973
b. Seniority credit for each employee is maintained as a total number of days. Employees will accrue seniority in accordance with the following procedure: The number of
51
regular hours paid each bi-weekly pay period plus the number of hours approved Leave without Pay will be accumulated. This total number of hours will be divided by 7.5 or 8 as applicable and rounded up to the next higher day. The result will be added to the employee's accumulated total.
Section 2.	The following shall constitute a break in service: resignation, separation for just cause, retirement, absence without leave for five consecutive working days, failure to report within ten consecutive working days of recall, expiration of recall period, failure to report after leave, and acceptance of other permanent employment while on leave. This shall not restrict the Employer's right to take whatever personnel action it deems warranted for any of the above. If service is broken by any of the above, the employee shall lose Bargaining Unit seniority. If an employee is returned within one year after such break in service, the employee shall be entitled to credit for seniority purposes for the time accrued up to the time break in service occurred, but shall not be entitled to any credit for the time represented by such break in service.
Employees who are furloughed and who file applications for retirement benefits which are subsequently approved, will be considered to have a break in service as of the date of the approval of benefits by the State Employes' Retirement Board.
A furloughed employee who applies for and receives retirement benefits from the State Employes' Retirement Board shall forfeit all recall rights as of the date of approval of benefits by the State Employes' Retirement Board.
Section 3.	Seniority lists shall be prepared for each seniority group and revised where necessary every six months. Appropriate service information shall be shown thereon to permit application of various seniority provisions. Such lists shall include both full-time and part-time employees and shall be posted on the appropriate bulletin boards. Seniority lists shall be provided to the designated local facility representative upon request not more than once every six months.
Section 4.	Postings: The Employer agrees that all vacancies (such as those positions vacated through resignation, retirement or permanent transfer of an incumbent or positions newly created by the Employer) which are to be filled within the bargaining unit will be posted at appropriate work locations within appropriate seniority units prior to the filling of such vacancies for a period of at least 10 calendar days unless otherwise provided for in this Agreement or unless an emergency requires a lesser period of time.
Section 5.	Furloughs and Bumping: When the Employer determines that a furlough is necessary within a seniority unit, employees will be furloughed in the inverse order of Bargaining Unit seniority. Employees affected by furlough who have the requisite seniority and skill and ability shall bump laterally or down in the following manner:
a.	If an employee is affected by furlough the employee shall bump laterally within the classification within the seniority unit as defined in Section l a(l) provided that the employee has more Bargaining Unit seniority than the employee with the least Bargaining Unit seniority in that classification and has the requisite skill and ability.
52
b.	If the affected employee is unable under Section a. above to bump within the classification the employee shall bump laterally or down within the seniority unit as defined in Section l a(l) into any other classification previously held within the bargaining unit using the seniority procedure specified in a. above.
c.	If the affected employee is unable to bump into any position as provided in subsections a. and b. above, the employee shall be furloughed.
d.	If an employee refuses to exercise rights under this Section, the employee shall forfeit all further bumping rights under this Section, recall rights under Section 7 of this Article to positions in all classifications except the one from which the employee was furloughed, and placement rights under Section 11 of this Article.
e.	Where practicable, the Employer will notify the Union one month in advance of any impending furlough.
f.	An employee in a Community Health District who is subject to reassignment to a different state health center as a result of a reduction of the work force and who refuses such assignment will be furloughed.
Section 6.	Before any furlough is implemented in a classification in the classified service in a seniority unit, all emergency employees will be separated before any temporary employees; temporary employees will be separated before any provisional employees; and all provisional employees will be separated before any probationary employees or any regular status members of the classified service are furloughed.
Section 7.	Recall: The Employer shall establish a recall list by classification by seniority unit for those employees furloughed under Section 5 of this Article in the inverse order of seniority.
a.	Employees on such recall lists shall have rights to a position in a classification within the seniority unit from which they were furloughed provided they have the requisite seniority and skill and ability.
b.	Such recall lists will remain in effect for a furloughed employee for a period of three years after the effective date of the furlough.
c.	In the event any employee on a recall list refuses an offer of employment in the classification from which the employee was initially furloughed the employee shall forfeit all recall rights.
d.	During the period that employees are on a recall list, they shall keep the Employer informed of any changes in address. The Employer shall not be held liable if an employee is not offered recall because of failure to notify the Employer of a change of address. An employee who is not offered recall because of failure to notify the Employer of a change of address and who subsequently informs the Employer of the current address shall be returned to the recall list and
53
shall be offered the next opportunity for recall, provided the employee's three year recall period has not expired.
e.	The recall period of a furloughed employee who, during the recall period, returns to the furloughing agency's payroll in a temporary capacity shall be extended by the amount of time the employee serves in the temporary capacity.
f.	A furloughed employee who, during a recall period, returns to the Employer's payroll in a temporary capacity shall upon recall from the furlough to permanent employment, be credited with seniority for the amount of time spent in the temporary capacity.
g.	During the recall period employees may be offered recall to either temporary or part-time positions. If an employee refuses an offer of either temporary or part-time recall, the employee forfeits all further recall rights to the type of employment refused. The employee will retain recall rights to permanent, full-time employment for which the employee is eligible.
h.	A furloughed employee who, during a recall period, returns to the Employer's payroll in
a temporary capacity shall be eligible for all benefits enjoyed by permanent employees provided other applicable eligibility requirements are met.
i.	A community health employee who is furloughed may refuse recall to a state health center different from the one from which furloughed without forfeiture of recall rights.
j.	The Employer will provide the Union with a copy of all recall lists.
k.	A furloughed employee who applies for and receives retirement benefits from the State Employes' Retirement Board shall forfeit all recall rights under this section as of the date of the approval of benefits by the State Employes' Retirement Board.
Section 8.	Employees desiring to transfer to another position in the same classification on a different shift in the seniority unit shall submit a written request to the local human resource office within the time period specified on the posting.
Filling of vacancies, shift preference and the realignment of staff will be accomplished in the following manner:
a.	Filling a Registered Nurse vacancy (as defined in Article 25, Section 4).
(1)	When a Registered Nurse vacancy occurs it shall be posted for ten (10) days. Employees in the Registered Nurse classification may bid for the vacancy as a lateral transfer between shifts. The bidding employee with the greatest bargaining unit seniority who possesses the requisite skill and ability will be awarded the position.
(2)	The Registered Nurse position vacated by the lateral transfer between shifts and any subsequent
resulting Registered Nurse vacancies will be posted for ten (10) days. Employees in the

If such placement is not possible, the employee will be placed in a position covered by this Agreement for which the employee qualifies, provided the pay range for the classification is equal to or lower than the pay range for the employee's classification at the time of furlough.
b.	Geographic limitations for the application of this Section will be designated by the employee by completing a placement questionnaire. The employee may choose up to ten counties in which the employee would be available or a statewide availability.

e.	Employees will be offered placement in one vacant position. If an employee declines the offer of placement, the employee's rights under this section cease. The furloughed employee shall retain recall rights as outlined in Article 25, Section 7.

In addition, such employee shall complete an "Availability for Temporary Employment" questionnaire. If an employee indicates a desire not to be offered placement to temporary positions no such offers will
58
be made and placement rights to permanent positions will not be affected. However, if an employee indicates a desire to be offered a temporary position and refuses such an offer, the employee shall forfeit all placement rights.

If the appeal to the Commission is withdrawn by the employee or not accepted by the Commission within the time limits prescribed in Section 2 of this Article, the processing of a timely filed contract grievance shall be permitted. Additionally, if the appeal to the Commission is not accepted outside the time limits prescribed in Section 2 of this Article, the employee shall be entitled to institute proceedings under the contract grievance procedure within fifteen (15) working days of the date of the Commission's denial of appeal. Any grievance appealed outside the fifteen (15) working day limit shall be considered untimely filed.
Section 2.	Any grievance or dispute which may arise during the term of this Agreement concerning the application, meaning, or interpretation of this Agreement except for grievances alleging a violation of Article 23 shall be processed in the following manner:
STEP 1. The employee, either alone, or accompanied by a Union Representative, or the Union Representative, where entitled, shall present the grievance in writing to the Employer's worksite designee within fifteen (15) working days of the date of the occurrence giving rise to the dispute, or when the employee knew or by reasonable diligence should have known of the occurrence.
In addition, in order for a grievance to be discussed at Step 1, the respective Employer worksite designee must have received a written confirmation of the grievance at least fifteen (15) working days prior to the prescheduled Step 1 meeting. This period may, however, be modified by mutual agreement.
The parties agree the respective Employer designee and the Union counterpart must schedule and meet on a monthly Step 1 basis, if necessary, in order to attempt to resolve all outstanding grievances. At the Step 1 meeting, the parties will advise each other of all of the then known facts, including witnesses, and furnish copies of relevant reports or investigations upon which the party will rely in proving and/or supporting its respective position.
63
When special circumstances preclude the disclosure of confidential patient, resident, client, student or inmate information at the Step 1 meeting, the case will be handled in accordance with the agreed upon procedures to be developed by the parties.
Any agreed upon final settlement of a grievance reached at Step 1 shall be reduced to writing and signed by the Union and the Employer designee. Decisions at Step 1 shall not be used as precedent for any subsequent case.
After the Step 1 meeting has been held, and the then known information the parties intend to rely on to support their respective positions has been discussed and exchanged, the respective Employer designee must, if the case is not settled at this point, make a written disposition of the matter to the Union within fifteen (15) working days from the date of the Step 1 meeting.
STEP 2. If the Step 1 response is not satisfactory, or a response has not been received by the Union within fifteen (15) working days of the Step 1 meeting, the Union shall have fifteen (15) working days after the Commonwealth's response is received or due, to appeal the decision by filing its grievance with the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee. Such submission, in a form to be established by the Committee, shall be made in writing, and shall be filed in accordance with the established procedures with the Office of Administration, Bureau of Labor Relations (OA-BLR). This office will officially "docket" all grievances submitted by the Union and will furnish official notice confirming the docketing of all cases scheduled to be heard by the State Committee, along with the date, place, and time of the scheduled meeting. Dockets will be sent to the affected Employer (Division of Labor Relations) and District 1199P, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC.
Failure of the Union to submit grievances to the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee within the fifteen (15) day appeal period specified above, shall be cause for the Commonwealth to consider the matter "settled and withdrawn." Any later discovered or developed evidence, not previously disclosed to the other party at the Step 1 meeting must be submitted to the other side as soon as practical after discovery and/or development, but in no event later than 48 hours before the Step 2 hearing. (See Rule 4, Section 3 of the Rules of Procedure, Appendix E, for Exceptions).
Decisions of the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee shall operate as precedent.
The Committee at Step 2 shall have the right to hear testimony from both parties, investigate all relevant facts and render a final and binding decision. Each case shall be considered on its merits and the collective bargaining agreement shall constitute the basis upon which the decision shall be rendered.
The Committee shall neither add to, subtract from, nor modify the provisions of the Agreement. The Committee shall be confined to the precise issue submitted, as outlined on the original grievance form, and shall have no authority to determine any other issues not so submitted. If the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee is unable to reach a decision by majority vote, the matter will be considered "deadlocked".
64
STEP 3. An appeal from a deadlocked decision at Step 2 may be initiated by the Union, by written notice of the intent to proceed to arbitration. This notice must be sent within fifteen (15) working days after the deadlocked decision from Step 2 to the Office of Administration (Bureau of Labor Relations), and the affected Employer (Division of Labor Relations) when the appeal is filed.
Arbitration
The impartial arbitrator is to be selected by agreement between the respective Co-Chairpersons of the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee within fifteen (15) working days after the notice has been given. If the parties fail to agree on an impartial arbitrator, either party may request the Bureau of Mediation to submit a list of seven (7) possible arbitrators to the respective Co-Chairpersons.
The Co-Chairpersons shall, within fifteen (15) working days of the receipt of said list, select the arbitrator by alternately striking one name from the list until one name remains. The Employer Chairperson shall strike the first name.
Each case shall be considered on its merits and the collective bargaining agreement shall constitute the basis upon which the decision shall be rendered.
The arbitrator shall neither add to, subtract from, nor modify the provisions of the Agreement.
The arbitrator shall be confined to the precise issue submitted for arbitration and shall have no authority to determine any other issues not so submitted.
A decision of the Step 2 Joint State Committee or by the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties. The arbitrator shall be required to issue a decision within thirty (30) days after the close of the hearing.
Time Limits
All of the time limits contained in this section may be modified by mutual agreement. The granting of any modification at any step shall not be deemed to establish a precedent.
Costs
Each party shall bear the costs of preparing and presenting its own case. All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be divided equally between the parties, except where one of the parties to this Agreement requests a postponement of a previously scheduled arbitration hearing which results in a postponement charge. The postponing party shall pay such charge unless such postponement results in a settlement of the grievance, in which event the postponement charge shall be divided by the parties.
65
A postponement charge resulting from a joint postponement request shall be shared equally by the parties.
Either party desiring a record of the proceedings shall pay for the record and make a copy available without charge to the arbitrator.
Section 3.	An employee shall be permitted to have a representative of the Union present at each step of the grievance procedure, up to and including Step 2; subject, however, to Section 606, Article VI of the Public Employe Relations Act. Upon request by a Union representative, a Step 1 grievance meeting will be postponed or rescheduled, if necessary, if a Union Representative is temporarily unavailable to the employee. Where this occurs, the time limits for response to the grievance will be suspended during the postponement period.
Delegates
Employees selected by the Union to act as Union representatives shall be known as delegates. The Union shall furnish the Commonwealth with the names and work locations of grievance representatives and shall notify the Commonwealth of any changes.
Lost Time
A reasonable number of witnesses shall be permitted to attend Committee meetings without suffering the loss of any pay, when their presence is required because of the Commonwealth's refusal to accept the witnesses' written statement, as provided for in the attached Rules of Procedure (Appendix F). Grievants shall be treated in exactly the same manner as witnesses under this procedure.
An employee who presents a grievance or sits on a Joint State Committee Panel, shall do so with pay, provided the Union has indicated their desire to have that person participate in the procedure. The number of employees so designated shall not be abused.
State/Agency Wide Grievances
The Union may present grievances concerning agency-wide actions or state-wide actions directly to Step 2 within fifteen (15) working days of the date of the occurrence giving rise to the dispute, or the date when the Union knew, or by reasonable diligence should have known, of its occurrence. However, the Union will meet with the official affected Employer or Office of Administration designee prior to any hearing on such grievances, in order to resolve any factual disputes relating to such Agency-wide or State-wide grievances.
Section 4.	The Joint Pennsylvania State Committee will function under the attached Rules of Procedure, which are contained in Appendix E.

The leave is to be used for the recipient’s own catastrophic injury or illness or for the catastrophic injury or illness of a family member. The leave also may be used as bereavement leave if the employee’s family member dies and the employee has no accrued or anticipated sick leave available, subject to the limitations in Article 11, Section 6.
Section 2.	Recipients
a.	Recipients must be permanent employees in bargaining units that have agreed to participate in this program.
b.	Family member is defined as a husband, wife, domestic partner, child, step-
child, or parent of the employee or any other person qualifying as a dependent under IRS eligibility criteria or the child of the employee’s domestic partner.
c.	A catastrophic illness or injury that poses a direct threat to life or to the vital function of major bodily systems or organs, and would cause the employee to take leave without pay or terminate employment, must be documented on a Family and Medical Leave Act Serious Health Condition Certification form. Donated leave may not be used for work-related injuries or illnesses, minor illnesses, injuries, or impairments, sporadic, short-term recurrences of chronic, non-life threatening conditions, short-term absences due to contagious diseases, or short-term recurring medical or therapeutic treatments, except for conditions such as those listed above.
d.	The absence due to the catastrophic illness or injury of the employee or a family member must be for more than 20 workdays in the current leave calendar year. The 20-workday absence may be accumulated on an intermittent basis if properly documented as related
80
to the same catastrophic illness or injury. Annual, personal, sick (for employee’s own serious health condition), sick family (for the serious health condition of a family member), holiday, compensatory, or unpaid leave may be used during the accumulation period. A separate accumulation period must be met for each catastrophic illness or injury and for each leave calendar year in which donated leave is used. Donated leave may not be applied to the required 20-workday accumulation period.
e.	All accrued leave must be used as follows before any donation may be received:
(1)	For an employee’s own catastrophic injury or illness, all accrued annual, sick, personal, holiday, and compensatory leave and all anticipated annual and sick leave for the current leave calendar year must be used.
(2)	For the catastrophic injury or illness of a family member, all accrued annual, personal, holiday, and compensatory leave and all anticipated annual leave for the current leave calendar year must be used. All five days of sick family leave and any additional sick family leave for which the employee is eligible must be used.
f.	Up to 12 weeks of donated leave per leave calendar year may be received for all conditions of the employee and family members cumulatively, but donations may not be received in more than two consecutive leave calendar years. Donated leave is added to the recipient’s sick leave balance on a biweekly basis. Recipients do not repay the donor for donated leave. Leave usage is monitored closely to ensure that donated leave is used only for absences related to the catastrophic illness or injury.
g.	The recipient’s entitlement to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act will be reduced, where applicable, by donated leave that is used. Entitlements to sick leave without pay (for an employee’s own illness) or family care leave without pay (for a family member’s illness) will also be reduced.
h.	Donated leave may be used on an intermittent basis. However, each absence may be required to be medically documented as due to the same catastrophic illness or injury.
i.	An employee is not eligible to receive donations of leave if, during the previous six months, the employee has been placed on a written leave restriction, or has received a written reprimand or suspension related to attendance.
81
j.	Donated leave that remains unused once the employee is released by the physician for full-time work, when the family member’s condition no longer requires the
employee’s absence, or at the end of the leave calendar year, must be returned to the donors in inverse order of donation. However, if at the end of the year, the absence is expected to continue beyond the greater of 20 workdays or the amount of annual and sick leave that could be earned and used in the following leave calendar year, donated leave may be carried into the next year.
Section 3.	Donors
a.	A donor may voluntarily donate annual and personal leave to an employee within
the donor’s agency who meets the requirements of the Leave Donation Program. Donations may be made to multiple employees, as long as the minimum donation is made to each employee.
b.	Donations must be made in increments of one day (7.50 or 8.0 hours), but not more
than five days can be donated to any one employee in the same leave calendar year. The donor’s annual leave balance after donation cannot be less than the equivalent of five workdays of leave (37.5 or 40.0 hours). Anticipated personal leave may not be donated.
c.	The donation is effected by the completion and submission of a Request to Donate
Leave to the agency Human Resource Office. Leave is deducted from the donor’s annual and/or personal leave balance at the time of donation and transferred to the recipient in order by the date and time the Request to Donate Leave form is received.
d.	Unused donations are returned to the donor if: the recipient or family member
recovers, dies, or separates before the donor’s leave is used; or if the recipient does not use the leave by the end of the leave calendar year, and is expected to either return to work within 20 workdays or to have sufficient anticipated leave available in the new year to cover the absence. In accordance with Section 1 above, an employee whose family member dies and who does not have accrued or anticipated sick leave available, may use donated leave as bereavement leave, subject to the limitations in Article 11, Section 6.
Section 4.	The provisions of this Article are not grievable under Article 34 of this Agreement.
Section 5.	For the purpose of this Article, domestic partner shall be defined as a same sex
domestic partner who meets the eligibility criteria established by the Commonwealth.

APPENDIX E
RULES OF THE ACCELERATED GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
RULE 1
THE JOINT PENNSYLVANIA STATE COMMITTEE
Section 1.	- Function
It shall be the sole purpose of the Joint Pennsylvania State Committee to hear unresolved grievances from Step 1. The Joint State Committee shall have the authority to render final and binding decisions on all grievances properly brought before them.
Section 2.	- Composition
All Joint Pennsylvania State Committees shall be made up of an equal number of representatives selected by the respective parties, with half being designated by the Union, and half designated by the Commonwealth - from persons not directly involved in the case. Each Committee Panel will consist of a total of six (6) or eight (8) members, as agreed between the parties. In addition, each party shall designate one of its Committee representatives as a CoChairperson for the purpose of ensuring the orderly execution of the established procedures.
RULE 2
MEETING DOCKETS
A docket indicating the cases scheduled to be heard at each Joint State Committee meeting will be furnished by the Office of Administration (Bureau of Labor Relations) at least ten (10) days prior to the date of each meeting. Copies are to be provided to District 1199P, Service Employees International Union. AFL-CIO, CLC and the affected Employers (Divisions of Labor Relations).
Once the docket has been prepared and distributed to all interested parties, no additional cases can be added to the docket for that meeting, unless agreed upon by the parties. If the CoChairperson for the Union and the Co-Chairperson for the Commonwealth mutually agree that a case may be heard by the Joint State Committee on short notice, then such case will be placed on a supplemental docket prior to the Joint State Committee meeting.
A discharged employee, or employees in cases of conflicting seniority claims, shall be notified within a reasonable time prior to the hearing by the party filing the grievance of the time and place of the grievance meeting, and of the employee's rights, including the right to be present at such hearing. In the event the Union or Commonwealth does not give notice to the employee, the Committee nevertheless, may in its discretion hear and decide the case.
99
RULE 3 PROCEDURES ON GRIEVANCES
Section 1.	- Filing of Grievances
The grievance shall be reduced to writing by the Union on a form approved by the Joint State Committee. Copies of same shall be submitted to the Office of Administration (Bureau of Labor Relations), District 1199P, Service Employees International Union, AFL-CIO, CLC, and the affected Employer (Division of Labor Relations).
Section 2.	- Selection of Panel
The Union and the Commonwealth will select their respective Co-Chairpersons. The position of Acting Chairperson for each Joint State Committee meeting will be alternately filled by each side. Each Co-Chairperson shall select his/her panel members to hear each case on the docket. Any Joint State Committee panel hearing a case shall consist of three (3) or four (4) representatives designated by each party, and at all times shall consist of an equal number of Commonwealth and Union representatives. The parties agree that the normal panel will consist of three members designated by each side. It is further agreed and understood between the parties that discussions will occur prior to the Committee meeting if either party anticipates the need to constitute a panel of 4 members from each side.
In the event any case on the docket affects the work location of any member of the panel, then such panel member shall be removed from the panel for that case, and the appropriate CoChairperson shall designate another member of his/her group to the Committee to hear that particular case.
No representative of either side, who participated in the prior hearing of the case at the First Step shall be permitted to act as a member of the panel hearing the case at Step 2.
Section 3.	- Settlements
If a case, after being placed on the Joint State Committee's docket for a particular meeting, is settled by the parties involved, each party shall inform the co-chairpersons of the Joint State Committee of the settlement before the meeting when such case is scheduled to be heard.
Section 4.	- Postponement of Cases
Postponement of cases on the agenda of a Joint State Committee will be permitted only once for each party. Notice of a postponement shall be given to the other party by the fastest possible method of communication upon knowledge of the need to postpone. No subsequent postponements by that party will be permitted by the Joint State Committee.
100
Section 5.	- Default
In the event either party in a dispute fails to appear before the Joint State Committee, or a panel thereof, without an authorized postponement, the Joint State Committee shall render a default decision in favor of the appearing party. If either party in a case which is scheduled to be heard at a particular meeting fails to appear at the time the case is called, that case will be placed at the end of the Docket and will be called again after all of the cases preceding it have been heard. At that time when the case is called for the second time, if the party again fails to appear, the Committee shall render a default decision in favor of the appearing party. However, in any such case, the Co-Chairperson of the group whose representative fails to appear may appoint a member of the Committee, or an alternate, to present the case. Only with the express consent of both CoChairpersons, shall the State Committee be required to meet on the day following the day of a scheduled meeting because of the failure of a party to appear on the date for which the hearing was scheduled.
RULE 4
OPERATION OF JOINT PENNSYLVANIA STATE COMMITTEE
Section 1.	- Rules
The operation of the Joint State Committee shall be in accordance with these Rules of Procedure and such other rules as may from time to time be adopted by the Joint State Committee. Such other rules shall be established by a majority vote of the Joint State Committee provided; however, both the Union and the Commonwealth members of the Committee have equal voting power. Whenever an addition or amendment to these Rules of Procedure, or other rules duly adopted, is proposed, it shall be presented in writing to the Joint State Committee at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee and voted upon at the following meeting.
Section 2.	- Order of Cases
Docketed discharge cases will be heard during the time period scheduled for the Joint State Committee for which it has been docketed. All other cases will be heard by the Joint State Committee in the order in which the Chairpersons mutually agree.
Section 3.	- Hearings
In the hearing of a case, either party may present any evidence bearing on the facts of the particular case, and may present testimony of witnesses either in person or by written witness statements. However, these statements must contain the following statement:
"THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS BEING GIVEN BY ME FREELY AND WITHOUT COERCION FOR OFFICIAL COMMONWEALTH BUSINESS AND WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR ALL PURPOSES, INCLUDING ACTIONS UNDER THE STATUTES OF THIS COMMONWEALTH, JUST AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN SWORN OR AFFIRMED BEFORE A COURT OF LAW OR FORMAL ARBITRATION PANEL."
101
All evidence to be presented must be made known to the other party within a reasonable time prior to the hearing. HOWEVER, NO LATER THAN FORTY-EIGHT (48) HOURS PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED MEETING OF THE JOINT STATE COMMITTEE. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE ONLY PERMISSIBLE EXCEPTIONS: BARGAINING HISTORY, PRECEDENT SETTING ARBITRATION AWARDS, PRECEDENT SETTING SETTLEMENTS, COURT DECISIONS, AND LABOR BOARD DECISIONS. Failure to comply with this rule by either party, shall constitute grounds for the Committee to refuse to consider the evidence in question if an objection to its introduction is raised. During the hearing, only panel members, alternate members of the Joint State Committee, the parties presenting the case, and those directly involved in the specific case being heard, shall be allowed to sit in the immediate area where the hearing is being conducted. Other members of the Joint State Committee, except for the designated panel hearing the case, shall not participate in the presentation, the discussion, or the questioning.
In discharge, involuntary demotion, suspension and reprimand cases, the Commonwealth must present its evidence first; in all other cases, the Union will present its evidence first. Each party shall declare, prior to the presentation of its case, whether there will be a co-presenter on the respective case. The number of co-presenters shall be limited to two (2) individuals, and a copresenter shall only supplement the presentation of the case. Both sides will have an opportunity to summarize and rebut, however, when co-presenters are used, only one (1) of the co-presenters may respond during the Summation and Rebuttal portion of the presentation. After each party has presented its case and its official rebuttal testimony, the panel members will be free to ask questions of the parties. After such questioning, the panel of the Joint State Committee will retire to executive session and will vote, and thereby render its decision. The voting will be conducted by secret ballot if requested by any member of the committee, otherwise, voting by a show of hands will be deemed to be sufficient. When the panel goes into executive session in order to decide the case, all others must retire from the room. After a decision has been reached by a majority vote of the panel, the decision shall be reduced to writing and provided to the parties in a manner agreed upon by the Joint State Committee.
Section 4.	- Recess
A recess may be requested by either party during the hearing of a case. However, if such request is granted by the Acting Chairperson, it shall not exceed one hour. The Acting Chairperson may also call for recess at any time, but such recess not to exceed one hour in duration.
Section 5.	- Minutes
The Commonwealth co-chair shall prepare written minutes of each committee meeting, briefly outlining the facts and the decision reached by the Committee in each case heard. Copies of all such minutes and decisions shall be provided to the Union. The Office of Administration will provide copies of these documents to all Commonwealth Agencies (Division of Labor Relations) participating in the AGP. Minutes for the Joint State Committee will be approved at the next meeting of the Committee and will form the official record of the Committee action.
102
Section 6.	Time and Place
The JPSC shall meet on a quarterly basis, unless otherwise mutually agreed.

RE: Recruitment and Retention
Dear Mr. DeBruin:
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and District 1199P SEIU, AFL-CIO, CLC (the Union) recognize that employee recruitment and/or retention issues, including the effects of mandatory overtime, (particularly in the nursing profession) may arise, or become aggravated, during the term of the collective bargaining agreement. This recognition reflects the past experiences of the parties and the long-standing nurse recruitment, retention and mobility issues.
District 1199P/SEIU authorizes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (through the Office of Administration) to utilize any of the following concepts to deal with such a recruitment and retention problem causing serious staffing issues in bargaining unit jobs: one-time hiring bonuses; pay range adjustments and/or pay-step increases. In addition, the parties may mutually agree to the utilization of similar concepts.
When the Office of Administration determines that one or more of these concepts needs to be utilized, to respond to a state-wide departmental, and/or work location-specific recruitment or retention problem, the Union shall be given notice of this determination. This notice shall be provided at least thirty calendar days in advance of the anticipated implementation date. If the Union requests a meet and discuss meeting regarding the Commonwealth’s intent, such meeting shall be expeditiously arranged. Similarly, the Union may request, and the Commonwealth shall honor, bargaining on the impact of the Commonwealth’s decision. (Note: Any such impact bargaining shall not prohibit the Commonwealth from acting within the scope of this Understanding to implement concepts to deal with the recruitment and/or retention issues).
A meet and discuss meeting between the parties to discuss nurse recruitment and retention issues shall occur within 180 days of the signing of the Agreement. Thereafter, the Union shall not make such a request more than once each fiscal year. Such requests shall be made in writing to the Deputy Secretary for Human Resources and Management, Office of Administration. Upon receipt of such a request, the Deputy Secretary for Human Resources and
Management shall cause a meet and discuss meeting to be convened to discuss the Union’s concerns and proposals.

RE: Procedures to be followed if removing an employee from a FRN trial period
Dear Mr. DeBruin:
The parties have met and discussed over a procedure to be followed when a determination is made to terminate the reassignment of a Registered Nurse to a Forensic Registered Nurse during the trial period described in Article 25, Section 8 of the collective bargaining agreement. The parties have agreed as follows:
1.	The assessment that a return is indicated and the actual return may be made at any point during the six month period when a determination is made that it is warranted based on the employee’s performance. The decision to return an employee will not be made for arbitrary or capricious reasons.
2.	The employee will be given notice of the assessment and when signing to denote the receipt, will indicate on the assessment document in writing a request for Bureau of Hospital Operations review.
3.	The employee and /or the union will then, upon request, be afforded access to information upon which the assessment is based.
4.	Within 10 days of the receipt of the information, the employee and/or the union can request in writing to the Director of the Bureau of Hospital Operations or designee a review of the information on which the assessment to reassign the employee was made. The union and/or the employee shall state the reason they believe the reassignment was improper and can attach any documentation they have to support their claim.
5.	The employee and/or the union may request a meeting to discuss the issue with the Director of the Bureau of Hospital Operations or designee.
6.	The Director of the Bureau of Hospital Operations/designee will then review the information/documentation (verbal as well as written) submitted by both the management and the employee/union and will advise the parties of a determination.
7.	The determination will be final and binding and is not grievable through the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in the collective Bargaining agreement.
If you are in agreement with this procedure, please sign the enclosed copy and return it to the Bureau of Labor Relations.
