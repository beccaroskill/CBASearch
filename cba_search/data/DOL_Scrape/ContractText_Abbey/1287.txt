8.1.1	If, during the term of this Agreement, the Union negotiates an agreement with any “Recognized Employer Association” which provides more favorable wages, hours or working conditions for the type of work covered by this Agreement than the wages, hours or working conditions contained in this Agreement then, in that event, CPMCA may at its option adopt those more favorable conditions by written notice to District Council No. 16.
8.1.2	It is understood and agreed that the Union has entered into other agreements containing clauses similar to Subparagraph 8.1.1 above and that the Union interprets those clauses as requiring the signatory employer or employer association to adopt all the terms of an agreement allegedly containing more favorable wages, hours or working conditions and not just the more favorable conditions. So long as the Union interprets and applies such similar clauses in other agreements in this fashion, then CPMCA, in exercising its option under Subparagraph 8.1.1 shall likewise be required to adopt all of the terms of a more favorable agreement.
8.1.3	CPMCA shall have the same option described in subparagraphs 8.1.1 and 8.1.2 above in the case of any independent contract (i.e., an agreement executed by the Union with an individual employer not represented by an association and not limited to a single project), provided that the independent contract also contains a favored nations clause.
8.1.4	In the event the Union negotiates a project agreement (i.e., an agreement limited to a single project) before the owner or general contractor has selected a plumbing or piping contractor, it is agreed that the terms of any such project agreement shall apply to any contractor bidding on the project and the Union shall provide CPMCA with a copy of the project agreement so that CPMCA may advise the contractors it represents to take into account the terms of the project agreement in any bid submittal for the project.

If a Local Union confines its adoption of an addendum to a particular project, then the terms of the addendum will be available only to those contractors bidding on that project.
