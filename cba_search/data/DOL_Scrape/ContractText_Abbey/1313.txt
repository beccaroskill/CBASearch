WITNESSETH THAT:
It is agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows:
ARTICLE 1	- UNION RECOGNITION
Section 1.	Recognition. The Employer, in compliance with the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, and pursuant to a certification of the National Labor Relations Board recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative of all Fabricators, Welders, R&D Technicians, and Wranglers of the Employer at its Cincinnati, Ohio establishment, 100 Progress Place., any location within a 1 mile radius of the Employer's present location, or a new location in case the establishment moves their plant to a point within a radius of 25 miles from said establishment, or within the Cincinnati Commercial Zone as outlined on the 1977 Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce Map, whichever is greater, but excluding all sales employees, office clerical employees, vocational co-op students, and all professional employees, guards, and supervisors as defined in the Act.
Section 2.	Co-Op Students. Vocational co-op trainees shall be limited to two students at a time and employed only during the regular co-op program period. Co-op students will be limited to no more than 25 hours of work per week during the regular school year and 40 hours per week otherwise, Co-op students will not be offered overtime until all bargaining unit members in the department have been offered overtime. Choice of student, vocational school, and co-op program is vested solely in the Employer. Within 60 days after completion of co-op training, upon promotion or assignment to work beyond the regular co-op program, a co-op
1
student will be required to join the Union as a regular employee and be placed in a job classification.
Section 3.	Exclusive Representative. The Employer will neither negotiate nor make any agreements for any of its employees in the bargaining unit covered hereby unless it be through the duly authorized representative of the Union.
Section 4.	Successors and Assigns. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not apply to any subsequent assignee, purchaser or successor in interest.
Section 5.	Union Shop. It is understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that as a condition of continued employment, all persons who are hereafter employed by the Employer in the unit which is the subject of this agreement, shall become members of the Union not later than the thirty-first (31st) day following the beginning of their employment or the execution date of this Agreement, whichever is the later; that effective from and after the thirty-first (31st) day following the execution date of this Agreement, the continued employment by the Employer in said unit of persons who are already members in good standing of the Union shall be conditioned upon those persons continuing their payment of the period dues of the Union; and that the continued employment of persons were in the employ of the Employer prior to the date of this Agreement and who are not now members of the Union shall be conditioned upon those persons becoming members of the Union no later than the thirty-first (31 st) day following the execution date of this Agreement. The failure of any person to become a member of the Union at such required time shall oblige the Employer, upon written notice from the Union to such effect and to the further effect that Union membership was available to such person on the same terms and conditions generally available to other members, to forthwith discharge such person. Further, the failure of any person to tender his Union dues as required
2
herein shall upon written notice to the Employer, by the Union to such effect, obligate the Employer to discharge such person, and the Union agrees to hold the Employer harmless against any liability arising out of its actions in reliance upon such notice.
Section 6.	Dues Deductions. The Employer agrees to deduct each week of all employees covered by this agreement, application fees and dues uniformly paid by members of the Union; provided, however, that the employees have provided pre-written authorization for such action on the part of the Employer. Such written authorization shall conform to and be in accordance with all applicable Federal and State laws,
All monies deducted shall be forwarded to the President or Secretary-Treasurer of the Union by the tenth (10th) of each following month.
The Union will furnish a statement to the Employer each month upon which the payroll deductions will be based.
The Union will hold the Employer harmless from any liability of whatever sort, which it might incur arising out of its actions taken in good faith to comply with this section and agrees to defend the Employer from any claims arising therefrom.
Section 7.	MNPL Check-Off. The Employer agrees to deduct and transmit to the Treasurer of the Machinists Non-Partisan Political League (MNPL) the amount specified for each week worked from the wages of those employees who voluntarily authorize such contributions on the forms provided for that purpose by MNPL. These transmittals shall occur monthly and shall be accompanied by a list of the names of those employees for whom such deductions have been made and the amount deducted for each employee.

Section 2. Non-Contract Benefits. All employee benefits of any nature whatsoever, which are not specifically required by this Agreement, are terminable at will and without cause at any time by the Employer.
ARTICLE IV- SENIORITY
Section 1.	Bargaining Unit Transfers. Seniority is the length of the employee's "continuous employment" by the Employer since his last hiring date. Any employee of the Employer who is now outside the bargaining unit at the Cincinnati plant of the Employer
7
and any employee in the future who is transferred to a position with the Employer outside the bargaining Unit shall retain his seniority for a period of seven (7) years, but shall not accrue additional seniority while so working outside the bargaining unit. After such seven (7) year period he will lose all seniority within the bargaining unit.
Section 2.	Seniority List. A list giving the seniority of each employee within each department in the bargaining unit shall be prepared and posted by the Employer on the bulletin board every six (6) months. The seniority as shown by said list of any employee who does not within ten (10) days after the posting by the Employer of such list file written exceptions with the office of the Employer as to his seniority rating shall be considered correct as listed and such copy will then be given the Union.
Section 3.	Probationary Period. The Employer shall place new employees on probation for a period of one-hundred and eighty (180) calendar days during which time such new employees shall have no seniority rights and during which time the Employer may discharge such employees without cause and without being subject to the grievance procedure herein. In case of layoff, the Employer shall lay off such new employees in the department in which an employee is laid off before laying off employees with seniority in that department, provided the employees with seniority have the skill and ability to perform the work available. New employees after having fulfilled the probation period above described shall date their seniority from the beginning of such period,
Section 4.	Recall Factors. In the event of lay off or recall from lay off of employees, the following factors shall be considered:
(a)	Seniority
(b)	Skill and ability to perform the work in question
8
It is recognized that Fabricators have greater skill and ability than Wranglers.
Section 5.	Injury/Illness Layoff. An employee shall be continued on the seniority list of the Employer for a period equal to his seniority, but not to exceed twelve (12) months from the date of his lay off. An employee on lay off because of a compensable injury incurred on the job, or proven illness or accident shall remain on the seniority list for a period equal to his seniority at the time of said lay off but not less than twelve (12) months or more than sixty (60) months. Employees on layoff will be offered re-employment in their department before new employees are hired and will be paid wages from Article VI.
All lay-off and recall from lay off of employees covered by Article IV will be governed by Article IV, Section 4 of this Agreement.
Section 6.	Termination of Seniority. The terms "continued service" and "employed continuously" as used in this Article shall be so construed that absence from employment due to illness, accident, family deaths, vacations or leaves of absence, or lay off by the Employer due to lack of work shall not cause a break in the meaning of the word "continuous" for the purpose of computing seniority, pay rates and other provisions of this Agreement unless the employee's seniority is terminated. Seniority shall be terminated for any of the following reasons:
(a)	If the employee quits;
(b)	If the employee is discharged for cause;
(c)	If the employee is absent without notifying the Employer for three (3) working days;
(d)	If the employee fails to report for work within Five (5) days after being notified to report by certified or registered mail. It shall be the duty of
9
each employee at all times to keep the Employer office advised in writing of his current mailing address to entitle such employee to the benefits of this Article; and
(e)	If continuous absence or lay off because of sickness or injury extends beyond the limitations set forth in Section 5 of this Article-
Section 7.	Military Service. Regular employees who leave the service of the company to enter the United States Armed Forces, or are drafted in the service of the U.S. Maritime Commission, or are drafted by the United States Government for civilian service, will, upon their return, within ninety (90) days from release from such service be granted such reinstatement and seniority rights as such employee is entitled to under the applicable provisions of law.
Section 8.	Leaving Early. When it is necessary, in the sole judgement of management, because of a lack of work, to send employees home early for the remainder of the day, then the employees will be sent home by seniority order with the newest employee in each classification first.
Section 9.	Shift Selection. Bids for assignment to the first, second, third or split week shifts will be considered during the months of February, June, and October or when a permanent vacancy occurs. All new and vacated positions shall also be posted for bid. All bids will be considered on the basis of seniority, but only if consistent with the personnel requirements of the Employer. A bid sheet will be posted two (2) weeks prior to the effective date of scheduled shift changes to enable all employees to consider bidding. A list of shift changes will be posted one (1) week prior to shift change date.
10
ARTICLE V— HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
Section 1.	Work Dav and Work Week. The normal work week shall consist of forty (40) hours per week, excluding lunch periods. The Employer shall determine the days and hours of work for each department and shift. The work week shall begin at the starting time of the first shift on Monday of each, week and end on the following Monday at the starting time of the first shift.
Section 2.	Overtime. All time worked in excess of forty (40) hours per week shall be paid for at the rate of one and one-half (1%) times the employee's straight time hourly rate.

Holiday pay will be considered time worked for purposes of this Section. There shall be no duplication or pyramiding of overtime pay. The Employer may require and assign overtime work when and how, in its opinion, the overtime work is necessary for the efficient operation of the business. As a matter of policy, however, the Employer will try to meet its overtime needs on a voluntary basis. When feasible, the Employer will give third-shift employees advance notice (which may include the use of mass text or e-mails) of weekly voluntary overtime as given to employees on other shifts. If the Employer reduces regularly scheduled hours in any work week, all voluntary overtime worked that week will be paid at time and one-half (1 lA)

Section 7.	Excusal from Overtime. In the event that the entire shift (or majority thereof) is required to work overtime, an employee may request to be excused from the overtime work and such request will not be unreasonably denied.
Section 8.	Refusal of Overtime. Employees may refuse overtime work on a seniority basis provided an employee with less seniority is available and has the skill and ability to perform the required work or if they have not received 12 hours notice.
Section 9.	Air Travel. All required air travel time pay away from the shop, shall be at the employee's appropriate rate. Time spent to and from the airport is not to be considered hours worked.
