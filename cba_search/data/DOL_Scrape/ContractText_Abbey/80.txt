(4)	If an employee quits or is terminated for any reason during a month, even if eighty (80) hours have been worked, no contribution is required for the following month nor will coverage be granted.
c.	Extended Coverage Rules:
(I)	Eligible employees who were either in a bridging status or eligible for bridging on July ), 1985 (bridged employees) and who are laid off due to lack of work shall have their health and welfare contributions paid for by the company (employee medical coverage only) for a period not to exceed eleven (11) months from the date of layoff (bridging period) to provide employee coverage during the layoff period, provided the company has made at least one (I) contribution payment as a result of the employee working eighty (80) hours.
(2)	Non-fourteen hundred (non-1400) hour employees who were neither in bridging status nor
73
bridged as of July 1, 1985 (“unbridged” employees) will not qualify for bridging. Unbridged employees who are laid off due to lack of work shall have the right to self-pay for health and welfare (employee medical coverage only) for the bridging period, provided the company has made at least one (1) contribution payment as a result of the employee working eighty (80) hours.
(3)	In the event the employee (bridged or unbridged) is not returned from layoff following the expiration of the bridging period and. in the case of the unbridged employee, provided self-payments have been made for health and welfare coverage throughout the bridging period, the employee may elect to pay the health and welfare contributions for the employee’s own coverage at the applicable rate for an additional period not to exceed twenty-four (24) additional months. Thereafter, the employee must requalify for bridging or for the right to make self-payments by being recalled to work from layoff or returning from personal leave and by the company’s payment of the contribution for at least one (I) month as required under the 1400 Hour plan.

The intent of this paragraph is to prohibit selectivity against the plans. If the employee does not pay for dependent coverage during the eleven (11) month bridging period, the employee cannot pay for dependent children coverage for the twenty-four (24) month additional period.
74
(5)	Bridged employees electing to self-pay for coverage pursuant to this Section must elect to do so within 31 days of employment. Unbridged employees electing to make self-payments for coverage may pay on a month-to-month basis after company-paid coverage ends,

However, employees may make their own contributions up to eleven (11) months providing that either the company or the employee made a contribution for the month preceding the illness, industrial injury or personal leave of absence. The eleven (11) month period begins with the first day of the month following the month for which the employer would have been required to make a contribution under paragraphs 4. b. or 4. c. (1) or for which the employee had the right to make a contribution under paragraph 4. c. (2) had the illness, industrial injury or personal leave of absence nor occurred. After the eleven (11) month period expires, the employee has no further self-pay rights under this paragraph until a contribution is required from the company because of hours worked.
(7)	Employees who are permanently laid off as a result of a plant closure as defined in Appendix L, shall be eligible to make self-contributions for their continued health and welfare coverage under these Plans for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months after their termination date. Such self-contributions must be continuous with either the company’s or the employee’s last contribution without any lapse in coverage. Employees can make self-contributions for their own coverage or for the coverage they elected in accord with paragraph 4. c. (2) or 4. c. (4) above. If said election has not been made at the time of
75
the plant closure, the previous years’ election shall apply.
(8)	Unless pre-funded through payroll withholding, all self-payments for health and welfare coverage must be made directly to the company by the sixth (6th) day of the month for which coverage is being purchased. Self-pay coverage must be continuous. If a payment is missed, the employee’s (and dependent’s coverage if applicable) ends and the employee loses the right to self-pay for coverage in future months unless and until employer-paid eligibility is reestablished.

APPENDIX F SICK LEAVE PLAN
1.	Eligibility.
Employees who have worked in the plant at least fourteen hundred (1400) combined straight and overtime hours, per Appendix B, Preface to the Fringe Benefit Appendices, during the preceding calendar year or anniversary year are eligible. Paid sick leave hours shall be credited towards the eligibility hours referred to above.
2.	Waiting Period.
Except in cases of industrial disability or accident which necessitate absence from work, there shall be a waiting period of three (3) working days, including overtime days the employee would have worked on each disability before the benefits are payable. In the case of a relapse caused by the same illness or injury within two (2) weeks after an employee returns to work, no waiting period is required. If an employee is hospitalized at any time during the employee’s three-day waiting period, the full wailing period is waived. Surgery performed on an out-patient basis in lieu of hospitalization, as determined by the Joint Benefit Trust Utilization Review Service, shall be considered hospitalization for the application of this paragraph.
3.	Calculation of Benefits.
Disability pay will be calculated on the basis of straight-time hours (including the twenty-five cents (25f) paid on straighttime Saturdays and night shift premium) the employee would have worked (based on each employee’s annual assignment hourly rate), for each of the employee’s scheduled straight
86
time days of work lost due to the disability, less the waiting period. If an employee is assigned to a temporary job, due to an industrial injury and I a id-off from the temporary job, the determination as to whether the employee would have worked will be based on whether the employee would or would not have been on layoff from the employee's regular assignment. If the employee is on layoff and is called back to work but is unable to return because of a disability, sick leave will start for the time the employee would have been at work, less the waiting period. If the employee, based on seniority and qualifications would have been on layoff, no disability pay is due during such layoff periods. The intent of this Section is to provide that an eligible employee will receive the designated sick pay for straight-time scheduled days of work for which the employee is not paid wages on account of the disability.
In no event shall there be a layoff for the purpose of avoiding the payments of sick benefits.
Sick leave payments by the company shall be made to the employee not later than the second payday after the company receives notification of the illness or injury,

5.	Application of Benefit Schedule.
If an employee becomes disabled while on vacation or sabbatical leave, at the employee’s request, such employee may have vacation or sabbatical leave interrupted and be placed on sick leave status on Monday of any week providing the employee notifies the company and substantiates the disability on Monday. Failing such Monday notification, the employee may be placed on sick leave Monday of the next week. The employee’s unused vacation shall be granted on request on a later date.
The benefits under Workers’ Compensation are separate from and in addition to the benefits provided for non-industrial cases. For example, the employee may exhaust the employee’s benefit schedule while off work for a Workers’ Compensation injury but after returning to work will still remain eligible to apply the schedule of benefits for a nonindustrial disability. This also applies in reverse in the event the non-indust rial disability occurs first and an industrial injury occurs after the employee returns to work.
6.	Integration with S.D.I. and Workers’ Compensation.
Company-paid benefits will be fully integrated with S.D.I. and Workers’ Compensation, and this will be accomplished in the following manner:
a.	Full-week benefits—during full-week benefits the company will supplement the weekly S.D.I. and Workers’ Compensation payments for which the employee is eligible up to a maximum of 100% of the employee’s normal net weekly straight-time earnings. The net weekly straight-time eamings will be based on the last straighttime week prior to the commencement of sick pay.
88
b.	In the event the weekly S.D.I. and/or Workers’ Compensation payments become subject to taxation as income, the maximum net of the employee’s normal straight-time earnings provided in 6.a. shall become 100%.
c.	Half-week benefits—during the half-week benefits the benefits due from the company shall be a maximum of one-half the employee’s normal weekly straight-time earnings. Company payments, up to a maximum of one-half the employee's straight-time earnings, will supplement S.D.I. and Workers’ Compensation payments by the full one-half of the employee’s straight-time weekly earnings if the combined benefits would equal more than 100% of the employee’s normal weekly straight-time earnings.
If the combination of half the employee’s straight-time’ earnings for the week involved, plus the employee’s weekly S.D.I. benefits, do not equal 100% of Ihe employee’s weekly straight-time earnings, the difference up to 100% will be paid from the employee’s S.D.I. reserve account.
7.	Subsequent Employee Credits Resulting From the S.D.I. Integration.
AU S.D.I. payments that have been used as a credit against the weekly benefits that the company is obligated to pay, will be set up by the company as a credit for the individual employee concerned and will be available to the employee, if disabled, in accordance with standard S.D.I. practices after the employee is no longer eligible to collect S.D.I. benefits during the disability period involved.
Any employee eligible for "Sick Leave Plan” benefits who retires on or after age 65 will be entitled to receive all S.D.I. payments remaining in the employee’s reserve account that have been used as a credit by the company. Providing the employee meets the following conditions, weekly payments will be made in the same amount of money as was weekly credited to the reserve account:
a.	The employee is receiving payments under the Sick Leave Plan at the time of retirement.
b.	The employee remains continually incapacitated by the same illness and can satisfy the provisions of “Proof of Claim’’ under the Sick Leave Plan in the same manner as
89
an active member.
c.	The employee is no longer eligible for S.D.I. payments.
8.	Renewal of Benefits.
Whenever an employee has worked one hundred thirty (130) working days or more since the employee’s last paid disability, including holiday, vacation and sabbatical leave, the full schedule of benefits is renewed automatically in accordance with the employee’s service. The employee is always eligible for the scheduled amount of benefits, less accumulated periods of paid disability, during the one hundred thirty (130) work day period necessary for full renewal of benefits.
If an employee is on sick leave at the time the employee becomes ineligible to be continued on the sick leave roster, the employee shall be eligible for the remaining part of the existing benefit schedule as long as the employee remains continuously disabled with the same disability.
9.	Proof of Claim.
If required by the company, a claim for disability payments shall be supported by a certificate from a licensed physician, surgeon, or chiropractor. When required, such certificate shall be supplied to the company by ihe employee. An employee will be eligible for sick leave pay as long as the employee qualifies for state disability benefits under the provisions of Assembly Bill #3082 relating to Alcoholic Recovery Programs. The company shall have the right at any time to make an investigation of each claim filed. Any dispute between the parties as to the validity of a claim shall be referred to (he Arbitration Board.
10.	Notification Required.
In case of illness or disability, notice shall be given to the person or persons designated by the company, provided such person or persons are available to receive such notice during specified hours. The waiting period for benefits shall commence on the date such notice is received by the company unless unusual circumstances beyond the control of the employee make it impossible for the employee to notify the company as provided above.
When requested by the local union, each company shall furnish, at reasonable intervals of time, statements listing the employees receiving sick pay and the amounts paid to each.
11	.Conditions Not Covered.
90
Employees will not be entitled to disability pay under this Plan:
a.	If the sickness or injury is due to willful self-injury, intoxication, the use of narcotics or habit-forming drugs, or for illness or injury resulting from willful, illegal action,
b.	If the employee is injured while performing work for another employer unless such work is performed with the knowledge and written consent of the primary employer,
c.	If the employee’s sickness or injury is the result of an act of war,
d.	The last three (3) working days of an employee’s vacation shall count as waiting days if the employee is sick on those days and gives notice at the start of the sickness in accordance with ‘’Notification Required” above and can submit evidence of sickness as provided under “Proof of Claim.”
This shall not apply if the employee would have been on layoff status during the three (3) day period referred to above.
e.	If an employee receives a settlement or award covering wages lost, the company shall have the right to recover disability payments made by the company during such period or periods,

SPECIAL ADDENDUM TO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT
PREAMBLE
The parties to the Collective Bargaining Agreement have a mutual interest in encouraging employers to bring additional work to existing or new facilities through the introduction of products not currently manufactured, processed or packaged at such facilities. In this regard, the parties have entered into an experimental agreement as an addendum to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The term of this experimental agreement shall be consistent with that of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The purpose of the agreement is to:
J.	Stimulate new capital investment in plant expansion, new equipment and new products.
2.	Encourage bringing work from outside the jurisdiction of the Northern California Cannery industry into plants covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
3.	Encourage the creation of jobs in the plants of companies covered under the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
4.	Encourage the stabilization of the industry by broadening its base of work activity to establish new product.
In view of the fact that this addendum establishes an entirely new concept for the industry, it is agreed and understood that it is an experimental agreement under which both parties will operate in good faith, directed toward achieving the established objectives.
Definition of New Work
For the purpose of this agreement, new work shall be defined as Bracket IV and V work as described below which is performed on any products new to the plant which have not been manufactured or processed at the plant or at any of the facilities covered under the Collective Bargaining Agreement by any member company of the employer during the three (3) year period prior to July I, 1982. A product will be considered “new work” for a period of twelve (12) months from the commencement of the new product operation.
Applicable Wage Rate
Wage rates for work performed on new work as described above will be $8.32/hour for Bracket V and $8.94/hour for Bracket IV, Such rates will be applicable to all Bracket IV and V work in die processing, canning, packaging and related work, but shall not
118
be applicable to warehousing, shipping and related Bracket IV and V work or to any work on such products other than that in Bracket IV or V which shall be paid for at applicable contract rates. The wage rates for Bracket IV and V as provided herein for new work shall be adjusted by the same cent per hour increases as are made applicable to Bracket IV and V contract rates effective July 1,2004 and July 1,2005.
Special Conditions
It is agreed that employees will have the right annually to bid on transfers to such work under procedures established by the committee provided for in the following paragraph. It is further agreed that guaranteed annual assignment rates will not be applicable to such new work assignments, but hours worked at such rates will be counted for purposes of maintaining guaranteed annua) assignments as provided under procedures established by said committee.
A committee of six (6) (three (3) appointed by the Union and three (3) appointed by the Employer) shall be formed to develop-procedures and to assist the parties in the implementation of the provisions of this special addendum. A representative of the company introducing the new product and a representative of any effected union shall also participate in any discussions involving such product. The company introducing a new product shall notify the Union, the Employer and the effected Union at least ninety (90) days in advance of the commencement of processing such product and provide particulars regarding the product, the length of the processing season and Other such relevant information. By mutual agreement between the parties, the period of notification may be less than ninety (90) days. The committee shall meet promptly thereafter to discuss implementation of the processing of the new product. Issues which cannot be resolved by the committee shall be reduced to writing and submitted for settlement under the arbitra-I tion provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The com' mittee shall be established effective July 1, 1982 and the applica-| tion of the special rates provided hereunder shall become effective I January 1, 1983.
Definitions
Current Products —Current Products are those that have been processed at any time, in any plant covered by the collective bargaining contract since July I, 1979. This definition is applicable to new methods used to process a current product, to any new ingredi
