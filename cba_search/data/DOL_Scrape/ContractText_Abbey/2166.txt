ARTICLE II. SENIORITY
Section 1.
Seniority Definition and Classification List
7 Seniority is continuous service with the Company, compiled by the time actually spent on the payroll plus properly approved absences as herein after specified. After the effective date of this Agreement, should more than one person hire in on the same day, seniority will be determined by the last four digits of the new hire’s Social Security Number.

The second highest number will be placed second on the seniority listing, etc. In the event the last four digits are identical, the last five digits will be used.
8	Employees coming into the bargaining unit from nonbargaining unit departments or divisions of the Company who have never previously worked on jobs within the bargaining unit in the Company shall have no seniority for job rights purposes and their seniority for job rights within the bargaining unit shall begin with their date of entry into the bargaining unit.
9	Seniority shall be by job and grouping as set forth in Appendix A. Jobs for seniority purposes, shall include the subdivisions (where there are subdivisions) except as provided in a specific list of job classifications approved by the Union and the Company, in which it is agreed that each subdivision shall be considered separately for seniority purposes.

Such error shall be corrected immediately without loss of seniority, upon written notification to Human Resources by the employee.
Section 5.	Notice of Layoff
27	When an employee is laid off due to curtailment of production, or for other reasons beyond the employee’s control, the Company will give three (3) days advance notice to said employee.

Any employee who has not received a notice due to absence from work will be entitled to layoff notice for only such part of the three (3) days that remains in the period in which he would have been notified had he been at work.
28	The Management will give three (3) days notice of layoffs to the Chief Steward concerned, with a copy to the Financial Secretary and the Chairperson of the Executive Bargaining Committee of the Union on the same date of the posting and it shall also furnish to said Financial Secretary and Chairperson of the Executive Bargaining Committee notice of all employees recalled to work and the disposition thereof; also the disposition of veterans who return within ninety (90) days after discharge.

35	The Union representatives recognized by the Company for seniority purposes, are the members of the Executive Bargaining Committee and the Skilled Trades Chairperson.
Section 10.	Laid-Off Employees-Preference

38	A laid-off employee may job bid for any job that is posted on the job posting board, per Article II, Section 17 of the Basic Labor Agreement.

7S
ARTICLE II, SECTION 10-13
discriminatory, capricious, arbitrary, or failed to consider the work experience submitted or performed by the employee. Any employee, so removed, shall revert to his former laid-off list, and his status shall be the same as immediately prior to his being placed on the job.
Section 11.	Reserved
40
Section 12.	Employee Defined
41 For the purpose of this article dealing with seniority, the word “employee” means any employee who has seniority.
Section 13.	Layoff
42	Where there is a decrease of force in any job, this procedure shall be followed:
43	When the employee is laid off, he must advise Human Resources of what jobs he will accept recall to on the form provided to him by the Company. It is the responsibility of the employee to return the completed form to Human Resources within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt. If the employee fails to advise Human Resources of the classifications to which he will accept recall, he will be placed on recall only to the classification from which he is being laid off. The Company is obligated to recall the employee to these jobs ONLY.
44 (a) Probationary employees shall be the first to be laid off.
The layoff of such probationary employees shall go deep
enough to accommodate the declared surplus of labor
provided that employees having seniority are qualified to
ARTICLE II, SECTION 13
19
perform the work done by these probationary employees and exercise their seniority and accept the applicable rate.
45 (b) (1) If further reductions are required and the removal of additional employees would result in the layoff of employees with one (1) or more years of seniority, an equivalent number of senior employees, who have previously applied, in writing, for optional layoff, shall be placed on optional layoff. Employees may sign the optional layoff form at any time. Employees will be given a copy of this signed optional layoff form. Employees exercising such option will become the lowest seniority person in that classification (for layoff purposes only) and will not exercise any bumping rights as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Employees may remove themselves from optional layoff at any time prior to their name being posted for layoff.
46	Employees on optional layoff will be recalled in accordance with Article II, Section 14, paragraph (h).
47	(2) If, after applying the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) above, further reductions are required, the provisions of paragraph (c), below, shall be applicable. Notice of layoff will be posted in the departments affected at the earliest possible time.
48	(c) Employees will be laid off according to seniority in their respective jobs on an inter-plant basis in conformation to their group seniority list and Appendix A, subject to the following:
49	(1) An employee who has received notice of layoff may exercise his seniority in jobs in his seniority group below his present job as set forth in Appendix A.
20
ARTICLE II, SECTION 13
50	(2) An employee being laid off from any seniority group including Group X will be offered the opportunity to bump the youngest employee in Group X before being laid off from the plant.
51	(3) An employee who has received notice of layoff and who has changed Appendix “A" groups by a promotion (job of higher rate) under Article II, Section 17, may, before being laid off from the plant, exercise his seniority only in the job from which he was promoted.
52	(4) An employee who has received notice of layoff and who has exhausted all available bumping opportunities as described in the preceding paragraphs, may bump into the highest Level I, II, III, or IV classification which he previously successfully held provided his current seniority will enable him to remain in the classification. Individuals utilizing this provision to bump into a Level III classification must have successfully held the Level III classification within the five (5) year period immediately preceding the date of the current layoff notification or must successfully pass the test required for the classification into which they are bumping. Individuals utilizing this provision to bump into a Level IV classification must have successfully held the Level IV classification within the three (3) year period immediately preceding the date of the current layoff notification or must successfully pass the test required for the classification into which they are bumping.
53 (5) An employee who has been given the opportunity and
has refused to bump into lower classifications in his group
or into Group X will not be recalled to such classifications,
unless employee decides to bypass lower classifications in
his group or Group X to bump into “previously held” level
40
ARTICLE II, SECTION 21
Section 21. Absence Due to Illness
146 No employee shall lose his seniority because of absence due to illness, including pregnancy, provided satisfactory evidence is presented of the inability to perform work because of such illness. The parties may at any time, by mutual agreement, direct that any employee be examined by a medical doctor to be selected by the Company and the Union Bargaining Committee. Seniority shall be accumulative for the first twenty-four (24) months of such illness. Such employee shall be reinstated according to seniority. If the employee is physically unable to do the same work or similar work to that which he was doing prior to leave, the Company will endeavor to find suitable work for such employee and will consider recommendations from the Union.
147 In the event there is a disagreement between the employer’s physician and the employee’s physician regarding the medical evidence presented at the time of return from injury or illness, the question shall be submitted to a third physician selected by such two physicians. The medical opinion of the third physician, after examination of the employee and consultation with the other two physicians, shall decide such question. The expenses of the third physician shall be borne jointly by the employer and the employee.
148 An employee who is unable to work due to a disability caused by an injury in the plant or from an occupational illness, shall accumulate seniority and all benefits that accrue thereto for a maximum period of three (3) years, provided he furnishes satisfactory evidence of his continuing disability.
ARTICLE II, SECTION 20
39
141 (e) If no vacancy exists under paragraph (c) above, the employee shall be moved in line with his seniority to a job he is qualified to perform (lowest seniority person is replaced by a restricted employee):
(1)	Within his department
(2)	In his Appendix A Group line
(3)	Within the plant
142	(f) If the medically restricted employee is disqualified from the job on which he is placed, he will, as soon as possible, be placed on another job in the same manner as before.
143	(g) Any employee who has been medically restricted or placed on a job in line with this section and then signs a job posting, such signing will not be recognized unless the job bid is approved by the Medical Department. The Medical Department shall review medically restricted cases, as appropriate, in view of removing them from medical restriction. Any job bid denied under this paragraph will be reviewed by the Union Bargaining Committee and the Vice President Human Resources or his representative.
144	(h) If the employee is medically placed the second time and is medically disqualified from this placement, his case will be reviewed by the Medical Department, the Union Bargaining Committee and the Vice President Human Resources for disposition.
145	(i) In any event, an employee unable to hold or obtain a job will be laid off, and will receive SUB payments, if eligible.
38
ARTICLE II, SECTION 18-20

138	(b) These sections dealing with seniority shall in no way be construed as requiring the Company to employ or retain a worker on a job which he is mentally or physically unable to perform.
139	(c) When an employee cannot perform work due to health or conditions that are harmful to the employee (Medically Restricted), the employee shall be transferred by Human Resources to vacancies which may exist and which he is able to perform:
(1)	Within his department
(2)	In his Appendix A Group line
(3)	Within the plant
140 (d) These moves will be made only after they have been reviewed by the Union Bargaining Committee and the Vice President Human Resources or his representative.
ARTICLE II, SECTION 18
37
127	In all cases of shift change, employees directly affected by such change will be given seven (7) days advance notice thereof whenever possible.
128	Probationary employees will work whatever shift assigned for the first thirty (30) working days.
129	All shift preferences must be in writing and signed by the employee.
130	The most recently dated shift preference shall remain in effect until signed by a new preference form.
131	Departmental management will utilize the most recently filed shift preference to develop the shift alignment for each department.
132	Each employee will have until 11:59 P.M. on June 14th and December 14lh of each calendar year to inform departmental management of their decision to refuse their first preference which shall automatically become their last preference.

ARTICLE VI, SECTION 6
Section 6.	Overtime
General Provisions:
219 The following rules apply to all overtime:
220 The purpose of overtime equalization is to provide the opportunity to all employees to work overtime when available and the intent is to schedule the low-houred employee; however, notwithstanding any other overtime or temporary transfer provision, the Company is not required to schedule an employee more than twelve (12) hours of regular and overtime hours within a twenty-four (24) hour period.
221 Hours not charged because of vacation, military leave, or out of classification work will not be considered out of balance.
222 Overtime hours worked out of classification or department will be equalized to the extent practicable taking into consideration the qualifications of the employees and unusual conditions and where time permits, the Chief Steward will be notified. Because of the nature of this overtime, it may never be in close balance. Overtime will be scheduled as far in advance as possible. In utilizing out of classification or out of department overtime, such overtime offering should not always be afforded to classifications which are populated by only one individual. In the event such overtime is consistently offered to a single classification, the Chairman of the Executive Bargaining Committee and the Vice President Human Resources will meet to discuss the matter.
ARTICLE VI, SECTION 6
61
223 Scheduled overtime within a balancing group shall be equalized in accordance with other provisions of Article VI of this Agreement. No later than January 1, 2007, all overtime postings throughout the facility shall appear in the same form.
224 Employees will not work more than two continuous shifts in any twenty-four (24) hour period including daily, Saturday, and Sunday/Holiday shifts. Hours charged under this paragraph will not exceed sixteen (16) hours in such twenty-four (24) hour period.
225 It is the employee’s or Chief Steward’s responsibility to call any clerical error (such as omissions, incorrect posting, oversight in scheduling, call-in, etc.) in posting and/or scheduling to the attention of the Company before the overtime is worked. Such errors not called to the attention of the Company will be corrected at the earliest possible date. Overtime errors called to the attention of the Company before the overtime is worked, and not corrected, will be paid. It is understood the Chief Steward will be given a copy of any revised posting as soon as possible.
226 There will be three (3) separate balancing boards as follows:
1.	Daily overtime
2.	Saturday overtime
3.	Sunday and Holiday overtime (combined)
227 Exceptions may be made by mutual agreement between the Union Executive Bargaining Committee and the Vice President Human Resources or his designated representative.
62
ARTICLE VI, SECTION 6
228 In every case, the employee must be capable of performing the scheduled work. If the low-houred employee is not capable and not qualified, he may be bypassed without being charged for the overtime.
229 The low-houred employee(s) who is absent for any reason, except for vacation or military leave, so as not to be available for notification, shall have the hours charged on the appropriate board the same as if he were there and refused to work or had worked. Employees on vacation will not work overtime.
230 An employee who is on a one day vacation may not work overtime on the same day on which he is on vacation. He may not work immediately prior to or immediately after the eight (8) hour period for which he is charging vacation. He will not be charged for any overtime hours offered on this day.
231 An employee who utilizes five (5) one day vacations during the same calendar week is eligible to be scheduled for and work overtime on Saturday and/or Sunday.

233 (a) Less than fifteen (15) minutes of any half-hour period shall not be charged.
234 (b) Fifteen (15) minutes up to and including the halfhour shall be considered as a half-hour and charged in accordance with the proper charging schedule.

236 New employees who are eligible for overtime, employees returning to the active payroll, or employees transferring to a new balancing group will receive the average number of hours of all employees in their balancing group for each separate balancing board. Each balancing board will have a separate calculation.
Section 7.	Daily Overtime Rules
237 Casual daily overtime will be posted daily before the expiration of the twenty-four (24) hour period following the start of the overtime.
238 Daily overtime shall be defined as any hours offered in excess of the employee’s regularly scheduled shift which are offered immediately before or immediately after the employee’s regularly scheduled shift.
239 Overtime hours immediately preceding or immediately following the regular shift will be considered overtime for that shift unless the overtime is more than four (4) hours in duration. Overtime in excess of four (4) hours in duration will be offered to the available low-houred, qualified employee regardless of shift.
240 Daily overtime hours within a balancing group, except for Skilled Trades classifications, will be considered to be in balance when they are within twenty-four (24) hours. In the Skilled Trades classifications, the craftsman working on a job will be permitted to complete the assignment when daily overtime is required and the changing of
64

Vacations will be scheduled by seniority in such a way as to minimize the impact on production requirements.
298 An employee who is entitled to, and has earned, two (2) or more weeks vacation may take all available vacation one day at a time. The employee must make his request for each day at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start of his shift unless it is for emergency purposes, in which case it may be requested one (1) hour prior to the start of the shift.

The maximum number of hours to be taken in half-day increments shall not exceed twenty-four (24) hours in the calendar year. The use of a half-day vacation does not affect the employee’s eligibility for scheduled overtime.
301 It will be the employee’s responsibility to determine his status regarding overtime, even though the employee is out on one or more day-at-a-time vacation at the time of the overtime posting. Rules regarding overtime refusal notification will also apply, notwithstanding employee’s absence while on one or more day-at-a-time vacation.
302 Vacation pay shall be in the amount of two percent (2%) of the employee’s earnings for the preceding calendar year divided by five (5), or eight (8) hours times the minimum rate specified in the Basic Labor Agreement (Article VII, Section 1). The employee will receive vacation pay with
76
ARTICLE VII, SECTION 3
his pay for the week in which the day was taken. Vacation day at a time cannot be deferred and, if not taken, will be paid at the end of the year.
303 Every effort consistent with production requirements will be made by the Company to schedule a vacation at a time suitable to the relative employee. Employees shall state their vacation preferences on the form provided prior to January 1. Management will develop a schedule in January honoring seniority. Employees may record their first choice on the preference form. If the original choice is not honored at the time the vacation schedule is determined, openings that develop during the vacation season will be filled by the recorded original preference by seniority. Open weeks after the schedule is determined will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis.
304 Vacations scheduled but canceled by management or canceled by the employee will be handled in accordance with paragraph 305 below. An employee canceling vacation must notify his supervision no later than the end of his last regularly scheduled shift prior to the scheduled vacation.
305 If the Company schedules a vacation for a particular employee and, because of production requirements, cannot permit the employee to take the vacation at the time scheduled, or if due to personal circumstances, the employee cancels the vacation, the Company and the employee will endeavor to set up another date for the vacation. If this cannot be done satisfactorily to the employee and the employee so desires, he may take his vacation pay in lieu of vacation at that time.

It was agreed during 2014 negotiations that the provisions of Paragraphs 50,79, 80,81, and 82 of the 1982 Agreement continue to be in effect until such time as all employees covered under those paragraphs are no longer employed by the Company. These paragraphs will not appear in the 1985 Agreement, the 1988 Agreement, the 1998 Agreement, the 2002 Agreement, the 2006 Agreement, the 2010 Agreement, or the 2014 Agreement.
The intent of this Agreement is to establish that employees who were promoted into a salary position prior to August 10,1985 did so with certain bargaining unit rights under the above paragraphs (50, 79, 80, 81, and 82 of the 1982 Agreement) and these bargaining unit rights shall be maintained.
Those employees promoted into a supervisory position after August 10,1985 and prior to June 1,2002 have one (1) year to determine whether or not to remain on supervision. They may accrue bargaining unit seniority during this period. Those employees promoted to a supervisory position after June 1,2002 may not accrue bargaining unit seniority during this period.
Employees going into other salary positions after August 10,1985 have no bargaining unit rights once they go on salary.

Reference: Incidental Work
It is recognized there is a certain amount of incidental work which affects all classifications. The parties agree that incidental work includes simple tasks that a worker is qualified to do in order to further the production process in an efficient manner. It would not be considered incidental work if the worker was asked to perform these tasks outside of the operation or process for which he/she was assigned.
This will include pick up of paperwork, templates, equipment and product to enable the operator to continue performing the job. In instances where there is shortage of paperwork or equipment necessary for performing the job, the operator may pick up the paperwork or equipment to enable the operator to continue performing the job. This would include, but not be limited to, situations where a template ran out of calibration during the course of a run. In such instance, the operator could take the template to get the calibration updated and then continue the run. Also included would be instances of the operator taking a part for inspection verification in order to continue the process. The operator will not be required to drive a tow motor or run paperwork.
Where the Union questions such work as being incidental, the Vice President Human Resources or his designated representative will meet with the Union’s Executive Bargaining Committee to discuss such work.

Skilled Trades
U.A.W. Local 856
As a result of discussions held during the 1998 contract negotiations and confirmed during the 2002 contract negotiations, it was agreed that maintenance craft employees in the performance of their daily assignments often perform what is considered incidental or overlapping work. All trades with an apprenticable background have work requirements and skill abilities that are relatively common. These common areas may be more prevalent in specific crafts whose classification write-up includes such work in detail. It is, however, well known that in practice all crafts are presently performing work that would be considered overlapping with other classifications. It is with this understanding that the following will be considered as normal maintenance craft operation:
1)	Craftsmen are expected to perform work outside their craft when such work is incidental to the primary tasks.
2)	Craftsmen may be assigned to assist other craftsmen where such performance is that of assistance and where such work would be considered as minimal skill or support. This would be necessary to balance workloads and would normally vary within short time periods.

The Company and the Union agree that for the facility to operate efficiently and economically, time must be utilized effectively.
In instances where a machine has been down for a period of time for any reason, a programmer or an NC technician may start the machine. This will be done only to reduce idle time waiting for machine warm-up. In this instance, the nonbargaining unit employee who starts the machine will not run any parts on the machine.
