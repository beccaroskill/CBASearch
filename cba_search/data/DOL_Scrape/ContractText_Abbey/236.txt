Section (42)	WORK STANDARDS
(a)	Establishing Work Standards
1.	When the Corporation establishes work standards, by whatever method it may select, it shall do
19
so on the basis of fairness and equity in that such standards shall be based on the reasonable working capacities of normal experienced employees working at a normal pace to produce quality work in the manner that the Company prescribes.
2.	When a work standard is established and is not disputed, or is disputed, and settled, such standard shall remain unchanged and not subject to dispute unless and until the operation is changed as a result of change in method, layout, tools, equipment, materials or product design. When a change is made in a work standard for any of the above reasons, only the elements of the operation that are affected by such change will be adjusted.
The Corporation agrees it is desirable to establish work standards on a new operation as early as is feasible. Where a standard is not established, the Chief Steward, upon request, will be given management’s reasons for not establishing the standard.
3.	When a work study is to be made for the purpose of establishing a standard, advance notice will be given to any employee to be studied and to his Steward. When a work standard is established, notice will be given to the employee and to his Steward advising them of the established work standard.
4.	Circumstances affecting the time of performance of a particular job that were not taken into account in establishing a work standard are known as non-standard conditions. When such non-standard conditions exist and are brought to the attention of management, the employee concerned shall be advised of the rate of production at which he will be required to perform his job under such non-standard conditions.
20
(b)	Relief Time and Other Allowances
1.	All employees on a regular 8-hour shift shall have a relief period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate twelve (12) minutes before lunch and twelve (12) minutes after lunch. Such relief periods represent 5% of the shift time or three (3) minutes per hour. The amount of such relief time shall be modified accordingly for a shift other than a regular 8-hour shift. This shall not be deemed to affect the environmental relief allowance now included in the work standard of certain operations.
Such relief time, except in emergencies, shall not be provided during the first hour of the shift or the first hour after the lunch period, or during such other periods, not exceeding in the aggregate two (2) hours per shift, as may be mutually satisfactory.
2.	When a time study is made, the employee’s performance will be rated as to normal. In addition to the regular relief allowance, allowances will be made for such elements as standard tool changes, material handling and fatigue where these are a factor.
(c)	Special Provisions Regarding Breakdowns, Product Mix and Controlling Operations
1.	An employee will not be required to make up a loss in production on his operation solely as a result of machine or equipment breakdown or shortage of stock or other conditions if the condition is beyond i the employee’s control., but the employee may be I	directed while the conditions exists, to perform other
l work or, if the condition exists during a period when he may be required to do so, to take his regular relief time.
21
2.	Work assignments on conveyor lines will be made in accordance with line speeds and available work space and the expected norma) ratio of product mix. When it is necessary to adjust the normal scheduled ratio of product mix on conveyor lines and more or less work is required because of such change, compensating adjustments in work assignments, manpower, spacing of units, line speed or any combination thereof will be made. If the time required to perform the elements of work assigned to an employee does not equal the available time of his work station, additional elements of work may be assigned to the employee, not to exceed the available time of his work station. If work assignments on such lines are changed, the Foreman will advise the employee what elements have been added to or removed from his operation.
3,	On some press, machine or conveyor lines the operations are limited by the controlling operation on the line with the result that on such lines either the time required to perform the elements of work assigned to an employee is less than his available time or the rate of production required of an employee is less than standard. In such circumstances the employee will be advised of the standard and available time for his operation whether or not he is required to produce to the standard. When the work standard on the controlling operation is adjusted, the other operations that were so limited will be adjusted accordingly within their standards.
(d)	Dispute Procedure
1.	If an employee or group of employees believes that a normal experienced employee working at a normal pace cannot perform the work required of
22
them in the time allowed, the employee, or a designated member of the group, may take the matter up with the Foreman, or ask the Foreman to send for their Steward. The Steward will then advise the Chief Steward or the individual designated by the Union. On request, the Foreman will obtain for the Chief Steward or designated representative in writing an elemental breakdown of the operation in question. Such elemental breakdown shall consist of all the elements of the operation in the order of their performance with the time of each element and the total । time for the operation as these appear on the study i or supporting data.
The best efforts of the employee, hrs Foreman and the Chief Steward or designated representative shall be directed toward settling the matter. A representative of the Industrial Engineering Department may be included in this effort to settle the dispute if it appears desirable to Corporate Management. Among other things, it should be determined that the employee’s work method, the job layout, the tools and equipment are those on which the standard is based. Machine cycle time, feedsand speeds, stock locations and line speed are among other items that should be checked to determine that these are as contemplated in the standard.
2,	(f, after the above procedure is followed, the matter is not resolved and a grievance is presented in writing, all of the data supporting the standard, upon request, shall be made available to the Union, If the grievance is not disposed of in the first step of the grievance procedure, the grievance shall be referred directly to the third step of the grievance procedure (Labor Relations).
3.	Should the grievance not be resolved in the third step of the grievance procedure (Labor Rela-
I
23
tions), the Union may request an Industrial Engineer from the Corporation and an Industrial Engineer from the International Union to give their technical assistance in resolving the grievance. In that event, the Industrial Engineer shall give his prompt attention to the matter.
In the presence of a local Union representative or representatives, they will compare their studies and computations to determine the area of difference, if any, in order to expedite the resolving of the grievance.
The Director-Personnel will arrange for the participation of the Union’s industrial Engineer.
4.	Should the grievance over the work standard not be resolved as a result of the foregoing, the Union will advise the Director-Personnel to that effect and a meeting will be arranged between Company and Union representatives to review the facts in an effort to resolve the grievance.

INTRODUCTION
The Dayton Thermal Products Plant (DTP) has developed into a position of leadership in the Heat Transfer industry. It is recognized as a successful “high-tech” company that is capable of producing a wide range of heat transfer products.
Through the years, DTP has developed organizational and management stability. It has established a management identity and stability considered to be fair, trusted, concerned and responsive to the needs of the organization.
Foreign competition has forced upon all industry a greater awareness of product quality and cost competitiveness. Our customers have established aggressive quality standards for its supply base, including DTP. We have, therefore, had to reassess and reevaluate our ability to produce consistently heat transfer products at our customers’ more stringent quality levels.
To meet customer requirements, a variety of programs and systems were initiated during recent years at DTP to enhance our quality effectiveness as a supplier, and to create positive changes of employee attitudes toward quality. These programs and systems (including among other things Statistical Process Control, Competitive Sourcing Teams and the BEST Agreement), have helped move DTP toward being more world class competitive.
To help ensure lower costs, higher quality and improve plant viability, Management and the Union agreed to establish a gainsharing system which will allow employees to participate in the ultimate success of DTP. The system is entitled Employee Sharing in Profits, Growth and Job Security through Gainsharing Plus Process (ESP).
105
The Management and Union of DTP are committed to the principle that ESP provides an involvement system that helps insure the long term success and growth of DTP. ESP requires a strong commitment on the part of every employee to make it work, and all employees must assume responsibilities if ESP is to be successful. We have the opportunity to influence the changes necessary for survival and growth at DTP, and to enhance our environment of trust, cooperation and recognition in an atmosphere of pride and friendship throughout the plant, the company and the community.
It is believed through the joint efforts of all employees, that we can be a more viable competitor in the global heat transfer industry.

UNIFORM ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
Mr. Wesley Wells, President
Local No. 775, International Union
oi Electronic, Electrical, Salaried,
Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO
150 Heid Avenue
Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
Excessive or unwarranted absence from work is recognized as a breach of an employee's responsibility to attend work regularly. Such excessive or unwarranted absenteeism results in unnecessary additional cost, adversely atlects the efficiency of plant operations and product quality, and places unfair safety and work related burdens on those employees who are regular in their attendance.
This understanding establishes a system to uniformly deal with employee absenteeism and, also, a disincentive system affecting the benefits of those persons that continue to have unacceptable attendance records. Both systems are intended to control those casual absences and sick leaves that are not the result of a serious and/or major injury or Illness.
I. UNIFORM ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
The parties agree to the need for a uniform, joint approach to deal with employees who breach their responsibilities to attend work regularly and acknowledge the necessity for continual improvement in attendance to enhance Job security and increase the Plant's competitiveness.
The Uniform Attendance System set forth below wii be effective January 1, 1996, in those instances when employees have been absent six (6) scheduled working days, whether separate or, consecutive, within a period of one (1) year, except the following casual absences will not be counted:
146
(0 absences excused in advance and paid eight (8) hours under the provisions of the Paid Absence Allowance program,
(11)	absences of less than five (5) working days due to nonjob related illness or injury provided the employee receives Sickness and Accident insurance Benefits,
(Mi) absences because the employee is sent home pending job placement by the Employment Department in accordance with a temporary work restriction imposed by the plant medical department,
(lv) absences due to plant related illness or injury which the employee:
(a)	promptly reports to his supervisor or Work Team Coordinator, and
(b)	promptly reports in person to the medical department and the tost time is accepted by the Workers' Compensation Department as compensable, and
(c)	in those cases where the lost time Is not accepted as compensable and provided the employee has filed a claim with the State of Ohio Bureau of Workers'Compensation, discipline will be delayed for a reasonable period of time but no later than a final decision from the State of Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation Department,
(v)	absences paid in accordance with Section (67) Funeral Absence, (66) Jury Duty, (63) Short-Term Military Duty and a leave of absence for illness or injury during which S&A Benefits are paid,
(vi)	absences because of one or more fuff or partial weeks of vacation,
(vii)	absences because subpoenaed as a witness by a State, Federal, or Municipal court or by a Governmental Agency or Legislative body with subpoena power,
147
(viii)	absences because of disciplinary time off,
(ix)	absences for Union business provided a request for each period of casual absence or absences for Local Union activities is made in writing and, where possible, in ad* vance of the absence by the Local Union President to the Labor Relations Supervisor,
(x)	absences due to severe weather conditions and paid Short Work Week Benefits under act of God pursuant to Letter (10) of the SUB Agreement,
(xi)	absences granted In accordance with Section (62) Granting Leaves of Absence.
(xlt) absences covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA),
(xili) absences because of being sent home early that are factory responsible,
it the Union promptly brings to the attention of the Supervisor, Area Manager and Labor Relations Supervisor a case involving exceptionally tragic circumstances resulting in an absence that would place an employee in the Discipline Procedure of the Uniform Attendance System, the Labor Relation Supervisor may remove the absence from the count of absences.
Disputes under this procedure, including whether an absence should be counted or not continue to be subject to the grievance procedure. In addition, the parties may issue guidelines to assist in determining the kinds of unique absences which may or may not be counted.
So as to make clear the consequences associated with absenteeism, the following schedule is hereby set forth.
7th Absence - Recorded verbal warning issued by a representative of Management and counseling by the appropriate Union Steward and Management Supervisor.
After the notice of absence has been issued by the rep
148
resentative of Management, an “absence" is defined as any scheduled work day, or series of consecutive work days, during which an employee is absent from work, regardless of the reason, except as outlined above.
Sth Absence - Supervisor's Report Issued by the representative of Management and counseling by the Steward and the Area Manager or their designated representative(s). The Supervisor's Report shall advise the employee that the next absence will result in a one (1) day disciplinary layoff being assessed.
9th Absence - Supervisor's Report and one (1) day disciplinary layoff assessed. The disciplinary time off shall be served and the Supervisor’s Report shall advise the employee that the next absence will result in a three (3) day disciplinary layoff. Upon returning to work, the employee will be counseled by the Steward and the Labor Relations Supervisor or his/her designated representative.
10th Absence - Supervisor’s Report and three (3> day disciplinary layoff assessed. The disciplinary time off Shall be served and the Supervisor's Report shall advise the employee that the next absence will result in a five <5) day disciplinary layoff. Upon returning to work, the employee will be counseled by the Steward and the Labor Relations Supervisor or his/her designated representative.
11th Absence - Supervisor’s Report and five (5) day disciplinary layoff assessed. The disciplinary time off shall be served and the Supervisor's Report shall advise the employee that the next absence will result in discharge. Upon returning to work, the employee will be counseled by the Steward and the Labor Relations Supervisor or his/ her designated representative.
12th Absence ~ Discharge
Employees who have casual absences from work for Illness or personal business will not be required to substantiate or verify the reason or cause for their absence. However employees must continue to notify the plant regarding absences. Employees must call in their ab
149
sences to Plant Proteclion or Personnel and obtain a call' in number verifying that the absence was properly reported. Accordingly, it is the employee's responsibility to maintain a record of call-in numbers for the purpose of substantiating the above cited required call-in. When employees are absent for five (5) working days or less and not on an approved medical leave of absence, such employees are required to properly call in each day.
To encourage good attendance, an employee who is in the above procedure but has not been absent after the 7th or Sth absence for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days, excluding days the employee is not on the active roll. Is to repeat the prior step of lhe Procedure tn the event of the employee's next absence. An employee who Is in the procedure but has not been absent after the 9th through 12th absence for twelve (12) consecutive months, excluding those periods when the employee is not on the active roll, will begin with the Notice of Absence for the 7th absence In the event of the employee's next absence. An employee who is In the procedure but has not been absent after the 7th through 12th absence for twenty four (24) consecutive months, excluding days the employee Is not on the active roll, will be removed from the procedure and any subsequent absences will be subject to the provisions of the Uniform Attendance System.
II.	UNIFORM BENEFIT REDUCTION PROGRAM
Another segment of the DTPD absenteeism problem needing a solution involves sick leaves that are not for major injury or illness, which, for the purpose of this document, shall be called "Minor Sick Leaves". Since benefits are generated, earned and funded by regular attendance, an employee's regular attendance should be a major factor in determining his/her benefits. It is the intent of this program to address only those employees with unacceptable attendance records. The program is not directed at persons who experience legitimate serious, major Injuries or illnesses. Employees who experiences casual absences and/or “minor sick leaves" totalling 15% or more available hours during a twelve (12) month assessment period will
150
have their entitlement to the hereinafter listed benefits under the Agreement decreased during the next following deduction cycle by the same percentage. The benefits that will be affected by the percentage decrease are as follows:
•	Holiday Pay
•	Vacation Pay
•	P.A.A.
•	Sickness and Accident Benefits
Jf during a twelve (12) month assessment period as hereinafter defined, for example, an employee who has 15% tost time due to casual absences and/or “Minor Sick Leaves’ of the type Identified in Exhibit I. appended to this letter, then his/her entitlement to the atorelisied benefits shall decrease by 15% for twelve (12) months. If an employee Is on sick leave for an illness or Injury not included on the list, assistance from the Medical Department will be sought by Labor Relations before making a determination. Benefit reductions for amounts of lost time greater than 15% shall be according to the hereinafter provided table.
For the purposes of applying the purification guidelines, time tost from work which is due to an occupational injury/ illness and for which either the Corporation voluntarily assumes liability or there is an unappealed decision adverse to the Corporation under any workers' compensation law or act will be considered excludable without regard to diagnosis. Benefits reduction may be suspended temporarily by the Corporation pending a final disposition of a workers’ compensation claim with the understanding any temporarily avoided benefit reduction will be recovered.
Any benefits reduction will be based upon the following table: Based upon 1984 Hours (Worked in a Twelve (12) Month Period)
151
ercentage	Hours Absent
15%	297,6 - 317.3

Alcohol & Drug Program
Mr. Wesley Wells, President
Local No. 775, International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO 150 Held Avenue Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
tn the negotiations leading to the new collective bargaining agreement, it was evident that we share a deep concern about the alcohol and drug problems that exist throughout our society and are reflected in varying degrees in the employee work forces in our plants.
We are both concerned with the destructive effects of alcohol and drug addiction, and recognize that such addiction also may impair the ability of the individual to perform an efficient and meaningful role in his family, in industry, and in society as a whole. We share the common conviction that It Is more important to provide assistance to such afflicted individuals to motivate them to help themselves overcome their problems, rather than to rely solely on discipline.
The plant for several years has had a joint program responsive to the needs of the alcohol and drug addiction problem which may exist in the plant
Said program incorporates a plant counseling approach with respect to employees with drug or alcohol addiction problems, to assure that genuine and sympathetic concern is demonstrated for persons so afflicted, and to explore the feasibility of arranging for consultations with competent medical professionals on these matters and to develop programs of deteclion, counseling and referral as are desirable to attain the most effective efforts in this area.
Notwithstanding the provisions contained in Appendix I of the Insurance Program, the parties have agreed that after the first treatment period for an employee by an approved substanceabuse provider participating in the mental heafth/substance abuse managed-care, preferred-provider program, only one additional treatment period will be covered under medical and/or psychiatric and sickness and accident coverage but only at the fifty (50) percent level. Any additional episode shall be without insurance coverages otherwise available under the Labor Agreement.
163
Guidance and assistance will be provided to the Management and the Union Shop Committee through discussions between us at the International level as needed.

,	Alcohol & Drug Assistance
Mr. Wesley Wells, president
Local No, 775, International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CiO 150 Held Avenue	'
Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
During negotiations the parties reaffirmed their continuing conviction that it is important to provide assistance to employees afflicted with alcohol and drug dependence and to find ways to motivate them to recognize their problem and seek treatment where appropriate. Accordingly, the parties have expressed their mutual wish to continue their progress toward the common goal of achieving an effective plant alcohol and drug abuse program.
While the previous Corporation-tUE program improved on past programs, the results varied widely. The most successful program is one that enjoys the tutl support of Management and the Union. This type of support has ted to different approaches to various problems. For example, the proximity or availability of approved treatment facilities, the suitability of places utilized tor employee contact, and the prior existence of a union or government-sponsored program are alt factors bearing on die success of the plant's alcohol and drug abuse program.
We will continue to develop methods that Will more effectively encourage afflicted employees to seek assistance under the program and that will convince them of the privacy and confidentiality of such assistance. To this end, Management and the Union Shop Committee, pursuant to the principles and guidelines previously established, will (i) analyze those causes that inhibit and those that tester employee utilization of the program, (ii) establish procedures for the confidential maintenance of records of employees using the program, and (iii) communicate when appropriate, those techniques that have proved successful at other Corporation plants. The parties will also continue to periodically review the program to assist Management and the Union.
Our experience under this program thus far shows that an effective program requires the full cooperation ot Management and Union alike. The joint efforts necessary to provide assis-ance to afflicted employees may, however, be complicated by nany factors such as multi-shift operations, plant population, indant facility available for employee contact, plant layout, and
165
the need tor privacy. We mutually endorse reasonable and practical resolution to these problems where they exist.
Finally, the success that already has been achieved under the program indicates the commitment that both the Corporation and the IUE have toward helping employees with problems of alcohol and drug dependence. We wifi continue to monitor, review and assist with program activities to assure the continued success and improvement of this Corporation-fUE program.

Equal Application

Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:	■
For many years the Corporation and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, status as a qualified person with a disability or membership in any other legally protected class, and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated in their Agreement an “Equal Application" provision that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at Chrysler and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violations of that principle.
The parties now recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (i) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive contractual method for the prompt resolution of all claims of denial of equal application rights, (ii) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, and (Hi) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal, provincial and state civil rights agencies for the following purposes: (a) to increase understanding, (b) to promote and encourage the use of the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure In order to avoid mutiplicity of litigation in many forums simultaneously which are frequently time consuming, contradictory and hence, non-productive to relieving employee problems, (c) to seek solutions to mutual problems, (d) to relieve tensions in this area, and (e) to exchange Information, expertise and advice.
At the Dayton Thermal Products Division an Equal Application Committee shall be established consisting of up to three (3) representatives of the Local Union and three (3) representatives of Plant Management. The representatives of the Local Union
179
shall be limited to the Local Union President or an Officer of the Local Union on a full time Leave of Absence for Union Business, the Chairman of the Plant Shop Committee, and the Chairman of The Fair Employment Practices Committee of the Local Union or a designated representative. The representatives of Management shall be the Plant Manager, or her designated representative, and two (2) Plant Management Representatives at least one of whom is active In the Corporation's Equal Employment Opportunity Program. Local Plant Equal Application Committees will meet at a mutually agreeable time on a quarterly basis. Such Union Representatives if not on a full time Leave of Absence for Union Business, and if working in the plant, shall receive pay from the Corporation at their regular hourly rate tor time spent in such meetings or when jointly investigating and/or studying a complaint with a management member of the Local Plant Equal Application Committee, that they would otherwise have worked in the plant. Local Plant Equal Application Committee shall have the following duties:
a.	Discuss ways and means of promoting use of the grievance procedure as the exclusive contractual method for resolving claims of denial of equal application rights.
b.	Discuss guidelines for Union and Company representatives active in the grievance procedure in the proper and prompt handling of grievances alleging such claims,
c.	Conduct or arrange for investigations and/or studies into the causes of equal employment opportunity and dlscrimiantion problems and tensions in an attempt to prevent such problems from arising or recurring.
d.	Exchange possible means for determining the cause of equal employment opportunity and discrimination problems and tensions tn the plant.
The parties continue to recognize their legal and moral responsibility for assuring that all Chrysler employees have equal employment opportunities and freedom from discrimination as set forth in Section (6) of the Production and Maintenance Agreement. Consequently the function of the Equal Application Committee shall be, consultative and cooperative. The Committee
180
may not commit either party to a specific course of action. However, the Union agrees that it will discourage Its members from by-passing the grievance and arbitration procedure with respect to any claim or complaint against the Corporation which may be made the subject of a grievance under the contract.

Local No- 775, Internationa) Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO 150 Held Avenue
Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir;
In response to your demand made during the current negotiations, we have agreed that during discussions as early as Step 3 of the grievance procedure of grievances over discipline, discharge and other terminations from employment, each party will present a statement of position reciting facts then known on which it relies, and a copy ot a document or statement on which the party relies to support its position.
In the case of a document covering, or statement by, an employee who is not the grievant, the party relying on it may excise, block out, or otherwise remove, information on it that is not relevant or that would disclose the identity ot the person who made the statement or concerning whom the document refers.
In cases where a prior disciplinary record is involved, the Corporation may present a written summary of the grievant’s disciplinary record.
The statement erf position and other statementsand documents that a party has provided the other shall become part of the grievance file and may be referred to in subsequent steps of the grievance procedure, including the Appeal Board.
The failure or refusal of the Union to present a full verbal explanation of its position shall relieve the Corporation from presenting any statement or document on which it relies. The failure or refusal of a party to make available to the other a copy of a document or statement which it has in its possession and on which the party relies shall preclude the party from using It before the Appeal Soard.
The Corporation expressed its concern that its providing to Local Union representatives involved in processing grievances copies ot employee statements and Corporate documents relating to employees may lead to abuses unless the statements and documents (i) are used solely in connection with the proper processing of a grievance, (ii) are otherwise kept confidential, and (iii) are not in any way used by any member of the bargain-

(18) Competitive Approaches
Mr Wesley Wells, President
Local No, 775, International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO 150 Held Avenue
Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir;
The Corporation and the Union recognize that quality and operating efficiency are inextricably wed to job security, and that a high level of quality and operating efficiency requires mutual respect and recognition of each other's problems and concerns. Fact-finding missions and meetings leading to the current agreement reinforced the parties conviction that a new cooperative approach is essential. Accordingly, a committee comprised of four persons, two each from Management and the Union, including the Plant Manager and the Local Union President, will focus on cooperative efforts toward our common goal to improve the effectiveness of operations and remove barriers to improvements, increase job opportunities and fully utilize the workforce. The local committee will develop a plan through an exhaustive analysis of the location’s operational efficiency.
Within six months of the effective date of the Agreement, and at least annually thereafter during the term of the Agreement, the Committee will review with Chrysler management the overall competitiveness of the location’s products and their plans, indicating actions, and/or changes needed to improve quality and efficiency at the Dayton Thermal Products and to stimulate job security of the existing work force and attract new work.
In these efforts, it is recognized that a great deal of initiative and imagination will be required by the parties. While not Intended to limit such innovation, the following are examples of appropriate areas the parties may address;
1)	identification of investments in the facility or equipment necessary to improve product quality or operational effectiveness;
2)	the broadening of the existing team-concept programs;
3)	the identification of non-labor cost savings and efficiencies;
4)	procedures and plans to review past sourcing and contracting decisions, and to identify opportunities for attracting new business;
187
5)	the examination of new forms of work organization, such as job assignments relating io jusi-in-timo or other quality enhancement systems;
6} procedures to review supervisory staffing and support for the initiatives in this letter;	'
7)	initiatives that will result "in a fair day's work for a fair day’s pay";
8} initiatives to reduce chronic absenteeism; and
9) procedures for improved access by the bargaining committee to product plans and other information affecting employment security and operational effectiveness, assuring confidential treatment of such information.
Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness may require change or waiver of certain agreements or practices. It is understood that any such waivers, modifications or changes shall be agreed to in writing by the Corporation and the Union, but shall not require further ratification.

Plant Closing Moratorium
Mr. Wesley Wells, President
Local No. 775. International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture workers, AFL-CIO	,
150 Heid Avenue
Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
Much time was spent during negotiations leading to the 1995 Agreement discussing the future viability of the Dayton Thermal Products Plant with the Union urging the Company to commit to a plant closing moratorium.
The Company advised the Union that It Is not its current Intention to close the Dayton Thermal Products Plant.
The Company reaffirmed its position articulated in previous negotiations that because the plant produces what commonly are referred to as commodity components — products that are not generally unique and produced elsewhere by other competing manufacturers on a competitive basis — management cannot commit to an unqualified plant closing moratorium.
There was recognition by the parties that given global economic and competitive pressures, the plant must remain competitive in the world marketplace in terms of such measurable things as quality, cost, productivity, technology, process control, innovation and continuous improvement if it is to remain open.
The parties acknowledged that the long-term viability ot the plant can only be attained and continued through diligent efforts by both Management and the Union to identify methodologies that will improve the plant’s quality, productive and financial competitiveness. It is also understood that conditions may arise that are beyond the control of the Corporation, e.g„ acts of God, catastrophic circumstances, or significant economic decline(s). Should any of the aforementioned or other untoward conditions occur, the Corporation reserves the right to close the Dayton Thermal Products Plant after discussion with the Union.

(d)	Making reports to the Corporation and the Union on the results of its activities.

In order to reduce tu a minimum any misunderstandings in this regard in the future, all alleged departures from this policy shall be immediately taken up in the following manner:

Mr. Wesley Wells, President
Local No, 775, International Union of Electronic, 'Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO
« 150 Heid Avenue
Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sic
During the negotiations leading to the Production and Maintenance Agreement today, the Union raised its serious concerns over outside contracting ot skilled trades work and the use of outside contractors to perform maintenance and construction work. The Corporation raised its equally serious concern with certain restrictive work practices.
The Union expressed an interest in establishing procedures Io assure maximum utilization of the Corporation’s manpower, machinery and facilities.
The Corporation expressed an interest In correcting certain work assignment practices which limit the efficient performance of some skilled trades work in the Corporation’s Dayton Plant,
Therefore, in the interest of resolving these inseparable mutual concerns, the parties have discussed various aspects of the problem and reached the following understanding.
Contract! ng-Maintena nee
It is understood that employees of an outside contractor will not be utilized Io replace seniority employees on production assembly or manufacturing work or maintenance work or fabrication of tools, dies, jigs and fixtures, normally and historically performed by them when performance of such work involves the use of Corporation-owned machines, tools or equipment maintained by employees.
The foregoing shall not affect the right of the Corporation to continue arrangements currently in effect nor shall it limit the fulfillment of warranty obligations by vendors nor limit work which a vendor must perform to prove out equipment.
In all cases, except where time and circumstances prevent it, the Plant Management will hold advance discussions with Union Representatives prior to letting such a contract. In this discussion management is expected to review its plans or prospects for letting a particular contract. The Union should be advised ot the nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be
233
performed and the reasons (equipment, manpower, etc.) why management is contemplating contracting out the work. At such times Corporation representatives are expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on the Corporation’s plans and to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances.	.
In no event shall any seniority employee who customarily performs the work In question be laid off as a direct and immediate result of work being performed by an outside contractor on the plant premises.
Written grievances Involving interpretation or application of the foregoing provisions may be presented directly to Step 3 of the grievance procedure.
Equipment Rental
The Corporation further stated that when the lack of equipment is the only factor upon which the decision turns to let work to an outside contractor, the Corporation will first give proper consideration to renting or leasing such needed equipment provided it is readily available at a cost which, when added toother factors, does not exceed the cost of having the work performed by an outside contractor.
Warranty and Service Agreement
On the matters of warranty and service agreements, the Corporation cannot agree to any limitation or restriction on Its right to enter into such agreements. However, in making decisions as to the need and duration of such agreements, the Corporation will give proper consideration to the operating needs of the business, the efficiencies and economics involved and all other relevant considerations, including the effect of the decisions on its skilled trades maintenance employees. Upon expiration of a warranty agreement, management will consider assigning such repair work to the plant skilled trades employees. In cases where management is contemplating placement of a service contract, the notice and discussion provisions usually applicable to Outside Contracting shall be utilized.
Contracting - Tool and Die
in our negotiations leading to the Agreement dated today, discussed in greatdetailtool and die contracting by the plant. As we have pointed out to you, there are many and varied factors that may influence any particular decision to make or buy. We do not believe it is feasible to list general criteria. However, the Union has stated in our discussions that it recognizesa number of them, such as the need, among other things, to contract work that requires specialized tools and equipment and special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model changes and rearrangement deadlines, in view of the foregoing, we have
234
advised you that the plant cannot agree to any limitation or restriction on its right and responsibility to decide whether io make tools, dies, models, jigs or fixtures or to buy them. We assure you, however, that when journeymen skilled trades employees in the toolmaking trades of the plant are on layoff for any reason or become laid off as a result of the plant’s contracting out work involving the labrication, maintenance or repair of tools and dies, and ot the kind normally performed by such skilled trades employees in the plant, the Skilled Trades Representative of the plant, on request, will meet with the Skilled Trades Representative of the Union to discuss, and provide information relative to, plans the plant is formulating and decisions II is contemplating concerning such contracting. A good faith effort wilt be extended by the parties to find solution to the problems discussed in these meetings.
Work Assignment Practices
The International Union, IUE, recognizes that certain work assignment practices exist which limit the efficient performance of some skilled tradesmen and that such inefficient practices must be corrected. The International Union will assist Local 775 IUE-AFL-CIO and Plant Management to achieve this objective.
The skilled trades committeeman and the area manager shall endeavor to correct these inefficient work assignment practices in a cooperative and non-adversarial manner. If, however, agreement cannot be reached, the matter may be referred to the Skilled Trades Representatives of the International Union and of the Corporate Union Relations Staff, who shall jointly review the matter and assist in resolution of the issues in dispute.
In those cases where corrections are made, the Corporation will retain existing work or, where appropriate, return to the bargaining unit work which had previously been contracted out. Further, improvements in plant operations that may result from more efficient work assignments will not result in the indefinite layoff of affected Journeymen who the parties agree may, in such circumstances, be used on other work. It is understood this application shall not adversely affect the seniority provisions pertaining to skilled trades employees. However, factors such as schedule or volume changes, technological improvements and other changes not related to more efficient work assignments, may continue to result in reductions or increases in the number of employees required.

(57) Employee Assistance Program
Mr, Wesley Wells, President Local No. 775, International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO 150 Heid Avenue Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
Chrysler Corporation and IUE Local 775 continue to recognize that alcoholism and drug dependency are health problems which may be successfully treated, given early identification and appropriate rehabilitation therapy. Furthermore, as with alcoholism and drug dependency, emotional disorders and serious personal problems can adversely affect job performance.
It is in the Corporation's and Union’s mutual Interest to provide a framework within which lUE-represented Chrysler employees voluntarily and confidentially may seek professional counseling, treatment, or their assistance to address such problems. Similarly it is in the parties' interests to generally encourage, educate and otherwise help employees pursue more healthful life styles. Working together the Union and the Corporation can achieve common goals In those areas. In this regard, the parties accordingly have established a new joint Employee Assistance Program.
The new Program provides for: (1) early identification and voluntary assessment of seniority employees having alcoholism or other drug dependency problems as well as emotional disorders or serious personal problems; (2) referral of such employees for professional diagnostic evaluation, counseling or treatment; and (3) appropriate follow-up on their counseling or rehabilitation progress. While the Program's primary purpose is to assist employees having such problems and help Union and Management Representatives deal effectively with such situations, it also allows employees to obtain information about available counseling or treatment referral services for immediate family members having such problems.
Employees with alcoholism, drug dependency, emotional or personal problems will be able to seek help voluntarily without having to be concerned that their employment status will be affected because they have sought help for such problems. Such employees, however, would continue to be subject to the same
239
standards of performance and conduct expected of any other employee, irrespective of participation in the Employee Assistance Program, Employees requiring a leave of absence for the treatment of health problems will be issued such leave In accordance with the provision of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Insurance benefits, if any, for the treatment and the absence will be determined in accordance with the Agreement.
Proposals and requests for funding concerning delivery of local programs and related services under the Program will be reviewed and subject to approval by the Employee Training and Development Committee. In reviewing such proposals, consideration will be given to the availability of funds and proposal consistency with the Program’s objectives.
A joint local Employee Assistance Program committee will be established. This committee will be comprised of the Plant Manager or a designated representative of department manager level and the Union President or a designated representative who must be a member of the Union Bargaining Committee. The function ol this committee is to coordinate Program activities, consistent with the provisions of this letter.
It is understood that nothing contained herein or in the existing of future statements concerning the Employee Assistance Program or steps taken to implement its programs and related services shall be construed or interpreted as constituting a waiver of either the Corporation’s or the Union’s right or responsibilities under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, nor is the Program intended in any wav to create for any employee any enforceable obligation against the Corporation, the Union, or their representatives.
In addition it is the parties’ intent that any programs, approaches or related services to be provided under the Employee Assistance Program are not to be construed as benefits or insurance programs.
Finally, the Grievance Procedure set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement shall have no application to, or Jurisdiction over, any matters related to the Program.

Dear Sir:	■
During the negotiations leading to the current agreement the parties discussed the concept of “a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay* and its relationship to work standards.
Notwithstanding Section (42) of the current agreement, in the event that the parties identify problem operations which inhibit the plant’s ability to remain competitive, existing work standards may be revised and implemented on the basis of fairness and equity to increase the productive use of available time for producing quality parts and, where applicable, to give recognition to process and machinery changes.
When a standard is revised in accordance with Ihis Understanding, it shall remain unchanged unless and until the operation is altered as a result of changes in method, layout, tools, equipment, materials or product design. Any deviation from this paragraph shall be implemented only with the concurrence of the Union Time Study Representative.
Consistent with the parties mutual intent to be competitive, all employees will devote maximum effort to the improvement and development of production processes that enhance the competitive position of the Dayton Thermal Products Plant.

(62) Efficient Work Practices
Mr. Wesley Weils, President
Local No. 775, international Union of Electronic. Electrical Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, AFL-CIO 150 Heid Avenue
Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
The Corporation and the Union agree to direct their best efforts toward the full utilization of employees. The parties recognize that full utilization requires that each employee exert a normal work effort that is fair to both the employee and the employer. Furthermore, such work effort must be in accordance with efficient work practices. To this end the parties affirm their commitment to observing efficient work practices in keeping with the principles stated in the current P & M Agreement.
tn order to clarify what constitutes efficient work practices, the parties recognize that many tasks are properly performed within the scope of two or more classifications, in other instances under the following circumstances, employees, in order to complete a principal assignment, may properly perform complementary or incidental tasks or series of such tasks that if performed separately may be regularly assigned to a particular classification:
(1)	the time required in relation to the principal job is fairiy short. A minor lask or a series of minor tasks performed over the duration of the principal Job also constitutes incidental work even though the cumulative time is fairly long.
(2)	The employee has the capability, e.g., the ability to weld;
(3)	and the work can be performed safely.
The following is an example of efficient work practices:
A Millwright 1$ assigned to replace a coupling on a conveyor. The job requires pulling back a motor, removing the brake and uncoupling an air line to gain access to the coupling. It would be expected that the Millwright perform each of these incidental tasks without relying on another Trade or Trades.
A Jobsetter is assigned to clean and calibrate burner nozzles. The job requires the removal and reinstallation of nozzles to be
247
cleaned and calibrated. It would be expected that the Jobsetter perform these incidental tasks without relying on another classification.
The parties agree that the objective ot efficient work practices is getting the job at hand completed as quickly as possible. Everyone should work as a team member for the common welfare oi all.
Disputes arising from the above understanding may be referred to the Chairman of the Shop Committee and the Labor Relations Supervisor pursuant to the work assignment practices and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.

Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
During these negotiations the Union expressed its deep concern over outside contracting matters which are addressed in Letter 53, “Skilled Trades". In particular, the Union cited failure to follow the advance notice and discussion provisions for said letter.
In response to the Union's concern, the Corporation informed the Union a communicalion would be sent to Manufacturing Engineering, Procurement and Supply, and related Management personnel following negotiations which would read as follows: “During the current agreement we have experienced many problems in handling contracting matters.’
“In many Instances the root cause of the problem is lack of communication. The P & M Agreement currently requires timely meetings in advance of the decision to contract work normally and historically performed by Dayton Thermal Products Plant skilled trades employees.'
“We are Informed that meetings with Local Union Representatives relative to contracting are often held after the contract has been let and insufficient useful information is provided to the Union for them to consider and make appropriate comments relative to Management’s plans.’
“The Corporation intends to achieve world-wide competitive status utilizing not only the skills of our employees, but also the suggestions and ideas of the people and the Union as to how work can best be accomplished at the lowest possible cost with the highest possible qualify and on time."
“This approach to managing the business should be utilized at all levels: production, skilled and technical. Obviously such discussions should be held In a timely manner with appropriate Management and Union personnel."
"Accordingly, please assure that adequate information about each contract for the performance of skilled trades work covered by
249
I he contracting provisions of the Agreement is supplied the Personnel Department in a timely manner. Approval by a Personnel Department Representative, prior to the contract being let to an outside firm, but after determination that discussions have been satisfactorily completed, shall be required.”
‘There are numerous examples where complete, advance communications with the Union and the skilled trades employees has resulted in important projects being completed on a competitive basis in terms of quality, cost and timeliness. The result has been a feeling of pride of accomplishment shared by the Union, employees and the managers."
"Relationships can only be improved by open, frank communications in all areas, particularly in carrying out our contracting responsibilities."

150 Heid Avenue
Dayton, OH 45404
Dear Sir:	.
During negotiations leading to the 1995 Agreement there was much discussion regarding the role that skilled trades employees can play tn the attainment of plant competitiveness.
In negotiations leading to previous agreements. Management advised the Union that real plant competitiveness would not be possible unless skilled trades employees participated In and endorsed such things as continuous improvement, the elimination of lines of demarcation and the performance oi incidental work. -
In our most recent negotiations the Management cited examples of skilled trades practices that are counterproductive to plant competitiveness that must be addressed and, in some cases, eliminated.
Accordingly, a joint committee comprised of three representatives of both the Management and the Union will meet during the 60 days following Notice of Ratification with the intention of identifying skilled trades-related practices and contractual language that must be eliminated, changed or deleted if the plan! is to become competitive.
The parties agreed that Letter No. 16 shall be utilized to effectuate any changes.

Dayton. Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
This is to confirm the discussions of the parties relative to product and employment opportunities that may materialize during the term ot the Agreement and in years that follow because of, among other things, Dayton Thermal Products (DTP) joining forces with other firms having technical expertise needed by DTP
You will recall that during our meetings it was repeatedly asserted that DTP is a supplier plant that must compete against other U.S. and international plants in terms of quality, cost, productivity and technology and no management representative could provide the Union with definitive, long-term product commitments or guarantees. Further, you were advised that the potential product opportunities had various probabilities of attainment ranging from low to high but would be pursued with vigor. H was also explained that one of the companies we will become partners with to gain needed engineering expertise required as part of a partnership that we commit to the manufacture of a portion of heater cores and unit assemblies for some vehicles to be produced after 1992 in their facilities.
You advised us that although you hoped employment levels would not suffer, especially if some opportunities could be converted to jobs, that the Local Union is willing to share in the risks necessary to hopefully Improve employment security.
You said it was clear to you and most members of the Local Union that without the technical involvement of a partner or partners, DTP has little chance of survival in the future.
We have reviewed and provided you with a copy of the listing of potential product opportunities. The listing suggests that, although there may be some variations in employment levels during the term of the Agreement, if DTP Is the successful bidder on most of the opportunities we have identified, there may be little or no effect on employment levels and the possibility does exist to have employment levels at a point in the future higher than
261
those at the current lime.
Management also said that the reviewed product opportunities did not include “aftermarket" considerations which could have an even more positive effect on employment levels in future years.

Dayton, Ohio 45404
Dear Sir:
During discussions leading to the 1995 Agreement, the par-	ties devoted much time to discussions ot those things necessary
- to compete successfully in today's global market. One conciu-;	sion was that job security will be difficult to attain and sustain
.	unless a program based upon “shared destiny" continues,
' The parties discovered during our analysis of competitive data । that there is reason to believe that the productivity and quality 1 levels of our competitors appear to be greater than those at [ Dayton Thermal Products, (DTP). Additionally, the average total i wage and benefit levels of our competitors are generally lower than those In effect at our facility. The just described data suggests that a “shared destiny" strategy is necessary If the facility is to be competitive.
Parts of the “shared destiny’ strategy are found throughout the new agreement. The parties concluded that greater flexibility is essential. The parties agreed that fewer classifications with work assignments being redesigned and employees given additional training so they can perform more varied assignments or I jobs at higher skill levels Is necessary. The parties agreed that । past practices which adversely affect quality and/or productivity ।	should be modified. The things the parties agreed to do are an
।	extension of the competitive teams that are already in place and
। working well.
After talking with and reviewing the work of several consultants and comparisons of our competition's wage rates and benefits. the parties agreed that the traditional forms of employee compensation should be replaced with one providing tor contingentcompensation since traditional pay methods only add to the cost of labor while at the same time doing nothing to improve such Chings as productivity, quality, machine utilization and “up time", reducing scrap, inventory and material costs. The parties agreed that al) plant employees should share in payouts that result from our joint determination...out “shared destiny*. The
263
parties agreed to continue what will henceforth be called the Employees Sharing in Profits, Growth and Job Security through Gainsharing Programs (ESP),
The parties agreed that it would not be in the best interest of the Dayton facility or its employees to continue a gainsharing program only because it was successful at some other location under different circumstances. Instead it was agreed to form a committee comprised of persons from not only Local No, 775, IUE, but also Local No. 758, IUE, and the professional and administrative roll to work on the mechanics of ESP so that the contingent compensation program could be effective for any included gains after the effective date of this Agreement. It was agreed that the planning group/review board should include persons from all employment groups since it would be supportive of our “shared destiny" philosophy and the inclusion of all [ persons would do much to encourage commitment to the intent . of the program. The parties agreed that the membership of the planning group/review board will be equally divided between represented and non-represented employees and will include the Plant Manager, Personnel Manager, Labor Relations Supervisor, the President, Vice President, Chief Steward and Gainsharing Coordinator of Local Union No. 775, IUE, plus five others, including the President and Vice President of Local No. 758, tUE, two persons appointed from the plant professional and administrative employees and one person appointed from the plant management group. The parties agreed that the planning group/ review board may utilize the services of a recognized gainsharing consultant, if necessary, with funds for such consultant and the later employee information program or other such required services to be paid from the joint training funds. Also, the planning group/review board may employ the services of a mutually agreed upon auditing firm on a yearly basis to assist It in the determination of the program payout with charges for such auditor and/ or any other administrative expenses being a proper charge(s) against the gainsharing fund.
The parties agreed that the planning group/review board, working with a charter that if DTP is to be a viable facility it must become and remain competitive in terms of such things as productivity, quality, and costs, will formulate a program that will include at least the following components:
•	The formula for measuring group performance.
•	The baseline against which improvements in the formula will be compared.
•	The share arrangement or methodology for dividing the gains between the organization and the employees with the employee share to be no Jess than 50% of the compos-
264
ite gain after giving consideration to any capital improvements needed to produce the gain, and a deficit reserve to be paid in those periods when actual costs exceed allowable costs so as to reduce the risk to the participants,
•	The payout frequency.
•	The payout distribution method,
•	A provision tor distribution of the deficit reserve at the termination of the plan,
*	Eligibility rules (based upon an understanding that any plant employee otherwise eligible to receive contingent compensation under any other Corporate plan shall not be eligible for ESP payments).
The planning group/review board, as part of Its deliberations leading to establishment of the gainsharing formula, among other appropriate things, will review DTP:
•	Fixed and variable costs;
*	Earned hours vs, actual hours;
•	Error rate, rejects and scrap costs;
•	Quality audit results;
•	“On time" delivery; and
•	Labor costs.
The planning group/review board may recommend investment in product research and development, and investment and product-related new equipment, giving consideration to acceptable payback considerations.
The planning group/review board also has the responsibility to; engender commitment for ESP from employees at all levels and from all employee groups; provide for the development and accumulation of simple and accurate accounting information for employee review; and urge employees to eliminate mistakes, improve teamwork, cooperation and communication.
Once adopted, ESP can be amended in the first Instance two years after the effective date of the program and annually thereafter following a majority vote of the planning group/review board.

This will confirm our agreement that the current formula utilized In the Gainsharing Program (ESP) will remain in effect through December 31, 1995- A more goal based formula shall be established effective January 1, 1996. However, if such a formula is not established on the effective date, the new jointly established formula, once configured, shall be made effective retroactive to January 1, 1996.
The parties further agree that effective communication is required to ensure employee comprehension and understanding of the new formula. To this end, the Board of Administration's Gainsharing Facilitators will be charged with developing easily read and understood descriptive materials to explain the new formula.
