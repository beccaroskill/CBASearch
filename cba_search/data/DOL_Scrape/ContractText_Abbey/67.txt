ranking is immediately above that of the laid off employees.
5.6e, Employees will be recalled from layoff strictly on the basis of their plant seniority provided they are qualified to satisfactorily perform the duties of the jobs to be filled.

CAMPBELL SOUP COMPANY
NAPOLEON PLANT
EMPLOYEE SUBSTANCE ABUSE POLICY
Policy Statement
It is the policy of Campbell Soup Company’s Napoleon Plant to maintain a drug-free workplace. This is supported by pre-employment urine drug testing and by for-cause urine drug and alcohol testing on employees determined to be unfit who are not found to have a medical condition to explain the state of unfitness.
Pre-Employment Testing
The company will perform pre-employment drug tests to keep users of illegal drugs from being employed.
Possession of Drugs or Alcohol
The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance or possession or use of alcohol on Company premises or while on Company business is prohibited. Employees found to be in violation of this prohibition while on Company premises or while conducting Company business will be discharged, subject to the terms of the policy.
Workplace Impact of Substance Abuse
The greatest danger of substance abuse in the workplace is safety related. An employee under the influence of a mind-altering substance is absolutely a danger to him/herself and to other employees as well. While safety concerns are obvious, often overlooked is the fact that productivity and quality are negatively impacted by the impaired employee, and for a food processor, quality assurance is imperative. Employee theft increases, as do violent incidents, when the workplace is not free of mind-altering substances.
Substance Abuse
When a supervisor determines that an employee’s conduct or work performance indicates they are unfit-for-work, the supervisor will take the employee to the Medical Department for evaluation. No supervisor has the authority to send an employee home who is declared unfit-for-work, without evaluation by medical personnel. If an employee is found to have a medical problem causing difficulty with conduct or work performance, the employee will be referred to the family doctor or accompanied to medical facility.
36
Circumstances that may lead to a determination of unfit-for-work will be based on “just cause”, which will be reduced to writing and a copy will be supplied to the union.
If medical personnel determine the employee does not have a medical condition causing him/her to be unfit-for-wrork, the employee will submit a urine specimen for alcohol (breathalyser or intoximeter testing is acceptable as a substitute for urine alcohol testing) and drug testing. If the employee refuses to submit to the test, he/she will be subject to discipline under offense #45 of the plant disciplinary rules as if he/she had tested positive for drugs or a level of alcohol constituting intoxication (as defined by current State of Ohio law).
As a part of the medical review, a consent and drug profile questionnaire will be signed, if the employee is able to do so. This will provide the employee the opportunity to identify medications or drugs they are taking. The employee will be removed from the job for the remainder of the shift and provisions should be made to transport the employee to his/her residence via family member, friend, co-worker, or guard. The employee will report to the Human Resources Manager’s office the next regular work day for further instructions.
If the results of the test are negative, the employee will return to work in accordance with the facility’s code of disciplinary conduct. The time off will be treated as time worked.
If the results of the test are positive (i.e., if the test reveals the presence of drugs ora level of alcohol constituting intoxication), the employee will be informed and given an opportunity to explain the positive test results and counseled by the facility Medical Department or the plant Human Resources Manager regarding the possible need for rehabilitation. The employee will be given an opportunity to seek assistance through the Employee Assistance Program and if the employee accepts that assistance, there will be no discipline. If they test positive again or refuse to submit to a test, they will be terminated. The union reserves the right to negotiate this policy at the expiration of the labor agreement.
Confidentiality
As with all medical information, test results are confidential and will be kept in the medical record. They will be communicated only on a need-to-know basis to any of the following: the Human Resources Manager or his/ her delegate, the Plant Manager or his/her delegate, the Corporate Medical Director, and the Union Business Agent or his/her delegate.
37
Employee Assistance Program
Campbell Soup Company and its subsidiaries believe that alcoholism and drug addiction are treatable diseases. The Company has made available to its employees and their family members a confidential, voluntary program that offers people the opportunity to get the assistance required for the treatment of the diseases of alcoholism and drug addiction. It is the policy of the Company that, while we offer the opportunity to receive assistance, it is the responsibility of the employee to seek the assistance. Supervisors, members of management, and union representatives are trained to recommend the Employee Assistance Program to those employees whose performance is deteriorating or who request assistance. Employee orientation is conducted on the Employee Assistance Program and how to use it. Further, the Company periodically publishes information on the Employee Assistance Program with the purpose of reminding all eligible participants of the availability of the program.
Rehabilitation
Each case as it relates to treatment will be evaluated on its individual merits. Participation in a rehabilitation program, at locations where it is covered at Company expense, under this policy will be authorized only once per person.

PROCEDURE FOR RECORDING AND MAINTAINING OVERTIME RECORDS FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS EXCEPT MAINTENANCE
1.	The standard overtime record form will be used for All Departments except Maintenance. Only extra shifts of work such as on weekends will be considered as overtime opportunities for equalization purposes. Daily overtime resulting from extended shifts will not be recorded as overtime opportunities.
2.	The codes to be used on overtime records are as follows:
W - Employee accepted overtime opportunity
R - Employee refused overtime opportunity
O - Employee was not asked
A - Employee was absent when overtime schedule was prepared or was scheduled for vacation the following Monday.
3.	Entries will be made for each employee under each date listed on the form. Entries will consist of the appropriate code letter and cumulative total number of W’s and R’s to date.
4.	On those occasions when all seniority employees are scheduled to work an overtime day, all employees on the list will automatically be recorded as having accepted the opportunity to work, except those on leaves of absence (including union leaves) and those scheduled for vacation.
5.	Newly hired employees will be added to the overtime lists only after they acquire seniority and will be credited with the average number of overtime opportunities to date for the other employees on the list. Employees transferred or bid into department will be averaged in with all employees in that department and rounded off mathematically. For example, if the average is 2.5 and above the number charged would be three; where the average is below 2.5, the number charged would be two. Employees on leave of absence or furlough will be credited with the number of overtime opportunities they would have acquired had they been at work.
6.	Effective January 1 of each year the total for the employee with the lowest number of overtime opportunities on each department’s record will be changed to zero and that former total will then be subtracted from the record of each of the other employees on the list.
7.	Seniority employees who wish to be considered for overtime opportunities outside the departments where they are normally assigned,
39
on jobs which they are qualified to perform, may register weekly in the Human Resources Department for Main Plant employees and in the V-8 cafeteria for V-8 Plant employees. Overtime assignments will not be made from this list to the exclusion of employees in the department where the overtime occurs. Employees will not be charged with overtime work performed outside the departments in which they normally work.
8.	Seniority employees in the respective departments will continue to have the first opportunity to work the overtime, and employees are required to work the overtime in their “home department” if needed before they would be given consideration for overtime elsewhere. Assignment of weekend overtime will be made from the weekly overtime lists on the basis of qualifications and seniority, first within the major department where the overtime occurs and then from other major departments.
9.	Overtime work opportunities for ‘C* and ‘D’ crews will be equalized as follows: The most senior qualified employee credited with the lowest number of overtime opportunities will be contacted by phone and offered the assignment. If the opportunity is refused or the employee cannot be contacted, the next employee in line will be phoned. ‘C’ crew personnel will be contacted if ‘D’ crew has just completed their shift or is scheduled to work the next shift and vice versa.
10.	Daily overtime will be offered first to the employees who have the highest seniority among those who are qualified to perform the work available. Those lowest in seniority must accept scheduled daily overtime assignments declined by more senior employees.
GUIDELINES COVERING DISTRIBUTION OF OVERTIME WORK OPPORTUNITIES - MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT
1.	A current overtime listing will be retained in the Supervisors’ office and available to all hourly Maintenance Department personnel.
2.	Overtime will be defined as hours worked beyond the basic work week. AH overtime work opportunities will be totaled and recorded as one figure.
3.	The codes to be used on the monthly overtime records are as follows:
# - Employee accepted overtime opportunity (# - of the opportunity) R - Employee refused overtime opportunity
O - Employee was not asked
A - Employee was absent when overtime schedule was prepared
Vac - Vacation
ML - Medical Leave
40
4.	Entries will be made for each employee under each date listed on the form. Entries will consist of the appropriate code letter and cumulative total number of work and refusal instances to date.
5.	On those occasions when all seniority employees are scheduled to work an overtime day, all employees on the list will automatically be recorded as having accepted the opportunity to work, except those on leaves of absence (including union leaves) and those scheduled for vacation.
6.	Newly hired employees will be added to the overtime lists only after they acquire seniority and will be credited with the average number of overtime work opportunities to date in the same classification on the list. Seniority employees transferred or bid into a department will be credited with the average number of overtime work opportunities recorded for the department. Employees on leave of absence or furlough of two weeks or more will be credited with the average number overtime opportunities for the department with the major department.
7.	Effective January 1st of each year the total for the employee with the lowest number of overtime opportunities on each department’s record will be changed to zero, and that former total will then be subtracted from the record of each of the other employees on the list. All employees will be combined regardless of rate.
8.	Records of overtime work opportunities by shift will be maintained separately for the following six departments:
a.	Electricians
b.	Mechanics - upper level
c.	Mechanics - lower level
d.	Mechanics - assigned to filling and closing
e.	Mechanics - V-8 (General Maintenance)
f.	Utility Maintenance
9.	Weekend overtime work opportunities will be posted on Thursday.
10.	Overtime information will be posted in each department that will list employees scheduled to work and will identify probationary employees. It will be the responsibility of employees absent on the day the overtime list is posted to inform their Supervisor that they are interested in working the overtime for which probationary employees may be scheduled, and if the employees are qualified to perform the overtime work, an adjustment in the overtime list will be made.
41
11.	The selection of the job class of maintenance personnel for overtime work opportunities will be based on the grade of work to be performed, the qualifications and availability of personnel to work the overtime, and the relative number of overtime work opportunities already charged to the employees by class/rate.
12.	Members of the Maintenance Department will not be scheduled to work or charged overtime work opportunities for the Saturday or Sunday that immediately precedes their vacation period. Third shift maintenance employees can take off Saturday before vacation except shutdown weeks. Although they will be given the opportunity to work such overtime when available. If the employee chooses to work the Saturday or Sunday preceding his vacation, they will be charged with such overtime work opportunities. During shutdowns or training on other shifts for 3 weeks or less employees will only be charged opportunities that they would have received if they worked on their shift.
13.	Employees on vacation are not to be charged for overtime work opportunities that they would normally be assigned, had they not been on paid vacation.
14.	Employees declining an overtime work opportunity will be charged with the overtime work opportunity he would have worked.
15.	The following detailed procedure for charging overtime work opportunities in the Maintenance Department that was agreed to by the parties on May 25, 1975, is reaffirmed:
a.	Employees normally scheduled to work eight hours per day who work an unscheduled nine hour day (one hour at time and one-half) will be charged with 1/8 of an opportunity. Employees will not be charged for unscheduled overtime unless it is an hour or more, and then only for additional full hours of overtime. Employees working three hours of unscheduled overtime will be charged four hours or one-half an overtime opportunity (three times time and one-half = four and one-half.) In this example, the employee is only charged four hours and the one-half is dropped.
b.	An employee normally scheduled to work eight hours, Monday through Friday, who is scheduled to work eight hours on Saturday, will be charged with 1Vi opportunities.
c.	An employee who normally works eight hours Monday through Friday and eight hours on Saturday and Sunday will be charged
42
1 ’/2 opportunities for Saturday and two opportunities for Sunday since he is paid double time for Sunday because it is the seventh day worked in the work week.
d.	Employees scheduled to work eight hours on a Company paid holiday will be charged a 1V2 opportunity. . .
e.	Third shift employees normally working 6.5 hour shifts will not be charged for any scheduled or non-scheduled overtime unless it exceeds eight hours and then in accordance with the formulas outlined in item (a) above. Third shift employees working six days per week, Monday through Saturday, will not be charged overtime opportunities unless they work a full hour or more on Saturday beyond eight hours and then in accordance with item (a) above.
f.	Third shift employees scheduled to work 6.5 hours, Monday through Saturday, and who work on Sunday, will be charged with the equivalent of 2/s (V4) of a job opportunity equal to each full hour they work on this day.
g.	Daily overtime work opportunities and Saturday and Sunday work opportunities declined by the employee will be charged in accordance with the procedure outlined above.
