The copays for office visits, emergency room, and prescription drugs that are agreed to will remain in effect for remote site HMOs offered by the company during the life of the contract, except where the HMOs no longer offer those copay arrangements as part of their array of products. In those situations where an HMO no longer offers the copay arrangements agreed to by the union and the company, the company will work with the HMO and the union to offer the next lowest copay arrangement.
in Southern California, the copay arrangements in place for HMOs offered to the IAM 725 will be offered to IAM 837 employees in those locations.
2.	Off-Site Bases
Employees assigned to off-site bases at the request of the Company will be assigned under the appropriate provisions of the Corporate Travel Manual then in effect. These employees will be informed of the provisions of the Corporate Travel Manual governing their assignment when they are requested to accept such assignments.
Employees assigned permanently to remote facilities may be reclassified to a Field Classification. In no case, however, will an employee be reclassified to a Field Classification when receiving per diem allowances.

Plant Chairman replacements may exceed the two (2) weeks without loss of any of the above benefits.
In addition, the Company agrees that leaves granted to employee/members of the Union’s negotiating committee during contract negotiation periods will not affect the seniority or cause any loss of benefits to those employees.
Special circumstances may occasionally occur wherein the Union may request time off for employees outside the provisions of this Supplemental Understanding. Such requests will be in writing, submitted to the Company at least three (3) calendar days prior to the requested time off.

Dear Mr. Smith:
This is to confirm the understanding we reached during the recent negotiations concerning public pension and health insurance legislation.
1.	Supplemental Understanding #7 dated 31 March 1981 is cancelled with the understanding that, if any applicable governmental legislation or regulations escalate pension or savings plan costs appreciably during the life of the 2001-2004 Agreement, this matter will be subject for negotiations upon expiration of this Agreement.
2.	It is also agreed that Company health benefits should not duplicate the benefits of public health insurance programs. It is further agreed that if any applicable legislation is enacted, the Company may implement changes in Company health benefits to effect cost reductions necessary to bring its liability for costs of Company health benefits plus any tax or premium contribution required from the Company by such legislation (or regulations thereunder) to the level in effect immediately prior to the implementation of such legislation.

> Supplemental Understanding #8
2	OVERTIME GUIDELINES
j NOTE: When a department is on a scheduled extended workweek (in 4 excess ot forty (40) hours), only paragraphs 13, 30 and 31 will s apply.
t, 1. Overtime is generally necessitated by an emergency and is 7 influenced by weather, availability of parts and extraordinary 8 production requirements and, therefore, cannot be scheduled 9	accurately in advance. The Company is willing, however, to
io	make an effort to notify as far in advance as it is possible for it to
11 do so, recognizing that this effort is limited by the nature of the u work to be performed and by the difficulty of securing a requisite u	approval of Company and customer representatives.
14	2. Recognizing the above difficulties, the Company will inform those is	employees required to work overtime on the weekend sometime
16	before the end of the shift on Thursday. It must be understood
n	by all parties that this group is subject to upward or downward
is	revisions without notice. In the event of a downward revision in
19	the number of employees, there will be no liability on the
20	Company’s part to any of the employees who were scheduled to
2i	work and for whom there had been a change. On Friday,
22	supervision will contact each tentatively scheduled employee (or
23	post a list) to confirm or cancel the overtime. Employees are not
24	to rely on the tentative schedule to determine the overtime
15	arrangement. In the case of an upward revision in the overtime
it.	schedule, no charge will be made for the Friday refusal of the
27	weekend overtime.
3, Overtime is not usually firm until the end of the employee's shift on Friday. Any employee absent the entire day on a Friday,
30	regardless of said employee’s reason for being absent, shall not
3i	work Saturday and/or Sunday overtime under any circumstances
32	nor be charged therefor. Any employee who has been confirmed
33	to work Saturday and Sunday of the same weekend and who,
34	however, does not report for work on Saturday, will be charged
35	for Saturday and will not be allowed to work that Sunday, nor be
36	charged for Sunday, regardless of said employee’s reason for his
37	Saturday absence.
62
i 4. Any employee who is tardy (four (4) hours or less) on a Friday 2	will be permitted to work Saturday and/or Sunday overtime, if
3	scheduled.
4	5. In the event an employee leaves work early on a Friday and said 3	employee was scheduled to work Saturday and/or Sunday
6	overtime, it will be the responsibility of the employee to confirm
7	his overtime assignment with supervision prior to his early
n	departure. If that employee’s reason for leaving work early is of
9	such a nature that may prohibit him from working the schedule
io	overtime, then that employee will be removed from the overtime
ii	list but will not be charged with overtime worked on the
12	department’s overtime record. However, if prior to his early
u	departure, supervision determines that said employee can work
14	the Saturday and/or Sunday overtime and that employee fails to
is	report for said overtime work, then that employee will be charged
16	with a day or days, as the case might be, of overtime worked on
17	the department's overtime	record.
is 6. In the event an employee	leaves work early on	a Friday	and has
19	been told by supervision,	prior to	leaving,	to report for	work on
20	Saturday and/or Sunday and, later, after the early departure of 2i the employee, the overtime is altered downwardly, supervision 22 will make a reasonable effort to contact by telegraph that 23	employee to notify him of the overtime change and there will be
24	no liability on the part of the Company to said employee for
25	whom there had been a change.
26	7. In the event the overtime is altered upwardly after the early 27	departure of an employee on a Friday, then that employee shall
zu	have no claim for wages due him for the overtime worked by
29	another employee.
30	8. All overtime, during the week as well as on weekends, whether 3i worked or declined, will be charged, except as provided 32 elsewhere in these Guidelines.
33	9. An employee will not be charged with overtime which he is 34 offered and cannot work due to jury duty, vacation or funeral 35 leave.
36 10. When an employee is transferred into another department or to 37	another shift, he will be charged with the average number of
3»	hours worked by the appropriate workers of the new department.
39 If a transferred employee returns to his original department and
63
shift within 30 days, he will be charged with the actual number of hours he had there if that number is higher than the average of that department and shift.
11.	No employee during a trial period (probationary, transferred in lieu of layoff or assigned to a higher-rated classification) shall work any overtime unless all the employees in his new department, in the classification for which he is being considered, have been offered overtime.
12.	On Monday or Tuesday, each Steward shall be given a list of the employees within his certification who have worked overtime or been charged tor overtime during the preceding week.
13.	Prior notice by memo will be issued when a department is placed on an extended workweek. This notice will include the start of the overtime scheduled workweek period as well as the anticipated end of this period. An employee absent on an overtime day when his department is on an overtime scheduled workweek will be charged on the overtime records for overtime missed but not unless he shall have at least three (3) days notice of the schedule.
14.	An employee who is absent on a leave longer than thirty (30) days will, upon returning to his department and shift, be charged with the average number of hours worked by others in his classification, if his actual hours worked are lower than that average.
15.	An employee who is gone on a road trip longer than one (1) week will, upon returning to his department and shift, be charged with the average number of hours worked by others in his classification, shift and department it his actual hours worked prior to going on the trip are lower than that average. Employees who are higher than the average number of hours worked by others in the department, shift, classification, will be charged with the average number of hours worked by employees in his classification, shift, and department, while the employee was on the road trip.
16.	Upon the request of the Directing Business Representative, the administration of these guidelines and the distribution of overtime will be reviewed by the Labor Relations Department, Supervision of the Company division concerned, and the Directing Business Representative or his designee.
64
i 17. Overtime shall be recorded in units of paid hours rather than 2 hours worked. For example, eight (8) hours’ work at time and 3 one-half shall be recorded as twelve (12) hours; eight (8) hours’ 4 work at double time shall be recorded as sixteen (16) hours.
s 18. If an employee is offered overtime work in a department other 6	than his own, he is to be charged with those hours (whether he
?	works or declines) on the record of his own department.
8 19. Whenever the number of overtime hours offered differs from the 9	number of hours actually	worked, an employee who declines
io	overtime is to be charged with the number of paid hours he was
11	offered. Supervision is	to exercise its best judgment in
is	estimating realistically the	number of hours' work which will be
13 needed. The employee who works is, of course, to be charged i4 with the number of paid hours actually worked.
is 20. Before requiring employees to work overtime, supervision will 16	first offer that overtime to each employee in the appropriate shift,
17	department, and job classification. Where it is necessary to draft
is	employees to work, this will be done in reverse seniority order,
is	For example, when “drafting” is first required, the least senior
2o	employee with the least number of drafts in the appropriate shift,
it	department, and job classification shall be ordered to work. If
22	subsequent drafting is required on that weekend or in the future,
23	additional employees shall be drafted starting with the least
24	senior man with the least number of drafts (i.e., the second least
25	senior employee with the least number of drafts next, the third
26	least senior employee with the least number of drafts next, etc.)
27	within the appropriate shift, department, and job classification. If
28	an employee is transferred to another department or shift which 29	has had drafting, the transferred employee will be charged with
30	the average number of drafts of that department, shift, and
3i	classification. This procedure will resume again when the 32 rotational seniority cycle is completed. Employees are not to be 33 drafted immediately prior to going on vacation.
34 21, Several provisions of the Guidelines call for charging employees 35 with the average number of hours worked by others in the same 36 classification, department, and shift. To calculate this average, 37 total the number of hours charged to the other employees and 38 divide by the number of employees. Calculate it to the nearest 39 tenth of an hour.
65
22.	An employee who is required to attend military reserve training on a weekend is not to be offered overtime (or charged) on that weekend, unless all employees in that classification, shift and department are needed. If the reservist falls considerably behind other employees in overtime as a result of his military obligation, this tact may be noted by entering “MR" on the record for any overtime day not offered to him because of his military reserve training.
23.	Overtime is to be recorded to the nearest tenth of an hour paid. For example, if an employee works 3.6 hours overtime following his regular shift during the week, he is to be charged with 5.4 hours (1-1/2 x 3.6 hours).
24.	A steward is to be permitted a reasonable amount of Company time to maintain a cumulative record of overtime hours for employees he represents. To minimize the amount of time required for this activity, supervision may furnish the steward with a xerox copy of the appropriate Overtime Distribution Record so that he need not prepare a duplicate record of his own. If this is done, the steward is to be allowed reasonable time to check this xerox copy for accuracy.
25.	Should supervision determine during the first four hours of a Saturday or Sunday shift that its schedule overtime work will extend into the following shift for four or more hours, the appropriate employees for the following shift will be called in by telephone.
26.	An employee who, on Thursday, declines weekend overtime and subsequently is absent on Friday, will be charged with the hours offered unless the weekend overtime is cancelled.
27.	If an employee declines overtime, and that overtime subsequently is cancelled, he will not be charged.
28.	Since an employee working up to eight (8) hours on a holiday actually earns only double time in addition to the straight-time pay he would receive for not working, he is to be charged at the double time rate for the first eight (8) hours, i.e., sixteen (16) hours. If he works more than eight (8) hours, he is to be charged at the rate of three (3) hours for each hour worked in excess of eight (8).

29.	Overtime is not to be offered to an employee immediately prior to going on vacation, during his vacation or following his vacation, unless all other employees in his department, shift, and classification have been asked. If overtime is offered under these conditions and it is refused, no charge will be made, but if the overtime is worked, it will be charged.
30.	An employee scheduled for vacation will be required to work on the Saturday of the workweek prior to the workweek in which his vacation begins. Such an employee will not be asked, nor allowed to volunteer, to work overtime on any Saturday that occurs during his scheduled vacation period.
31.	Overtime shall not be recorded on the appropriate “Overtime Distribution Record” during those workweeks when a department is on a scheduled extended workweek (in excess of 40 hours); e.g., when a department is placed on a scheduled extended workweek of 48 hours for 4 consecutive weeks, we will freeze each employee’s overtime record at the number of overtime hours worked through the fast day of the workweek prior to the Monday the department commences the 48-hour workweek schedule. If Sunday overtime is worked however, it will be recorded. We will unfreeze the individual employee's record of hours worked and again begin our normal overtime recording with the first work day following the above 4 weeks.
32.	Overtime hours accumulated by each employee during the life of the previous agreement will not be reduced to zero. Only the employee with the lowest overtime hours within each shift, department, and job classification will be reduced to zero and each other emptoyee within the same shift, department, and job classification, will be reduced by a like amount.
33.	Employees who have scheduled a one (1) day vacation prior to being drafted for overtime will not be required to work the overtime for which he was drafted. However, an employee who takes a one (1) day vacation after being drafted for overtime will still be required to work the overtime for which he was drafted.

io Dear Mr. Williams:
it During the recent contract negotiations, you expressed the desire 12 that your Union become more actively involved in the Affirmative n Action Program established to further the employment opportunities 14 of employee-members of minority groups. You mentioned specifically i; that you wanted the Union to participate actively in the investigating 16 and resolving of complaints of discrimination raised by minority I? employees within the bargaining unit you represent, particularly in where no contract violation is alleged and recourse through the is grievance procedure is not appropriate. The Company 20 wholeheartedly accepts your offer to help in this critical area of 2i employee relations.
22 As you know, the Company has established at St. Louis an Equal 23 Opportunity Department under the guidance of the Manager-Equal 24 Opportunity Programs, MDA-St. Louis, whose duties include the 15 investigation and resolution of complaints of discrimination. To date, 26 this department has pursued such complaints without regard to Union 27 representation. Beginning 1 June 1972, a new procedure will be 2n instituted for the investigation and resolution of discrimination 29 complaints. The Union will designate one of its Business 30 Representatives as a specialist to assist minority employees in the 3i pursuit of their complaints. Any complaints or reports of 32 discriminatory treatment, which are lodged with the Union, will be 33 brought to the attention of the Manager-Equal Opportunity Programs, 34 MDA-St. Louis, by this Business Representative as well as by the 3s affected employee if the employee so chooses. The Business 36 Representative and the Manager-Equal Opportunity Programs, MDA-37 St. Louis, will cooperatively investigate such complaints and exercise

their best efforts to effect a satisfactory resolution, it is understood, of course, that where any affected employee is not satisfied with such resolution, he may seek further recourse through any appropriate governmental agency.
Bulletin board notices announcing this new procedure will be posted simultaneously by the Union and the Company for 30-day period beginning 1 June 1972.
It is our hope that this new approach to this vital aspect of employee relations will help all employees realize our mutual objective of equal opportunity and fair play.

Dear Mr. Williams:
This will reconfirm our recent discussion about the newly bargained job classification of Mechanic-Electro-Optic when you posed two (2) questions:
First, what would happen in the event that one of your members is reclassified (i.e., promoted according to Article IV, Section 7) to the new classification of Mechanic-Electro-Optic and several months later it is learned that we are not able to secure the required Security clearance?
Second, what will happen to the incumbents should this new job classification become extinct-not needed-during the term of this Agreement?
In either event, this is to acknowledge our understanding that such employee(s) “will be returned to his previous work" (see Article IV, Section 7, last sentence).

2	MDA Employability Plan
3	Productivity gains will lead to reduced product cost, and this, in 4 turn, will lead to increased sales. Thus, the need for workers should .i remain constant or even grow. It is our desire to increase sales and 6 expand our workforce because of these gains.
7 However, in the early stages of implementing High Performance s Work Teams, it may become necessary to reduce the size of the 9 workforce because the productivity gains have not yet led to io increased sales. In addition, the mix of work may change, causing a 11 reduction in need for some worker classifications and an increase to 12 others.
13 In either circumstance, it is the Intent of the Company to offer H assistance to the displaced worker through this employability plan.
is I. When productivity gains cause a reduction or shift in the types of is	workers required, the Company will provide up to one year of
17	training at a maximum cost of $5,000 to any displaced worker,
is	This training will be skill-based in the areas where we are
w	experiencing a shortage (depleted the pool of laid-off workers in
20	that classification). The worker will be expected to satisfy all
2i	certification requirements of the new position. If a worker cannot
j;	qualify for the new work, he will be placed on layoff status until
23	there is a need in his current classification.
14	ll. If there are no jobs in the Company for which the displaced worker 25 is qualified, the Company will assist the worker in his search for 26 employment by:
27	1. maintaining a database of other job opportunities within the
2ti	local area;
29	2. providing assistance in the job search process, which includes
30	resume' preparation, letter writing support, etc.
31	3. providing up to one year of skills training in a field selected by
32	the worker. This training is not to exceed $5,000 per worker.
33	Displaced workers laid-off because of productivity gains must take 34 advantage of the benefits offered in this plan within three (3) months 35 of being laid off.

2	OFFSET AND SUBCONTRACTING
j	ARRANGEMENTS
4 The Company and Union agree that an increasingly productive 5 workforce is critical to the continued success of the enterprise and s that domestic and international sales represent opportunities for 7 employment growth and stability. The parties also recognize that a s variety of business factors, including the Company’s ability to secure 's sales, may require offsets as part of such transactions. While io agreeing that Company’s ability to enter into offset arrangements is n not diminished by this Agreement, the parties agree that the 12 Company and the Union wilt meet periodically to discuss the status of i3 offset arrangements.
t4 Given these conditions, and in acknowledgment of Company and 13 Union concerns regarding employment stability, the parties agree to if. meet periodically to discuss the impact of subcontracting on 1? bargaining unit jobs, {except work that has been or will be transferred is or assigned into St. Louis Production Operations by other MDC is operating units.)
20 With respect to the subcontracting of work currently performed by 2i bargaining unit employees, the parties recognize that from time to 22 time such subcontracting may be necessary. To enable the Union to 23 suggest competitive alternatives which might allow the retention of 24 work within the bargaining unit, the Company will, at least seventy-23 five (75) days prior to signing any agreement to subcontract work 26 currently being performed by bargaining unit employees, provide 27 notice to the Union of its plans to subcontract work which would 28 directly result in the displacement of bargaining unit positions. The 29 Company will provide information related to the potential 30 subcontracting other than information it considers to be confidential, 31 proprietary or subject to nondisclosure provisions.
32 The parties recognize that some subcontracting decisions cannot 33 be disclosed within the seventy-five (75) day period referred to above, 34 due to confidentiality concerns. In such circumstances, the Company 33 will provide the Union as much notice as practicable-
36 Following notice of specific plans to subcontract work currently 37 performed by bargaining unit employees, the parties shall, upon the 38 request of the Union, meet and discuss the impact on the bargaining
94
unit. The Company agrees to consider any proposal the Union might make which would result in a materially less costly way to retain such work in the bargaining unit. The Union must present any such proposals within 60 calendar days of receipt of the Company's plans. The parties will meet periodically to review the implementation of any such union proposals accepted by the Company. Should the Union’s projected savings not be realized within any ninety (90) day review period during implementation, the Company wilt have the right to subcontract the work.
Employment Stability Income Continuation Plan
In the event the Company subcontracts work resulting in the displacement of active bargaining unit members, affected eligible employees shall be offered (and elect) a benefit under (a) the MDA Employability Plan or (b) the Income Continuation Plan discussed above. The Employability Plan and the Income Continuation Plan shall exist only during the term of this Agreement.

HEALTH CARE COMMITTEE
The Company and the Union are committed to ensuring that employees have access to cost effective, quality health care coverage. Because of their ongoing concern about the quality of health care and costs, the parties agree to a Joint Committee on Health Care Costs and Quality. The Committee will have an equal number of representatives, including a co-chair, from each party. When appropriate, health care experts and representatives from the Company’s health plans will be invited to attend Committee meetings. Each party may have their benefits consultants and advisors attend Committee meetings. The Committee will meet at least twice each year to discuss issues related to the health care program. The Committee also will meet with health care providers to express the parties’ interest in obtaining quality health care at affordable prices. Among the topics that the parties will consider and discuss are:
■	Costs under the HMD, POS and indemnity plans available to 1AM members.
■	Overall plan design, including availability of adequate health care plans in remote locations. In areas where high quality managed care is not available, covered employees will enjoy the benefits provided under in-network coverage with the health care provider of their choice.
•	Cost management programs to address specific cost areas, including:
o Disease management of selected high-cost chronic diseases.
o Targeted health risk assessment.
o Catastrophic case management.
■	Measurement tools for evaluating health plans, including accreditation from a nationally recognized group such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) or the Foundation for Accountability (FACCT). The Parties agree that no change in managed care providers or benefit levels will occur without review and approval by the Committee.

•	The Company and the Union also will undertake initiatives to expand health care plan accountability for quality. Among these initiatives will be joint efforts in pursuit of provider programs focused on specific high-yield quality innovations shown to substantially improve patient safety:
o Computerized physician order entry. Physicians will be required to enter prescriptions into a hospital database to screen for inappropriate medications and dosages and avoid potential adverse drug reactions/'nte tactions.
o Evidence- based hospital referral. Physicians will be required, where practical, to guide patients to facilities with superior outcomes (linked to significantly lower patient mortality).
o Closed ICU physician staffing. Where available, only ICU physicians will provide medical care in these units, using their particular expertise in critical care.
The Company and the Union are committed through these and other initiatives to improve quality and maintain reasonable costs, and they will recognize and endorse contracting decisions with physicians, hospitals and health plans based on compliance with these joint initiatives.

2	MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
3	ON THE
4	LABOR GRADE
j During the 2001 negotiations, the Parties agreed to a new Labor 6 Grade classification model. The model features nine Labor Grades 7 wherein each Labor Grade contains one or more classification. An s employee's classification will be maintained for purposes of 9 layoff/recall, overtime distribution, vacation scheduling and shift io bumps. An employee wilt be allowed to progress through automatic 11 wage progression to the top of the rate range agreed to for the Labor 12 Grade in which his classification resides. An employee within a □ Labor Grade, notwithstanding his classification, may perform work of i4 any classification contained therein and the company will provide >5 training if necessary to perform the duties of those other 16 classifications. Higher rated Labor Grades may additionally perform n work falling within a lower rated Labor Grade. All employees will be is expected to perform general duties such as moving parts, clean-up, i9 on-the-job training and cross training, and perform general shop 20 duties as assigned. This flexibility may be utilized during an 2i employee's normal workweek as well as on overtime and shall not be 22 diminished due to layoff in any classification.
23 Manufacturing Self ExaminatiorVOperator Verification (MSE/OV) 24 will be implemented plant wide. An operator that is unable to pass 25 the required certifications to be MSE/OV certified will be given a 26 second chance to do so. Any employee failing the second chance 27 will be required to meet with a special review board, which will review 28 the employee's circumstances. The special review board will 29 determine the next appropriate action.
30 Overtime will be assigned in accordance with Article XXV and 3i distributed as equally as possible by classification, department and 32 shift. Where the majority of the work (more than half of the overtime 33 worked) to be performed, during an overtime period, can be identified 34 as belonging to a particular classification, then that classification 35 would perform the work.
36 The parties recognize that some on-the-job-training and/or specific 37 training may be required in order to utilize the flexibility inherent in is this new Labor Grade Mode). AH such training decisions deemed
99
i necessary will reside with management. An employee that is unable 2 to pass cross-training necessary to effectively utilize them within a 3 Labor Grade will be given a second chance to do so. Any employee 4 failing the second chance will be required to meet with a special s review board, which will review the employee’s circumstances. The 6 special review board will determine the next appropriate action.
