B.	Improve Regular Pension Breakpoint
Covered Compensation Breakpoint shall be established at $50,000 for the calendar years 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. For subsequent calendar years, Covered Compensation Breakpoint shall be $20,000 below IRS covered compensation (defined under Section 401(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) for an employee attaining age 65 in the year.
Note: Covered Compensation Breakpoint remains constant after age 65 based on the amount of the employee's Covered Compensation Breakpoint under the plan in the year in which the employee attained age 65.
C.	Regular Pension Update
(Effective 11/1/15 with Accelerated Eligibility Date)
Increase annual regular pension as of December 31, 2014, for hourly and nonexempt salaried participants with at least 25 years of Pension Qualification Service (“PQS”) as of such date, and for hourly, nonexempt salaried and exempt salaried participants who have both attained at least age 55 and completed at least 20 years of PQS as of such date, to the following amount:
0.90% of the participant’s average annual earnings up to $55,000 multiplied by his years of Pension Benefit Service (“PBS”) as of December 31, 2014;
plus
1.40% of the participant’s average annual earnings in excess of $55,000 multiplied by his years of PBS as of December 31, 2014.
Average annual earnings is the average of the participant’s annual earnings during the 3 consecutive calendar years of the 6 year period 2009 through 2014 that produces the highest average for the participant. The participant’s earnings will be based on the Plan’s definition of “Compensation” including overtime. In the case of a participant who is an exempt salaried employee as of December 31, 2014, however, in no event will such a participant’s average annual earnings in excess of $200,000 be taken into account under the above formula.
The participant’s existing December 31, 2014 regular pension, to which his pension under the above formula is compared to determine the amount (if any) of the increase, will include all previous increases already credited to the participant.
Page 10 of 88
IUE
6/22/2015 3:09 AM
Application
Applies to pensions payable on and after November 1, 2015.
Employees who meet the service (and any age) requirements described above who are actively participating in the Pension Plan on July 1, 2015 are eligible. Former employees who meet such service (and any age) requirements, actively participate in the Pension Plan immediately before termination of employment with the Company and terminate employment in June 2015 after becoming eligible to retire with an optional, normal or disability pension are also eligible.
In addition, employees who were pieceworkers in IUE-CWA Local 201 and retired on October 1, 2014 (or were eligible to so retire but elected to receive layoff benefits as of such date instead) who meet the service (and any age) requirements described above and actively participated in the Pension Plan immediately before such retirement or layoff are also eligible to participate in this Regular Pension update to the extent provided in the agreement entered into for this purpose by General Electric Company’s Aviation Business and IUE-CWA Local 201.
With the exception of the calculation of any alternate benefits payable with respect to participation in a prior plan (e.g. RCA), this update shall not apply to prior plan benefits.
D.	Extend Payout Period of Supplements
Payment of the Regular Supplement and Special Supplement will be extended from the age 62 date on which the participant is first eligible to commence receiving old-age Social Security Benefits until the date on which the commencement of such benefits would result in exactly a 20% reduction. Such latter date, referred to as the “Age of Eligibility for 80% Social Security Benefits,” will be determined under provisions of law in effect on June 1, 2015 (without regard to any amendments thereto). Accordingly, it will vary based on the participant’s year of birth as set forth in the table below:
Page 11 of 88
IUE
6/22/2015 3:09 AM
Year of Birth	Age of Eligibility for 80% Social Security Benefits
Before 1955	Age 63
1955	Age 63 and 2 months
1956	Age 63 and 4 months
1957	Age 63 and 6 months
1958	Age 63 and 8 months
1959	Age 63 and 10 months
After 1959	Age 64
(Exact ages and year of birth to be determined in accordance with Social Security laws in effect on June 1, 2015.)	
No Regular or Special Supplement will be paid from the Plan on or after such date.
The extension also applies to any Supplement which may be payable under the Long Service Security Provisions of the Plan.
Example: A participant was born in 1955 and is eligible for the Regular Supplement when he retires. Based on his year of birth, the participant will be entitled to receive 80% of his Social Security benefits if he elects to start receiving them at age 63 and 2 months. The Regular Supplement will therefore be extended for such participant for an additional 14 months in comparison to the age 62 cutoff date that would otherwise apply.
Effective for participants who terminate service on or after June 1, 2015 and on or before June 30, 2019 who are eligible for the Regular or Special Supplements covered by this extension.
E.	Regular Supplement
1.	Increase the Regular Monthly Supplement
From: $20.00 per month, per year of Pension Benefit Service
To: $21.00 per month, per year of Pension Benefit Service
Regular Supplement is paid until the date of earliest eligibility to commence receiving old-age Social Security benefits (age 62), unless paragraph 3 applies.

For this purpose, an employee will be treated as qualifying for the Regular Supplement by applying the rules of paragraph 2 above, except that the Age of Eligibility for 80% Social Security Benefits will be substituted for age 62 therein.
F.	Special Supplement
~\
Renew Special Supplement and increase monthly amount from $400 to $425. Special Supplement also continued beyond age 62 to the Age of Eligibility for 80% Social Security Benefits in accordance with the Section entitled “Extend Payout Period of Supplements.”

Interest rate discount assumption used to calculate the offset will be whichever of the following two interest rates applicable to the first day of the calendar year in which the participant retires produces the smaller offset: (1) the lump sum interest rate for private sector payments as may be published by the PBGC, or (2) the “Applicable Interest Rate” under the GE Pension Plan.
The portion of offset attributable to health benefits will be calculated by multiplying $7,841 by the number of whole years between the date of termination for retirement and the date when first eligible for Medicare. The resulting number shall be reduced by a factor equivalent to the percent of employee contributions toward the average value of health coverage at the time of the Special Early Retirement Option election. For Permanent Job Loss Events occurring after 2015, the $7,841 figure shall be adjusted annually based on annual increases in the medical component of the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers.

A.	Automatic Enrollment
Provide for the automatic enrollment of union employees who are eligible for Company Retirement Contributions (“CRCs”) and who have not made an affirmative election regarding the amount (if any) of their own savings in the plan, on the same terms that currently apply to non-union employees eligible for CRCs, except as provided below.
Those employees will be enrolled as electing to contribute 2% of eligible pay in pre-tax savings, which will continue as after-tax savings pursuant to normal plan rules once the regular pre-tax savings limit governed by the Internal Revenue Code ($18,000 for 2015) is reached.
If the employee has not made an affirmative election regarding the investment of his contributions in the plan, those contributions will be invested as if he had elected the Target Retirement Date Fund consistent with his age.
The employee may change these contribution and investment elections, and the investment of his account balance, at any time in accordance with normal plan rules. For example, the employee may elect to make a different type of contribution (e.g., after-tax savings or Roth contributions) or a different contribution amount (including no contribution at all).
Effective for years beginning on or after January 1, 2016 with respect to all union employees eligible for this provision, regardless of hire date. All employees eligible for this provision will receive notice of their automatic enrollment at least 30 days in advance, and may elect not to be automatically enrolled.

Services deemed not to be medically necessary by the health plan will be denied in full by the plan.
The new benefit will apply to expenses incurred on or after January 1, 2016 for active employees.
5.	Enhancement to Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) and Health Care Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Process (For Information Only)
Introduce a single card to access the pharmacy benefit and pay for in-network pharmacy expenses.
Allow employees at the time of Annual Enrollment the ability to choose from the current manual reimbursement process (“Pick and Process”) or the new auto-reimbursement feature for non-pharmacy debit card transactions.

For participants in Option 1 and 2, modify the plan such that a mid-year birth, adoption or addition of a step-child shall not result in a mid-year change to your coverage category (e.g., you will not change from Two Person to Three Person coverage), and your Annual Deductible, coinsurance maximum and HRA contribution amount will not change as a result of those events until the next plan year. However, your contribution will still change mid-year.

V. RETIREE MEDICAL
Introduction of Retiree Reimbursement Account and GE Pharmacy Assistance Fund in lieu of current post-65 benefits
It is understood and agreed that no union that is or will be subject to the 2015 -2019 GE/IUE-CWA National Agreement, the 2015 - 2019 GE/UE National Agreement, or another CBC-union collective bargaining agreement which is part of a “me-too” arrangement incorporating the terms of either National Agreement referred to herein (collectively, the “CBAs”) represents any individuals that are retired prior to the effective date of the CBAs.
A.	Effective December 31, 2015, all plans maintained by the Company that provide post-65 retiree healthcare benefits for eligible union-represented employees shall be amended to eliminate any coverage on or after attainment of age 65. After December 31, 2015, the only post-65 retiree healthcare benefits for eligible union-represented employees, spouses, and same-sex domestic partners who have reached age 65 shall be the Retiree Reimbursement Account and Pharmacy Assistance Fund described below (subject to the terms thereof).
B.	Effective January 1, 2016, the Company will extend solely to Eligible Participants (as defined below) a Retiree Reimbursement Account (“RRA”) and a Pharmacy Assistance Fund (“GEPAF”) (collectively, the “New Arrangements"), which may be administered as one or more stand-alone plans or as part of another GE plan. An Eligible Participant means: an Eligible Retiree, Eligible Spouse, or Eligible Domestic Partner (each as defined below) who has not lost eligibility for and requests to enroll in GE-subsidized post-65 retiree healthcare benefits by the date he or she attains age 65 for purposes of Medicare. Subject to satisfying the
Page 42 of 88
IUE
6/22/2015 3:09 AM
eligibility requirements, coverage shall become available to an Eligible Participant on the later of January 1, 2016, or the date such Eligible Participant attains age 65 for purposes of Medicare.
1.	An “Eligible Retiree” is an individual who satisfies all of the following conditions:
a.	As of June 22, 2015, he or she is an hourly or non-exempt salaried production employee; and
b.	He or she retires from the Company on or before June 23, 2019; and c. If not for the first sentence of Paragraph A, above, he or she would qualify for Company-subsidized post-65 retiree healthcare benefits under the GE Life, Disability and Medical Plan after attaining age 65 (i.e., (i) was hired prior to January 1, 2008 and retires at age 60 or later with at least 10 years of continuous service, (ii) retires under the Special Early Retirement Option (SERO) of the GE Pension Plan, (iii) receives a disability pension under the GE Pension Plan, or (iv) receives pension benefits under the Plant Closing Pension Option (PCPO) of the GE Pension Plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of subparagraph (ii), in no event will an individual be regarded as an Eligible Retiree, and no post-65 retiree healthcare benefits shall be provided, if the individual retired as a volunteer for another employee under any substitution feature of SERO (including the substitution features of regular SERO and SERO 30). In addition, for purposes of applying clause (iv), in no event will an individual be regarded as an Eligible Retiree, and no post-65 retiree healthcare benefits shall be provided, if the individual retired under PCPO unless such individual also completed 30 years or more of Pension Qualification Service or was at least age 50 with 25 through 29 years of Pension Qualification Service under PCPO. The post-65 retiree healthcare benefits provided to those SERO and PCPO participants who qualify as Eligible Retirees shall be in addition to the benefits set forth in the Sections which provide for SERO and PCPO.
2.	An Eligible Spouse is a spouse (including a same-sex spouse if the marriage is recognized under federal law) of an Eligible Retiree, which spouse is (a) at least age 60 on June 23, 2019 and (b) married to the Eligible Retiree when the spouse attains age 65 for purposes of Medicare and thereafter.

IUE
6/22/2015 3:09 AM
(b) qualifies for coverage under the Company’s stated practices respecting marriage and domestic partnerships when the same-sex domestic partner attains age 65 for purposes of Medicare and thereafter.
The Company reserves its right to change, suspend, or terminate the New Arrangements in any manner and for any reason in its sole discretion, subject to the following:
a.	The Company will continue the New Arrangements for Eligible Retirees, Eligible Spouses, and Eligible Domestic Partners (collectively, the “Affected Population,” each of whom must satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth above no later than June 23, 2019) through June 23, 2019; and
b.	After June 23, 2019, no change by the Company to the New Arrangements will adversely affect any individual in the Affected Population before the date that is four (4) years after the individual’s eligibility date (as described below), except to the extent (i) necessary to ensure that the total per-capita annual cost to the Company of continuing the New Arrangements for the Affected Population (including costs of benefits, administrative costs, and tax costs related to the New Arrangements) does not exceed the Company’s total per-capita cost to provide the New Arrangements to the Affected Population for the 2016 plan year by more than 20%, or (ii) appropriate to reflect material changes in the structure of the Medicare program or other government-sponsored healthcare programs available to post-65 individuals. For purposes of this paragraph, an individual’s “eligibility date” is the date the individual reaches age 65 for purposes of Medicare.
Individuals who do not meet the criteria set forth above shall not be eligible for any post-65 retiree healthcare benefits.
The New Arrangements
RRA
The RRA is a notional credit provided by GE that Eligible Participants can use to reimburse eligible health care premiums and expenses (as described below). Each calendar plan year, if the Eligible Participant is enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug and/or Medicare supplemental plan through OneExchange, GE will apply a credit to the RRA. The credit for a full plan year (twelve (12) months) is $1,000 per Eligible Participant. The RRA does not accrue interest or other earnings of any kind, and can be used to reimburse the following two types of expenses:
Page 44 of 88
IUE
6/22/2015 3:09 AM
•	Premiums for Medicare prescription drug (Part D) and/or supplemental plans (Medigap, Medicare Advantage, or HMO) purchased through OneExchange; and
•	Out-of-pocket eligible medical costs—i.e., the portion participant owes after Medicare and the participant’s supplemental plan pay their share—but not drug costs.
GEPAF
The GEPAF provides catastrophic coverage for prescription drugs and is intended to supplement coverage under a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan. If a Medicare-covered individual’s true out-of-pocket costs (within the meaning of the Medicare Part D program) reach a threshold for catastrophic coverage established by Medicare ($4,850 for 2016), his/her Medicare prescription drug plan generally pays the full cost of his/her prescription drugs except for a set fee or coinsurance for which the participant is responsible. The amount the participant is responsible for is generally the greater of a set fee (for 2016, the fee is $2.95 for generic drugs and $7.40 for brand-name drugs) or 5% coinsurance for eligible drug purchases for the remainder of the year. If an Eligible Participant is enrolled in a Medicare prescription drug and/or Medicare supplemental plan through a private Medicare exchange specified by the Company in its sole discretion (e.g., OneExchange) for a calendar plan year, and that Eligible Participant’s true out-of-pocket prescription drug costs reach the catastrophic threshold for that year ($4,850 for 2016), the GEPAF will cover 100% of the Eligible Participant’s fees and coinsurance above that threshold for eligible prescription drugs for the remainder of that year.
‘References to OneExchange may be changed to another private health care exchange/concierge service.
VI.	Retiree Life
Amend the Plan to modify Company provided life insurance coverage for employees who retire on or after January 1, 2016. For purposes of this Section an employee is an individual, who as of June 22, 2015, is an hourly or non-exempt salaried production employee currently eligible for life insurance in retirement.
There is no change to life insurance in retirement for any employees who retire prior to January 1, 2016.
For employees who retire between January 1, 2016 and June 23, 2019, Company provided life insurance in retirement will reduce to $15,000 or, if currently less than $15,000 shall remain unchanged. For employees who retire after June 23, 2019, Company provided life insurance in retirement will be reduced to zero.

VII.	OTHER PROGRAMS
A.	First Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program for Active Hourly and Nonexempt Salaried Employees
Employees electing to participate in this First Incentive Program must be hourly or nonexempt salaried employees on the active payroll of a company participating in the GE Pension Plan and must be at least age 60 with 10 or more years of continuous service by the date of termination. Both represented employees and non-represented employees are eligible to participate in this First Incentive Program.
In the case of represented employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement which expires on June 21, 2015, however, this First Incentive Program shall be unavailable to such employees and such employees shall be ineligible to participate in this First Incentive Program unless their bargaining unit representative has ratified the agreement providing for this First Incentive Program on or before the date set forth in the applicable Memorandum of Settlement. In the case of represented employees under a collective bargaining agreement expiring after June 21, 2015 and before August 1, 2015, eligibility for such employees is conditioned on ratification occurring within ten (10) days of such agreement’s termination date.
Eligible employees electing this First Incentive Program must apply during an election period to be established in the future by the Company in its sole discretion and must elect to voluntarily terminate from active employment on February 29, 2016.
In the event the number of electing employees eligible for this First Incentive Program after application of the above provisions (the “Eligible Employees”) exceeds 500, only 500 Eligible Employees may participate. Priority to receive benefits under the First Incentive Program shall be given to those Eligible Employees who have been credited with the longest Pension Benefit Service within the meaning of the GE Pension Plan (whole and fractional years) as of December 31, 2015 taking into consideration all Eligible Employees. For this purpose, in the event an Eligible Employee had been reemployed, his Pension Benefit Service shall include any prior service which had been restored as Pension Benefit Service no later than December 31, 2015, except that if he is in the process of repaying any pre-1989 contributions with interest, such amounts must be repaid in full to the GE Pension Plan no later than February 12, 2016 in order for such prior service to be considered. In addition, Pension Benefit Service shall include any credited service under a prior plan (e.g., RCA) that has been merged into the GE Pension Plan. In the case there is a tie among two or more Eligible Employees by virtue of being credited with identical Pension Benefit Service as so determined
Page 46 of 88
IUE
6/22/2015 3:09 AM
as of December 31, 2015, the Eligible Employee with the earliest date and time of birth shall have priority to receive the benefit provided by this First Incentive Program.
The benefit provided under this First Incentive Program will consist of a single lump-sum payment equal to 75% of the Participant’s “Annual Wage.”
“Annual Wage” is determined for hourly employees by multiplying the employee’s regular hourly wage rate as of the date of termination of employment by 2080. For hourly employees regularly assigned to a shift that includes a night shift differential as of the date of termination of employment, the regular hourly wage rate shall include an .applicable percentage of the employee’s night shift differential based on the portion of regularly scheduled working time attributable to such shift. For pieceworkers, the Annual Wage is determined by multiplying the employee’s average earnings in his position as of the date of termination of employment (as determined from the then most recent periodic earnings statistics and expressed as an hourly rate) by 2080. For nonexempt salaried employees, the Annual Wage is the employee’s annual base salary as of the date of termination of employment, plus any applicable percentage of night shift differential determined in accordance with the above principles for hourly employees. The Annual Wage does not include overtime, extra service payments or any other additional payments.
The lump-sum payment (net of applicable tax withholdings) shall be made as soon as practicable following termination of employment, but in no event later than March 31, 2016.
The lump-sum payment is not creditable compensation under any of the GE benefit plans, including (but not limited to) the GE Retirement Savings Plan and the GE Pension Plan.
Participants in the First Incentive Program will not have any recall rights and are ineligible for any benefits associated with job loss or lack of work, including (but not limited to) the special voluntary layoff bonus, special retirement bonus, income extension aid, plant closing benefits, transfer of work benefits, and severance payments.
Participation in this First Incentive Program is entirely independent of a Participant’s election to commence or not to commence benefits under the GE Pension Plan or any other company plan.

6/22/2015 3:09 AM
All obligations under the First Incentive Program shall be paid from the general assets of the company.

(4)	An employee assigned temporarily as a group leader over Service Center employees on work outside the Service Center on customers' premises is currently paid in accordance with Article VI, Section 5(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of that Section, such an employee while on such outside work shall be paid at a rate three steps, rather than two steps, above the rate referred to in that Section.
(5)	Where a local travel and living expense agreement has been reached which provides for "reasonable expenses for meals," the meal allowance for breakfast, lunch and dinner shall be at a rate not less than thirtv-eiqhtfortv-two dollars ($334)042 00) per day now and forty-four ($40.0044,00) per day beginning June 20. 2013.22, 2017.

Where employees are assigned to outside work requiring overnight lodging, local Agreement will provide for a minimum of two telephone calls home per week.
In those cases where employees are assigned to outside work for extended periods where overnight lodging is required, local travel and living expense agreements may provide for a per diem expense arrangement in lieu of any meal allowance, reimbursement of lodging and other expenses (except mileage reimbursement) incurred by the employee as a result of the assignment. This per diem rate shall be equal to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) per diem for assignments within the United States.

Living Agreement, such employee will receive not less than the equivalent of four hours pay at his straight time rate for both Saturday and Sunday if no work is available for such days.
When an employee conducts outside work for three or more consecutive weeks and is unable to return home while on that assignment, upon return home, the employee shall be entitled to take one day off without pay within the first five following working days following the employee’s return. The specific day of the week to be taken off by the employee must be approved by local management.
(6)	The Company will replace, for employees designated by the manager as requiring tools, certain personal tools which are
(a)	lost as a result of theft on the job where the work is performed outside of the shop on the customer's premises and where forced entry is evident or
(b)	broken on the job not as a result of employee negligence or normal wear.
Employees will be responsible to provide, on a Company form, an inventory of personal tools required on their job. The replacement will apply only to tools inventoried and approved by the foreman or manager in advance and will be made only to the extent the loss is not covered by insurance or by the vendor. The replacement may be made, at the Company's option, by either supplying the employee with new or used comparable tools or by reimbursing the employee for the purchase of comparable tools. Reimbursement will be made only after the employee produces sufficient documentation of the cost of the replacement.
(7)	Employees will be reimbursed up to a maximum of $325350 annually for the purchase of job-related tools and equipment. Employees will also be reimbursed up to $225250 annually toward the purchase of mandatory safety shoes and other approved personal protective equipment. Such reimbursement will be made only if approved prior to purchase and upon adequate documentation of purchase(s).

Competitiveness and Growth Committees in Article XXII, Section 6(b) of the GE-IUE/CWA, AFL-CIO, CLC National Agreement may have job preservation issues in common that would justify the establishment of a job competitiveness and growth committee for service shops. The Company and the Union agree to form such a committee that would meet annually at a location designated by the Company.
(9)	The Company shall continue to make the provisions of this Agreement available to such employees until the 245l23nd day of June, 204-52019 and from year to year thereafter, unless not more than ninety and not less than sixty days prior to such date, or any anniversary thereof, the Company shall notify the Union in writing of its intention to discontinue making such provisions available to such employees upon such date or anniversary date.

RE: VRIP
Gentlemen,
During our negotiations over the 2015-2019 GE/IUE collective bargaining agreement, we reached an agreement to allow certain represented and other employees to elect to participate in a Voluntary Retirement Incentive Program (“VRIP”). The parties reached an agreement to conduct two VRIPS, one in the first quarter of 2016 for 500 volunteers, and one in the first quarter of 2018 for 500 volunteers. These numbers are aggregate numbers for the eligible GE population, not specific to IUE employees.
While the essential benefit provided by this VRIP Program generally reflects the benefits provided under previous local VRIPs, the description in the Memorandum of Settlement provides some additional terms that are necessary for this VRIP opportunity to be administered on a Company-wide basis, consistent with our agreement.
Sincerely,
John Gritti GE Labor Relations

Gentlemen:
Company management has decided to recommend to GE’s Board of Directors a onetime pension increase for eligible retirees under the GE Pension Plan. The increase would be to the lifetime pensions of participants who retired directly from the Company on or before December 1,2005 with a normal, optional or disability pension under the GE Pension Plan. Vestees who started their pensions under the GE Pension Plan during the same time frame after the completion of at least 25 years of qualifying service will also be eligible for the increase. Former GE executives, however, will not receive the increase. In addition, individuals receiving payments attributable to the GE Pension Plan solely under a group annuity contract issued by MetLife will not receive the increase.
The increase would apply to pension payments made to eligible participants on or after December 1, 2015. The amount of the recommended increase will be based on the eligible participant’s last retirement date under the GE Pension Plan as shown in Exhibit A.
In the event an eligible participant described above has died and his surviving spouse began receiving a lifetime survivor benefit on or before December 1, 2015, that lifetime survivor benefit will also be increased, again starting as of December 1, 2015. The amount of the increase will be based on the eligible participant’s last retirement date under the GE Pension Plan. For eligible spouses receiving a 100% survivor benefit, the recommended increase will be the amount shown in the table in Exhibit A. For eligible spouses receiving a 75% survivor benefit, the recommended increase will be the amount shown in the table in Exhibit B. For eligible spouses receiving a 50% survivor benefit, the recommended increase will be the amount shown in the table in Exhibit C.

IUE
6/22/2015 3:09 AM
If a participant would have been eligible for the increase as described above except that he died before retirement and such participant’s spouse commenced receiving a preretirement survivor annuity on or before December 1, 2005, that lifetime 50% survivor benefit will also be eligible for an increase beginning December 1, 2015. The amount of the recommended increase will be based on the commencement date of the preretirement survivor annuity as shown in the table in Exhibit C.
This letter describes the basic framework of the potential pension increase. Additional details and conditions will be stipulated in the plan document as approved by the Board of Directors or its delegate.
As you know, the Company is not required to bargain with the union over retiree increases and related survivor benefits. Nonetheless, the Company has listened to your concerns in this area. We trust that this initiative demonstrates the goodwill that has characterized our negotiations.
Very truly yours,
Greg Capito
