A.	General Principles
1.	Community college faculty members, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognize the special responsibilities placed upon them in promoting the educational goals and well being of students. To this end, faculty members demonstrate respect for the student as an individual, and adhere to their proper roles as intellectual guides and mentors. They avoid any exploitation of students for private advantage and they promote educational achievement in a supportive and safe environment.
2.	The District and AFT will work cooperatively to promote and maintain a climate of free, impartial, and responsible inquiry and discussion. In order to realize the educational advantages offered by this climate, the District and AFT will actively seek to maintain a teaching and
learning environment that is free of sexual harassment, discrimination, or abusive conduct.
3.	Faculty accept the obligation to exercise critical self-discipline and judgment in using, extending and transmitting knowledge. Faculty shall abide by the duties and responsibilities set forth herein.
B.	Faculty Responsibilities Under District Policies, Rules, and Regulations Faculty shall abide by applicable provisions of the Faculty Handbook, District Policy Manual, and District Rules and Regulations except as modified herein. This paragraph shall not be read as waiving AFT’s or a faculty member’s statutory right(s) or right(s) under this Agreement.
If a faculty member is disciplined pursuant to this Article, Article 10 of the Agreement will govern.
C.	Academic Freedom
1.	The District and AFT are unequivocally and unalterably committed to the principle of academic freedom in its true sense which includes freedom to study, freedom to learn and freedom to teach and provide educational professional services to students.
2.	Academic freedom encompasses the right of an instructor to discuss in the classroom relevant and controversial subjects consistent with the course outline, and for counselors, librarians and other academic employees to provide relevant and appropriate student services.
3.	Interference with or censure of an academic employee by District officials or by outside individuals or groups because of the faculty member’s introduction of relevant and controversial subjects or provision of relevant and appropriate
ARTICLE 8 ACADEMIC FREEDOM, DUTIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES 8.C.3 - 8.D.3.1 AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 educational professional services to students is precluded by the principle of academic freedom.
4.	The parties acknowledge the fundamental need to protect faculty from censorship or restraint which might interfere with their obligation to pursue truth in the performance of their teaching or other educational functions. The rights of academic freedom and freedom of expression apply to the reasonable use of District computing resources, including e-mail and internet access. This subsection 8.C.4 is subject to reopener negotiations in accordance with the February 2005 side letter between the parties regarding the Policy Proposal for Electronic Communications and Information Technology. Faculty cannot, however, expect academic freedom to be unlimited, for the right to exercise any liberty implies a duty to use it responsibly. Academic freedom does not give faculty freedom to engage in indoctrination. Nor can faculty invoke the principle of academic freedom to justify non-professional conduct.
D.	Faculty-Student Relationships
1.	Principles
1.1	The power differential inherent in faculty-student relationships may compromise the student’s or the faculty member’s ability to make decisions and may call into question whether the relationship is welcome.
1.2	A conflict of interest is presumed in situations involving an amorous/sexual relationship between faculty and students for whom they have educational responsibility.
1.3	. Amorous/sexual relationships involving faculty and students may also give rise to a perception on the part of others that the evaluative capacity of the faculty member has been compromised and create an appearance of favoritism.
2.	Definition: An amorous/sexual relationship exists when two persons as consenting partners (a) have a sexual relationship or (b) engage in romantic partnering or courtship that may or may not include a sexual relationship.
3.	Policy:
3.1	Amorous/sexual relationships between faculty and students currently enrolled in a course being taught by the faculty member or who is under the supervision or direction or receiving counseling, library or instructional assistance services of the faculty member are potentially exploitative and should therefore be avoided. In such situations (and others that cannot be anticipated) serious
ARTICLE 8 ACADEMIC FREEDOM, DUTIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES 8.D.3.1 - 8.F AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 21 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 conflicts of interest, discipline, and/or potential legal liability could result.
3.2	Because a conflict of interest is presumed in situations which involve or have involved (within the last four (4) years) an amorous/sexual relationship between faculty and students for whom they have educational responsibility, the faculty member shall request that the department chairperson, dean, or immediate supervisor arrange for alternative evaluation procedures, or alternative provision of services, which may include the oversight of existing evaluative procedures. Evaluation procedures include grading, rewarding, or penalizing of a student, or providing academic references or job references for a student. The department chairperson, dean, or immediate supervisor shall not ask, nor shall the faculty member be required to disclose to them, the reason for the request. The District will advise its
department chairpersons, deans and immediate supervisors of faculty of the need to maintain confidentiality except on a need-to-know basis.
4.	Avoid Amorous Relationships Where No Evaluative Relationship Exists: Amorous/sexual relationships between faculty and students in situations where there is no evaluative educational responsibility are discouraged. Relationships that the parties currently view as welcome may be subsequently viewed as exploitative. In such situations (and others that cannot be anticipated) serious conflicts of interest, discipline, and/or potential legal liability could result.
5.	Friendships or mentoring relationships which are not amorous/sexual relationships are not discouraged.
E.	Information to Students
For pedagogical reasons, faculty members may decide that it is necessary to use course materials that some students may find offensive. When course materials and/or presentations include explicit representations or language which may reasonably be viewed by responsible educators as offensive, shocking or obscene, a faculty member should give students adequate information to enable the students to determine whether to enroll or remain enrolled in the class. This information should be provided in writing and may be provided in course syllabi, lists of readings and other course materials or instructional aids provided to the student.
F.	Textbook Selection
The College shall develop a procedure for the selection of textbooks that recognizes the basic right and duty of the faculty to be the primary agent in the process. Since students in most instances must purchase books, the procedure should take cognizance of the financial burden that may be imposed	upon	the	student.
ARTICLE 8 ACADEMIC FREEDOM, DUTIES, AND RESPONSIBILITIES 8.G - 8.1.1.3 AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 22 1 234567891011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
G.	Selection of Library Materials
The library faculty, as a part of the educational program, shall have the same freedoms guaranteed the teaching faculty and students and shall choose books and other resources based on their interest, information and potential for enlightenment of students. So far as practical, books and other resources will be selected to present all points of view concerning the problems and issues of our times, international, national, and local. No books shall be excluded because of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, ethnic group identification, ancestry, marital status, age, physical or mental disability or the political or philosophical views of the writer.
H.	Improper Influence
The selection of textbooks, library books and other resources must be free of improper influence by publishers or manufacturers and no employee
may accept anything of value from publishers or manufacturers for the purpose of influencing the selection of any textbook, library books or other educational resource. The acceptance of a desk copy of a textbook by an employee which he/she may consider using in his/her course shall be allowable.
I.	Conflict of Interest
1.	A faculty member shall not engage in any employment, enterprise or other activity which interferes with or prevents the faculty member from carrying out his/her assigned duties and professional responsibilities or official CCSF business, including:
1.1	Unreasonable or excessive use of District time, facilities, equipment, or supplies, including District computing resources, for purposes other than the performance of their assigned duties and professional responsibilities or official CCSF business. The District provides computing resources for use as academic professionals and for business use as District representatives, and not for personal, financial or other gain. Reasonable personal use of District computing resources is permitted when it does not consume a significant amount of those resources and does not interfere with the performance of the user’s job or other District responsibilities. This subsection 8.1.1.1 is subject to reopener negotiations in accordance with the February 2005 side letter between the parties regarding the Policy Proposal for Electronic Communications and Information Technology.
1.2	Performing CCSF assigned duties and professional responsibilities as a private service for compensation other than	District	salary.

This provision is not intended in any way to prevent faculty from requiring the use of their own textbooks or other instructional materials in their classes, in accordance with existing practices, policies and procedures for the adoption of texts and other instructional materials.
1.4	Authorizing other persons to engage in the above forms of selling (see Section 1.3) in the faculty member’s classroom or at any District-sponsored event supervised by a faculty member.
1.5	Claiming to speak or act or creating the false impression that one speaks or acts on behalf of the District without authorization by the District.
2.	Authorization — A faculty member who is engaging in or plans to engage in any employment, activity, or enterprise which interferes with or prevents him/her from carrying out his/her assigned duties and professional responsibilities as a District employee, should obtain the prior approval of the Chancellor.
J.	Tutoring
No faculty member shall give private lessons or instruction for pay to any student who is a member of the class in which the faculty member is employed; nor shall such faculty member use a room or building of the District for the purpose of giving private lessons or instructions for pay.
K.	Determination of Grades
1.	A faculty member shall maintain the exclusive right and responsibility to determine grades based upon his/her professional judgment. The determination of the student's grade by the instructor, in the absence of mistake, fraud, bad faith, or incompetency shall be final.
2.	Instructors are responsible for providing the District with copies of accurate grade reports, grade books, attendance records, unreturned class examinations or term papers, and any other method of student evaluation promptly upon request. A grade book refers to the composite record kept by the instructor of a student’s performance including grades or scores which are used by the instructor as his/her basis for the midterm and final grades. Instructors shall retain grade books, unreturned final examinations, term papers, and any other method of evaluation for three years. Instructors who are not returning to the District are required to leave grade books, attendance records, and academic performance material, i.e., final examinations etc. with their department chairperson.

In the event that a faculty member claims that he or she need not disclose or turn over true and correct copies and/or the original(s) of grade books, unreturned student exams, unreturned term papers, or any other method of student evaluation, the Union shall support the District’s efforts to obtain such documents promptly.
L.	Student Records
Faculty shall not use their faculty status or position to solicit personal student information, such as marital status, identity of spouse, or work address for their personal use. Faculty may ask but shall not require students to share relevant directory information, such as name and telephone number, with the faculty member and/or with other students to facilitate course objectives.
M.	Grades/Census Sheets/PARS
AFT and the Board agree that it is important to have all grades, census sheets and PARS returned by the deadline dates to make grades available for students and departments and to report enrollment and attendance to the State. AFT and the Board agree to work cooperatively with each other to encourage that faculty comply with report deadlines. Without this cooperation, not only do students and the educational program suffer, but the District has to waste money on late manual processing of reports and also loses State funding for future classes.
N.	Eavesdropping & Monitoring
1.	Except with the specific consent of the faculty member involved, work stations shall be free from mechanisms, mechanical and electronic, by means of which management shall be able to listen to or record procedures in said work station. For purposes of this provision, faculty work stations may include desktop and laptop computers which may or may not be the property of the District, and telephone voice mail. The District does not and shall not monitor individual usage of its computing resources, including e-mail accounts, internet usage or data created by individuals, except as provided herein.
2.	Under special circumstances, the District may monitor the activity and accounts of users of District computing resources, including login sessions and the content of individual communications, with or without notice, when:
2.1	required by law
2.2	necessary to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of District or other computing resources
2.3	necessary to protect the District from criminal or civil liability
2.4	there is sufficient and reasonable cause to believe that (a) the user has violated or is violating this policy or other District policies/

3.	Except in the event of such special circumstances as documented by the Chancellor or Vice Chancellor (such as imminent system crashes, excessive network bandwidth usage, internal or external denial-of-service attacks), any monitoring or examination of individual accounts, usage, content or hardware shall not occur unless it has been approved in advance by the appropriate Vice Chancellor, with notification to the affected employee(s), unless the Vice Chancellor concludes that good cause exists to refrain from immediately notifying the employee. Good cause may exist, e.g., in the event of an ongoing investigation into misconduct; when the District has a reasonable basis to believe that disclosure could result in destruction of evidence or retaliation against other persons; or when employees are not readily available to receive notice. A joint labor-management work group augmented with representation of the Chairperson of the ITPC or his/her designee shall serve as a resource in defining appropriate standards and procedures regarding “special circumstances” and “good cause” based on case-by-case assessment and discussion after the fact, with appropriate confidentiality afforded to the identity of the employee(s) involved.
0.	Public Forums
In keeping with the philosophy of intellectual freedom and the responsibility of the Community College District for services to its community, public forums presenting speakers with varying points of view may be offered to the local community as part of the educational program.
P.	Illegal Drugs and Alcohol - The campuses of City College of San Francisco are drug-free. The College does not allow the unlawful possession, use or distribution of illegal drugs and alcohol by faculty on its property or as part of its activities, whether on or off campus.
Q.	Field Trips - Field trips required as a regular part of the instruction in a course must be mandated in the course description in the College Catalog. Advance written notice of such trips must be given to the department chairperson and to the appropriate dean, including a statement of reasonably exact times and places so that students may be reached in case of emergency. It is also important that the Director of Administrative Services be notified in advance of field trips so that the District’s insurance carrier can be notified. Although permission for such field trips is almost always granted, it is not automatic; hence, instructors should provide notice sufficiently so that the advisability of modifying plans to avoid conflict within the instructional schedule or for other reasons can be discussed.

4.1	Self Evaluation with Peer Review (for regular full-time tenured faculty)
4.1.1	Self evaluation shall be completed on the appropriate forms. If departments elect to add questions, the questions must be approved by the Union and the District. The completed self evaluations shall be submitted to the appropriate Dean/Director/designee by the deadlines provided in the Evaluation Calendar. The completed self evaluations shall then be forwarded to the chairs of the evaluation committees.
4.1.2	The peer evaluators shall be selected in the manner provided in Section 4.2.
4.1.3	If an evaluatee fails to complete and submit a signed self evaluation when due, the Chancellor/designee may require a Peer-Management evaluation to be conducted. Such failure to complete and submit a self evaluation shall be documented and placed in the evaluatee’s personnel file.
4.1.4	If the peer evaluators determine the self evaluation and other materials are acceptable, the evaluatee shall be so notified, and the self evaluation shall be turned in to the appropriate administrator with indication of approval.
4.1.4.1	If the Peer evaluators identify problems in the self evaluation which might be remedied by revising the document, the evaluatee shall be notified as soon as possible and given two weeks to submit a revision. If the revision is acceptable, the evaluatee shall be so notified, and the self evaluation shall be turned in to the appropriate administrator with indication of	approval.

The peer committee evaluators shall use an official form to notify the evaluatee of its recommendation to the Chancellor. The evaluatee must sign the form to indicate he/she has received notice of the committee’s decision and its written criticism of the self evaluation. This signed recognition does not imply acceptance of the recommendation of the committee. The evaluatee may submit written objections to the conclusion of the peers. If the Administration decides to proceed with re-evaluation, the evaluation must take place not later than the subsequent semester according to the provisions of 9.B.2.
4.1.6	Self evaluation may be elected by an evaluatee only one time within a six-year period.
4.1.7	The self evaluation, supporting documents, and reports of the evaluating committee shall be retained in the employee’s Personnel File in the manner that all evaluations are kept.

If the services of full-time faculty
members are not needed within a department, the names of these faculty members shall be sent to the appropriate administrator or designee. The administrator or designee may then assign these faculty members to do evaluations in departments where there are not sufficient evaluators or to do evaluations for those faculty who have requested an evaluator from outside the discipline or department. A department chair or supervisor may serve as a peer evaluator if there are not sufficient peer evaluators in the department and if the evaluatee gives written permission when he/she selects a method of evaluation. This does not preclude said department chair/supervisor from serving as a management designee in a subsequent evaluation of that faculty member or of any other faculty member.

4.2.2	The manager/designee shall select two or three peer evaluators, as appropriate. Wherever possible, teams shall represent the diversity of California and be sensitive to affirmative action concerns (Ed. Code §87663(d) and see also Article 4). Where possible, the evaluators shall be from the same or a related department as the evaluatee. The evaluatee may elect to have one of the evaluators be from another discipline or department. The evaluatee shall have the right, within three days of receipt of the notification, without stating cause, to make up to three (3) disqualifications, in writing, from those originally selected. The evaluators shall not be notified until the challenge period has passed. The manager/designee shall select a chair of the evaluating team. The chair of the evaluating team shall have the responsibility of facilitating the evaluation process and obtaining proper signatures, when necessary.
4.2.2.1	No faculty member may serve as an evaluator for a faculty member and also be evaluated by that same faculty member in the same semester. This provision may be waived by the appropriate Dean/Director.
4.2.2.2	Except as provided in this section (4.2.2.2), the two- (2) member evaluation team
shall follow the same evaluation procedures as a three- (3) member team.
In the event that the two- (2) member evaluation team is unable to agree on the overall evaluation rating, the evaluators will endeavor to reach a consensus in consultation with the Dean responsible for faculty evaluation. In their attempt to reach consensus, the evaluators may, if time allows, conduct a second classroom or work site visitation(s). Thereafter, if the evaluators are unable to reach a consensus evaluation, the evaluation will be deemed incomplete. The evaluate will undergo peer evaluation by a three-person team in the following semester, no member of which shall have served on the previous two- (2) member evaluation	team.

The evaluators shall repeat the classroom or work site visitation(s) within ten (10) working days after the post-evaluation conference. If, as a result of the second visitation(s), the evaluation cannot be completed within the Evaluation Calendar, Section 9.A.4, above, such time limits shall be waived.
4.2.8	Within two (2) working days after the videotaping of a class or other activity, the evaluatee shall have the option of requesting regular observation in lieu of having the videotape viewed by the evaluators. If, after viewing the videotape of the class or activity, the evaluators anticipate writing an unfavorable or unsatisfactory evaluation report, the evaluators shall so inform the evaluatee at the post-evaluation conference. Within ten (10) working days after the post-evaluation conference, the evaluators shall conduct formal classroom or work site visitations.

3.1	Tenure Review Committees shall evaluate contract employees and make recommendations to the Board of Trustees concerning tenure and/or retention in contract status.
3.2	The Tenure Review Committees shall ordinarily consist of four faculty members and the immediate supervisor of the contract employee. The immediate supervisor is the lowest level non-bargaining unit member who has supervision over the employee. A department of eight tenured faculty members or fewer may choose to use only two faculty members and the immediate supervisor of the contract employee, or it may choose to function as a committee-of-the-whole, provided that the committee-of-the-whole has at least three members, including the supervisor. All faculty
members of the Tenure Review Committees must be tenured.
3.2.1	The immediate supervisor shall select the faculty members in consultation with the chairperson of the Hiring Committee which interviewed the contract employee. If the chairperson of the Hiring Committee is not available, the supervisor will consult with one or more members of the Hiring Committee. Service on the committee shall be voluntary. If the supervisor is unable to recruit the required number of faculty members from volunteers within the department, he/she shall endeavor to remedy the situation by seeking a committee member(s) from a related discipline. If the supervisor cannot find a faculty member(s) in a related discipline, he/she shall inform the Vice Chancellor/ designee, who shall have the authority to select a volunteer(s), district-wide, to achieve the required number.
3.2.2	The supervisor shall endeavor to represent the diversity of California in his/her appointments. No Tenure Review committee shall consist of all men or all women or be all of the same ethnicity. If the immediate supervisor cannot achieve this balance from volunteers within the department, he/she shall endeavor to remedy the situation by seeking a committee member(s) from a related discipline. If the supervisor cannot find a faculty member(s) in a related discipline, he/she shall inform the Vice Chancellor/designee, who shall have the authority to select a volunteer(s), district-wide, to achieve the proper ethnic or gender balance.

Whenever a member of the Tenure Review Committee resigns, or retires, or takes a leave of absence of more than one year, the supervisor will appoint a replacement according to the original appointment procedures. Whenever a
member of the Tenure Review Committee takes a leave for one year or less, the supervisor will appoint a replacement for the duration of the leave according to the original appointment procedures.

Once the District has adopted the Plan, the committee shall follow the goals and timetables in the Plan in evaluating candidates who are equally qualified under the criteria of Section B.3 and shall make every effort to ensure that the finalist(s) to be presented to the Chancellor meet(s) the needs reflected in the District's Plan.
6.	Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Article, once the District has adopted the Plan, preference between candidates who are otherwise equal shall go to those candidates who fulfill the goals and timetables of the Plan. If, in applying the criteria in Section B.3, the screening/interviewing committee concludes that an outside candidate and an inside candidate who are otherwise equal both fulfill the Plan goals and timetables, the inside candidate shall have first consideration.

D.	Arbitration Standards and Confidentiality
1.	The selection of the District’s work force for hire and promotion inherently requires the District to apply judgment and discretion regarding the relative qualifications of applicants. The Union has an interest in monitoring the District’s compliance with its obligations under Article 12. In the event of a dispute regarding Article 12, if the Union, after reviewing any grievances over the District’s application of the criteria of Article 12.B as well as information provided by the District, seeks arbitration, the parties agree that the appropriate standards of review are:
1.1	Did the District in fact apply the Article 12 criteria and/or procedure? If not, did the District’s conduct prejudice the grievant and what remedy is appropriate?
1.2	Was the District unreasonable in exercising its discretion and judgment in applying the Article 12 criteria?
2.	The Union agrees to uphold and protect the confidentiality of committee processes and procedures at the level of the President, Chancellor and Board of Trustees. In the event of a grievance alleging a violation of Article 12, the District shall, upon the Union’s request, promptly provide to the Union such information which can be legally disclosed, which is relevant and necessary to enable the Union to evaluate the grievance intelligently. The Union pledges not to disclose information regarding candidates to any other person except as is essential for the Union to evaluate the grievance.
E.	Pay and fringe benefits based on the load following the upgrading process shall be granted in accordance with Articles 20 and 21, Compensation and Fringe Benefits.
F.	Full-time positions designated to be filled by Long Term Substitutes shall, whenever possible, be filled in accordance with this Article.

2.	In the credit and noncredit program where it is determined and approved by management to be in the best interests of the educational program (instructional, counseling or librarian), a less than five day (i.e. four or three day) a week schedule shall be
permitted. The primary intent of this provision is to provide an incentive for voluntary acceptance of evening, weekend, or split assignments.
3.	Wherever possible, employees shall be notified in writing of their initial assignments at least four (4) weeks in advance of the assignments becoming effective.
B.	Assignment
1.	Assignments shall be made considering qualifications, affirmative action (See Article 4), seniority, job performance, special job-related skills and the needs of the District.
2.	Assignments of both full-time and temporary part-time employees will be made, where possible, on a semester basis.
3.	Assignments shall be made after consultation, wherever possible, prior to any new assignment at more than one site or campus.

A faculty member who owes units (or hours) will be assigned sufficient extra load courses without pay until deficiencies are balanced, or, at the option of the faculty member, he/she shall have his/her salary reduced proportionately to balance part or all of the existing deficit.
6.2	In cases where it is necessary to teach more units than those owed or required to balance the deficit, the faculty member shall have the option of being paid for such additional hours over the deficit, or taking a reduced load within the following three (3) semesters.
6.3	Full-time faculty members who are granted a high enrollment multiplier for classes exceeding an enrollment of 60 students may elect to have the additional teaching units credited as regular load or may elect to receive extra pay.
6.4	The District may in its sole discretion, at the beginning of any semester, wait until the end of the add/drop period; until after two (2) meetings of an evening class (whichever is later) in the credit program; or wait until the end of two (2) weeks in the noncredit program prior to canceling a class due to low enrollment where exceptional circumstances at the normal time of cancellation (first week) create a reasonable likelihood of maintaining the class due to an increase in enrollment. Any such decision shall be on an individual case by case appraisal by management. Any such decision(s) are non-precedent setting and are non-grievable.
7.	Split Assignments
7.1	Except where specifically requested by full-time faculty, split assignments shall be avoided for full-time faculty except to fulfill District needs.
7.2	Where split assignments occur, volunteers will be first considered.
7.3	Management will, where feasible, rotate any such split assignment on a semester basis.
8.	Upon advance approval of the Dean/Director, a prior arrangement between the District and a faculty member may be undertaken not to cancel a probable low-enrollment specialized course, or advanced classes in sequence, required within a degree program.
9.	Upon written request, the District will provide Union with the print-out provided management concerning class cancellations. Such printout will be provided at the same time as distribution to management.

C.	Reassignment - A reassignment is a subsequent change in a full-time employee's initial assignment for part of a load or part of a semester not covered in Article 14.C (Emergency Transfer).
1.	Management will solicit and make reasonable effort to find qualified volunteers prior to an involuntary reassignment, except where cancellation of classes or changes in program occur either prior to the beginning of a semester, or in the credit program prior to completion of the first census week, or in the noncredit program within four (4) weeks of the beginning of a class in the semester.
2.	Reassignments shall not be made arbitrarily or capriciously; where requested in writing, the full-time employee shall be furnished, in writing, reason(s) for the involuntary reassignment.
3.	Employee requests for voluntary reassignment shall be granted with mutual agreement between the District and the faculty member.
D.	A part-time faculty member who has taught in the District at a particular load for at least four semesters and is not able to complete his/her assignment due to illness, personal emergency or death in the immediate family, will be given first consideration to return to the same workload when conditions permit, upon his/her written request.
E.	When the services of a part-time faculty member are terminated for reasons other than lack of an available class assignment, such faculty member shall, upon written request made within 20 work days after notice of termination, receive a written statement of the reasons for termination. Reasons for termination may be appealed to the Provost and, if not satisfactorily resolved, then to the Chancellor or designee for final decision.
F.	Full-time faculty members with split site assignments, exclusive of extra-pay overload, shall be reimbursed, in accordance with past practice, for approved expenditures of mileage, garage parking, bus/streetcar fares and bridge tolls, provided the employee submits the District "Field Expense Form" accompanied by all receipts prior to the fifth (5th) day of the month following the month in which the expenses were incurred.

Employee Relations Department, on behalf of the District, and by the Union, on behalf of all faculty within the discipline or subject area.
A.	Reemployment Preference - If, at the time of original assignment, there is a reduction in the number of hours available to a currently employed temporary, part-time faculty member, then, within the faculty member's department or subject area, hours shall be reassigned to temporary, parttime faculty according to their seniority provided the following requirements are met:
1.	Minimum Qualifications - The faculty member must possess the State determined minimum qualifications, or their formally granted equivalent, in the discipline or subject area of every course or nonclassroom activity to which he or she is assigned.
1.1	Previously Granted Credentials - No mention of minimum qualifications herein shall disqualify a faculty member who has been teaching or serving under a previously granted credential.
2.	Assignment Preference Form
2.1	In order to receive re-employment preference, temporary, parttime faculty must submit an assignment preference form prior to the time of original assignment.
3.	Prior Assignment
3.1	Credit Courses and Noncredit DSP&S, Older Adults, Health and Safety, and Vocational Courses - For credit assignments, and noncredit assignments in DSP&S, Older Adults and vocational courses, every assignment must be to a course taught at least once within the last ten (10) semesters. Assignment to specific sections may also require special job-related skills. Management or designee shall publicly list such sections in advance. Management or designee may deem courses within a department or subject area as equivalent to each other for application of this Article provided that such "equivalencies" are publicly listed in advance and consistently applied.
3.2	Other State-Funded Noncredit Areas - For faculty members with noncredit assignments in Consumer Education, Parenting, ESL, Citizenship Ed., or Transitional Studies including ABE/GED and Adult Learning Center, assignment must be to any course in their State-funded noncredit area. Assignment to specific sections may also require special job-related skills. Management or designee shall publicly list such	sections	in	advance.

4.	Evaluation - Any assignment may be precluded if the most recent evaluation was unsatisfactory.
5.	Unassigned Hours
5.1	Same Department - If hours are still available after all temporary, part-time assignments have been made for currently employed temporary, part-time faculty members in the department in accord with A.3, such hours may be assigned to currently employed temporary, part-time faculty in the department without regard to A.3.
5.2	Other Departments - Currently employed temporary, part-time faculty members may apply for unassigned hours which are available in other departments or subject areas and for which they possess the minimum qualifications, or their formally granted equivalent. With respect to these applications, the faculty member shall be interviewed for the assignment for which he/she applied.
B.	Definitions - For purposes of this Article, the following definitions shall apply:
1.	Time of Original Assignment - The time of original assignment is the day notice of assignment or non-assignment is given to all current temporary, part-time faculty within a department or subject area who previously submitted Assignment Preference Forms. For purposes of this article, notice is given when assignments are posted at the Adams, Alemany, Chinatown/North Beach, Downtown, Evans, Mission, Ocean, and Southeast campuses.
1.1	At time of posting, notices shall also be mailed first-class to the home addresses on Assignment Preference Forms.
2.	Load for the Current Semester - Shall be determined without regard to reductions which were the result of course cancellations due to low enrollment or to fiscal cuts that occurred after the original assignment.
Departments that assign both credit and noncredit courses shall compute assignments, loads, etc. as proportions or percentages of a	full-time	load.
ARTICLE 13-1 PART TIME REEMPLOYMENT PREFERENCE 13-1.B.3 - 13-1.B.6 AFT/DISTRICT CBA —1/14/2005 —12/31/2007 59 1 2345678 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46
3.	Reduction in the Number of Hours Available - A reduction in the number of hours available to a temporary, part-time faculty member shall be deemed to have occurred if, within a department or subject area, the number of hours offered is less than the faculty member's modal load for the most recent four (4) semesters assigned out of the last six (6) calendar semesters or, if there is no mode, the modal load for the most recent three (3) semesters assigned out of the last six calendar semesters or, if there is no mode, the median load for the most recent three (3) semesters assigned out of the last six (6) calendar semesters.
3.1	Modal Load - The modal load is the single most frequently occurring load in the distribution of loads assigned.
1.	60% 60% 40% 20% Mode = 60%
2.	60% 60% 40% 40% Mode = None
3.	60% 40% 20% 20% Mode = 20%
4.	60% 59% 55% 50% Mode = None
5.	60% 40% 40% Mode = 40%
6.	60% 40% 20% Mode = None
7.	40% 20% 20% Mode = 20%
8.	59% 55% 50% Mode = None
3.2 Median Load - The median load is that load among the distribution of loads assigned which has an equal number of loads above and below.
1.	60% 40% 20% Median = 40%
2.	55% 59% 50% Median = 55%
3.	60% 50% 20% Median = 50%
4.	Noncredit Assignments - For purposes of determining minimum qualifications for noncredit assignments, discipline or subject area includes, but is not limited to, each of the nine (9) State-funded noncredit areas. (Ref. Education Code Section 84757)
5.	Seniority - Seniority shall be defined as the total number of semesters of academic service as a temporary faculty member and shall be determined in accordance with Article 20.A.9.1.1 and 20.A.9.1.3. Faculty members who achieved modal loads in more than one department, discipline, or subject area are eligible for assignments in those departments, disciplines, or subject areas.
5.1	Ties - In case of equal seniority between two or more faculty members, seniority shall be determined by the drawing of lots.
6.	Current Employee - Except as specifically provided below, a temporary, part-time faculty member shall only be considered a current employee	if	he/she
ARTICLE 13-1 PART TIME REEMPLOYMENT PREFERENCE 13-1.B.6 -13-1.D.2.3 AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 60 1 2345678910 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47
has an assignment during the semester in which assignments are made or, if assignments are made after the semester ends, if he/she had an assignment in the prior semester. Temporary, parttime faculty members who have regular assignments in alternate semesters shall also be considered current employees, even in semesters for which they are not assigned, provided all other requirements of this Article are met.
C.	Overload - With respect to the previous semester, the proportionate reduction in the number of temporary, part-time hours in a discipline or subject area shall generally not exceed the proportionate reduction in the number of overload hours assigned to unit members in that discipline or subject area. For example, if the department, in the previous semester, scheduled 30 hours taught by hourly and 21 hours taught as overload (51 hours total) and only 30 hours are currently available to be scheduled, a proportionate reduction is to schedule 59% (30 - 51 = 59%) of previous hours so that 17.7 hours would be scheduled as hourly. Rounding would yield 18 hours hourly and 12 hours overload. Exceptions to this rule may be justified when course hours cannot be split (i.e., a 3-hour assignment is one unit, not three separate hours).
If, for further example, only 6 hours were previously assigned to overload while 60 hours were assigned to hourly, while the department currently has only 24 hours to assign 36% (24 - 66 = 36%), 2.16 hours would go to overload while 21.6 hours would go to hourly. Rounding would yield 2 and 22, but if the department has 3-hour courses, the final result would be 3 hours overload and 21 hourly, rather than zero hours overload and 24 hourly, because zero hours overload would be a 100% reduction rather than 64%.
D.	Grievance Procedure
1.	Purpose - To provide an orderly procedure for reviewing and resolving grievances promptly and at the lowest administrative level possible. This shall be the exclusive procedure by which grievances arising under the Part-time Reemployment Preference Article may be resolved.
2.	Definitions - For purposes of this Part-time Reemployment Preference Article, the following definitions shall apply.
2.1	Grievance - A formal written allegation by a grievant that the grievant has been adversely affected by a violation of a specific provision of this Article.
2.2	Grievant - Any individual temporary, part-time (or categorical) unit member who believes his/her preference to an assignment under this Article has been violated.
2.3	Day - Any day on which the central administrative office of the District is regularly open for business.

5.1.1	In the event the Union elects to submit more than one grievance from a particular department or subject area to arbitration, then all such grievances shall be submitted and decided in one hearing before the same arbitrator.
5.2	Power of the Arbitrator - It shall be the function of the arbitrator, and he/she is empowered except as his/her powers are herein limited, after investigation and hearings, to make a decision in cases of alleged violation of the Part-time Reemployment Preference Article and, in cases where a violation is found, to assign a remedy in accordance with Section E, below. When any matter is submitted to an arbitrator hereunder, the sole issue to be decided shall be: "Is there a less senior temporary, part-time unit member with an assignment in the department or subject area for which the grievant was qualified and was entitled to preference under this Article?"
5.3	The arbitrator shall have no power to:

5.6	All fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the District and the Union. All other expenses shall be borne by the incurring party, and neither party shall be responsible for the expense of any witness called by the other.
E.	Remedy - When preference to an assignment under this Article has been improperly denied, the Grievant shall be entitled to treatment in the subsequent semester as if the appropriate assignment had been made (i.e. semesters of service, mode, median, current status). In addition, one of the following remedies shall be granted:
1.	Provided that the remedy can be implemented prior to the beginning of the assignment to which preference was denied, the Grievant shall receive the percentage of a full-time load he/she would have received but for the improper application of this Article; provided, however, the specific assignment shall be determined by the District in accordance with the Contract.

F.	Exceptions - This Article shall not apply with respect to the following:
1.	Site supervision or non-departmental laboratory assignments.

9.	In case the program of study or travel, as agreed upon in the sabbatical leave contract with the District, is interrupted by serious accident or illness during such leave, and the accident or illness is properly verified by a qualified physician, such interruption shall not constitute a violation of the contract or prejudice the employee against receiving the rights and benefits provided for under the terms of the sabbatical leave. However, this provision is based on the fact that such interruption does not extend over a period of time that would cause the purposes of the sabbatical leave to be abandoned. In the latter case, the sabbatical leave would be terminated and sick leave would be substituted. If a sabbatical is terminated due to illness or serious accident, the sabbatical leave salary shall also be terminated. In all cases of serious accident or illness of an academic staff member on sabbatical leave, the District shall be notified by registered letter after occurrence or medical diagnosis.

2.4	Due to the serious health condition of the faculty member which makes the faculty member unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position. A "serious health condition" of the faculty member includes any illness, injury impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves any of the following:
2.4.1	Any period of incapacity or treatment in connection with or in consequent to treatment in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility; or

3.3	Intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule may be taken for the serious health condition of the faculty member or to care for a family member where the patient's health care provider certifies that the serious health condition warrants this type of leave.
3.3.1	Intermittent or reduced leave schedule may be taken for the birth, adoption or foster care of a child or care of a newborn, only by mutual agreement between the District and the faculty member. The District shall predicate its agreement to intermittent or reduced leaves on considerations dictated by student needs, the needs of the instructional program, and the needs of faculty requesting such leave. The faculty member shall make all reasonable efforts to structure his/her leave request to balance the need for leave for the birth, adoption or foster care of a child or care of a newborn with the needs of the instructional program.
3.4	If the faculty member requests intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave because of his or her serious health condition or to care for a family member with a serious health condition, the District may require the faculty member to transfer temporarily to an available alternate position for which the faculty member is qualified and which has equivalent pay and benefits and better accommodates the recurring periods of leave than the faculty member's regular position.

5.2	Faculty members on unpaid Family Medical Leave shall be entitled to participate in other benefit plans to the same extent as faculty members who take other types of unpaid leave.
5.3	The District shall cease providing benefits when the faculty member's Family Medical Leave is exhausted or whenever the faculty member informs the District that he or she does not intend to return from leave.
5.4	If a faculty member exhausts his or her Family Medical Leave and does not return to work, the faculty member must repay the benefit premiums paid by the District during the period of unpaid leave. In such circumstances the District may make a deduction from any sums due the faculty member, to cover the cost of the premiums, in accordance with State wage garnishment laws. The faculty member is not required to repay the premiums where the failure to return to leave is due to the following:
5.4.1	The continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition to the faculty member or a family member which would entitle the faculty member to Family Medical Leave, were his or her leave not exhausted. The faculty member must provide certification of the condition from the patient's health care provider within thirty (30) days; or
5.4.2	Other circumstances beyond the faculty member's control, such as the unexpected job transfer of a spouse or the serious health condition of a person other than a defined family member, who requires the
faculty member's care. The faculty member shall provide verification of these circumstances within thirty (30) days.
5.4.3	A faculty member's desire to stay with a family member for whom care is no longer medically necessary, or a parent's desire to remain home with a newborn child are not "other circumstances beyond the faculty member's control."
5.5	Faculty members on Family Medical Leave remain "employees" of the District and the leave will not constitute a break in service.
6.	Verification — Before a Family Medical Leave will be granted, the faculty member must provide written certification by a health care provider as follows:
6.1	If leave is requested due to the faculty member's serious health condition, the faculty member's health care provider must certify the date of commencement and probable duration of the condition and the faculty member's inability to perform essential job functions. The certification need not state the nature	of	the	condition.

The certification need not state the nature of the condition.
6.3	If the faculty member requests intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule for planned medical treatments, the certification must include the dates and duration of such treatments. Whenever such intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave is requested, the certification shall indicate that this type of leave is warranted and its expected duration. The certification need not state the nature of the condition.
6.4	If the leave is foreseeable, the faculty member must provide certification within a reasonable time after the District requests it. The leave may be denied if certification is not received within a reasonable time. When the leave is not foreseeable, the faculty member may begin the leave, but must provide certification within a reasonable time of request. A reasonable time will usually be within 15 days,
unless there is an emergency which makes it impracticable to provide certification within that time.
6.5	The District may require recertification of the faculty member's serious health condition on a reasonable basis if additional leave is requested.
6.6	When a faculty member requests leave for his or her own serious health condition and the District has reason to doubt the validity of the certification, it may require, at its expense, that the faculty member obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved by the District, who is not regularly used or employed by the District. If the second opinion differs from the first, the District may require, at its expense, that the faculty member obtain the opinion of a third health care provider jointly selected by the District and the faculty member. The third opinion shall be final and binding.
6.7	. If the faculty member substitutes paid sick leave for Family Medical Leave, verification requirements shall be consistent with paid sick leave under Article 17.C.
7.	Notice by the Faculty Member - Faculty members shall provide the District with reasonable advance notice of the need to take a leave and its estimated duration. Leave shall not be denied for failure to give advance notice where it is required due to an emergency or otherwise	unforeseeable	situation.

7.2	If the faculty member becomes aware of the need for a leave less than thirty (30) calendar days in advance, the faculty member shall give written notice within five (5) working days after becoming aware of the need for the leave, where that is possible.
7.3	If the leave is needed for a planned medical treatment or planned supervision of a family member with a serious health condition, the faculty member shall give reasonable advance notice of the leave and may be requested to meet with the District's designee to discuss scheduling to minimize disruption to District operations. Any such scheduling shall be subject to the approval of the health care provider.
8.	Reinstatement - Upon return from Family Medical Leave, a faculty member will be reinstated to the position he or she held prior to the

A. Compensation
1.2005-	2006 and 2006-2007 Academic Years
1.1	For each Academic Year covered by this Agreement, bargaining unit wage rates shall be increased by cost of living adjustments (COLA), if any, for community colleges contained within the adopted State budget for Academic Years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007.
1.1.1.	Effective 2005-2006, the District shall provide an across-the-board increase of at least 3%, even if the State COLA adjustment for 2005-2006 is less than 3%. If the State COLA adjustment for 2005-2006 is less than 3%, available formula moneys will be used to help fund the difference between the actual State COLA and a 3% across-the-board increase.
1.1.2.	The parties acknowledge that the final State budget for 2005-2006 may include a reduction in State funding for STRS that would have to be addressed at the local level. Such a reduction may place financial pressure on the District, thereby limiting the District’s ability to pass through the full amount of the State COLA beyond 3%. If the final 2005-2006 State budget reduces State funding for STRS, the parties shall reopen this Agreement to negotiate the amount above 3%, if any, to be passed through.
1.2	If, after adoption of the State budget, the State modifies the COLA or the amount of COLA it funds, the District shall increase or decrease pay rates by the appropriate percentage as soon as practicable. Before decreasing pay rates under this section, the District will determine in consultation with the Union whether any savings have been achieved or whether alternate revenue sources to offset the revenue deficit exist. In the event of overpayments to employees, the District shall, in equal installments over a sixmonth time period, recoup the amount overpaid.
1.3	Bargaining unit members' wage rates shall be increased by the COLA adjustment effective 30 days after the District begins to receive COLA funds. The District shall disburse a retro check to employees as necessary to cover the period from August 1 to the date the increase is made in base wages.

total of increases and/or decreases of the following unrestricted revenues received by the District:
1.	Lottery - to the extent allowable under California Proposition 20 (1999) after required set-asides for instructional materials and supplies
2.	Sales tax
3.	Interest earned on unrestricted revenue
4.	Prior year corrections (by definition, deemed one-time only)
5.	Fifty percent of State-authorized “growth” funding for enrollment increases (including Basic Skills)
6.	Fifty percent of non-resident tuition
7.	“Transfers in” from the designated reserve, unless the transfer is made: (1) in response to a decline in revenues that creates a deficit of revenue in the Unrestricted General Fund in relation to the continuance of the previous college program; or (2) to fund an increase in class sections in order to capture “growth” funding.
8.	Partnership for Excellence (PFE) funds above 2003-2004 allocation.
9.	Equalization
10.	Noncredit rate enhancement
11.	Other Local and State Revenues.
2.2	In the event that the Union believes that other resources, including transfers into the Unrestricted General Fund, or other resources outside the Unrestricted General Fund should have been included for allocation by formula, it shall promptly raise its concerns to the District and the parties will negotiate in good faith, provided that impasse procedures shall not apply. If the parties have not reached agreement within 14 calendar days, either party has a right to initiate mediation. The parties shall jointly select a mediator. Failing mutual agreement on the mediator, the parties shall use the State Mediation and Conciliation Service. Mediation shall occur for a maximum of 30 days absent mutual agreement to extend the time. No other statutory impasse procedure shall apply-
2.3	In each fiscal year covered by this Agreement, the baseline will be determined by the District’s independent audit from the immediately prior fiscal year. For Fiscal Years 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 “new revenues” shall include the amount of the ending balance of the prior fiscal year that is in excess of $2 million. In no event shall the excess amount of ending fund balance include funds already taken into account in Subsection 2.1 above.
2.3.1	For Fiscal Year 2005-2006, the parties shall meet in May 2005 to determine the amount of formula revenue	that	may

be advanced. Any agreement on the amount of formula revenue to be advanced and the allocation of moneys shall be specified in an Exhibit to this Agreement.
2.4	Operation of Formula: In each fiscal year covered by this Agreement using the prior year’s audited expenditure and revenue figures (unrestricted) from the immediately prior fiscal year, the District shall determine the amount of “new revenue” available for distribution. The cost of salary-driven fringe benefits associated with the pass-through of the State COLA shall be charged against “new revenue” available for distribution. In both years, the District and Union shall reach agreement on:
2.4.1	. How much of the new revenue is attributable to onetime sources and ongoing sources. (Revenue from one-time sources may only be allocated for one-time salary, workload or benefit changes and shall not be allocated to ongoing commitments unless (1) otherwise agreed to and (2) the parties reach agreement on how to sustain the level of expenditure); and
2.4.2	Allocation of new revenue to salary, workload or benefits changes (in the event that such allocations require modification of provisions of this Agreement, the parties shall reopen the Agreement for the sole purpose of making such mutually agreed-upon modifications).
2.4.3	Allocation of performance based revenue, in a manner that assures provision of the State-required performance and service levels. Continuation of expenditures funded with Partnership for Excellence
funds is contingent on the continuation of the State funding mechanism. The continuation of such enhancements is not guaranteed against the loss of such funds.
2.5	Baseline
Audited figures from the District’s independent audit for 1999-2000 will be used to determine allocation percentages. Eighty percent (80%) of the new revenues shall be available for salary and benefit adjustments college-wide. AFT’s proportionate share of these available revenues shall be equal to its “proportionate share” of salary and benefit expenditures in 1999-2000 (67.19%). The parties shall jointly conduct an annual review in each fiscal year of the Agreement, to determine whether audited data justifies a change in the figure used for AFT’s proportionate share.

2.6	To determine AFT’s “proportionate share,” the academic salaries and benefits expenditures shall be divided by all salaries and benefits expenditures (State Budget and Accounting Manual Categories 1000, 2000 and 3000). “Academic salaries and benefit expenditures” attributable to AFT shall include salaries and benefits of academic department chairpersons and shall exclude salaries and benefits of categorically funded AFT bargaining unit members, administrators, the Chancellor, independent contractors, department chairperson stipends, classified employees and student workers.
3. Priorities for Allocation of Unrestricted New Revenues Other Than State COLA
3.1	The parties agree that priority items for negotiation of salary improvements using funds identified under the salary formula (section 2 above) during the term of this Agreement include the following (recognizing that, due to fiscal constraints, not all of these priorities may be achievable during the term of this Agreement): (a) an additional across-the-board salary increase; (b) additional employer contributions toward employee only, employee plus one, and employee plus family dependent health coverage; (c) modification of Step 15.5 on the Contract & Regular Faculty and Full-Time Temporary Faculty Annual Salary Schedule to a full Step 16; (d) partial or full establishment of (an) additional step(s) on the part-time pro-rata scales; (e) increasing to 100 percent the percentage of the pro-rata
scales for temporary, part-time credit instructors, contingent on the District’s receipt of State Part-time Faculty Compensation Funding and/or other mutually agreeable sources of funding; (f) assessing and as appropriate increasing the value of certain salary columns (“F+”) on the existing full-time and pro-rata scale; (g) modification of science lab load factors to address the unequal workload between lecture-lab and lecture class; (h) adopt initial salary step placement provisions for the pro-rata pay scales based on credit for prior teaching/work and related work experience.
3.1.1	. Of the preceding priorities, the parties acknowledge that modification of Step 15.5 to a full Step 16 is the highest priority.
3.1.2	The parties acknowledge that, in reference to item 3.1(g) above, considerable discussion has taken place regarding the comparability of load factors between classroom/lecture and laboratory instruction, particularly in the science-related disciplines, that this matter of inequity needs to be addressed incrementally over time, and that it is the intent of the parties to work towards that end. The parties further acknowledge

that other inequities may exist within other departments and/or discipline areas. The parties shall establish a joint labor-management work group to identify specific areas of concerns and strategies for seeking redress.
3.2	In addition to the priorities in the preceding section, the parties have discussed the issues listed below and agree that they may be addressed in subsequent negotiations as appropriate, depending on funds available and the priorities identified and negotiated by the parties:
(a) add steps to overload pay scales; (b) increase pay for one-year sabbaticals; (c) District pick-up of SFERS employee contribution; and (d) reimburse drug co-payments of parttimers
3.3	In evaluating the foregoing items, the parties shall take into account the following:
3.3.1	Since 1994, the District and the Union have maintained a commitment to the principle of increasing salaries of District faculty members to above the median of Bay
Area community college districts. In 1998, the District and Union agreed to the pay formula embodied in Article 20.A.2. It is the intent and desire of the parties that the pay formula will allow the District to maintain and enhance the standing of faculty salaries relative to Bay Ten community college districts;
3.3.2	In measuring the median, the parties agree to compare Bay Ten salary schedule columns/criteria to like salary schedule columns/criteria within the District. The parties further agree that the value and/or employee cost of medical benefits shall also be taken into account in defining compensation.
3.3.3	The provisions of the Education Code, including AB 420, which, among other items, calls for comprehensive study of part-time faculty employment issues and dedicates funds for improvement of parttime faculty employment conditions and study thereof, and new legislation which may provide heightened funding levels for faculty;
3.3.4	. The parties recognize the importance of working toward the goal of increased state funding for further improvement of part-time employee pay, working conditions, and fringe benefits. The parties further recognize that working toward this goal will involve their mutual, cooperative efforts.
3.3.5	. Within the limits of available resources, the District has been and remains a front-runner among California community colleges in improving part-time faculty terms	of	employment

relative to their full-time counterparts with comparable duties, and has demonstrated its commitment by, among other matters, enhancing part-time faculty health benefits, improving pro rata pay (including “mirror” pro rata scales), implementing paid office hours, and affording opportunities for upgrading to full-time status.
3.3.6	As the percentage of pro-rata pay increases for parttime faculty with credit teaching assignments, there should be an assessment of (1) the existing load factors below that of one unit per instructional hour (1.0) within the credit mode and how those load
multipliers should be factored into the calculation of credit pro-rata pay rates, and (2) the feasibility of such part-time faculty assuming a proportionate share of professional duties beyond classroom teaching;
3.3.7	District and the Union acknowledge the work of the Joint Committee as detailed in the Efficiency Committee Report of January 1991. The District and the Union affirm their commitment to further evaluate the Joint Committee's Recommendations with a particular emphasis on administrative efficiency, faculty loads and class size in light of median loads and class sizes of other Bay Ten community college districts;
3.3.8	The District and the Union affirm their commitment to analyzing and implementing ways to more efficiently use existing District resources, including the recommendations of the 1998 Fiscal Review Commission, to provide quality instruction and student services and to provide needed improvements in faculty compensation.

6.	Documentation must consist of official transcripts mailed directly to the District by the granting institution. Each faculty member is solely responsible for requesting and arranging for the payment of the official transcript.
7.	All course units are to be from accredited institutions. Semester units are assumed for purposes of computing applicable course units. Quarter units shall be converted to semester units using established District formula.

8.	Units determined to be appropriate for column advancement but insufficient in number to advance a faculty member to the next column shall be considered to be vested units. Vested units (including “grand-parented” units under the 2000-2003 CBA) may be credited toward future column advancement.
9.	Effective Spring 2005, courses that are identically numbered may be credited more than once when the course is graded and given credit each time completed, and (1) the content or learning objectives	of	the	course

Upon mutual agreement between the party initiating the arbitration and the District, the AAA rules governing expedited arbitration may be utilized.
7.1.1	When a written notice for arbitration of the grievance is not initiated by the Union, the probationary employee providing written notice to submit the grievance to arbitration must deposit with the arbitrator prior to the commencement of the arbitration adequate security to pay the employee’s share of the cost of arbitration. (Ed. Code Section 87610.1(c)) If, in the process of arbitration, the arbitrator believes that the cost of arbitration will exceed the original estimate, the
arbitrator shall so inform the parties and shall direct the employee to deposit further security. If the employee fails to make any required deposit, the arbitrator shall notify the employee of his or her obligation and give a ten (10) day grace period to fulfill his or her obligation. If the employee fails to make payment within the grace period, the arbitrator shall be authorized to dismiss the grievance. In no event shall the District be liable for the employee’s one-half share of the cost of arbitration. Any cash amounts remaining at the conclusion or dismissal of the arbitration after payment in full of the employee’s half of the full fees and expenses of the arbitration shall be refunded to the employee.

B.	Access to District E-mail and Individual Web Sites for Retired Faculty
For the life of this Agreement, faculty who retire may continue to use their District e-mail accounts subject to the conditions and limitations applicable to active employees. The District acknowledges the potential value of retired faculty members’ ongoing involvement in the District educational process, including non-commercial contributions to the District intranet and District web site. Faculty who wish to maintain their individual City College-supported web sites can request to continue their access by application to their dean subject to approval of the appropriate vice chancellor.
ARTICLE 30 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 30.A - 30.B.4 AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005-12/31/2007 154 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
A.	Purpose and Scope
The understandings regarding Intellectual Property that are set forth in this Article are intended to:
•	encourage faculty to engage in the production of scholarly works, creative publications, and technology-based materials, including works utilized in distance education;
•	promote the right of faculty members to benefit from their scholarly work; and
•	avoid copyright disputes by facilitating advance agreement between faculty members and the District regarding the ownership and use of such works.
B.	Copyright Definitions
1.	Commissioned/lnstitutional Works are defined and directed by the District for a specific District purpose. Faculty members’ contributions to such work are outside their normal duties, and are specified in advance by written agreement.
2.	Derivative Work is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adopted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a “derivative work.”
3.	Good Standing, for purposes of this agreement only, means the faculty member’s performance is satisfactory or above in connection with the on-line course(s) he or she is teaching. In the absence of an
evaluation, good standing shall be presumed unless the District has documented the deficiency and followed the process set forth in Article 11.C.4 through 11.C.6. Mere unsatisfactory performance in teaching an online course does not constitute an independent basis for discipline but may preclude the faculty member from further assignment to an online course. When the faculty member’s deficiency is solely related to the unique nature of on-line teaching, the District shall not rely on such documentation in connection with future discipline.
4.	Intellectual Property means any work that is eligible for copyright protection including (but not limited to) literary works, books, articles, dramatic and musical compositions, poetry, instructional materials (e.g., syllabi, lectures, student exercises, multimedia programs, and tests), analysis (e.g., scientific, logical, opinion or criticism), works of art and design, including pictorial, graphic and sculptural works, photographs, films, video and audio recordings, computer based programs and media (e.g., software or ARTICLE 30 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 30.B.4 - 30.C.3 AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007155 1 2 3456789 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46
computed code of their representation in forms such as CD-ROM, video disk, compressed video, web-based material and the like), original “maskworks” (i.e., original images derived from semi-conductor chip products), architectural and engineering drawings and choreography.
5.	Joint Work is a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole
6.	License is contract in which a copyright owner grants to another permission to exercise one or more of the rights under the copyright.
7.	Personal Work is intellectual property that is prepared outside the course and scope of District employment without the use of District resources.
8.	Royalty is a payment made to an owner of a copyright for the privilege of practicing a right under the copyright.
9.	Scholarly/Aesthetic Work is “Intellectual Property” originated by a faculty member resulting from independent academic effort. Such works include faculty prepared textbooks, lecture notes, syllabi, journal articles, reviews, and other course materials such as outlines, workbooks, presentations, and laboratory manuals, as well as literary, musical and artistic works, and periodicals or other serial publications.
10.	Substantial Support means financial support over and above the cost of the faculty member’s normal compensation, office space, office
computer, local telephone use, minimal office supplies and copy services. Substantial support includes extra compensation or the assignment of reassigned time to create the work, the cost of providing secretarial, technical, legal or creative services specifically for the creation of work, as well as the cost or value of the use of District equipment or facilities. Neither District-sponsored training nor compensation to a faculty member while on sabbatical, standing alone, constitutes substantial support.
C.	Copyright Ownership
1.	Scholarly/Aesthetic Works are the property of the faculty member and the copyright is owned by the faculty member.
2.	Commissioned/lnstitutional Works - unless otherwise stipulated in the agreement, ownership will rest with the District if the elements of this definition are substantially present.
3.	Personal Work - ownership of copyrights to personal works shall reside with	the	faculty	member.

4.	Faculty Efforts Supported by District - Where the faculty work(s) as defined in Section B involve(s) substantial support of District resources (as defined in Section B.10), one of the following applies: 4.1 The faculty member shall retain the right to copyright the material, but shall reimburse the District for the reasonably assessed cost of the substantial support.
4.2	The District and the faculty member may agree to share the right to copyright materials. This will be accomplished through a separate contract at the time the project is initiated. As provided in Section D, AFT will be a party to the negotiations.
4.3	The District may seek the right to market the work(s) created by the faculty member. The terms of the license to market the work(s) shall be agreed upon by the faculty member and the District. As provided in Section D, AFT will be a party to the negotiations.
4.4	Before a faculty member makes substantial use of District facilities, equipment and resources to create a work, he/she shall seek approval from his/her Department Chair or Dean and the appropriate Vice Chancellor. If the request is approved, the Vice Chancellor and faculty member shall enter into a signed agreement specifying the degree to which District facilities, equipment and resources will be permitted to be used, as well as disposition, including use, of copyrighted works. As provided in Section D, AFT will be a party to the negotiations.
5.	Creation of Intellectual Property During Paid Sabbatical
5.1	Creation of intellectual property during a paid sabbatical leave is the property of the faculty member and the copyright to the work(s) is owned by the faculty member, except as stated in Section C.4.
5.2	Where the District has provided to the faculty member substantial support as defined in Section B.10 above in the creation of work(s) included in the faculty member’s approved sabbatical proposal, issues of approval for the use of District resources, ownership, and copyright of the created work(s) shall be governed by Section C.4.
6.	Joint Work - Rights between joint owners of a copyright shall be determined pursuant to copyright law.
7.	Grant-funded Work - Ownership and use of works stemming from grant-funded projects shall be subject to and determined by the terms	of	the
ARTICLE 30 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 30.C.4 - 30.C.7 AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 157 1 2
grant. This provision shall not be deemed to create a beneficial interest for any	Grantor.
ARTICLE 30 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 30.C.8 - 30.G.1 AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 158 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
8.	District License for Use of Copyrighted Materials - In cases where the faculty member retains ownership of a work produced during the faculty member’s employment, with the exception of Personal Work as defined in section B.7, the faculty member and the District may agree upon terms for a license permitting the District’s use of such work for internal instructional, educational and administrative purposes. Under normal circumstances, the license shall be nonexclusive and royalty-free. In the event of a dispute under this section, the Union, faculty member and Chancellor shall meet in an effort to collegially resolve the dispute.
D.	AFT’s Role in Intellectual Property Rights Negotiations between the District and Individual Faculty Members
In negotiations pursuant to this Article between the District and a faculty member over the terms of a written agreement covering matters within the scope of representation (Government Code Section 3543.2), AFT will be a party to the negotiations. Before initiating any negotiations with any faculty member over a written agreement pursuant to this Article, the District shall notify AFT.
E.	Copyright Registration
Responsibility for official registration of copyright will lie with the owner of the copyright. Where the District and faculty member(s) share ownership, the
District will be responsible for filing for both parties for registration of copyright.
F.	Royalties and Distribution Rights
Unless mutual agreement is made to the contrary, the ownership of copyright determines royalty distribution as follows:
1.	When faculty has full copyright ownership, they retain full royalty distribution rights.
2.	When the District has full copyright ownership, it retains full royalty distribution rights.
3.	If the District and the faculty member(s) share copyright ownership, all royalties or profits will be distributed to reimburse copyright owners for documented expenses related to the creation and production of the materials. Any remaining royalties or profits will be distributed equally among the owners or according to a different percentage under the terms of a separate agreement.
G.	Distance Education
1.	Distance Education is defined as instruction, education or training where the instructor and the student are separated geographically. Communication between the student and instructor is made through	one	or

2.	Compensation including extra pay or release time for work performed by faculty members who develop Distance Education courses, shall be negotiated by the Union and the District. In each case in which the faculty member develops a Distance Education course, an agreement regarding this compensation and the work to be performed will be executed by the faculty member, the District and AFT.
3.	The faculty member retains ownership of and the right to copyright course materials of Distance Education courses, except for ownership of the courseware shell.
4.	Right of First Refusal and License
4.1	The faculty member who creates a distance education course, whether a new distance education course or an existing course converted to a distance education course, shall maintain the right of first refusal to teach the course for four (4) semesters, provided that (a) there is adequate enrollment to offer the course, and (b) the faculty member remains in
good standing, as defined above. Faculty members meeting these conditions are referred to as “such originating faculty members.”
4.1.1	If such originating faculty members decide not to continue to teach the course, the terms of G.4.2 apply.
4.1.2	If the District wishes to reassign the course and provide the course materials of such originating faculty members to another faculty member over the originating faculty members’ objection, the District shall consult with the originating faculty members and Union before determining a final course of action, with review by the Chancellor in the event of continued disagreement. The District, Union and originating faculty members shall agree, prior to reassignment of the course, to the amount to be paid the originating faculty member for a license fee and shall also agree to the duration of the license.
4.1.3	. If the faculty member does not remain in good standing with adequate enrollment for the entire four semesters, the terms of G.4.2 apply.

DRAFT
Policy Proposal for Electronic Communications & Information Technology
Feb 14, 2005
It is the District’s policy that the rights of academic freedom and freedom of expression apply to the use of District computing resources. The District supports a campus and computing environment open to the free expression of ideas, including unpopular points of view. The District recognizes the privacy interests of faculty and their rights of academic freedom, freedom of expression, and participatory governance. Accordingly, the District does not and shall not monitor individual usage of its computing resources, including e-mail accounts, internet usage or data created by individuals, except as provided herein.
The use of District computing resources, like the use of other District resources, is subject to legal requirements, to standards of ethical behavior as defined and refined through the ongoing shared governance process, and usage policies. Both the nature of electronic communication and the public character of District business make electronic communication inherently less private than many users anticipate. Even the most perfect computer network is not immune from hacking or efforts to compromise the integrity and security of the system. Hence, although the District strives to develop and implement safeguards to protect system integrity and security, it cannot guarantee privacy or confidentiality of data. In addition, the normal operation and maintenance of the District’s computing resources require backup and caching of data and communications, logging of activity, monitoring of general usage patterns and aggregated usage data, and other such activities that are necessary to provide network services that are relatively secure.
Under special circumstances, the District may monitor the activity and accounts of users of District computing resources, including login sessions and the content of individual communications, with or without notice, when:
1.	required by law
2.	necessary to protect the integrity, security, or functionality of District or other computing resources
3.	necessary or to protect the District from criminal or civil liability
4.	there is sufficient and reasonable cause to believe that (a) the user has violated or is violating this policy or other District policies/procedures, including the District’s policy and procedure against discrimination/harassment/retaliation or other violations of law, or (b) the use of such computing resources may reflect cause for discipline.
Except in the event of such special circumstances as documented by the Chancellor or Vice Chancellor (such as imminent system crashes, excessive network bandwidth usage, internal or external denial-of-service attacks), any monitoring or examination of individual accounts, usage, content or hardware shall not occur unless it has been
approved in advance by the appropriate Vice Chancellor, with notification to the affected employee(s) unless the Vice Chancellor concludes that good cause exists to refrain from immediately notifying the employee. Good cause may exist, e.g., in the event of an ongoing investigation into misconduct; when the District has a reasonable basis to believe that disclosure could result in destruction of evidence or retaliation against other persons; or when employees are not readily available to receive notice. AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 163
A joint labor-management work group augmented with representation by the Chairperson of the ITPC or his/her designee shall serve as a resource in defining appropriate standards and procedures regarding “special circumstances” and “good cause” based on case-by-case assessment and discussion after the fact, with appropriate confidentiality afforded to the identity of the employee(s) involved.
The results of general or individual monitoring specifically authorized by this Policy may be disclosed, after review and approval by the Chancellor or Vice Chancellor,
(a)	as appropriate if requested by law enforcement agencies;
(b)	in disciplinary proceedings or, as relevant, in litigation; and/or
(c)	as otherwise required by law.
It should be understood by all District employees and users of District computer resources that communications may be subject to the California Public Records Act, Government Code § 6250, to the same extent as they would be if made on paper.
Limitations on Use
Computing resources are provided for professional and business use and not for personal, financial or other gain. Reasonable personal use of District computing resources for other purposes is permitted when it does not consume a significant amount of those resources, does not interfere with the performance of the user’s job or other District responsibilities, and is otherwise in compliance with this policy. AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 164
Side Letter Between SFCCD and AFT Local 2121 (2005-2007 Agreement)
Education Code section 87482.8 provides:
Whenever possible:
(a)	Part-time faculty should be informed of assignments at least six weeks in advance.
(b)	Part-time faculty should be paid for the first week of an assignment when class is cancelled less than two weeks before the beginning of a semester. If a class meets more than once per week, part-time faculty should be paid for all classes that were scheduled for that week.
(c)	The names of part-time faculty should be listed in the schedule of classes rather than just described as “staff.”
(d)	Part-time faculty should be considered to be an integral part of their departments and given all the rights normally afforded to full-time faculty in the areas of book selection, participation in department activities, and the use of college resources, including, but not necessarily limited to,
telephones, copy machines, supplies, office space, mail boxes, clerical staff, library, and professional development.
In signing this language, the Governor stated that this provision stated legislative intent, that “implementation of the intent language of AB 654 will be costly and may adversely affect other aspects of community college programs, particularly in these times of funding shortages,” and that “the intent language of AB 654 should not be implemented until there are adequate fiscal resources available.” During reopener negotiations in Spring 2005, the parties shall discuss and negotiate over this provision, existing practice, the other provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, and costs and funding prospects, including possible allocation of formula revenue for the cost of such matters.

Therefore, the scale is an interim one. The rates in the above scale represent the retroactive rates in effect for Academic Year 1999-2000 plus an across-the-board increase of 4.62%. Additionally, Steps 10, 11, and 12 were added effective 8/1/01.

It is the intent of AB 1725 that tenure should be granted to new faculty members only after an evaluation process which is more rigorous, of longer duration, and more representative of the state's diversity than has previously been the case at California community colleges. The bill provides that each district shall develop its own evaluation procedures through collective bargaining between the Community College District and the faculty's representative. The procedures now in effect for the San Francisco Community College District have been prepared by AFT Local 2121 in consultation with the Academic Senate and negotiated with
the District as part of the current Agreement. These procedures are in many ways distinct from those used for the evaluation of tenured faculty. Faculty evaluators and new faculty members should be thoroughly familiar with them. The most obvious change from past procedure is the lengthened period of evaluation leading to the granting or denial of tenure. While in exceptional cases tenure may be awarded after two years, or even one year, of service, it is anticipated that the decision to grant tenure will normally NOT be made until the fourth year of employment. A decision of such importance must be based on thorough and well-documented evaluation of the new employee over an extended period of time. I. RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVALUATORS
The faculty bears the primary responsibility for this evaluation of new faculty members through the peer review process. "The peer review process shall be on a departmental or divisional basis, and shall address the forthcoming demographics of California, and the principles of affirmative action. The process shall require that the peers reviewing are both representative of the diversity of California and sensitive to affirmative action concerns, all without compromising quality and excellence in teaching." (Ed. Code §87663(d)) Many tenured faculty members will be called upon to participate in this process. In recognition of the seriousness of the responsibility and the demands it will make on their time, funds have been made available for supplemental pay.
These guidelines are intended to familiarize the departments with: (I.) the general responsibilities of those who will be participating in tenure review evaluations; (II.) the several components of evaluation; and (III.) the new role of departmental mentor. They do NOT give a thorough description of the evaluation process and MUST be read in conjunction with Article 9.D of the Agreement concerning tenure review.
The heart of the peer review process is the departmental tenure review committee. Its members are appointed by the department's immediate supervisor in consultation with the hiring committee which interviewed the employee	being	evaluated.
Departmental Guidelines for Tenure Review aft/district cba — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 212 1. Familiarize himself/herself with the new evaluation procedures contained in the Agreement; 3. Schedule, conduct, and document frequent evaluations of new faculty in accordance with the Agreement; 3. Supervise the process of evaluation to assure its timeliness and accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 6. Maintain a file of all working evaluation documents until a final decision regarding tenure has been reached by the Board of Trustees and the period for legal challenge to such a decision has passed. A. Direct observation
A.	It is the responsibility of every member of a tenure review committee to:
2.	Attend the evaluation orientation and workshop which will be conducted annually;
4.	Attend all scheduled meetings of the Tenure Review Committee on which he/she serves.
B.	A tenure review committee shall elect, from its faculty members, a chairperson for EACH new faculty member being evaluated. Ordinarily, no committee member should serve as the chair for more
than one new employee's evaluation team. It shall be the responsibility of a committee chair to:
1.	Meet all requirements of Paragraph A above.
2.	Schedule and chair meetings of the Tenure Review Committee.
4.	Advise the immediate supervisor or department chair of the inability of any member of the tenure review committee to continue in that capacity so that a temporary or permanent replacement can be appointed.
5.	Write draft consensus reports from the various evaluation components to serve as a basis for the committee's final recommendations.
II.	COMPONENTS OF EVALUATION
A tenure review committee shall consider three elements of the evaluation process in making its recommendations to the Chancellor and Board of Trustees regarding renewal/non-renewal of contracts or the granting of tenure.
A regular schedule of direct observations is mandated by the Agreement and is the responsibility of the tenure review committee. A modified version of the standard peer evaluation document will be completed after each observation. Tenure review committee members will seek to document such qualities as: Departmental Guidelines for Tenure Review aft/district cba — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 213
1.	Professionalism
2.	Knowledge of subject matter
3.	Teaching effectiveness
4.	Fulfillment of college and departmental requirements
5.	Good collegial relationships
6.	Communication skills
7.	Organizational skills
8.	Sensitivity to students' needs
9.	Creativity and innovation
B.	Tenure Portfolio for Classroom Faculty
Each new faculty member is required to maintain a tenure portfolio which shall be made available to the employee's tenure review committee. The portfolio shall be assembled during the first semester of employment and up-dated each semester thereafter. The contents will be determined by the nature of the employee's department. For instructional departments the portfolio shall contain:
1.	An annual self-evaluation
2.	Course syllabuses
3.	A short summary listing the courses taught with enrollments and distribution of grades. (A department may choose to include grade distributions in all tenure review portfolios or in no tenure review portfolios.)
4.	Other classroom related material deemed appropriate by the department or the instructor such as evidence of creativity and
innovation in teaching, examples of the adaptation of course content to reflect new developments in the discipline, students' term papers, lab. reports, assignments, exams, etc.
5.	Other material which the employee might wish to include as a measure of his/her professional growth, achievement, or participation in non-classroom activities. Examples might include: a. Service on departmental and/or college committees
b.	Attendance at workshops, in-service training sessions, and other activities designed to enhance teaching effectiveness
c.	Attendance at professional conferences or involvement in other professional activities
d.	Community service relating to college or professional responsibilities
e.	Publications, honors, awards, etc.
f.	Other material relevant to the criteria for Early Tenure consideration (Exhibit K).
Departmental Guidelines for Tenure Review aft/district cba —1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 214
C.	Tenure Portfolio for Non-classroom Faculty 1. Specific areas you may want to address in your portfolio:
a.	Describe those accomplishments you feel had a significant impact on your area of responsibility. Include supporting material (e.g. reports, projects, policies, etc.) that highlights these accomplishments.
b.	In reference to your position, describe those activities, projects and ideas you intend to pursue in the near future. Include a description of the anticipated impact of these activities, projects, and ideas.
c.	Indicate the strengths you bring to the position. Also indicate the skills you wish to develop and how you intend to develop these skills.
d.	Other areas you may want to address:
•	Service on departmental and/or college committees
•	Attendance at workshops, in-service training sessions, conferences, and other professional activities.
•	Community service relating to college or professional responsibilities
•	Publications, honors, and awards
D.	Tips for Constructing Portfolio:
1.	When constructing your portfolio be sure to stay organized and focused. It’s important to remember that your tenure review committee, senior administrators, and the Board of Trustees will review you portfolio.
2.	The portfolio should provide the reader with a clear idea of who you are as a professional faculty member at CCSF. As such, the portfolio is an opportunity for you to delineate your
accomplishments, showcase your talents/skills, and provide a sense of what you intend to accomplish at CCSF in the future.
3.	The portfolio should be thought of as a “work in progress.” That is, its contents should be constantly under review with revisions occurring as needed.
4.	Mentors may assist in the construction of the portfolio.
5.	All portfolio material should fit in one (1) binder. Quantity is not a substitute	for	quality.
Departmental Guidelines for Tenure Review aft/district cba — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 215
E.	Student Evaluation
1.	Student evaluations must be conducted in all of a non-tenured instructor's classes when possible.
2.	At a minimum these evaluations will be conducted once in each of the first three years of employment.
III.	DEPARTMENTAL MENTORS
Each new faculty member who is required to have a mentor shall be assigned a mentor during the first year of probationary employment to enable him/her to learn through a direct, sustained association with an experienced, accomplished colleague. New contract faculty who have served as San Francisco Community College District hourly faculty in the two years prior to their being hired as contract faculty may choose to forego having a mentor. At the end of the first year, if the probationary faculty member receives an evaluation that is not satisfactory or if that faculty member feels the need for further assistance from a mentor, he/she may elect to have a mentor assigned for an additional semester or year.
Full-time, tenured faculty members who wish to serve as mentors shall notify their department chairpersons, who shall select the mentors. No faculty member may concurrently serve as the mentor for more than one probationary instructor. Mentors may not serve on the tenure review committee of the employee for whom they are serving as mentor; nor may a mentor's opinion be solicited by the committee in any matter relating to that employee. Mentors shall be compensated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.
The duties of the Mentor shall include:
1.	Attending an annual workshop for faculty mentors;
2.	Observing classes taught by the probationary faculty member;
3.	Recommending workshops, courses to attend, classes to observe, inservice training sessions, or any other materials, activities or programs the mentor believes would be beneficial. While participation in such developmental opportunities does not in itself guarantee tenure, it is considered evidence of dedication to professional growth and should be documented in the new employee's tenure portfolio.
4.	Introducing the new faculty member to his colleagues, directing him/her to campus facilities, assisting with the complexity of roll sheets, grades, and other paperwork, helping with student problems, providing
assistance in the preparation of the tenure portfolio, and generally being available when advice or a sympathetic ear is needed.

A.	Tenure Review and the Criteria Related to Exceptional Circumstances for Early Tenure Consideration
Tenure Review is a four-year process during which the institution gives support and positive reinforcement to probationary instructors. The tenure review process is a period of time when peers have the opportunity to work closely together in a mutually supportive manner, give each other assistance, resources, and the opportunity to discuss ideas and teaching techniques. Hence, the four-year tenure review period is one of validation, intended as a positive experience which sets the tone for the professional life of a new full-time instructor in this District.
Only in rare and exceptional circumstances is this period shortened and an individual faculty member is given the opportunity to be reviewed for tenure earlier than four years. Of course, being given the opportunity to go through an early tenure review process does not guarantee the awarding of early tenure or tenure after four years.
Qualifying elements and the criteria that comprise “Exceptional Circumstances” are as follows:
1.	Senior Faculty member (with extensive experience as a tenured faculty member) from another community college or institution of higher education hired as faculty by the college because of his/her outstanding track record, expertise, and commitment to students and quality instruction; or,
2.	The reputational qualities and contributions of the individual to a particular field and/or discipline are such that he or she is worthy of state/national/international recognition and the expectation is that this individual will bring same to the college, and have a dramatic qualitative impact on the program/college.
3.	The individual faculty member in the early tenure review process must necessarily be engaged in a full-time faculty assignment. Approved release time opportunities for activities directly related to the academic mission of the institution shall not automatically disqualify an early tenure candidate from consideration; however, extensive time spent away from teaching during an abbreviated tenure review process may deprive a faculty member’s department of their ability to assess his/her teaching ability and contributions. Such approved released time opportunities may include Union service of benefit to the College, as referenced in 4.f., below.
4.	In terms of New Probationary Faculty with previous years of City College experience as a Part-time Faculty member, the following considerations should apply:
a)	All candidates must satisfy condition number three above;
EXHIBIT K AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 225
b)	Consideration of the extent to which candidate may meet criteria one, or two, above; or
c)	Long-term and consistent service as a part-time faculty member at City College, at least 10 years; and,
d)	At least 8 years of continuous academic service leading up to full-time status, should be at the level of at least 50% pro rata academic service (this means consecutive, immediately prior service at City College, provided that approved absences under Article 13-1.H shall not be viewed as a break in service and may, depending on the activity, be counted as applicable service under this section); and,
e)	Documented evidence of sustained performance at a truly exceptional level, with a particular emphasis on teaching or other academic services (library, counseling, etc.). The potential applicant must show evidence of strong/outstanding teacher evaluations leading up to full-time status and during the period of Tenure Review; and,
f)	Documented evidence of a significant, high quality, and sustained level of involvement in College Service and in this area, the emphasis must be on college-wide service and not exclusively departmental. The latter distinction is critically important. Effective and high quality involvement in Departmental Committees which tie directly into college-wide issues related to teaching and learning, budget, curriculum, personnel, and facilities could be eligible to qualify as college-wide service. Involvement in various committees of shared governance, self-study, etc., would clearly qualify. Also eligible for consideration is work on employee relations or legislative programs of benefit to the College, which may include Union work (e.g., service on the Union negotiations team or service as a Union officer, including Grievance Officer, or Union work on behalf of legislative initiatives benefiting community colleges).
g)	"Exceptional circumstances” is not synonymous with a long history of hourly/part-time faculty assignments.
B.	Application of the Early Tenure Review Criteria
1.	In the first Fall semester of employment, or the third semester of employment (Fall) for those first under tenure review under Article 9.D.7.1.1, the Tenure Review Committee (“Committee”) has the opportunity to measure the faculty member’s qualifications against the criteria in Section A to determine if consideration for early tenure	is warranted,	as follows:
EXHIBIT K AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 226
a)	A faculty member may initiate a request for consideration for early tenure based on the criteria in Section A above by submitting to the Committee the appropriate form (FORM 1) by the end of the sixth week of instruction. In so requesting,
the faculty member shall consent to the Committee’s review of the faculty member’s application for employment.
b)	During the first semester evaluation process, the Committee shall assess the faculty member’s readiness for early tenure consideration in light of the criteria in Section A, the faculty member’s application for employment, the content of the tenure review evaluation document and the information provided in FORM 1. The Committee and faculty member shall complete FORM 2, specially addressing the question of the extent to which the candidate meets the criteria set forth in Section A. The Committee and faculty member shall complete their forms by the end of the sixteenth week of instruction. Thereafter, the Committee shall promptly submit the completed form to the Chancellor or designee.
c)	By unanimous vote of all members of the Committee or within one vote of being unanimous, the Committee may decide to recommend the faculty member as a candidate for early tenure. Should the appropriate number of members of the Committee so decide, the Committee shall submit a recommendation for early tenure consideration to the Chancellor (FORM 3) by the end of the sixteenth week of instruction, with each member of the Committee affirming his/her vote.
2.	The Chancellor has the sole discretion to determine whether to advance a faculty member for consideration for early tenure. However, if the Chancellor is not inclined to support a recommended candidate for early tenure consideration, the Chancellor will meet with the Tenure Review Committee to allow for a discussion of perspectives before making a final decision, which shall not be subject to review.
3.	In the event that the Chancellor determines that a faculty member is to be afforded early tenure consideration, he or she shall so advise the Committee and faculty member by the end of the first week of instruction in the Spring semester. (FORM 4)
4	If the faculty member is approved for consideration as a candidate for early tenure, the Committee shall evaluate the candidate in the Spring semester in the first year unless the candidate is in the second year of contract status under Article 9.D.7.1.1, and in the Spring semester of the second year unless the candidate has been granted early tenure after the first year. In each evaluation, the Committee and faculty member shall complete FORM 5, specifically assessing the candidate in light of the EXHIBIT K AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 227
evaluation criteria. The Committee and faculty member shall complete their forms by the end of the sixteenth week of instruction.
5.	In the second and/or fourth semester, the Committee shall determine whether to recommend the candidate for early tenure. In order to
make a positive recommendation, the Committee must reasonably conclude, based on the evaluations, that the instructor has demonstrated outstanding service to the District, above and beyond the “satisfactory or better” rating necessary to attain tenure after four years, consistent with the “rare and exceptional” finding originally made by the District. The decision to award early tenure will most likely be made at the conclusion of a two-year period. However, the Committee has the discretion to make this recommendation in the second semester. Candidates who have only three years of tenure review by virtue of application of Article 9.D.7.1.1 will, as a result, have the opportunity for only one year of early tenure review. Should the Committee decide to recommend early tenure by appropriate vote (per Article 9.D.7, unanimous or within one vote of being unanimous), they shall so certify on FORM 5 and shall transmit their recommendation to the Chancellor for consideration at the end of the sixteenth week of instruction.
6.	If the Committee recommends early tenure, the recommendation shall be submitted to the Chancellor for review prior to submission to the Board. In the event that the Chancellor agrees that early tenure is appropriate, he or she shall so recommend to the Board. If the Chancellor is not inclined to support a recommended candidate for early tenure, the Chancellor will meet with the tenure review committee to allow for a discussion of perspectives. Thereafter, if the Committee maintains its recommendation, the matter shall be referred to the Board per the provisions of 9.D.7.9.

The final determination to grant early tenure is within the sole discretion of the Board and shall not be subject to review.
7.	In the second semester, the Committee shall follow the recommendation/ decision process in Article 9.D.7.3. If the Committee does not recommend early tenure at the conclusion of the second semester, (a) the declination to recommend early tenure shall not proceed to the Board, and (b) assuming renewal of the contract, a third semester evaluation is required, per Article 9.D.7.4. (Note: Consistent with Article 9.D.7.4, the Committee does not have the option to recommend early tenure at the conclusion of the third semester.)
8.	In the fourth semester, the Committee shall follow the recommendation/ decision process in Article 9.D.7.5. If the Committee does not recommend early tenure at the conclusion of the fourth semester, (a) the declination to recommend early tenure shall not proceed to the	Board,	and	(b)	assuming

seventh semester evaluation, with the final decision regarding tenure being made in the seventh semester per 9.D.7.6.
9.	In connection with early tenure, where the Board does not affirm the recommendation of the Committee, and upon request of the Committee Chairperson, the Chancellor or designee may meet with the Committee, prior to the next series of evaluations, to provide guidance.
C.	The standards for early tenure consideration and conferral are unique. They are not intended to, and shall not, modify the standards that apply for four-year tenure determinations.

San Francisco Community College District SELF EVALUATION GUIDELINES REQUEST FOR EARLY TENURE REVIEW
Name Assignment
Instructor Counselor Librarian Other (Specify):
Tenure is a four-year process during which the institution gives support and positive reinforcement to probationary instructors. Only in rare and exceptional circumstances is this period shortened and an individual faculty member given the opportunity to be reviewed for tenure earlier than four years. Of course, being given the opportunity to go through an early tenure review process does not guarantee the awarding of early tenure or tenure after four years.
Please indicate how or in what manner you exhibit the following qualifying elements or criteria that comprise “Exceptional Circumstances. ”
A.	NEW PROBATIONARY-FACULTY WITHOUT PRIOR YEARS OF PARTTIME SERVICE AT CITY COLLEGE
PLEASE PROVIDE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF HOW YOU MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:
1.	You were a Tenured Senior Faculty member at another community college or institution of higher education with an outstanding track record, expertise, and commitment to students and quality instruction; or
2.	Your reputational qualities and contributions to a particular field and/or discipline are worthy of state, national, or international recognition and the expectation is that you will bring same to the college, and have a dramatic qualitative impact on the program/college.
B.	NEW PROBATIONARY-FACULTY WITH PREVIOUS YEARS OF CITY COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AS A PART-TIME FACULTY MEMBER PLEASE PROVIDE A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF HOW YOU MEET THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:

record, expertise, and commitment to students and quality instruction; or
2.	Your reputational qualities and contributions to a particular field and/or discipline worthy of state, national, or international recognition and the expectation is that you will bring same to the college, and have a dramatic qualitative impact on the program/college; or EXHIBIT K AFT/DISTRICT CBA — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007 230
3.	You meet all of the following criteria:
a)	Long-term and consistent service as a part-time faculty member at City College, at least 10 years; and
b)	At least 8 years of continuous academic service leading up to fulltime status, should be at the level of at least 50% pro rata academic service (this means consecutive, immediately prior service at City College, provided that approved absences under Article 13-1.H shall not be viewed as a break in service and may, depending on the activity, be counted as applicable service under this section); and
c)	Documented evidence of sustained performance at a truly exceptional level, with a particular emphasis on teaching or other academic services (library, counseling, etc.). You must show evidence of strong/outstanding teacher evaluations leading up to full-time status and during the period of Tenure Review; and
d)	Documented evidence of a significant, high quality, and sustained level of involvement in College Service and in this area, the emphasis must be on college-wide service and not exclusively departmental. The latter distinction is critically important. Effective and high quality involvement in Departmental Committees which tie directly into college-wide issues related to teaching and learning, budget, curriculum, personnel, and facilities could be eligible to qualify as college-wide service. Involvement in various committees of shared governance, self-study, etc., would qualify. Also eligible for consideration is work on employee relations or legislative programs of benefit to the College, which may include Union work (e.g., service on the Union negotiations team or service as a union officer, including grievance officer, or work on behalf of legislative initiatives benefiting community colleges).
Note: Per Exhibit K, Section A.3, to qualify for early tenure, you must necessarily be engaged in a full-time faculty assignment. Approved release time opportunities for activities directly related to the academic mission of the institution will not automatically disqualify you from consideration. However, extensive time spent outside away from teaching during an abbreviated tenure review process may deprive your department of their ability to assess your teaching ability and contributions. Such approved release time opportunities may include Union service of benefit to the College as referenced in Exhibit K, Section A.4.f.

® 1. Tenure should be granted effective the fall semester of the next academic year. (This recommendation may be made during the second or fourth semesters of employment. The Committee does not have the option to recommend early tenure at the conclusion of the third semester. The decision to award early tenure will most likely be made at the conclusion of a two year period. However, the Committee has the discretion to make this recommendation in the second semester. Candidates who have only three years of tenure review by virtue of Section 9.D.7.1.1 will, as a result, have the opportunity for only one year of early tenure review.)*

® 3. Contract for contract employee under early tenure review should be renewed for a period of two years effective the fall semester of the next academic year. (This recommendation may be made on this form only at the end of the third or fourth semester of employment. If the Committee makes this recommendation, the Committee will conduct a fifth and seventh semester evaluation with the final decision regarding tenure to be made in the seventh semester utilizing the standard peer-management evaluation form, Exhibit J. See 9.D.7.6.)*

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN
I.	PURPOSE 8 II.
City College of San Francisco is committed to fostering the continued professional growth of its faculty, and recognizes the mutual advantage which results when Faculty increase their education and training. The procedure set forth herein is designed to foster, encourage and assist faculty members in approaching their own professional development in an organized, long-term manner through the use of pre-approved multi-year Professional Development Plans.
Under this pilot program, faculty have the option of developing a long-term professional development plan that can clarify and help focus each faculty member’s professional goals and a plan towards reaching them. Faculty participating in the program may gain pre-approval for a course of study involving an array of courses and/or seminars consistent with the faculty member’s development plan rather than approving courses on a course-by-course basis as provided in Article 20 Section D. The criteria outlined herein for approval of a faculty member’s professional development plan are broader than the criteria of Article 20 Section D, since they are tied to the College’s Strategic Plan.
This procedure is intended to support and further the eight (8) Strategic Priorities set forth in the College’s Strategic Plan, and shall be implemented and utilized in a fashion consistent with that intent. Those eight (8) Priorities are:
1.	Increasing student success, as demonstrated by student learning outcomes;
2.	Strengthening and improving academic programs;
3.	Expanding programs to meet educational and training needs related to workforce, economic, and community development;
4.	Expanding campus outreach and recruitment, increasing access to educational opportunities for all those in need;
5.	Increasing the quality and accessibility of student development services;
6.	Identifying and promoting strategies to ensure stabilized funding resources;
7.	Upgrading and expanding technology utilization; and
Promoting a dynamic organizational climate and promoting diversity.
TERM OF THE PILOT PROGRAM
The Parties shall evaluate the program in EXHIBIT L in Spring 2006. Unless the parties evaluate and expressly extend or modify the program by the last day of Spring Semester 2006, it shall “sunset at that time” and no new Plans shall be initiated after that date absent express mutual agreement between the District and	AFT.

Student complaints are governed by the following procedure:
Informal Process
7.	a. Investigating the complaint.
STUDENT COMPLAINTS
A student complaint is an allegation by a student against a faculty member that the member has harmed a student by violating a policy, rule, or regulation, or otherwise engaged in inappropriate conduct. A complaint does not include a grade or file challenge, or an allegation of discrimination or sexual harassment, or other conduct for which immediate disciplinary action or suspension could result.
1.	A complaint should first be raised directly with the faculty member concerned.
2.	If a direct meeting does not resolve the complaint, or if either party is unable or unwilling to meet, the complaint should be taken to the faculty member’s supervisor. 3. The supervisor may take the following action, including, but not limited to: e. Redirecting the matter as appropriate.

NOTICE	STUDENT COMPLAINTS MAY HAVE	SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FACULTY MEMBER CONCERNED. STUDENTS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT DIFFERENCES IN PERSONALITY, OPINION,	AND PERCEPTION DO OCCUR, AND CAN OFTEN	BE RESOLVED	BY DISCUSSION BETWEEN	THE PARTIES.

4. The form used at Step 2 of the formal process should advise each party of the right to provide representation of their choice and of other procedural aspects of the process. We agreed that this form could be required of all parties at the formal level and not just the appealing party.			5. We recognized that the designation and selection of faculty committee members are issues which, because they may affect others who are not at the bargaining table, cannot be immediately determined. However, one option we discussed was a system whereby the Academic Senate and the Vice-Chancellors would pre-designate representatives from which committee members would be chosen, either with discretion or mechanically from a list. Ideally, such designations would be made prior to the semester in which the designees would serve so that they could receive Flex-day training. We also discussed staggering the terms of pool participants and setting up the selection process so that each committee would have at least one experienced member.

aft/districtcba — 1/14/2005 — 12/31/2007255 EXHIBIT M (Student Complaints)
6. Appeal: A faculty member shall have the right to challenge the documentation of a student complaint in his/her personnel file and the procedure by which such documentation is placed in the file. In those cases, the appeal shall have the same scope and procedure as an Article 11 personnel file appeal. See Article 11 .C.5 and 11 .C.6.	
8. Sealing/Purging: Unless there is a subsequent entry in the personnel file within five years which concerns similar inappropriate conduct, the decision of a committee which results in the documentation of a student complaint in a faculty member’s personnel file shall be purged from such file, as allowed by law; and, if purging is not allowed by law, shall be sealed. In the case where such a subsequent entry or entries do appear in the personnel file, such entries shall be purged or sealed, as allowed by law, on the fifth anniversary of the date of the last entry concerning the similar conduct.	9. Training: We have discussed two elements of training for committee members: (1) written guidelines on complaint handling process; and (2) flexday training in conflict resolution.
7.	Representation: A faculty member may be represented by an agent of AFT 2121.
