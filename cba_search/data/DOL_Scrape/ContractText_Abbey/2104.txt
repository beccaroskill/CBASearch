A108-	Dispatching Rules. Dispatching Rules shall be posted in the Union Hall in a place conspicuous to Registrants.	-
A109-	Position on List. If Registrants inquire, they shall be informed of their position on the out-of-work list.
A110 -	Available for Work. “Available for Work” means that the registrant must be present at the time and place uniformly required for dispatchment and be ready, able and willing to go to the job site and perform the work for which he is being dispatched. The practice of the dispatching office shall be uniform as to all registrants with respect to physical presence in the office at given hours, or telephoning in, being available at the telephone, etc., and registrants shall be informed of the practice.
Alli -	Notations. Appropriate notations shall be made opposite the registrant’s name when his name is reached for dispatchment, showing the job and classification to which he is dispatched, his lack of availability, or other reason that he has been passed over. If inquiry is made by the registrant, he shall be given exactly the same information as to reasons, etc., as appears on the notation. In such cases, or any other cases which may lead to a dispute, the dispatcher should immediately make notes on the facts upon which he or she based his or her decision to dispatch or not dispatch the man.
Al 12 -	Hiring Hall Modification.
Al 12.1 -	In the event Federal legislation, any Federal Court of Appeals decision, or a decision of the NLRB determines or establishes that any portion of this Section A100 is illegal, such portion shall be immediately reopened for the purpose of negotiation, upon notice, in writing, from either party to the other.

•	reasonable restrictions such as written notice to authorities in charge, reasonable hours and no harassment.
A106-	Registration. No workman shall be refused registration or dispatchment because of his Union or non-Union status, if he is otherwise entitled to dispatchment.
A107-	Qualifications of Workmen. It is the responsibility of the dispatcher to determine, in the first place, the proper Group in which to place the registrant. This normally will be based upon information or papers which the man supplies. If any doubt exists as to the registrant’s proper placement, the dispatcher may call prior employers, or make other prompt investigations to get the facts needed. Similarly the dispatcher should make an appropriate notation, where necessary, of the qualifications of the applicant, or his related experience, to assist in sending men meeting the Contractor’s stated requirements. Any dispute which may arise relative to which list a registrant should be placed upon, or as to competency, shall be settled as follows:
A107.1-	The registrant shall file with the dispatching office a written request for review of the disputed matter, within ten (10) days after the dispute arises. He shall also, at that time, deposit with the dispatching office a cash bond in the sum of Thirty Dollars ($30.00) which sum shall be used solely toward paying his share in the referee’s fees.
A107.2-	The dispatching office will immediately refer the request to the impartial referee who shall review the dispute within ten (10) days after the written request has been filed. Time and place of an informal hearing will be fixed by the referee and notice thereof will be given to the registrant by the Union, as soon as practicable.
A107.3-	The referee will examine all material evidence submitted by the registrant and the Union, and will conclusively decide which Group the registrant should be placed in and as to what classifications the registrant has. The Union will then register and classify the registrant accordingly. Nothing contained herein, however, may be interpreted to permit or grant power to the referee to alter, amend, modify, or otherwise change any term or condition of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, or these dispatching procedures.
A107.4-	The referee’s fees will be bome equally by the Union and the registrant except that the registrant shall in no circumstances be required to pay a sum in excess of Thirty Dollars ($30.00). The registrant’s share shall be taken out of the Thirty Dollars (S30.00) bond on file with the dispatching office, and any excess shall be returned to the registrant as soon as possible.

Gross violation of this provision (as determined under Article 9, of this Agreement) shall result in the Employer being denied, for a six (6) month period, the right to call any individual workman specifically by name.
A 104.6.3 - Notwithstanding the above-stated order of preference in referrals, and not withstanding any other provision in this agreement, a dispatching office may give first priority preference to any classes protected by the Civil Rights Act, who are properly registered, where reasonably necessary to comply with “affirmative action plans” which are conditions of federally or state assisted construction or which are established from time to time by the Union and the Employer in concert with each other, as part of a community action or industry plan.

A 104.8 - The period of years in Group “A” and Group “B” above will be extended for any period of incapacity due to sickness or injury, or for military service, and to workmen employed by individual Contractors (currently signatory to an Agreement), on work outside the State of Arizona, provided workmen so affected become properly registered with the Union dispatching office within thirty (30) days after recovery from such said disability, discharge, or return to Arizona from such work outside the state.
A104.9 - It is further agreed that the Employer, or his agent, shall not contact individual workmen, nor shall the individual workmen contact the Employer or his agent, for the purpose of discussing potential employment under terms less favorable than those set forth in this Agreement.

A105- Hiring Hall Inspection. There shall be complete right of inspection of dispatching operations by authorized representatives of the Employer, such right to be subject to

A 104.6-	When any Employer has four (4) workmen currently employed on any specific job or project, who have been dispatched from Group “A” or “B” (or “C” if not called by name) he may then requisition by name one (1) workman from Group “C”.
