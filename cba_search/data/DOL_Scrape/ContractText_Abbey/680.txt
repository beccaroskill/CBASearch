1.	A regular full-time employee being laid off may displace the shortest service regular full-time employee within his classification within the bargaining unit. The regular full-time employee so displaced may displace the shortest service part-time employee in the same classification in the bargaining unit. In the event there is no less senior employee performing work in the same classification, this displaced employee may displace the least senior employee in a lower classification in which he previously performed six (6) months of service in the classification for the Employer.

It is understood that any employee on layoff from the classification where the vacancy occurs shall have preferential rights to such vacancy.
Laid off employees shall be recalled as needed, in the order of seniority, to jobs in the classification from which they were laid off. The Employer shall not hire a new employee into a classification in which they are laid off employees at the lime. The Employer shall offer recall to a job in the classification from which an employee was laid off prior to promoting another employee into that classification.

If the employee works, or is scheduled forty (40) hours during any of the twelve (12) consecutive weeks, that employee will not have his or her hours reduced unless and until the Company has followed the reduction in hours provision of the contract. If an employee works or is scheduled forty (40) hours, the twelve (12) week period will start over. Further, if a forty (40) hour position becomes available, it will be offered, in seniority order, to full-time employees on layoff and full-time employees working reduced hours before a new employee is hired or an existing employee is granted full-time status.

I f the market value of the assets at any twelve-month review' point is ever below the calculated minimum reserve requirement level as calculated by the Fund consultants, then the Fund consultants shall prepare recommendations for benefit plan redesign and/or employee co-premium contributions such that the dollar amount of any such deficiency will be fully recovered by the end of the 12-month period beginning after the trustee meeting in which the deficiency is first projected.
3.	No changes are permitted that would violate any contractual agreement between the Fund and any third party vendor.
4.

Section 117. Employer Contributions. Effective January 1,2010 (December hours) for all employees covered by this Agreement, the Employer shall pay eighty nine cents ($0.89) per hour for all hours worked at straight time (including hours worked on Sunday, vacation and holiday hours paid) into the Denver Area Meatcutters UFCW Unions and Employers Pension Plan, w hich shall be jointly administered by the Union and the Employer by an equal number of trustees as provided in an agreement establishing such Pension Fund.
In the event the New Hire Benefit goes into effect as provided herein, then effective with hours worked after the adoption of such Benefit, the Employer shall pay an additional ten cents ($0.10) per hour for all hours worked at straight time (including hours worked on Sunday, vacation and holiday hours paid) to fund the benefit.
Section J18. Long-Term Funding Policy
1.	The trustees shall, no later than April 1, 2005, adopt the following Long Term Funding Policy. Such Long Term Funding Policy shall be applicable for plan year 2005 and subsequent plan years. Effective as of March 27,2005 and commencing with the April contribution payment, the employerswill increase the hourly contribution by $.15 per hour from $1.36 to $1.51 for employees hired before ratification.
33
This $0.15 per hour increase in contribution is a "supplemental" contribution dedicated solely to improving the funding of the pension plan, will not be used to increase benefits and will be discontinued at the times set forth in paragraph 2.
2.	This supplemental contribution shall continue to be made until the earlier of such time the Plan reaches a financial state whereby either: (i) the funding ratio of the Plan (actuarial value of assets over actuarial liability) is at least 100%; or any contribution of the employers would not be deductible for federal income tax purposes in the year in which it is required to be made. However, unless changes are needed to support contribution deductibility, no changes shall be made when the Plan has withdrawal liability.
Effective January 1, 2010 (December hours) the supplemental contribution provided above in subsections 1 and 2 shall no longer apply and shall be replaced by any supplemental contribution that may be provided in the Pension Protection Act section of this agreement.
3.	I fas of any valuation date commencing with the 01701/06 valuation, a funding deficiency is projected to
occur in less than 5 years, the Trustees will reduce benefits such that a projected funding deficiency will not occur within any of the 8 years following the valuation date. The parties agree to apply for section 412(e) relief if available before the benefit reductions are enacted. It is understood that application for section 412(e) requires the parties to reduce benefits as a condition of the application. Such section 412(e) application, if approved, must cure the funding deficiency as prescribed above.
If the section 412(e) application is not approved, or not acted on, within 18 months ofthe valuation date (for example 01/01 /06 valuation), then the Trustees will immediately enact benefit reductions to cure the funding deficiency as prescribed above.
4.	In no event will benefit reductions be delayed to or beyond a time diat would expose the employers to liability beyond the supplemental contribution including but not limited to liability for the payment of excise taxes or additional contributions. Any deadlocked issue over the enactment ofbenefit reductions and/or the application of this policy shall be submitted to expedited arbitration ahead of any other matter pending arbitration. Such expedited arbitration shall occur within 60 days ofthe request for arbitration and the arbitrator shall render his decision within 60 days following the close of the hearing in the matter.
5.	The parties authorize and direct the Trustees of the Plan to develop Maintenance of Equity Policy for employers that do not adopt this agreement upon renewal of the collective bargaining agreement (or for new agreements).
6.	I f the Plan experiences a minimum funding deficiency, any excise tax that is levied against the employers will be allocated amongst such employers in a way that first makes all employers not contributing the full amount of the supplemental contribution responsible for fully paying any accumulated missed supplemental contributions with interest. Thereafter, the balance of any excise tax remaining will be allocated to all employers in proportion to their non-supplemental contribution rate. Finally, for any employer not adopting this agreement, future benefits will be based on the assumption that $. 15 ofthe current rate being contributed is deemed to be supplemental.
7.	The parties recognize there is a possibility of merger ofthe Denver Area Meatcutters Pension Fund with the Rocky Mountain UFCW Union and Employers Pension Plan and give full authority to effectuate such merger to the Board of Trustees of the two pension plans without further approval of the parties of this Agreement.
34
Section 119. Said Pension Fund shall be used to provide benefit pensions for eligible employees of the Employer as provided in a Pension Plan, the terms and provisions of which are to be agreed upon by the parties hereto; said Pension Plan shall, among other things, provide that all benefits under the Plan and costs, charges and expenses of administering the Plan and all taxes levied or assessed upon or in respect of said Plan or Trust or any income there from shall be paid out of the Pension Fund.
Section 120. Said Pension Plan and Trust Agreement establishing the Pension Fund have been submitted to the United States Treasury Department and the United States Department of Labor for the approval and rulings satisfactory to the Employer, that said Plan is qualified under l.R.C. Section 401, et seq. and that no part of such payments shall be included in the regular rate of pay of any employee.
Section 121, If, for any reason, the United States Treasury Department and the United States Department of Labor withholds approval and rulings satisfactory to the Employer, the parties to this Agreement hereto agree to negotiate other fringe benefits or wage increases in the amount equal to the cents per hour provided for in this Article for all hours worked at straight-time in lieu of payments into the Pension Fund.
Section 122. The Employer shal I be represented by its employees, or some other representative on the Board of Trustees administering such Pension Plan. A copy of the Trust Agreement and any amendments thereto shall be made a part hereto as if herein at length set forth, when adopted.
Section 123. Pension Protection Act (“PPA”) The bargaining parties agree and understand that the Employer may be obligated to make pension contributions in addition to the base contribution rate specified in the Employer Contributions Section. The amount of any such supplemental contribution shall be determined as follows:
i.	Alternate Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule attached hereto as Appendix B, the Employer shall pay the contribution rate required in the Alternate Schedule (modified only as provided herein) of one dollar and fifty one cents ($1.51) per hour effective January 1, 2010 (on December hours) w hich includes the rate of eighty nine cents ($0.89) per hour described in the Employer Contribution section above and a supplemental contribution of sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour. In the event the New Hire Benefit goes into effect as provided herein, then effective with hours worked after the adoption of such Benefit, the Employer shall pay a total contribution rate of one dollar and sixty one cents ($1.61) per hour, which reflects the sum of the contribution rate required in the Employer Contribution section, the supplemental contribution rate of this section and the new hire benefit contribution rate provided herein.
ii.	Default Schedule Contribution Rate: In the event the Trustees of the Plan do not adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule, but instead adopt a legally valid “Default Schedule” within the meaning of the PPA, the Employer shall pay the contribution rate required under the Default Schedule effective January 1, 2010 (on December hours); provided that in no event shall such contribution rate be payable prior to the effective date of al) of the benefit adjustments required under the Default Schedule. For example, if the Default Schedule benefit adjustments do not become effective until the start of the Rehabilitation Period under the PPA, the Employer shall not be required to pay the Default Schedule contribution rates until that time.
35
If any required Default Schedule contribution rate exceeds the rate provided for under subsection (i) above, then each annual increase in the top pay rate provided for in this contract shall be permanently reduced by fifteen cents ($0.15) per hour, and ten cents ($0.10) per hour in the case of Courtesy Clerks, effective with the next scheduled pay rate increase following the implementation of the Default Schedule contribution rate. The permanent reductions provided for herein shall continue year after year. It is understood that each annual top rate increase will be reduced until either sufficient reductions have occurred so as to equal the amount of the increase to the supplemental contribution rate of subsection (i) caused by the implementation of the default schedule or until the date on which the employer implements contribution rates which are reduced to, or below, the contribution rates under subsection (i) above and in accordance with subsection (vii) below, whichever occurs first, but in no event shall any such wage reductions made be restored.
iii.	Long-Term Funding Policy Contribution Rates: In the event the Alternate Schedule in subsection (i) above and the Default Schedule in subsection (ii) above are not applicable during the term of this agreement, but the Long-Term Funding Policy is implemented, the Employer shall not be obligated to pay a supplemental contribution under any other provision of this Agreement, but shall continue to pay the base contribution specified in the Employer Contribution Section plus a supplemental contribution under this subsection (iii) that shall not exceed sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour. This supplemental contribution shall be a contribution amount which has the same proportionate value relative to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy as the value of the supplemental contribution of sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour under subsection (i) has to the value of the benefit adjustments under the Alternate Schedule. This approach shall be accomplished by utilizing the following formula: a) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy, divided by b) the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternative Schedule, multiplied by c) the supplemental contribution of sixty two cents ($0.62) per hour under subsection (i). These calculations shall be made by the employer consultants and shall be final and binding on all parties.
For example: If $5M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Long Term Funding Policy and if $10M is the present value of benefit adjustments under the Alternative Schedule and sixty-two cents ($0.62) per hour is the supplemental contribution under subsection (i), then the supplemental contribution under this subsection (iii) is $0.62 times $5M divided by $10M, or thirty-one cents ($0.31) per hour.
iv.	It is understood and agreed that the Employer may reduce the amount of any of the above supplemental contributions due the Trust (but not below zero) by the amount of any surcharge, deficiency or excise tax required to be paid by the Employer any time after entering Critical Status. The supplemental contribution provided for herein shall be dedicated solely to improving the funding of the Plan, and shall not be used to increase or improve benefits, and will be reduced or discontinued upon determination by the Plan’s Trustees, based on projections provided by the Plan’s actuaries, that such supplemental contributions are no longer needed to support the level of benefits provided for under the Plan in accordance with the provisions of subsection (vii) below.
36
v.	As a result of the Plan's having been certified as being in critical status for the Plan Year beginning January 1,2009, the Trustees are authorized to adopt the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule attached as Appendix B hereto (if they believe it is appropriate to do so). If the Alternate Schedule is adopted by the Trustees, it is hereby deemed approved by the bargaining parties and automatically incorporated into this Agreement.
vi.	In no event shall any contribution increases be required during the term of this Agreement as a result of any annual updates or other changes to the Rehabilitation Plan Alternate Schedule or, if applicable, to any Default Schedule.
vii. In the event the Trustees determine, based on projections provided by the actuaries for the Plan, that, at any time during the term of this Agreement, an Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule with lesser contribution rates and/or benefit reductions would be sufficient to reasonably enable the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, the Trustees may amend the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule in a manner that, to the extent possible, would restore reduced benefits and would reduce the Employer’s supplemental contribution in an equal manner and amount, based on actuarial equivalence, provided that such modifications to the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule would still allow the Plan to emerge from critical status by the end of the Rehabilitation Period, taking into account to the extent legally permitted any relief available under IRC Section 431(d). In the event the Trustees amend the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule as provided in this subsection (vii), then the parties agree to adjust the supplemental contribution rates provided above to reflect the lower rates in the amended Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the effective date of any benefit cuts specified in the Alternate Schedule or the Default Schedule, the Trustees determine that (a) such benefit cuts are no longer required to avoid critical status or to have a valid Rehabilitation Plan, and (b) the supplemental contribution could be reduced or eliminated, then the Employer supplemental contribution shall be reduced or eliminated accordingly, and the Employer shall be further entitled to recoup the value of any supplemental contribution paid prior to the effective date of the benefit reductions set forth in the Alternate Schedule or Default Schedule. This provision shall apply regardless of the reason for the Trustees’ determination, including a change in the law (e.g., a further extension of the Plan’s green status) and/or improved investment returns. The value of the contributions shall be recouped via a suspension of contributions in an amount equal to the amount of the supplemental contribution paid.
viii. The Board of Trustees is authorized to take all reasonable measures to cooperate and assist in achieving the objectives set forth in this Section.
Meat New Hire Benefit:

Any extensions of this ninety (90) day period must be agreed upon in writing and signed by the employee, a representative of the Union and the Employer. In no case will such extension exceed a total of six (6) months from the date the employee accepted the layoff.
If an employee is offered a transfer to other employment with the Employer within forty (40) miles ofthe store or plant in which he was last working and he refuses to accept the transfer or other employment with the Employer he forfeits his rights to severance pay and Pension and Health and Welfare contributions.
If a store or plant is sold and the successor Employer offers employment to an employee who is otherwise eligible for severance pay under the terms of this Article and the new job is comparable, then no provisions of this Article shall apply.
The Employer agrees to give to the employees and the Union two (2) weeks' notice in advance of a store or plant closing or sale. When such notice is given, an employee shall remain with the Employer until the plant or store closes, or forfeit his rights under this Article, unless mutually agreed to by the employee, Employer and Union.
No benefits shall accrue under the terms of this Article unless the Employer makes a business decision to close or sell a store or plant. If a store or plant closing is caused by fire, flood, storm, land condemnation or remodeling, then this Article shall not apply.

APPENDIX "A"
The minimum hourly rates of pay for the indicated classifications shall be as set forth below on the dates indicated. The Employer may hire any employee at any rate in the progression schedule at its sole discretion.
Rate Determination
Employees hired before March 27, 2005 who remain in their classification after commencement of this Agreement shall be paid in accordance with the "hired and assigned in the bargaining unit prior to March 27, 2005" wage schedule while they remain in that classification.
Demotions, Step Downs and layoffs: An employee who is demoted, steps down, or who is laid off in accordance with this Agreement, shall be placed back into the same wage schedule in which the employee was working immediately prior to their assignment into management or promotion into the classification from which they are being demoted, stepping down or laid off. In determining the proper progression level for an employee demoted, stepping down, or laid off from a classification with a higher "thereafter" hourly rate to a classification with a lower "thereafter" hourly rate, such affected employee shall be placed in the appropriate progression level in the rate schedule referenced in this paragraph based on their experience in the newly assigned classification, regardless of whether such assigned rate results in a reduction in hourly rate. In determining prior experience hereunder, the Employer will give recognition to the verified number of hours of actual work experience in the same classification which said employee may have performed for the Employer and the verified number of hours of actual work experience on a comparable job which said employee may have performed within the previous five (5) years for any other employer in a similar retail grocery operation.
Rate Determination - Promotions, new hires and new entrants into the bargaining unit: Employees hired into, or assigned to, or promoted to a different classification, the bargaining unit on or after March 27, 2005 shall be assigned to the "EMPLOYEES HIRED INTO THE BARGAINING UNIT OR ASSIGNED OR PROMOTED ON OR AFTER March 27,2005" wage scale. Employees who are promoted to a different classification after March 26,2005 shall not receive a reduction in their hourly rate of pay if when promoted to such classification they are being paid an hourly rate of pay greater than the minimum, unless they are above the "thereafter" hourly rate in which case they will immediately be paid the "thereafter" hourly rate. When such employee is paid less than the "thereafter" hourly rate, prior to receiving an increase in their hourly rate of pay, they must work 1,040 hours at theircurrent rate before promotion to the hourly rate in the new classification that would give them an increase in their hourly rate of pay.
Ratification Bonus: Effective no later than the second Sunday following ratification, all employees who have been continuously employed for one consecutive year, to the date of ratification, shall receive a gift card (net of taxes) equal to SI,000 for top rate FT employees, $500 for top rate PT employees, $400 for employees in wage progression and $150 for Courtesy Clerks.

January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2022.
Plan to Emerge from the Red Zone and Annual Benchmarks to Assess Progress Toward Emergence_________________________________________________________________________
The Plan’s actuaries certify that the Contribution and Benefit Adjustments shown above are sufficient for the Plan to emerge from the Red Zone at the end of the Rehabilitation Period based on the funded status ofthe Plan as of January 1,2009 before the addition of any New Hire benefits. In the event that the New Hire benefits are implemented, the Plan’s actuaries certify that with the additional contributions specifically designated to
72
fund the New Hire benefits, the plan is still reasonably expected toemerge from Critical Status after such benefit increases, as shown in the annual benchmarks including the New Hire benefits. These schedules will be updated as needed throughout the Rehabilitation Period. Progress toward emergence from the Red Zone will be measured by the Plan’s Funding Standard Account Credit (Deficiency) Balance being greater than (less than) the amounts in the following projections. These projections have been made in accordance with the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 including:
•	Contribution rates in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement effective for hours worked in December 2009 payable in January 2010.
•	An assumption of the same number of contributable hours as reported for the actuarial valuation as of 1/1/2008. The reasonableness of this assumption has been verified by the Trustees.
»	No market related investment gains or losses from 9/30/2009 forward and no other actuarial gains or losses from 1/1/2009 forward.

Safeway agrees to carry forward the specific Letters of Understanding as listed below. Any Letter not referenced below shall be deemed null and void.
1.	B-l Employees reinstated under terms of Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program Agreement reached as a result of an Agreement reached as a result of a meeting held on March 31,1983, between Charles Mercer, UFCW 7 and Rex Berry, Safeway.
As a result of a meeting held on March 31, 1983 between Charles Mercer and Rex Berry, the following terms and conditions have been agreed upon regarding future letters of agreement concerning employees re-instated under the terms of our Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program.
1.	The employee must enroll in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program recognized by the State and/or Federal Government.
2.	The employee must sign a release which permits Safeway Stores, Inc. and Retail Clerks Union, Local 7 access to any and all information related to his/her treatment required by, or undertaken in, the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program. Safeway Stores, Inc. has the right in its discretion, to obtain status reports from the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program Organization.
3.	Any employee terminated from Safeway Stores, Inc. for any reason, who later claims to be an alcoholic, will not be entitled to any back pay should the employee be reinstated under this policy.
4.	The Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program shall not in any way interfere with the written work schedule at the employee’s place of employment.
5.	Any employee enrolled in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program is still subject to progressive discipline for any infraction of Safeway Stores, Inc. rules, regulations, or policies, and remains subject to the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
6.	Safeway Stores, Inc. shall not be liable for any expense associated with an employee's enrollment in an Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program.
7.	Should an employee violate any provision of the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program, the Company
and the union will review the violation to determine if there are any highly unusual circumstances which might warrant continuation in the program. If there are no such circumstances, the employee shall be terminated immediately.
8.	Upon enrolling in the Alcoholic Rehabilitation Program, the employee shall be reinstated, but the employee will not necessarily be assigned his/her place of employment from which he/she was terminated. Safeway Stores, Inc. reserves the right to reinstate an employee to a place of employment which best serves the operational interest of Safeway Stores, Inc.
9.	Reinstatement shall be no later than two full weeks after the agreement is signed, or two full weeks after a "dry-out period", if required by the treating physician.
77

2.	B-3	Procedure for Scheduling Employees with Conscientious Objections to Working on Their Day of
Sabbath. Unsigned and Undated agreement between Safeway and UFCW Local 7.
PROCEDURE FOR SCHEDULING EMPLOYEES WITH CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTIONS TO WORKING ON THEIR DAY OF SABBATH
We have had a number of requests for the procedure in the handling of employees scheduled on a day which is their day of Sabbath. Safeway has entered into an agreement with UFCW which provides certain procedures for accommodating individuals who have such conscientious objections.
Problems can result in a grievance under the contract as well as a possible violation of the laws against discrimination on the basis of religion, so please follow these procedures carefully and call Safeway Inc. Human Resources if necessary.
This procedure, of course, applies only to any employee who advised you:
1.	that they have conscientious objections to working a particular day of the week.
2.	the nature of their conscientious objections, and
3.	the particular day of the week which they are unable to work.
If you have any questions concerning whether the employee actually has bona fide conscientious objections, be certain to contact Employee Relations and review the matter. You also should complete the form attached to these instructions, ask the employee to sign it, and route it to Safeway Inc. Human Resources Department for future reference.
The procedure for scheduling is as follows:
1.	Until noon on Saturday for the following week's schedule an employee may identify and request an exchange of shifts with any employee junior to him in the same job classification in the store which will result in the employee obtaining their Sabbath as a day off. You may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail, and the junior employee cannot refuse to make the trade.
2.	As an option, an employee may identify and request an exchange of shi fts with a senior employee who is willing to make such an exchange. Again, you may deny this request if the exchange would require an employee to perform duties for which they are not trained, or for some other equally substantial business reason. Otherwise you must grant the request. Seniority shall prevail and the senior employee may refuse to make the trade.
78
3.
As a third alternative, an employee may simply decline to work on their day of Sabbath if they cannot trade shifts with anyone else. Such an employee will not be disciplined under the Absenteeism Program except for failure to notify the Company prior to a scheduled shift that he will not work on their day of Sabbath. You will then assess points for failure to call, but not for the absence itself.
4. Ifan employee cannot make a change of shifts and is scheduled on their day of Sabbath for the entire bid period or for any extended period of time, it is permissible for that employee to advise you at the beginning of the bid period or other extended period of time that they will not work on such day for the entire three months. Such an employee, if full-time, will not in fact be scheduled 40 hours, but 32 hours. The Company has no obligation to provide 40 hours work under these circumstances.
Attached you will find a form for keeping a record of any such scheduling accommodation.
It is very important that we follow these procedures and complete the attached form in the event we are challenged on our application of the settlement agreement.

6.	Transfers and Seniority. Agreement added to all Colorado Meat bargaining units between Safeway and Meat Cutters Union Local 634 (now UFCW Local 7).

In the event the transferred employee is laid off in the new location, then the transferred employee shall retain the right to return to the area from which the employee transferred during this thirty (30) day period in the new bargaining unit.
It is agreed that this provision shall become effective on January 10, 1978, and shall not be retroactive for employees who have previously transferred into a new bargaining unit.
7.	Layoff Procedures, Colorado Springs retail clerks and meat bargaining units. Clarifies layoff procedures in Section 75 of ihe retail clerks contract and Section 97 of the retail meat contract for the Colorado
80
Springs bargaining units. Signed by Bruce Trull, Safeway on 12/18/94 and Michael Belo, UFCW Local 7 on fl/23/94.
1.	This agreement pertains to the implementation of layoff procedures in Section 97 of the retail meat contract and Section 75 ofthe retail clerks contract for the Colorado Springs bargaining units.
2.	The purpose of this agreement is to ensure that to the greatest extent possible in circumstances when multiple layoffs are necessary, the Company will operate the layoff procedures in Section 97 (retail meat) and Section 75 (retail clerks) so that the least senior employees in the bargaining unit will be the employees who are laid off. Therefore, the Company will discontinue its current practice. Instead, the Company will complete the process of offering and having the employee choose the layoff options with the first affected employee before going to the second affected employee, then will complete the layoff options with the second affected employee before going to the next employee, and so forth.
3.	Time limit for exercising options. When a reduction in the work force is necessary, the Company will notify the affected employee of his/her options in accordance with Section 97 of the retail meal contract of Section 75 ofthe retail clerks contract. If the affected person is notified of his/her layoff options before 11:00 a.m., the affected person must inform the Company's designated representative (the district secretary, store manager, or other person handling the matter for the Company) of his/her chosen option by no later than 4:00 p.m. on the same day. If the affected person is notified of his/her options after 11:()0 a.m., the affected person must inform the Company's representative of the chosen option by 8:30 a.m. on the next day. These are outside time limits, and the affected person is free to inform the Company of which option he/she chooses sooner than these time limits.
4.	Effect of not exercising option within time limits. If the affected person does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits set forth above, the affected person will be deemed to have exercised the first option specified in Section 97 (retail meal) or Section 75 (retail clerks) that is available, assuming that the affected person qualifies for such option when the contract requires qualifications. For example, if a retail clerk employee does not notify the Company of his/her chosen option within the time limits, he/she will be deemed to have chosen the option in Section 75 of displacing a less senior employee within the same classification in the store or, if such option is unavailable, of displacing the least senior employee within the same classification in the bargaining unit.
5.	The Company will implement this procedure as soon as possible. If either party wishes to discontinue this agreement, it may do so after it has given written notice of at least 30 days to the other party.

8)
When it is necessary' to work additional hours, the additional hours shall first be offered by seniority to employees within the affected classification and store who are scheduled less than 40 hours. If these hours cannot be filled, the Company will offer the hours by seniority to employees within the affected classification within the bargaining unit who are scheduled less than 40 hours. And, if it is still necessary to fill the additional hours of work needed, the Company will offer the hours by seniority to employees within the affected classification who are scheduled less than 40 hours in the above-described bargaining units.

ARBITRATION SCHEDULING
Letter of Understanding
Between
Safeway Inc. and UFCW Local 7
19.	During the course of our negotiations for new collective bargaining agreements for Denver, Pueblo and
Colorado Springs for the period from to, United Food and Commercial Workers
Local 7 (the Union) and Safeway Inc. (the Company) discussed their mutual desire to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the parties’ administration of the grievance and arbitration process in our labor agreements. These discussions reflected both parties’ belief that a well managed grievance procedure is a cornerstone of any mature collective bargaining relationship and is the responsibility of both labor and management.
Our discussion was open and honest and was forward-looking. Our objective was not to assess blame for why the process had not lived up to expectations in the past, but rather, to use the past as a learning experience for the future. Within this context, the parties have agreed to the following grievance procedure administration guidelines which we believe will help us achieve the type of grievance procedure the Company, the Union and the employees who work under the agreements deserve:
1.	The leadership of Local 7 has committed to “taking a second look” at the backlog of pending grievances to see whether any can be withdrawn or settled. There is no obligation on Local 7 to withdraw any grievance it believes has merit, only to determine whether each grievance has merit and deserves to move forward. Local 7 believes this process can be accomplished by
2.	Additionally, the parties recognize that the information requests that routinely accompany grievances filed by Local 7 can be burdensome and time consuming for the Company to respond to, which in turn impacts the effective and efficient administration of the grievance procedure. Accordingly, Local 7 has committed to reviewing the information requests it has accompanying pending grievances as well as information requests it may file with future grievances to determine w hether the information requests can appropriately be withdrawn or tailored more narrowly in scope.
3.	The parties also agree to schedule monthly settlement meetings at which the parties will discuss the possible settlement or withdrawal of grievances pending arbitration.
4.	The parties will work from an agenda containing cases pending arbitration ranked in order of date filed w ith the exception that cases involving termination, demotion, or potential continuing liability shall be moved to the top of the agenda in date order and shall be discussed before any other case. The agenda will be prepared one week from the date of the meeting and may then only he modified by agreement of the parties.
5.	The parties will endeavor to discuss as many cases as can reasonably be considered at each monthly settlement meeting.
a.	Cases that are settled or dropped/withdrawn by the Union shall be removed from the agenda and shall be deemed closed.
89
b.	Cases that are continued at the monthly settlement meeting pending further review or investigation shall remain on the agenda for discussion at future monthly settlement meetings.
c.	Cases that have been discussed by not resolved may. at the option of the grieving part)', be scheduled for arbitration as provided below.
6.	Grievances refereed to arbitration shall be placed in the scheduling queue and scheduled for hearing as follows:
a.	Cases shall be scheduled from the scheduling queue in order of their respective grievance filing date with the understanding termination or demotion cases shall move to the front of the scheduling queue in date order.
b.	The party requesting arbitration shall promptly request a panel of arbitrators from FMCS for each case placed in the scheduling queue.
c.	Within sixty (60) days after a final settlement meeting decision, the parties will select an arbitrator.
d.	The parties will use best efforts to schedule the hearing in the matter for which an arbitrator has been appointed within six (6) months following a final settlement meeting decision with the understanding that the parties may schedule a hearing a date later than six (6) months upon mutual agreement or as the result of 6(e) below.
e.	N’otw ithstanding the provisions of 6(d) above, neither party shall be required or obligated to schedule more than three (3) cases per calendar month except by mutual agreement.
f.	In all disciplinary cases referred to arbitration, as a condition to accepting appointment, the arbitrator must agree to render a decision and award no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the parties’ post hearing statements. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, such statements must be filed no later than fourteen (14) days following the close of the hearing (or receipt of transcript where applicable) and must be limited to no more than ten (10) single space letter size pages. It is specifically agreed and understood that any such case resolved under this procedure shall be deemed “nonprecedential” and will not be cited by either party in any future proceeding. The provisions of this subsection (e) may be modified on a case by case basis by mutual agreement of the parties.
The Company’s Director of Labor Relations and the Union President will retain jurisdiction over this letter of understanding and may, by mutual agreement, modify this letter of understanding as they deem necessary and appropriate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the agreements’ grievance and arbitration process. Any such modifications must be in writing and signed by both parties.

WEINGARTEN RULES
Under the Supreme Court's Weingarten decision, when an investigatory interview occurs, you should ask if it is for disciplinary action. If so, the following rules apply:
Rule I: The employee must make a clear request for union representation before or during the interview. The employee cannot be punished for making this request.
Rule II: After the employee makes the request, the Employer must choose from among three options. The Employer must either:
A.	Grant the request and delay questioning until the union representative arrives and has a chance to consult privately with the employee, or
B.	Deny the request and end the interview immediately, or
C.	Give the employee a choice of:
(1)	having the interview without representation or
(2)	ending the interview.
Rule III: If the Employer denies the request for union representation, and continues to ask questions, it commits an unfair labor practice and the employee has a right to refuse to answer. The Employer may not discipline the employee for such a refusal.

DO NOT GO SUSPENDED!!!
