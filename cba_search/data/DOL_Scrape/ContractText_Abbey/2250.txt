NATIONAL MASTER FREIGHT AGREEMENT
For the Period of April 1, 2008 through March 31,2013
covering:
Operations in, between and over all of the states, territories and possessions of the United States, and operations into and out of all contiguous territory.
The(Company or Association) hereinafter referred to as the EMPLOYER and the TEAMSTERS NATIONAL FREIGHT INDUSTRY NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE representing Local Unions affiliated with the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS, and Local Union No.— ----which Local Union is an affiliate of the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS, agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 1. PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT
Section 1.	Employers Covered
The Employer consists of Associations, members of Associations who have given authorization to the Associations to represent them in the negotiation and/or execution of this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements, and individual Employers who become signator to this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements as hereinafter set forth. The signator Associations enter into this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements as hereinafter set forth. The signator Associations represent that they are duly authorized to enter into this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements on behalf of their members under and as limited by their authorizations as submitted prior to negotiations.
- 1 -
Article 1, Section 2
Section 2.	Unions Covered
The Union consists of any Local Union which may become a party to this Agreement and any Supplemental Agreement as hereinafter set forth. Such Local Unions are hereinafter designated as “Local Union.” In addition to such Local Unions, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee representing Local Unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, hereinafter referred to as the “National Union Committee,” is also a party to this Agreement and the agreements supplemental hereto.
Section 3.	Transfer of Company Title or Interest
The Employer’s obligations under this Agreement including Supplements shall be binding upon its successors, administrators, executors and assigns. The Employer agrees that the obligations of this Agreement shall be included in the agreement of sale, transfer or assignment of the business. In the event an entire active or inactive operation, or a portion thereof, or rights only, are sold, leased, transferred or taken over by sale, transfer, lease, assignment, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings, such operation or use of rights shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the life thereof. Transactions covered by this provision include stock sales or exchanges, mergers, consolidations, spin-offs or any other method by which a business is transferred.
It is understood by this Section that the signator Employer shall not sell, lease or transfer such run or runs or rights to a third party to evade this Agreement. In the event the Employer fails to require the purchaser, transferee, or lessee to assume the obligations of this Agreement, as set forth above, the Employer (including partners thereof) shall be liable to the Local Union(s) and to the employees covered for all damages sustained as a result of such failure to require the assumption of the terms of this Agreement until its expiration date, but shall not be liable after the purchaser, the transferee or lessee has agreed to assume the obligations of this Agreement. The obligations set forth above shall not apply in the event of the sale, lease or transfer of a portion of the rights comprising less than all of the signator Employer’s rights to a non-signator company unless the purpose is to evade this Agreement. Corporate reorganizations by a signatory Employer, occurring during the term of this
-2-
Artlclel, Section 3
Agreement, shall not relieve the signatory Employer or the reorganized Employer of the obligations of this Agreement during its term.
When a signator to this Agreement purchases rights from another signator, the provisions of Article 5 shall apply. The applicable layoff provisions of this Agreement shall apply.
The Employer shall give notice of the existence of this Agreement to any purchaser, transferee, lessee, assignee, or other entity involved in the sale, merger, consolidation, acquisition, transfer, spin-off, lease or other transaction by which the operation covered by this Agreement or any part thereof, including rights only, may be transferred. Such notice shall be in writing, with a copy to the Local Union, at the time the seller, transferor or lessor makes the purchase and sale negotiation known to the public or executes a contract or transaction as herein described, whichever first occurs. The Local Union shall also be advised of the exact nature of the transaction, not including financial details.
The term rights shall include routes and runs.
ARTICLE 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
Section 1.	Master Agreement
The execution of this National Master Freight Agreement on the part of the Employer shall apply to all operations of the Employer which are covered by this Agreement and shall have application to the work performed within the classifications defined and set forth in the Agreements supplemental hereto.
Section 2.	Supplements to Master Agreement
(a)	There are several segments of the trucking industry covered by this Agreement and for this reason Supplemental Agreements are provided for each of the specific types of work performed by the various classifications of employees controlled by this Master Agreement.
-3-
Article 2, Section 2
All such Supplemental Agreements are subject to and controlled by the terms of this Master Agreement and are sometimes referred to herein as “Supplemental Agreements.”
All such Supplemental Agreements are to be clearly limited to the specific classifications of work as enumerated or described in each individual Supplement.
In all cases involving the transfer of work and/or the merger of operations subject to the provisions of Article 8, Section 6 or Article 5, Section 2, where more than one Supplemental Agreement is involved and one or more of them contains provisions contrary to those set forth in Article 8, Section 6 or Article 5, Sections 2, the applicable terms and conditions of the NMFA shall supersede those of the contrary Supplemental Agreements, including the resolution of any seniority related grievances that may arise following approval of the involved transfer of work and/or merger of operations.
(b)	The parties shall establish four (4) Regional Area Iron and Steel and/or Truckload Supplements to the National Master Freight Agreement.
The Employer and the Local Union, parties to this Agreement, may enter into an agreement whereby road drivers working under an Over-The-Road Supplemental Agreement have the opportunity to perform work covered by and subject to the above Regional Area Supplements, under conditions agreed upon. Such Supplement shall be submitted to the appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee.
(c)	The jurisdiction covered by the National Master Freight Agreement and its various Supplements thereto includes, without limitation, stuffing, stripping, loading and discharging of cargo or containers. This does not include loading or discharging of cargo or containers to or from vessels except in those instances where such work is presently being performed. Existing practices, rules and understandings, between the Employer and the Union, with respect to this work shall continue except to the extent modified by mutual agreement.
-4-
Article 2, Section 3
Section 3.	Non-covered Units
This Agreement shall not be applicable to those operations of the Employer where the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with a Union not signatory to this Agreement, or to those employees who have not designated a signatory Union as their collective bargaining agent.
Card Check
(a)	When a majority of the eligible employees performing work covered by an Agreement designated by the National Negotiating Committee to be Supplemental to the National Master Freight Agreement execute a card authorizing a signatory Local Union to represent them as their collective bargaining agent at the terminal location, then, such employees shall automatically be covered by this Agreement and the applicable Supplemental Agreements. If an Employer refuses to recognize the Union as above set forth and the matter is submitted to the National Labor Relations Board or any mutually agreed upon process for determination and such determination results in certification or recognition of the Union, all benefits of this Agreement and applicable Supplements shall be retroactive to the date of demand for recognition. In such cases the parties may by mutual agreement negotiate wages and conditions, subject to Regional Joint Area Committee approval.
The parties agree that a constructive bargaining relationship is essential to efficient operations and sound employee relations. The parties recognize that organizational campaigns occur in bargaining relationships and that both parties are free to accurately state their respective positions concerning the organization of certain groups of employees. However, the parties also recognize that campaigns must be waged on the facts only. Accordingly, the parties will not engage in any personal attacks against Union or Company representatives or attacks against the Union or Company as an institution during the course of any such campaign.
Additions to Operations: Over-The-Road and Local Cartage Supplemental Agreements
(b)	Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the provisions of the National Master Freight Agreement and the applicable Over-the-
- 5 -
Article 2, Section 3
Road and Local Cartage Supplemental Agreements shall be applied without evidence of union representation of the employees involved, to all subsequent additions to, and extensions of, current operations which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as a part of such current operation, and newly established terminals and consolidations of terminals which are controlled and utilized as a part of such current operation.
If an Employer refuses to recognize the Union as above set forth and the matter is submitted to the National Labor Relations Board or any mutually agreed-upon process for determination, and such determination results in certification or recognition of the Union, all benefits of this Agreement and applicable Supplements shall be retroactive to the date of demand for recognition.
The provisions of Article 32 - Subcontracting, shall apply to this paragraph. Extensions or additions to current operations, etc., which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as part of such current operation shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Change of Operations Committee for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of Article 8, Section 6 - Change of Operations, apply and, if so, to what extent.
Section 4.	Single Bargaining Unit
The employees, Unions, Employers and Associations covered under this Master Agreement and the various Supplements thereto shall constitute one (1) bargaining unit and contract. It is understood that the printing of this Master Agreement and the aforesaid Supplements in separate Agreements is for convenience only and is not intended to create separate bargaining units.
This National Master Freight Agreement applies to city and road operations, and other classifications of employment authorized by the signatory Employers to be represented by Employer Associations or Employers, where applicable, participating in national collective bargaining. The common problems and interest, with respect to basic terms and conditions of employment, have resulted in the creation of the National Master Freight Agreement and the respective Supplemental Agreements. Accordingly, the Associa
-6-
Article 2, Section 4
tions and Employers, parties to this Agreement, acknowledge that they constitute a single national multi-employer collective bargaining unit, composed of the Associations named hereinafter and those Employers authorizing such associations to represent them for the purpose of collective bargaining, and solely to the extent of such authorization, and such other individual employers which have, or may, become parties to this Agreement.
Section 5.	Riders
Upon the effective date of this Agreement, all existing or previously adopted Riders which provide less than the wages, hours, and working conditions specifically established by this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements shall become null and void. Thereafter, the specific provisions of this Agreement and applicable Supplemental Agreements shall apply without being subject to variance by Riders. This Section shall not be applied or interpreted to eliminate operational, dispatch, or working rules not specifically set forth in this Agreement and Supplemental Agreements.
ARTICLE 3. RECOGNITION, UNION SHOP AND CHECKOFF
Section 1.	Recognition
(a)	The Employer recognizes and acknowledges that the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee and Local Unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters are the exclusive representatives of all employees in the classifications of work covered by this National Master Freight Agreement, and those Supplements thereto approved by the Joint National Negotiating Committees for the purpose of collective bargaining as provided by the National Labor Relations Act.
Subject to Article 2, Section 3 - Non-covered Units, this provision shall apply to all present and subsequently acquired over-the-road and local cartage operations and terminals of the Employer.
This provision shall not apply to wholly-owned and wholly inde
- 7 -
Article 3, Section 1
pendently operated subsidiaries which are not under contract with local IBT unions. “Wholly independently operated” means, among other things, that there shall be no interchange of freight, equipment or personnel, or common use, in whole or in part, of equipment, terminals, property, personnel or rights.
Union Shop
(b)	All present employees who are members of the Local Union on the effective date of this subsection or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, shall remain members of the Local Union as a condition of employment. Union membership for purposes of this Agreement, is required only to the extent that employees must pay either (i) the Union's initiation fees and periodic dues or (ii) service fees which in the case of a regular service fee payer shall be equal to the Union’s initiation fees and periodic dues, and in the case of an objecting service fee payer shall be the proportion of the initiation fees and dues corresponding to the portion of the Union’s total expenditures that support representational activities. All present employees who are not members of the Local Union and all employees who are hired hereafter shall become and remain members of the Local Union as a condition of employment on and after the thirty-first (31 st) calendar day following the beginning of their employment or on and after the thirty-first (31 st) calendar day following the effective date of this subsection or the date of this Agreement, whichever is the later. An employee who has failed to acquire, or thereafter maintain, membership in the Union as herein provided, shall be terminated seventy-two (72) hours after his/her Employer has received written notice from an authorized representative of the Local Union, certifying that membership has been, and is continuing to be, offered to such employee on the same basis as all other members and, further, that the employee has had notice and opportunity to make all dues or initiation fee payments. This provision shall be made and become effective as of such time as it may be made and become effective under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, but not retroactively.
For purposes of this Article, “present employees” and “employees who are hired hereafter” shall include “casual employees” as defined in Article 3, Section 2 of this Agreement. Such “casual
-8-
Article 3, Section 1
employees" will be required to join the Union prior to their employment on or after the thirty-first (31st) calendar day following their first (1st) day of employment for any Employer signatory to this Agreement.
Hiring
(c)	When the Employer needs additional employees covered by this Agreement, it shall give the Local Union equal opportunity with all other sources to provide suitable applicants, but the Employer shall not be required to hire those referred by the Local Union. Upon a written request from the referring Local Union, the Employer shall inform the Local Union of whether an applicant is being hired or not hired, or whether no decision has been made. Violations of this subsection shall be subject to the Grievance Committee. It is recognized that the Employer legally is not permitted to share with the Local Union information regarding the reasons for a refusal to hire an applicant.
Any employment examination for applicants must test skills or physical abilities necessary for performance of the work in the job classification in which the applicant will be employed. Violations of this subsection shall be subject to the Grievance Committee.
State Law
(d)	No provision of this Article shall apply in any state to the extent that it may be prohibited by state law. If under applicable state law additional requirements must be met before any such provisions may become effective, such additional requirements shall be first met.
Agency Shop
(e)	If any agency shop clause is permissible in any state where the provisions of this Article relating to the Union Shop cannot apply, the following Agency Clause shall prevail:
(1)	Membership in the Local Union is not compulsory. Employees have the right to join, not join, maintain, or drop their membership in the Local Union, as they see fit. Neither party shall exert any pressure on, or discriminate against, an employee as regards such matters.
-9-
Article 3, Section 1
(2)	Membership in the Local Union is separate, apart and distinct from the assumption by one of his/her equal obligation to the extent that he/she receives equal benefits. The Local Union is required under this Agreement to represent all of the employees in the bargaining unit fairly and equally without regard to whether or not an employee is a member of the Local Union. The terms of this Agreement have been made for all employees in the bargaining unit and not only for members in the Local Union, and this Agreement has been executed by the Employer after it has satisfied itself that the Local Union is the choice of a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit. Accordingly, it is fair that each employee in the bargaining unit pays his/her own way and assume his/her fair share of the obligations along with the grant of equal benefits contained in this Agreement.
(3)	In accordance with the policy set forth under subparagraphs (I) and (2) of this Section, all employees shall, as a condition of continued employment, pay to the Local Union, the employee’s exclusive collective bargaining representative, an amount of money equal to that paid by other employees in the bargaining unit who are members of the Local Union, which shall be limited to an amount of money equal to the Local Union’s regular and usual initiation fees, and its regular and usual dues. For present employees, such payments shall commence thirty-one (31) days following the effective date or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, and for new employees, the payment shall start thirty-one (31) days following the date of employment.
Savings Clause
(f)	If any provision of this Article is invalid under the law of any state wherein this Agreement is executed, such provision shall be modified to comply with the requirements of state law or shall be renegotiated for the purpose of adequate replacement. If such negotiations shall not result in mutually satisfactory agreement, either party shall be permitted all legal or economic recourse.
Employer Recommendation
(g)	In those instances where subsection (b) hereof may not be validly applied, the Employer agrees to recommend to all employees that
- 10-
Article 3, Section 1
they become members of the Local Union and maintain such membership during the life of this Agreement, to refer new employees to the Local Union representative, and to recommend to delinquent members that they pay their dues since they are receiving the benefits of this Agreement.
Business agents shall be permitted to attend new employee orientations in right-to-work states. The sole purpose of the business agent’s attendance is to encourage employees to join the Union.
Future Law
(h)	To the extent such amendment may become permissible under applicable federal and state law during the life of this Agreement as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial determination, all of the provisions of this Article shall be automatically amended to embody the greater Union security provisions contained in the 1947-1949 Central States Area Over-The-Road Motor Freight Agreement, or to apply or become effective in situations not now permitted by law.
No Violation of Law
(i)	Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed so as to require the Employer to violate any applicable law.
Section 2.	Probationary and Casual Employees
(a)	Probationary Employees
(1)	A probationary employee shall work under the provisions of this Agreement, but shall be employed on a trial basis as provided for in each Supplement.
(2)	During the probationary period, the employee may be terminated without further recourse; provided, however, that the Employer may not terminate the employee for the purpose of evading this Agreement or discriminating against Union members. A probationary employee who is terminated by the Employer during the probationary period and is then worked again at any time during the next full twelve (12) months at any of that Employer’s locations within
- 11 -
Article 3, Section 2
the jurisdiction of the Local Union covering the terminal where he/she first worked, except in those jurisdictions where the Local Union maintains a hiring hall or referral system, shall be added to the regular seniority list with a seniority date as of the date that person is subsequently worked. The rules contained in subsection (a) (2) are subject to provisions in the Supplements to the contrary.
(3)	Probationary employees shall be paid at the new hire rate of pay during the probationary period; however, if the employee is terminated by the Employer during such period, he/she shall be compensated at the full contract rate of pay for all hours worked retroactive to the first (1st) day worked in such period.
CDL-qualified employees hired into driving positions who are not currently on the seniority list at an NMFA carrier and who for two (2) or more years regularly performed CDL-required driving work for a commonly-owned NMFA carrier shall be compensated at 90% of the full contract rate of pay for a period of one (1) year and go to the full contractual rate thereafter, provided they have not had a break in service in excess of three (3) years.
(4)	The Union and the Employer may agree to extend the probationary period for no more than thirty (30) days, but the probationary employee must agree to such extension in writing.
(b)	Casual Employees
(1)	A casual employee is an individual who is not on the regular seniority list and who is not serving a probationary period. A casual may be either a replacement casual or a supplemental casual as hereinafter provided. Casuals shall not have seniority status. Casuals shall not be discriminated against for future employment.
(2)	a. Replacement casuals may be utilized by an Employer to replace regular employees when such regular employees are off due to illness, vacation or other absence, except when an absence of a regular employee continues beyond three (3) consecutive months, a replacement casual shall not thereafter be used to fill such absence, unless the Employer and the Local Union mutually agree to the con
- 12 -
Article 3, Section 2
tinued use of a replacement casual. If a CDL-qualified casual filling a position has been regularly employed for a period of six (6) months or more, he will not be required to go through a probationary period if hired into a full-time position.
b. Where the Company is using casuals as vacation replacements for regular employees, and the Area Supplemental Agreement does not provide a method to add regular employees based on the use of casuals to replace vacation absence, the vacation schedules shall be broken into yearly quarters beginning January 1st, and subsequent vacation quarters shall begin on April 1st, July 1st, and October 1st thereafter.
Starting with the quarter beginning April, 1991, and continuing each quarter thereafter, the Employer shall add one (1) additional employee to the regular seniority list for each sixty-five (65) vacation replacement days worked by a casual during each vacation quarter.
The application of this formula shall not result in pyramiding.
New employees shall be placed on the respective seniority lists on the first (1st) day of the following quarter unless there are employees in layoff status, in which case such new employees shall be placed on the respective seniority list at the time the laid-off employees are recalled from layoff status.
Employees shall first be added to the regular seniority list from the preferential list, if applicable. Thereafter, employees to be added to the regular seniority list shall be determined by the respective Supplement and shall be subject to the probationary provisions of that Supplement.
In the application of this formula, employees specifically designated under an appropriate reporting procedure to replace absence other than vacations shall not be included as vacation replacements. It is the intent of the parties, in the application of this formula, to add regular employees to the seniority list to replace employees on vacation where there is regular work opportunity for such additional employees.
- 13-
Article 3, Section 2
The implementation of this provision may raise issues particular to a respective Supplemental Agreement. Failure to resolve the issues, such Supplemental Negotiating Committee may agree to waive this provision, or submit the disputed issues to the National Grievance Committee.
(3)	Supplemental casuals may be used to supplement the regular work force as provided for in each respective Supplement. Once the number of new employees to be added as required in the Supplement is determined, the Employer must initiate the processing of the new probationary employees immediately, and complete such processing as provided for in the Supplements.
(4)	Unless waived in writing by any Joint Supplemental Negotiating Committee, all Supplements shall provide for a preferential casual hiring list and shall provide the qualifications for placement on such list. Casuals on the preferential hiring list shall be offered available extra work and future regular employment in seniority order by classification as among themselves. A preferential casual employee’s seniority date shall be the date he/she becomes a regular employee; and such employee shall not be subject to any probationary period.
Casual employees on the preferential hiring list shall have full access to the grievance procedure.
The provisions of Article 3, Section 3, shall apply to casual employees on the preferential hiring list who are paid on the regular payroll.
Local Unions employing an exclusive hiring hall under the terms of the Supplemental Agreement may petition the respective Joint Area Supplemental Negotiating Committee for approval to waive this subparagraph (4).
(5)	Casual road employees, where permitted by Supplemental Agreement, may only be used within the jurisdiction of their respective Regional Area and shall gain preferential status and/or regular seniority status as provided in the respective Supplement, except on approved two-man operations when the extra boards are exhausted.
- 14-
Article 3, Section 2
(6)	Any casual employee who declines regular employment shall be terminated without recourse and will not be used by the Employer for any further work.
(7)	a. Casual Employment
The Employer agrees to give first opportunity for work as a casual employee to those CDL-qualified employees on layoff at a commonly-owned NMFA carrier. This obligation shall apply only at terminals located within the jurisdiction of the employee’s Local Union. The Local Union will furnish Employer with the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of those laid off employees interested in casual work opportunity and the job each employee is qualified to perform. Where applicable, casual employment may not be offered to laid off employees under this provision ahead of preferential casuals, nor shall this provision supersede an established order of call in a supplemental agreement.
(7)	b. Regular Employment
The Employer agrees to offer regular employment to those employees on letter of layoff from a commonly-owned NMFA carrier at other terminals located within the jurisdiction of the employee’s Local Union who have made application for regular employment at the terminal offering regular employment. Employment shall be offered in accordance with the following order, unless the Supplemental Agreement or an agreed to practice provides a different order of call, in which case such other order of call shall prevail:
1.	Preferential casuals, where applicable.
2.	Employees of the Employer, on a seniority basis.
3.	Employees of a commonly-owned NMFA carrier based on the date such employees made application.
Employees who for two (2) or more years regularly performed CDL-required driving work for a commonly-owned NMFA carrier shall be compensated at 90% of the full contract rate of pay for a period of one (1) year and go to the full contractual rate thereafter.
- 15 -
Article 3, Section 2
Other employees hired into regular employment shall be paid in accordance with the new hire rate set forth in Article 36, herein and shall establish seniority in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Agreement. Employees who accrue seniority under this provision who are on layoff from another Employer shall retain seniority rights at the terminal they are laid off from until such time as they are recalled to that terminal. Employees who accrue seniority under this provision who are on layoff from another terminal of the same Employer shall retain their seniority at the terminal they are laid off from until such time as recalled to that terminal. At that time, the employee must either accept recall and forfeit seniority at the new terminal or refuse recall and forfeit seniority at the terminal he/she is being recalled to.
In order to be eligible for either casual or regular employment opportunity under this provision, the laid off employee must meet the minimum hiring standards established by the Employer and be otherwise qualified to perform the work available and must be able to report for work in compliance with the Employer’s established call-time procedures. The Employer’s hiring standards and examinations shall be applied uniformly to all applicants for employment. The Employer shall provide the hiring standards and examinations upon written request of the Local Union. Employees who are offered work opportunity under this provision must be able to furnish proof of their qualification to perform the work available.
Any employment examination for applicants must test skills or physical abilities necessary for performance of the work in the job classification in which the applicant will be employed. Violation of this subsection shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
(8)	Fringe benefits will be paid on casuals in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Agreement. Minimum daily guarantees will be governed by the respective Supplemental Agreement.
(9)	A monthly list of all casual and/or probationary employees used during that month shall be submitted to the Local Unions by the tenth (IOth) day of the following month. Such list shall show:
a.	the employee’s name, address, and social security number;
- 16-
Article 3, Section 2
b.	the date worked;
c.	the classification of work performed each date, and the hours worked; and,
d.	the name, if applicable, of the employee replaced.
This list shall be compiled on a daily basis and shall be available for inspection by a Union representative and/or job shop steward.
(10)	Unless otherwise agreed to in any Supplemental Agreement, the following will apply:
Supplemental casuals may be used to supplement the regular work force (dock only) and shall be subject to a four (4) hour guarantee when called to work. Four (4) hour casuals shall be started on an established starting time; or when called to work at a time other than an established starting time, must end his/her shift at the conclusion of that established starting time shift. Four (4) hour casuals shall be eligible for pension and/or health and welfare contributions in accordance with the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
For the purpose of adding regular employees in accordance with the Supplemental Agreement, casuals who work six (6) hours or more or back to back on a shift shall be considered as having worked a supplemental day towards seniority. Once regular employees are required to be added in accordance with the applicable Supplement, the employer must initiate the processing of the new probationary employees immediately and complete such processing as provided for in the applicable Supplement.
(c)	Employment Agency Fees
If employees are hired through an employment agency, the Employer is to pay the employment agency fee. However, if the Local Union was given equal opportunity to furnish employees under Article 3, Section (I) (c), and if the employee is retained through the probationary period, the fee need not be paid until the thirty-first (31st) day of employment.
- 17 -
Article 3, Section 3
Section 3.	Checkoff
The Employer agrees to deduct from the pay of all employees covered by this Agreement the dues, initiation fees and/or uniform assessments of the Local Union having jurisdiction over such employees and agrees to remit to said Local Union all such deductions. Where laws require written authorization by the employee, the same is to be furnished in the form required. The Local Union shall certify to the Employer in writing each month a list of its members working for the Employer who have furnished to the Employer the required authorization, together with an itemized statement of dues, initiation fees (full or installment), or uniform assessments owed and to be deducted for such month from the pay of such member. The Employer shall deduct such amount within two (2) weeks following receipt of the statement of certification of the member and remit to the Local Union in one (I) lump sum within three (3) weeks following receipt of the statement of certification. The Employer shall add to the list submitted by the Local Union the names and Social Security numbers of all regular new employees hired since the last list was submitted and delete the names of employees who are no longer employed. Checkoff shall be on a monthly or quarterly basis at the option of the Union. The Local Union and Employer may agree to an alternative option to deduct Union dues bi-monthly.
When an Employer actually makes a deduction for dues, initiation fees and assessments, in accordance with the statement of certification received from an appropriate Local Union, the Employer shall remit same no later than three (3) weeks following receipt of the statement of certification and in the event the Employer fails to do so, the Employer shall be assessed ten percent (10%) liquidated damages. All monies required to be checked off shall become the property of the entities for which it was intended at the time that such checkoff is required to be made. All monies required to be checked off and paid over to other entities under this Agreement shall become the property of those entities for which it was intended at the time that such payment or checkoff is required to be made.
Where an employee who is on checkoff is not on the payroll during the week in which the deduction is to be made, or has no earnings
- 18 -
Article 3, Section 3
or insufficient earnings during that week, or is on leave of absence, the employee must make arrangements with the Local Union and/or the Employer to pay such dues in advance.
The Employer agrees to deduct from the paycheck of all employees covered by this Agreement voluntary contributions to DRIVE. DRIVE shall notify the Employer of the amounts designated by each contributing employee that are to be deducted from his/her paycheck on a weekly basis for all week worked. The phrase “weeks worked” excludes any week other than a week in which the employee earned a wage. The Employer shall transmit to DRIVE National Headquarters on a monthly basis, in one (1) check, the total amount deducted along with the name of each employee on whose behalf a deduction is made, the employee’s social security number and the amount deducted from that employee’s paycheck. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters shall reimburse the Employer annually for the Employer’s actual cost for the expenses incurred in administering the weekly payroll deduction plan.
The Employer will recognize authorization for deductions from wages, if in compliance with state law, to be transmitted to Local Union or to such other organizations as the Union may request if mutually agreed to. No such authorization shall be recognized if in violation of state or federal law. No deduction shall be made which is prohibited by applicable law.
In the event that an Employer has been determined to be in violation of this Article by the decision of an appropriate grievance committee, and if such Employer subsequently is in violation thereof after receipt of seventy-two (72) hours’ written notice of specific delinquencies, the Local Union may strike to enforce this Article. However, such strike shall be terminated upon the delivery thereof. Errors or inadvertent omissions relating to individual employees shall not constitute a violation.
Upon written request of an employee, the Employer shall make payroll deductions for the purchasing of U. S. Savings Bonds.
The Employer hereby agrees to participate in the Teamsters National 401 (k) Savings Plan (the “Plan”) on behalf of all employ
- 19-
Article 3, Section 3
ees represented for purposes of collective bargaining under this agreement, and shall authorize the Plan to allow for participating employee, upon his request, to take loans on his contributions to the Plan. The Employer is not required to participate in the Teamsters National 401 (k) if Teamsters employees were eligible to participate in an Employer sponsored 401 (k) as of January I, 1998.
The Employer will make or cause to be made payroll deductions from participating employee’s wages, in accordance with each employee’s salary deferral election subject to compliance with ERISA and the relevant tax code provisions. The Employer will forward withheld sum to State Street Bank or its successor at such time, in such form and manner as required pursuant to the Plan and Declaration of Trust (the “Trust”).
The Employer will execute a Participation Agreement with TNFINC and the Trustees of the Plan evidencing Employer participation in the Plan effective prior to any employee deferral being received by the Plan.
Section 4.	Work Assignment
The Employers agree to respect the jurisdictional rules of the Union and shall not direct or require their employees or persons other than the employees in the bargaining units here involved, to perform work which is recognized as the work of the employees in said units. This is not to interfere with bona fide contracts with bona fide unions.
Section 5.
The term “Local Union” as used herein refers to the IBT Local Union which represents the employees of the particular Employer for the purpose of collective bargaining at the particular place or places of business to which this Agreement and the Supplements thereto are applicable, unless by agreement of the Local Union involved, or a Change of Operations Committee, or a jurisdictional award under Article 30 herein, jurisdiction over such employees, or any number of them, has been transferred to some other Local Union, in which case the term Local Union as used herein shall refer to such other Local Unions. Nothing herein contained shall be
-20-
Article 3, Section 5 construed to alter the multi-employer, multi-union unit or single contract status of this Agreement.
Section 6.	Electronic Funds Transfer
If the Employer institutes an electronic funds transfer (EFT) system, employees may participate.
Section 7.	Utility Employee
The parties recognize the need for the Employers to compete effectively in a changing environment. To this end, there shall be established a new position on the local cartage seniority list called a Utility Employee. The intent of the parties’ creation of the Utility Employee position is to generate additional job opportunities and enhance employee earnings, by enhancing the Employer’s ability to compete and grow.
Subject to the approval of the National Utility Employee Review Committee, the Employer may establish Utility Employee positions at any facility at its discretion as-needed, and CDL-qualified road or local cartage employees may bid for Utility Employee positions in accordance with established terminal bidding procedures. All CDL-qualified drivers with the required endorsements shall have the opportunity to transfer to the local cartage operation, if necessary, and bid for open Utility Employee positions with full seniority rights. There shall be no retreat rights for employees who transfer to the local cartage operation to bid an open Utility Employee position. For example, if a road driver bids into the Utility Employee position, he relinquishes his road seniority for bidding purposes and cannot return to the road driver classification, unless through a change of operations, or bid back rights consistent with the applicable Supplement. The Employer shall be permitted to assign a qualified local cartage employee to a Utility Employee position on a temporary basis when necessary to pursue business opportunities that become available, as long as the temporary assignment is made in seniority order and if senior employees do not accept the temporary positions, less senior employees are forced from the bottom of the seniority list. Temporary vacancies in the Utility Employee position, for things such as sickness, vacations, leaves of absences, will be filled consistent with practices under the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
-21 -
Article 3, Section 7
The Utility Employee shall work across all classifications as assigned and as necessary to meet business needs, and there shall be no restrictions on the type of freight or work handled. A Utility Employee’s duties during a tour of duty may, at his/her home terminal, include performing Utility-related dock work, P&D (local cartage) work, hostling/yard work (drop & hooks), and any driving work. At larger facilities where the Employer utilizes Utility Employees and there is more than Utility work performed, the Employer will designate a specific area on the dock where freight to be handled by Utility Employees will be staged. Non-utility freight will be staged at a designated area and the employees at the destination terminal will handle the non-utility freight.
A Utility Employee shall perform all local cartage functions at his home terminal. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any Supplemental Agreement to the contrary, Utility Employees also may be required to work across Local Union jurisdictional lines. It is not the intent to use Utility Employees to perform local peddle runs or P&D work outside their Local Union’s jurisdiction. At away terminals, a Utility Employee may perform Utility-related dock work, hostling and drop and hooks on his/her own equipment. A Utility Employee shall fuel his/her own equipment at away terminals, if there are no fuelers available. All Utility Employees shall be returned to his home domicile at the end of his shift, absent bona fide extenuating circumstances, in which case they shall be paid on all hours.
The Employer shall pay each Utility Employee an hourly premium of $ 1.00 per hour over the highest rate the Employer pays to local cartage drivers under the Supplemental Agreement covering the Utility Employee’s home domicile. Employees in progression who bid into Utility Employee positions or individuals the Employer hires into Utility Employee positions shall complete the progression for local cartage drivers outlined in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. A Utility Employee in progression shall receive the hourly premium in addition to the Utility Employee’s progression rate.
A Utility Employee’s work week shall consist of any four (4) ten-
-22-
Article 3, Section 7
hour or five (5) eight-hour consecutive days starling Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday, subject to a forty (40) hour guarantee during that period. With four (4) ten-hour days, the Utility Employee shall have three (3) consecutive days off and with five (5) eight-hour days the Utility Employee shall have two (2) consecutive days off. The Employer may establish multiple start times bid by Utility Employees and may slide such start times on a daily basis by either thirty (30) minutes before or thirty (30) minutes after the bid start times.
The parties recognize that most, if not all locations will have Utility Employees regardless of facility size, geographic and/or service area. Subject to the approval of the National Utility Employee Review Committee or the Committee Chairman or their designees, the Employer may establish and modify Utility Employee positions and bids without the approval of a change of operations or other Union approval. All bids shall be offered in seniority order, and, if senior employees do not bid open positions, less senior employees shall be forced from the bottom of the seniority list.
In the event the Employer’s proposed use of a Utility Employee position causes a transfer, change or modification of any driver's present terminal, breaking point or domicile, the proposed change shall be submitted to a National Utility Employee Review Committee comprised of three representatives designated by the President of TMI and three representatives designated by the Chairman of TNFINC. The President of TMI or his designee and the Chairman of TNFINC or his designee shall be the TMI and the TNFINC Chairmen of the National Utility Employee Review Committee. The National Utility Employee Review Committee shall establish rules of procedure to govern the manner in which proposed Utility Employee operational changes are to be heard.
The National Utility Employee Review Committee shall have the authority to determine the seniority application of employees affected by the operational change and such determination shall be final and binding. No proposed operational change will be approved which violates this Agreement. In the event the National Utility Employee Review Committee is unable to resolve a matter, the case
-23-
Article 3, Section 7
shall be submitted to the National Review Committee on an expedited basis. Neither the Union nor the Employer shall unreasonably delay the scheduling or completion of any requested meeting, or the submission of any dispute to the National Review Committee. In no event shall a Utility Employee operational change hearing be held more than fifteen (15) business days after the Employer meets with the affected Local Unions to discuss the written operational change proposal.
Any grievance concerning the application or interpretation of Article 3, Section 7 shall be first referred to the National Utility Employee Review Committee for resolution. If the National Utility Employee Review Committee is unable to reach a decision on an interpretation or grievance, the issue will be referred to the National Grievance Committee. The National Utility Employee Review Committee shall have jurisdiction over alleged violations of seniority rights in the bidding of the Utility Employee positions, issues regarding the utilization of the Utility Employee position consistent with this Section, and issues regarding the seniority rights of employees bidding into the Utility Employee position.
Subject to the approval of the National Utility Employee Review Committee, the Employer may establish the number of Utility Employee positions at any location.
The parties agree that nothing in this Article 3, Section 7 shall alter the Employer’s ability to engage in layoffs in accordance with the layoff provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement. In the event a Utility Employee is laid off, the Employer may re-bid that position in accordance with seniority provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
ARTICLE 4. STEWARDS
The Employer shall give one (1) job steward, during his regular working hours or if outside his regular working hours his/her designated alternate, an opportunity to participate in the Employer’s orientation of new employees, or the right to meet with new employees during their workday to inform them of the benefits of Union representation without loss of time or pay.
-24-
Article 4
The Employer shall have the sole right to schedule the time and place for such participation so as not to interfere with the Employer’s operation.
The Employer recognizes the right of the Local Union to designate job stewards and alternates from the Employer’s seniority list. The authority of job stewards and alternates so designated by the Local Union shall be limited to, and shall not exceed, the following duties and activities:
(a)	The investigation and presentation of grievances with his/her Employer or the designated company representative in accordance with the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement;
(b)	The collection of dues when authorized by appropriate Local Union action;
(c)	The transmission of such messages and information, which shall originate with and are authorized by the Local Union or its officers, provided such message and information;
(1)	have been reduced to writing; or,
(2)	if not reduced to writing, are of a routine nature and do not involve work stoppages, slowdowns, refusal to handle goods, or any other interference with the Employer’s business.
Unless waived in writing, there shall be a steward or available bargaining unit member of the employee’s choice present whenever the Employer meets with the employee about grievances or discipline or to conduct investigatory interviews. If a steward is unavailable, the employee may designate a bargaining unit member who is available at the terminal at the time of the meeting to represent him/her. Meetings or interviews shall not begin until the steward or designated bargaining unit member is present. An employee who does not want a Union steward or available bargaining unit member present at any meeting or interview where the employee has a right to Union representation must waive Union representation in writing. If the Union requests a copy of the waiver, the Employer shall promptly furnish it.
- 25 -
Article 4
Job stewards and alternates have no authority to take strike action, or any other action interrupting the Employer’s business, except as authorized by official action of the Local Union. The Employer recognizes these limitations upon the authority of job stewards and their alternates, and shall not hold the Local Union liable for any unauthorized acts. The Employer in so recognizing such limitations shall have the authority to impose proper discipline, including discharge, in the event the job steward or his/her designated alternate has taken unauthorized strike action, slowdown or work stoppage in violation of this Agreement.
The job steward, or his/her designated alternate, shall be permitted reasonable time to investigate, present and process grievances on the company property without loss of time or pay during his/her regular working hours without interruption of the Employer’s operation by calling group meetings; and where mutually agreed to by the Local Union and the Employer, off the property or other than during his/her regular schedule without loss of time or pay. Such time spent in handling grievances during the job steward’s or his/her designated alternate’s regular working hours shall be considered working hours in computing daily and/or weekly overtime if within the regular schedule of the “job steward.”
The job steward, or his/her designated alternate, shall be permitted reasonable time off without pay to attend Union meetings called by the Local Union. The Employer shall be given twenty-four (24) hours’ prior notice by the Local Union.
ARTICLE 5.
Section 1.	Seniority Rights
(a)	The application of seniority which has been accrued herein shall be established in the Supplemental Agreements.
(b)	Seniority shall be broken only by discharge, voluntary quit, retirement, or more than a five (5) - year layoff.
(c)	This Section shall apply to all Supplemental Agreements.
-26-
Article 5, Section 2
Section 2.	Mergers of Companies-General
(a)	In the event the Employer is a party to a merger of lines, seniority of the employees who are affected thereby shall be determined by mutual agreement between the Employer and the Local Unions involved.
In the application of this Section, it is immaterial whether the transaction is called a merger, purchase, acquisition, sale, etc. Further, it is also immaterial whether the transaction involves merely the purchase of stock of one (1) corporation by another, with two (2) separate corporations continuing in existence.
(b)	If such merger of companies results in the combination of terminals or over-the-road operations, a change of operations shall be submitted to the Co-Chairmen of the National Grievance Committee for assignment to an appropriate Change of Operations Committee established pursuant to Article 8, Section 6. The Change of Operations Committee shall retain jurisdiction for one (1) year after the effective date of the Committee decision and shall have the authority to amend its decision in the event of a substantial change in the amount of work to be performed at the terminals or over-the-road operations which were combined.
Combining of Terminals or Operations as a Result of Merger of Companies
(c)	In the application of this Section, when terminals or operations of two (2) or more companies are combined, as referred to above, the following general rules shall be applied by the Employer and the Local Unions, which general rules are subject to modification pursuant to the provisions of Section 4 of this Article:
Active Seniority List
(1)	The active employee seniority rosters (excluding those employees on letter of layoff) shall be “dovetailed” by appropriate classification (i.e., road or city) in the order of each employee’s full continuous classification (road or city) seniority date that the employee is currently exercising. (The term “continuous classification seniority” as used herein is defined as that seniority which the employee is
- 27 -
Article 5, Section 2
currently exercising and has not been broken in the manner provided in Section I of this Article or by voluntary changes in domicile not directed, approved or ordered by a Change of Operations Committee.) The active “dovetailed” seniority roster shall be utilized first and until exhausted to provide employment at such combined terminal or operational location.
Layoff Seniority list
(2)	In addition, the inactive seniority rosters (employees who are on letter of layoff) shall be similarly “dovetailed” by appropriate classification. If additional employees are required after the active list is exhausted, they shall be recalled from such inactive seniority roster and after recall such employees shall be “dovetailed” into the active seniority roster with their continuous classification (road or city) seniority dates they are currently exercising which shall then be exercised for all purposes. Seniority rosters previously combining job classifications shall be continued unless otherwise agreed.
Temporary Authority
(d)	Where only temporary authority is granted in connection with any of the transactions described above, then separate seniority lists shall continue only when terminals or operations are not merged, unless otherwise agreed. The Employer which is to survive will assume the obligations of both collective bargaining agreements during the period of the temporary authority.
In the event of temporary merger of operations which are contingent upon approval by regulatory agencies or on other stated conditions, the seniority of the involved employees shall continue to accrue with their original Employer during the period of temporary merger, so that if there is no final consummation of the merger, the seniority of such employees shall be continued with their respective employers. However, if, on the failure of final consummation and dissolution of the merger, one of the parties to the proposed merger discontinues the operations which were subject to such merger, the employees of such Employer shall be granted seniority rights for all purposes with the other Employer only for the period of time they were employed in such temporary merged operations.
- 28 -
Article 5, Section 2
Purchase of Rights
(e)	If a merger, purchase, acquisition, sale, etc., constitutes merely the acquisition of permits or rights, without the purchase or acquisition of equipment or terminals, and/or without the consolidation of terminals or operations, or in the event of the purchase of rights during bankruptcy proceedings, the following shall apply:
Where the purchasing company has a terminal operation at the domicile of the employees of the seller, the employees of the selling company shall be placed on a master seniority list, and the purchasing company or companies shall hire, after recall of the purchasing company’s employees from layoff, such employees as needed for regular employment within the first twelve (12) calendar months after purchase or acquisition of permits and/or rights, and they shall be dovetailed with full seniority. If an employee refuses a bona fide offer of regular work opportunity with any of the purchasing companies, his/her name shall be removed from the list. No employee hired under this provision shall be required to serve a probationary period. After the expiration of the aforementioned twelve (12) calendar month period, the purchaser shall have no further obligation to the employees of the seller.
However, if the purchasing or acquiring company does not have and/or continue a terminal or operation at the domicile of the employees of the seller, resulting in their layoff, such Employer shall place the laid-off employees on a master seniority list and such Employer shall, if and when additional regular employees are required, within a twelve (12) - calendar month period after purchase or acquisition, and providing its employees on layoff have been recalled, offer employment to such laid-off employees at the terminal locations or operations to which the work has been transferred. Any such laid-off employees accepting transfer shall be dovetailed in accordance with their terminal seniority for work purposes, including layoff, and holding company seniority for all fringes. If an employee refuses a bona fide offer of regular work opportunity with any of the purchasing companies, his/her name shall be removed from the list. No employee hired under this provision shall be required to serve a probationary period. After the expiration date of the aforementioned twelve (12)- calendar month period, the purchaser shall have no further obligation to the employees
- 29-
Article 5, Section 2
of the seller. The transferring employee shall be responsible for lodging and moving expenses.
Exclusive Cartage Operations
(f)	If in connection with the transactions described in these rules the successor Employer determines to discontinue the use of a local cartage company, the employees of that local cartage company who have worked exclusively on the pickup and delivery service which is retained by the successor Employer shall be given the opportunity to continue to perform such service as an employee of such successor Employer, and shall have their seniority “dovetailed” as described in the above rules.
Committee Authority
(g)	Area and/or State Committees created pursuant to Local Supplements which have previously established rules of seniority, not contrary to the provisions of such Supplements, and approved by the Joint Area Committee, may continue to apply such rules if such rules are reduced to writing.
Section 3.	Intent of Parties
(a)	The parties acknowledge that the above rules are intended solely as general standards and further that many factual situations will be presented which necessitate different application, modification or amendment. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that questions of the application of seniority rights may arise which require different treatment and it is anticipated and understood that the Employers and Unions jointly involved and/or the respective grievance committees may mutually agree to such disposition of questions of seniority which in their judgment is appropriate under the circumstances.
(b)	In all instances, the disposition of questions involving the application of seniority rights made by the parties pursuant to this Section may be presented to the appropriate grievance committees provided herein whose decisions shall be final and binding.
Section 4.	Equipment Purchases
(a)	The Employer shall not require as a condition of continued
-30-
Article 5, Section 4
employment, that an employee purchase truck, tractor and/or tractor and trailer or other vehicular equipment, or that any employees purchase or assume any proprietary interest or other obligation in the business, except as referred to in Article 6, Section 2. The requirements of this provision shall be maintained during the renegotiation of this Agreement unless either party has terminated the Agreement in the manner provided.
Highest Rates Prevail
(b)	If the minimum wage, hours and working conditions in the Company absorbed differ from those minimums set forth in this Agreement and Supplements thereto, the higher of the two shall remain in effect for the employees so absorbed.
Cutting Seniority Board
(c)	The Union reserves the right to cut the road seniority board when the average weekly earnings fall to eight hundred twenty-five dollars ($825.00) or less. This is not to be construed as imposing a limitation on earnings. After the Union notifies the Employer to cut the board and in the event that Employer refuses, the Union shall immediately submit the matter to the grievance procedure. In determining whether average weekly earnings will fall to eight hundred twenty-five dollars ($825.00) or less, only the earnings of the lower twenty-five percent (25%) of the drivers on the seniority board, counting from the bottom up, shall be considered. The average shall be calculated for the thirty (30) day period preceding the Union’s original request. After such calculation is made, the average earnings of the drivers for the top seventy-five percent (75%) of the seniority board must also average more than eight hundred twenty-five dollars ($825.00) per week, or layoff shall be made in accordance with seniority. The above provisions shall also apply to extra board for sleeper drivers exclusively.
Posting Seniority List
(d)	The Employer shall give the Local Union a seniority list at least every six (6) months. The Employer shall also post a seniority list at least once every six (6) months and shall maintain a current seniority roster at the terminal. Protest of any employee’s seniority date or position on such list must be made in writing to the Employer
-31 -
Article 5, Section 4
within thirty (30) days after such seniority date or position first appears, and if no protests are timely made, the dates and positions posted shall be deemed correct. Any such protest which is timely made may be submitted to the grievance procedure.
Section 5.	Work Opportunities
Over-the-road and CDL-qualified local cartage employees who have been on letter of layoff for more than thirty (30) days shall be given an opportunity to relocate to permanent employment (prior to the employment of new hires) occurring at other domiciles of the Employer provided they notify the Employer and Local Union in writing of their interest in a relocation opportunity. The offer of relocation will be made in the order of applicable seniority of the laid-off employees domiciled within the Regional area. The Employer shall be required to make additional offers of relocation to an employee who has previously rejected a relocation opportunity provided the employee again notifies the Employer in writing of his/her continued interest in additional relocation opportunities. However, the Employer will only be required to make one relocation offer in any six (6) calendar month period. Any employee accepting such offer shall be paid at the employee’s applicable rate of pay and shall be placed at the bottom of the seniority board for bidding and layoff purposes, but shall retain company seniority for fringe benefits only. A relocating employee shall pay his/her own moving expenses and shall, upon reporting to such new domicile, be deemed to have relinquished his/her right to return with seniority to the domicile from which he/she relocated. The provisions of this Section shall not supersede an established order of call/hiring in the Supplemental Agreement.
Section 6.	Overtime
On a weekly basis, the Employer shall be permitted to work the active seniority board 25% of the straight time hours in overtime. In the event the Employer exceeds the 25% overtime allowance, the number of overtime hours in excess of the allowance will be applied in the next following week for determining the number of employees to recall from lay-off.
For example, if the Employer has 120 employees on the seniority
-32-
Article 5, Section 6
board with 100 actively working and 20 laid-off, the Employer shall be permitted 4000 hours straight time hours plus 1000 hours overtime (25% of 4000) for a total of 5000 hours to be worked that week by the active seniority board. If during that week, the Employer actually worked the 100 active employees a total of 5600 hours, there would be 600 hours in excess of the 25% overtime allowance. The 600 hours would be divided by 50 (40 straight time hours plus 25% of 40 or 10) which equals 12 employees to be recalled from lay-off in the week following the violation of the 25% overtime allowance.
ARTICLE 6.
Section 1.	Maintenance of Standards
The Employer agrees, subject to the following provisions, that all conditions of employment in his/her individual operation relating to wages, hours of work, overtime differentials and general working conditions shall be maintained at not less than the highest standards in effect at the time of the signing of this Agreement, and the conditions of employment shall be improved whenever specific provisions for improvement are made elsewhere in this Agreement.

General
(c)	It is agreed that the provisions of this Article shall not apply o inadvertent or bona fide errors made by the Employer or the Union in applying the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Such bona fide errors may be corrected at any time.
In the event a Local Union and/or employee notifies the manager at the applicable Employer facility in writing by certified mail that an employee’s wages are being overpaid and the Employer does not correct the overpayment within thirty (30) calendar days following receipt of such notice, the Employer shall not be permitted to recoup such overpayment.

Except as provided in this subsection 4(b), agreement to utilize this procedure shall not thereafter in any way limit or constitute a waiver of the right of the Employer or Union to commence damage suit action. However, the use of evidence in this procedure shall not waive the right of the Employer or Union to use such evidence in any litigation relating to the strike or lockout, etc., in violation of this Agreement. There shall not be any strike, slowdown, walkout, cessation of work or lockout as a result of a deadlock of the National Grievance Committee on the questions referred to under this subsection 4(b) and any such activity shall be considered a violation of this Agreement.
(c)	In the event that an Employer, party to this Agreement, commences legal proceedings against the Union after the Union’s compliance with the provisions of Article 8, Section 3(a), (b) or (c), the Employer Associations will cooperate in the presentation to the court of the applicable majority grievance committee decision.
(d)	Nothing herein shall prevent the Employer or Union from securing remedies granted by law except as specifically set forth in subsection 4(b).

Article 8, Section 5
Section 5.
(a)	In the event of strikes, work stoppages, or other activities authorized by Article 8, Section 3(a), (b) or (c) of this Agreement, no interpretation of this Agreement or any Supplement thereto relating to the Employer’s obligation to make health & welfare and /or pension contributions by any tribunal shall be binding upon the Union or affect the legality or lawfulness of the strikes unless the Union stipulates to be bound by such interpretation, it being the intention of the parties to resolve all questions of interpretation by mutual agreement.
(b)	It is the intention of the parties to resolve all grievances and requests for interpretation arising under this Agreement through the grievance procedure. However, it is understood and agreed that nothing herein shall prevent the Employer or Union from securing remedies in those circumstances where the application of this Agreement is contrary to law.
Section 6.	Change of Operations
Change of Operations Committee
(a) Present terminals, breaking points or domiciles shall not be transferred, changed or modified without the approval of an appropriate Change of Operations Committee. Such Committee shall be appointed in each of the Regional Areas, equally composed of Employer and Union representatives. The Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to determine the seniority of the employees affected and such determination shall be final and binding.
In the event a proposed change of operations includes the establishment of either a new or satellite terminal as a “combination” facility with a common city driver and dock seniority roster, when such change of operations results in the relocation or movement of city drivers and dock employees from an existing terminal recognizing separate (split) seniority rosters for city drivers and dock employees, the Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to determine the conditions under which such a combination facili
-50-
Article 8, Section 6
ty may be established, including but not limited to, the number of city drivers and dock employees who qualify, be allowed to follow the work to the new or satellite combination terminal, the implementation of training programs to qualify dock employees as city drivers and the seniority right of affected employees to either return to the “mother” terminal and/or claim additional driving positions at the satellite terminal within reasonable time periods following the establishment of such combination terminal, as determined by the Committee. Existing terminals that recognize separate city driver and dock seniority rosters (split terminals) shall not be converted to “combination” terminals unless and until such time as a majority of those affected employees agree to such conversion, in which case the Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to determine the conditions under which such conversion shall be implemented.
Such Committee, however, shall observe the Employer’s right to designate domiciles and the operational requirements of the business. Where the Union raises the question as to whether or not certain proposed runs of excessive length can be made, the Employer must be prepared to submit objective evidence including DOT certification or logs and tapes that such runs have been tested and were made within the DOT hours of service regulations. Individual employees shall not be redomiciled more than once during the term of this Agreement as the result of an approved change of operations unless a merger, purchase, sale, acquisition or consolidation of employers is involved, or unless there is proven economic need as determined by the Change of Operations Committee based on factual evidence presented.
Pension and health & welfare contributions paid on behalf of a redomiciled employee shall be paid to the Funds to which the contributions were made prior to the employee’s change of domicile, and the decisions of the Change of Operations Committee shall so specify. This Section does not apply to employees who voluntarily transfer to new domiciles, unless such transfer is a result of a Change of Operations Committee decision. Any dispute concerning the appropriate fund for an Employer’s contribution on behalf of a redomiciled employee, pursuant to a Change of Operations Committee decision, shall be referred to the National Grievance
-51 -
Article 8, Section 6
Committee. The decision of the National Grievance Committee shall to the extent permitted by law, be final and binding on all affected parties, including the Trust Funds.
The Change of Operations Committee shall also have jurisdiction for a period of twelve (12) months following the opening of a new terminal to consider the redomicile of employees who are laid off as a direct result of such opening of a terminal. The Committee shall also have jurisdiction over the closing of a terminal in regard to seniority, as well as to determine the conditions under which freight may or may not be interlined into the area of a vacated operations when necessary to retain major customers, including mandating the use of union carriers where available. In no event will the Employer be granted the authority to vacate a facility and interline the freight on a non-union subsidiary of the parent company.
The above shall not apply within a twenty-five (25)-mile radius.
The Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to require a definition of primary and shared lanes, where applicable.
The Change of Operations Committee shall not grant the Employer authority to relocate U.S. operations, work, or terminals to Mexico.
Change of Operations Committee Procedure
b) The National Grievance Committee shall adopt Rules of Procedure concerning the application and administration of this Article.
The Employer shall notify all affected Local Unions of the proposed change of operations at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the hearing at the Regional Joint Area Committee, and the Employer and the Local Unions involved shall have a mutual responsibility to inform the employees subject to redomicile prior to such hearing in accordance with the practice and procedures agreed to in the respective Area Committee. Any exception or waiver of the aforesaid thirty (30) day period shall be mutually agreed to between the Employer and the Local Unions involved and approved by the Regional Area Change of Operations Committee.

Article 8, Section 6
Moving Expenses
(c)	The Employer shall pay reasonable expenses to demount and remount an employee’s mobile home, if used as his/her residence and in such instance shall pay normal expenses to move such mobile home, including the use of other modes of transportation where required by law. However, it is mutually understood that the cost of such move shall not exceed nine thousand dollars ($9,000.00) per move. Commencing April 1, 2004 and every April 1st thereafter under this agreement, this amount will be increased by the prior year’s average annual increase in the CP1-W, U.S. city average. Housing, Household Operations expenditure category titled “Moving, storage, freight expense”. A decrease in the percent change in the Index will not result in a decrease of the mobile home moving allowance once established. In the event the index is no longer published by BLS, the parties will agree to meet and find a substitute Index as an escalator.
Where an employee is required to transfer to another domicile in order to follow employment as a result of a change of operations, the Employer shall move the employee and assume the responsibility for proven loss or damage to household goods due to such move, including insurance against loss or damage. Should any employee possess household items of unusual or extraordinary value which will be included in the move, such items shall be declared and an appraised value determined prior to the move. The Employer shall provide packing materials for the employee’s household goods when requested or at the employee’s request pay all costs and expenses of moving such household goods, including packing.
An employee shall have a maximum of one (1) year to move in accordance with the provisions of an approved change of operations unless, prior to the expiration of such year, he/she requests, in writing, an extension for a reasonable period of time due to an unusual or special problem. The Employer shall provide lodging for the employee at the point of redomicile, not to exceed ninety (90) calendar days, and in addition, shall reimburse the employee forty cents (40?) per mile to transport one (1) personal automobile to the new location.
-53 -
Article 8, Section 6
The Employer shall not be responsible for moving expenses if the employee changes his/her residence as a result of voluntary transfer.
None of the Employer obligations set forth in this Subsection (c) -Moving Expenses shall apply to transfers of domiciles within a fifty (50) - mile radius.
Change of Operations Seniority
(d)	The Change of Operations Committee established herein hall have the sole authority to determine questions of the application of seniority in those situations presented to it and in connection therewith the following general rules shall apply, subject, however, to modification as provided by Section 6(g) below:
Closing, Partial Closing of Terminals-Transfer of Work
(1) a. When branches, terminals, divisions or operations (hereinafter “terminal(s)”) are closed or partially closed and the work of such terminal(s) is transferred, in whole or in part, to another terminal(s), the active employees (excluding those employees on letter of layoff) at the closed or partially closed terminal(s) shall have the right to bid into a master seniority roster (road or city) comprised of bidders from the active seniority rosters of closed or partially closed termi-nal(s) in the order of their continuous classification (road or city) seniority. Continuous classification seniority shall be defined as that seniority which the employee is currently exercising and has not been broken in the manner provided by Article 5, Section 1, or by voluntary changes in domicile not directed, approved or ordered by a Change of Operations Committee. Employees shall bid from the combined master seniority roster into openings at the terminal(s) into which work is being transferred. Employees so transferring shall be “dovetailed” into the appropriate active seniority roster at the new terminal(s) in the order of their continuous classification seniority. Such transfers shall be permitted prior to the recall of laid-off employees at such gaining terminal(s). If and when additional employees are required in excess of those who formed the combined active roster at the point of redomicile, employees on letter of layoff at that location shall be recalled. If recalled, such employees shall be “dovetailed” with their continuous classification seniority.
- 54 -
Article 8, Section 6
In addition, the inactive seniority rosters (employees who are on letter of layoff) at the terminal(s) from which employees are being redomiciled shall be “dovetailed” into a master “laid off’ seniority roster and such employees shall have the same opportunities to transfer to terminal(s) within the area of the Supplemental Agreement which are afforded to employees covered by the provisions of subparagraph 2(b) below. These inactive employees at the losing terminal(s) shall also be offered first work opportunity, in seniority order, at terminals into which work was transferred within the regional area where such employees were employed. Such inactive employees shall gain active seniority in accordance with the provisions of the applicable supplemental agreement. The use of such employees shall be subject to the order of call of the supplement. The employee’s seniority date for bidding and layoff purposes shall be the date which they gain active status. The employee shall retain company seniority for fringe benefits only as of that date.
The senior driver voluntarily laid off at a losing domicile will be restored to the active board each time foreign drivers or casuals (where applicable) make ten (10) trips (tours of duty) within any thirty (30) calendar day period on a primary run of such domicile, not affected by a Change of Operations.
b. The following seniority bidding procedures are to be applied in all change of operations cases that involve master pool bidding:
1.	The Change of Operations Committee shall have the authority to establish a date for purposes of determining active and inactive (on letter of layoff or the equivalent thereof) employees at both gaining and losing locations.
2.	Affected employees at losing locations shall be allowed to bid onto an active master pool seniority list on a dovetailed seniority basis.
3.	At the time of the original bid, an employee on the active master pool seniority list shall be afforded the opportunity to bid any available position for which he/she is qualified at a gaining location in
-55 -
Article 8, Section 6
accordance with his/her seniority on the master pool seniority list. In the event the active employees at any given location elect not to bid the number of positions being lost at that particular location, inactive employees at that location, in accordance with their seniority, shall then be afforded the opportunity to bid as an active employee until the number of positions being lost at that particular location are filled. An employee who elects to “hold” as set forth in paragraph 4 below shall not be considered as filling a losing position. A successful bidder shall be dovetailed on the seniority list at the location he/she bids into. The number of successful bidders from any losing location shall not exceed, at the time of the original bid, the number of positions lost at that location as approved by the Change of Operations Committee.
4.	An employee on the active master pool seniority list who does not have seniority to bid the location he/she desires in the initial bid may hold for such desired location and remain at his/her present domicile in such status as his/her bidding seniority will allow. Should an opening occur during the window period as set forth in the Change of Operations decision at the location to which he/she desired to transfer, he/she shall be afforded transfer opportunity in line with his/her bidding seniority. A successful bidder under this provision shall be dovetailed on the applicable seniority list at the location into which he/she bids and his/her moving expenses shall be paid in accordance with other transferring employees. The transfer provisions of this Section shall apply only during the window period as set forth in the Change of Operations decision.
5.	An employee who elects to hold as set forth in Paragraph 4 above may hold for only one (1) location and must designate that location at the time of the original bid and may hold only for a position within the classification the employee has seniority to bid. If an employee refuses to accept an opportunity to claim a position he/she is holding for, the employee shall have no further claim to a position that may become available during the window period.
6.	An employee who elects to hold, shall also be entitled to exercise seniority to claim a voluntary move under the provisions of Article 5, Section 5 herein, and in the event the employee accepts such a voluntary move, he/she shall retain his/her hold position at his/her
-56-
Article 8, Section 6
home domicile during the remainder of the window period but shall forfeit any other seniority rights at his/her home domicile. Should a position become available at the location such employee is holding for and which the employee has seniority to successfully claim, moving expenses set forth in Article 8, Section 6(c) shall be computed from the employee’s original home domicile.
7.	There shall be a maximum one hundred twenty (120) calendar day window period from the date of implementation in all Changes of Operations only when the number of positions offered at gaining terminals do not equal the number of positions lost at the losing terminals.
(a)	Any openings which may occur at a gaining terminal during the window period shall be offered to those employees on the Master Pool Seniority list who have not been offered transfer opportunity under the provisions of Article 8, Section 6 before they are offered to employees who may have elected to “hold” as set forth in paragraph 4 above.
(b)	The window period established by the Change of Operations decision shall close if either of the following conditions is met: (a) the number of days and/or months of the window period as set forth in the Change of Operations decision has expired; or (b) all employees on the Master Pool Seniority list have been offered work opportunities pursuant to Article 8, Section 6.
(c)	However, with respect to those who bid to “hold”, it is understood that such bids must remain open and any job opportunities that are clearly identifiable as a direct result of the Change of Operations must be offered, by seniority, to those qualified employees who bid to hold for that specific location for the length of the window period(s) (road/cartage) set forth in the Change of Operations decision even if the window period is closed as set forth in paragraph (b) above.
(d)	The Company shall determine whether an additional job opportunity is the direct result of the Change of Operations at the specific gaining domicile for which the employee is “holding”. The Company shall so notify the employee’s current Local Union and
- 57 -
Article 8, Section 6
the gaining Local Union. The Company shall have the burden of proof in establishing whether or not an additional job opportunity is clearly the direct result of the Change of Operations at the specific gaining domicile for which the employee is “holding”. Any grievance filed regarding the Company’s decision to permit or deny a “hold” transfer shall be filed with the appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee to be heard by the Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee that held jurisdiction.
8.	Employees who are qualified bidders on Long-Term Disability (LTD) at the time of bid shall be allowed to bid. If successful LTD bidders are unable to claim their bid on the date of implementation, a hold-down bid will be allowed. This hold-down bid will be offered to those remaining active employees at the LTD’S current location, by classification, who have not been offered transfer opportunity under the Change of Operations. The successful hold-down bidder shall be dovetailed. When the LTD employee returns to work and claims his/her bid, the hold-down employee may either remain at the hold-down location with a bidding seniority date consistent with the date of transfer under the Change of Operations or return to his/her original location with his/her original bidding seniority date. The hold-down employee may not return to a location where the classification from which he/she bid has been eliminated. The Company shall not be responsible for the moving expense of the employee filling the hold-down bid, unless and until such time as it is determined that the employee on LTD will never be able to claim his bid and the hold-down bidder becomes a regular permanent employee at the hold-down location.
Closing of Terminals-Elimination of Work
(2)	a. When a terminal(s) is closed and the work of such terminal(s) is eliminated, an employee who was formerly employed at another terminal shall have the right to return to such former terminal and exercise his/her continuous classification (road or city) seniority, provided he/she has not been away from such former terminal for more than a five (5)-year period.
Layoff
b. When a terminal(s) is closed and the work of such terminal(s) is
-58-
Article 8, Section 6 eliminated, employees who are laid-off thereby shall be given first (1st) opportunity for available regular employment in the classification in which they are employed at the time of such layoff (prior to the employment of new hires but subject to the order of call/hiring of the Supplemental Agreement) occurring at any other terminal(s) of the Employer within the area of the Supplemental Agreement where such employee was employed provided they notify the Employer in writing of their interest in a transfer opportunity. The offer of transfer will be made in the order of continuous classification seniority of the laid off employees within the area of the Supplemental Agreement. The Employer shall be required to make additional offers of transfer to an employee who has previously rejected a transfer opportunity provided the employee again notifies the Employer in writing of his/her continued interest in additional transfer opportunities. However, the Employer will only be required to make one transfer offer in any six (6) calendar month period. The obligation to offer such employment shall continue for a period of five (5) years from the date of closing. Any employee accepting such offer shall be employed at his/her applicable rate of pay and shall be placed at the bottom of the seniority board for bidding and layoff purposes, but shall retain company seniority for fringe benefits only. A transferring employee shall pay his/her own moving expenses.
Opening of Terminals
(3)	When a new terminal(s) is opened (except as a replacement for existing operations or a new division in a locality where there are existing operations), the Employer shall offer to those employees, if any, affected thereby the opportunity to transfer to regular positions in the new terminal(s) in the order of such employee’s continuous classification (road or city) seniority date as defined herein. Upon arrival at such new location, such employees shall be “dovetailed” with their continuous classification (road or city) seniority date together with other employees so transferring.
This provision is not intended to cover situations where there is replacement of an existing operation or where a new division is opened in a locality where there is an existing terminal. In these latter situations, those employees laid off at the existing facilities shall
-59-
Article 8, Section 6
have first (1st) opportunity for employment at the new operation in accordance with their continuous classification (road or city) seniority date, and upon arrival shall be similarly “dovetailed.” If all regular full-time positions are not filled in this manner, then the provisions of the preceding paragraph shall apply.
(4)	When a Company which has an established Local Cartage Operation, which has been cleared by system OTR drivers, seeks to establish a new OTR domicile there, the Company shall first file for a Change of Operations giving transfer opportunity, with regard to the initial complement, to OTR drivers from those system OTR domiciles that previously serviced such Local Cartage Operation with reasonable regularity. Such transfer opportunity shall remain in effect for any additions to the initial complement for a period of not less than 120 calendar days, after which further additions to such complement shall be hired at the locality where such new OTR domicile was established.
(5)	Any employee redomiciled by an approved change of operations to another domicile shall upon reporting to such new domicile be deemed to have relinquished his/her right to return, with seniority, to the domicile from which he/she was transferred, except under another approved change of operations. Employees who avail themselves of the transfer privileges because they are on layoff at their original terminal may exercise their seniority rights if work becomes available at their original terminal during the five (5) year layoff period allowed them at their original terminal.
(6)	When an Employer’s proposed Change of Operations offers a specific number of road positions at a gaining domicile, the Employer shall be required to make every good faith effort and use all practical means to hire qualified applicants to fill such offered positions that are left vacant because other employees affected by the Change have elected not to bid into that gaining domicile. The Employer’s duty to hire under this provision is to use every reasonable means to advertise for qualified applicants and to meet with the affected Local Union(s) to seek qualified applicants. Nothing in this provision shall be construed to create an obligation that the Employer maintain or otherwise guarantee a specific number of
-60-
Article 8, Section 6
employees at a gaining domicile. Any grievance concerning any issue which may arise under this provision shall be filed directly with the Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee.
In the event it is determined by the Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee that the Employer has not made every good faith effort and used all practical means to hire qualified applicants for road positions as required under this provision, the Committee may require the Employer to hire qualified applicant(s) as outlined above.
Definition of Terms
(e)	The term “continuous classification seniority” as used in this Agreement is defined as that seniority which the employee is currently exercising and has not been broken in the manner provided in Article 5, Section 1, or by voluntary changes in domicile not directed, approved or ordered by a Change of Operations Committee.
Qualifications and Training
(f)	Employees, who are presently non-CDL qualified and elect to bid to transfer to a gaining terminal that requires CDL qualified employees, shall be provided a sixty (60) day training period in order to become CDL qualified. The training period shall commence from the date the employee becomes a successful bidder and the Company shall furnish training personnel and equipment at the location where the employee is currently domiciled or otherwise as mutually agreed to. If the employee fails to qualify during such sixty (60) day period, the employee shall forfeit his/her right to fill the bid and shall remain on the seniority list of the current domicile.
Intent of Parties
(g)	The parties acknowledge that the above rules are intended solely as general standards and further that many factual situations will be presented which necessitate different application, modification or amendment. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge that questions of the application of seniority rights may arise which require different treatment and it is anticipated and understood that the Employers and Unions jointly involved and/or the respective grievance committees
-61 -
Article 8, Section 6
may mutually agree to such disposition of questions of seniority which in their judgment is appropriate under the circumstances.
The Change of Operations Committees, as provided herein or in the Supplemental Agreements, shall have the authority to determine the application of seniority in those situations presented to them. In all cases, the seniority decisions of the Joint Committees, including the Change of Operations Committees and subcommittees established by the National Master Freight Agreement and the respective Supplemental Agreements, shall be final and binding.
Section 7.
Any grievance committee or panel, as constituted under this Agreement, shall have the jurisdiction and power to decide grievances which arose under the preceding agreements and supplements thereto. In doing so, the committees or panels shall follow the grievance procedure set forth in the 2003-2008 Agreement, but apply the contract under which the grievance arose.
Section 8.	Sleeper Cab Operations
Unless specifically addressed in this section the provisions of the applicable supplemental agreement relating to sleeper cab operations remain in full force and effect.
A.	Work Rules

Article 8, Section 8
miles driven and work performed. There will be no free time at any point reached.
2.	“Extra Board Team Drivers”
Teams who are classified as extra board drivers will receive a minimum of thirteen hundred (1300) miles round trip when dispatched.
3.	Turning In The Yard Home Terminal (Non-Scheduled Teams)
When mutually agreed between the sleeper team and the Employer, sleeper teams may be allowed to turn in the yard at their home domicile provided the dispatch wheel is exhausted and/or there are no other teams rested and available for dispatch. When the Employer turns a sleeper team at their home domicile any delay in excess of one (1) hour shall be compensable.
The above referenced mileage guarantees are in addition to any other earnings after dispatch.
C.	Dispatch Method
Sleeper cab operations shall be between the designated home terminal and a designated area and/or a destination terminal unless otherwise agreed. The A, B, C, dispatch principle shall apply.
All regular sleeper runs shall be posted for bid once each six (6) months unless otherwise agreed. The number of regular runs or teams in designated areas shall be determined by taking fifty percent (50%) of the average number of runs operated by sleeper teams between two (2) or more designated points for a period of six (6) months. Disputes over bids will be referred to the Sleeper Resolution Committee.
The sleeper trip must equal a minimum of thirteen hundred (1300) paid miles.
All sleeper trips are limited to one via on the return home dispatch, (B-A), (C-A), unless otherwise mutually agreed or as approved by the appropriate committee.
-63-
Article 8, Section 8
All sleeper teams must be sent to their home terminal on the third dispatch unless otherwise mutually agreed.
D.	Laypoint and Layover
The layover provision of this section shall apply at only one away from home terminal, and all time spent at all other points touched on a round trip from the home terminal exclusive of meal time shall be paid for at the full hourly rate for each driver.
The layover point shall be the destination of the A-B dispatch and shall be designated on the driver’s original orders prior to the dispatch from the point of origin and shall remain the same whether or not the drivers reached that point. If the team does not reach the original dispatch point there shall be no free time.
Upon arrival at a team’s designated lay point, the Employer shall advise as soon as possible, but not later than thirty (30) minutes after the team signs-in, whether the team will be turned or put to bed.
In the event the team is put to bed, they shall be compensated at the straight-time hourly rate of pay from the time they signed in until the time they were so notified.
However, in the event of unforeseen circumstances (e.g., road closures; equipment breakdown; government declared emergency), the Employer may cancel a previously assigned dispatch prior to the expiration of the one hour free time and put the team to bed. In this circumstance, the team will be compensated at the straight time hourly rate of pay from the time they signed in until the time they were so notified. Failure by the Employer to make a load shall not be considered an unforeseen circumstance.
If the drivers are advised they are turning, the Company will have one-half (1/2) free hour at the laypoint and one (1) free hour at the home domicile in which to turn the drivers provided there are safe and sanitary shower facilities equipped with hot and cold water for showering. If the drivers are not dispatched within the above-mentioned one-half (1/2) or one (1) hour free time period after arrival, they shall be paid for all time spent in excess at the applicable rate.
-64-
Article 8, Section 8
If the team is relieved of duty on arrival and signs for eight (8) hours off and then is recalled within four (4) hours, they shall be paid for all time spent.
Where sleeper teams are required to layover away from their home terminal, layover paid shall commence following the tenth (10th) hour after the end of the run. If the driver is held over the tenth (10th) hour the driver shall be guaranteed two (2) hours pay in any event for the layover time. If the driver is held over more than two (2) hours the driver shall receive layover pay for each hour up to eight (8) hours in the first eighteen (18) hours of layover period, commencing after the run ends. The same principle shall apply to each succeeding eighteen (18) hours, and layover pay shall commence after the tenth (I Oth) hour.
E.	Abuse of Free Time
Whenever any employer arbitrarily abuses the free time allowed in this section, then this shall be considered a dispute and the same shall be subject to the grievance machinery.
F.	Mark-Off Procedure For Non-Scheduled Sleeper Cab Drivers
In the event the Company and the Local Union are unable to agree to a mark-off procedure, the following shall apply unless the supplement provides otherwise.
1.	For the purposes of time off, one thousand (1000) tractor miles equals one (1) sleeper trip, (for each driver)
2.	After the completion of four (4) consecutive trips, the drivers will be entitled to forty-eight (48) hours off, plus an additional eight (8) hours rest. The drivers may waive the forty-eight (48) hours off.
3.	After the completion of six (6) consecutive trips the drivers will be entitled to seventy-two (72) hours off, plus an additional eight (8) hours rest. Drivers entitled to such time off privileges may at their option, exercise time off privilege at the completion of either the sixth (6th), eighth (8th), or tenth (10th) trips. An extra board team that exercises their maximum time off after the eighth (8th) or tenth
-65-
Article 8, Section 8
(10th) trip is subject to no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the active board off at one time.
4.	Where drivers fail to exercise time off privilege after the tenth (10th) trip, they shall forfeit such time off and the cycle will revert back to subsection 2.
5.	Time off privileges may be exercised only at the completion of the fourth (4th), sixth (6th), eighth (8th) or tenth (10th) trips upon the drivers returning home. An extra board team that exercises their maximum time off after the eighth (8th) or tenth (IOth) trip is subject to no more than fifteen percent (15%) of the active board off at one time. A driver shall not be denied the time off in accordance with the fifteen percent (15%) rule more ±an once prior to receiving such time off.
6.	The only exception to the above is that the Employer shall provide in the dispatch rules and/or procedures for thirty-six (36) consecutive hours off duty at the home terminal at least once a week unless otherwise agreed to, provided the driver has been on the board and required to be available.
7.	Where only one driver of an established team marks off for any reason, other than “9” below, he shall remain off until his partner returns to the home terminal, except as mutually agreed.
8.	In those instances where an extra board driver makes a combination of single operation and sleeper operation trips each driver will earn one tour for each one thousand (1000) tractor miles while on a sleeper trip.
9.	Bid team drivers must take their earned time off at the same time as outlined above.
10.	Sleeper drivers are entitled to ten (10) hours off duty at their home domicile upon the completion of each round trip exclusive of the two (2) hour call.

Bedding and fresh linen, excluding pillows, for sleeper cabs shall be
-66-
Article 8, Section 8
furnished and maintained by the Employer in a clean and sanitary condition. Upon expiration of cunent linen provider contracts, the drivers will be compensated seven dollars ($7.00) each per trip to furnish and maintain their linens. A trip is defined as beginning and ending at home domicile. Complaints with respect to width, depth, and condition of mattresses shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
I.	Sleeper Cab Equipment
All sleeper cab equipment must be provided with air conditioning and heating appliances in accordance with Article 16, Section 6 of this Agreement. In the event of mechanical failure of such air conditioning and hearing appliances, repairs shall be made at the first point of repair enroute where qualified, certified service and parts are available. Drivers shall be paid for all time waiting for repairs to be made to heating appliances. In the event an air conditioning appliance becomes inoperable, the time necessary to complete the repairs cannot cause an unreasonable delay in the movement of freight and therefore will be limited to four (4) hours, for which drivers will be paid. In the event parts and/or qualified, certified service are not available, necessary repairs shall be completed prior to the equipment being dispatched from the next scheduled point of dispatch.
J.	Sleeper Cab Occupants
Only two (2) drivers shall be permitted in the sleeper cab equipment at any one time except in the case of emergency, an act of God, or where new type equipment is put into operation.

K.	Method of Dispatch At Foreign Domiciles
Foreign domiciled sleeper teams shall be placed on a common rotating wheel at the time they arrive at a foreign domicile and shall be dispatched off that wheel on a first-in first-out basis; provided however, a team may be dispatched out of rotation when receiving a direct dispatch back to their home domicile. Such direct dispatch may include a drop and pick enroute. When more than one team from a common home domicile is on the foreign wheel, the first team in shall be the team dispatched out of rotation.
-67-
Article 8, Section 8
Sleeper teams who are put to bed at a foreign domicile shall be dispatched in accordance with the procedure herein; provided however, it shall not be a violation or the basis of a runaround claim, when a foreign team, whose home domicile is common to that of another team who is in bed at the foreign domicile, has been pre-dispatched on a via through the foreign domicile enroute to their home domicile. A foreign team may not however, be dispatched from a home domicile to a foreign domicile and then back to their home domicile (A-B-A) when another team from the same home domicile is in bed at the foreign domicile.
L.	Foreign Power Courtesy Dispatch
It shall not be a violation or the basis for a runaround when a sleeper team is dispatched on a via through a foreign domicile where other sleeper teams or single drivers are domiciled when continuing in motion over their designated sleeper lane, or being dispatched to their home domicile.
M.	National Sleeper Cab Grievance Committee
The parties shall establish a National Sleeper Committee composed of four (4) union representatives appointed by the Chairman of TNF1NC and four (4) Employer representatives appointed by the Employer Chairman of the National Grievance Committee. The National Sleeper Committee shall establish rules of procedure to govern the manner in which proposed sleeper operations are to be heard, procedures for resolving sleeper issues and procedures for establishing prehearing guidelines. Any grievance concerning the application or interpretation of this section shall be referred to the National Sleeper Committee for resolution.

Section 2.	Struck Goods
It shall not be a violation of this Agreement and it shall not be cause for discharge, disciplinary action or permanent replacement if any employee refuses to perform any service which his/her Employer undertakes to perform as an ally of an Employer or person whose employees are on strike and which service, but for such strikes, would be performed by the employees of the Employer or person on strike.
Section 3.
Subject to Article 32 - Subcontracting, hereof, the Employer agrees that it will not cease or refrain from handling, using, transporting, or otherwise dealing in any of the products of any other Employer or cease doing business with any other person, or fail in any obligation imposed by the Motor Carriers Act or other applicable law, as a result of individual employees exercising their rights under this Agreement or under law, but the Employer shall, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, when necessary, continue doing such business, including pickup or delivery to or from the Employer’s terminal and to or from the premises of a shipper or consignee.
Section 4.
The layover provision of the applicable Supplemental Agreement shall apply when the Employer knowingly dispatches a road driver to a terminal at which a primary picket line has been posted as a result of the exhaustion of the grievance procedure, or after proper notification of a picket line permitted by the collective bargaining agreement, or economic strikes occurring after the expiration of collective bargaining agreements, or to achieve a collective bargaining agreement. In such event and upon his/her request, a driver shall be provided first class public transportation to his/her home terminal, plus be paid a minimum of eight (8) hours or actual time spent while
-69-
Article 9, Section 4
returning, whichever is greater. The Employer shall determine the mode of transportation to be utilized.
ARTICLE 10.	LOSS OR DAMAGE
Section 1.
In the event loss, damage or theft of freight, equipment, materials, or supplies is incurred as a direct result of a proven willful gross negligent act by an employee in the performance of assigned work, when such act knowingly may result in such loss, damage or theft, the employee may be held responsible for such acts and may be required to assume liability for any such loss, damage or theft, in whole or in part. The term “willful, gross negligent acts” is intended to describe independent actions of any employee who knowingly violates established rules or policies that, when adhered to, clearly prevent loss, damage or theft described herein. Employees shall not be held responsible or required to assume liability for loss or damage or theft unless clear proof of willful, gross negligence is shown. In no event will an employee be held responsible for, or required to assume any liability for any loss, damage or theft when performing assigned work in a manner as specifically instructed by a supervisor. This Article shall not be utilized in any manner to hold an employee liable for any loss or damage of equipment under any conditions or for any damage to cargo as a result of a vehicular accident.
Section 2.
Prior to an employee being charged with the responsibility and liability for any loss, damage or theft because of willful gross negligent acts on the part of the employee, a hearing shall be held with the Local Union, the employee and the Employer. Employees who are found to be liable and required to make restitution for such liability, shall not then be subject to any further disciplinary action. Any disputes between the parties may be referred to the grievance procedure of the applicable Area Supplemental Agreement and the National Master Freight Agreement.

Article 11
ARTICLE 11.	BONDS AND INSURANCE
Section 1.
Should the Employer require any employee to give bond, cash bond shall not be compulsory, and any premium involved shall be paid by the Employer. The primary obligation to procure the bonds shall be on the Employer. If the Employer cannot arrange for a bond within ninety (90) days, it must so notify the employee in writing. Failure to so notify shall relieve the employee of the bonding requirement. If proper notice is given, the employee shall be allowed thirty (30) days from the date of such notice to make his/her own bonding requirements, standard premiums only on said bond to be paid by the Employer. A standard premium shall be that premium paid by the Employer for bonds applicable to all other of its employees in similar classifications. Any excess premium is to be paid by the employee. Cancellation of a bond after once issued shall not be cause for discharge unless the bond is cancelled for cause which occurs during working hours, or due to the employee having given a fraudulent statement in obtaining said bond.
Every driver must maintain a valid commercial driver’s license and be covered by insurance. If an Employer cannot cover a driver under an existing fleet policy, the Employer will promptly apply to the state assigned risk-pool to provide any comparable coverage. During the pendency of the application and until insurance is obtained, the driver will not be terminated, but will be taken out of driving service. When any comparable insurance is obtained, the employee will be responsible for paying any excess over the standard charges.
Section 2.	Corporate Owned Life Insurance
The Employer will not own and/or be the beneficiary of any life insurance policy on the life or lives of any members of the bargaining unit without obtaining the explicit authorization of the Teamsters National Master Freight Negotiating Committee and the individual affected employees.
-71 -
Article 12
ARTICLE 12.	UNIFORMS
Before the Employer purchases uniforms, it must present a sample of the material for the uniforms to the Union for approval. If the sample material type is not used in the finished uniforms, the Union employees are under no obligation to wear the uniforms. The Union’s approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Employer agrees that if any employee is required to wear any kind of uniform as a condition of his/her continued employment, such uniform shall be furnished and maintained by the Employer, free of charge, at the standard required by the Employer. Said uniforms shall be made in the United States by union vendors, if possible, and will have the Teamster emblem appropriately applied.
The Employer shall replace all clothing, glasses, hearing aids and/or dentures not covered by company insurance or worker’s compensation which are destroyed or damaged in a wreck or fire with company equipment.
The Employer has the right to establish and maintain reasonable standards for wearing apparel and personal grooming.
The following provisions shall govern the wearing of shorts, unless the Employer and Local Union has a prior existing practice:
During the period May I, through September 30, employees shall be allowed to wear appropriate shorts, subject to the guidelines set forth herein. Appropriate shorts shall be defined as walking or Bermuda style shorts with at least two (2) pockets and belt loops and which cannot be shorter than two (2) inches above the knee, properly hemmed at the bottom and of a conservative basic solid color, (black, blue, brown or green). Socks and appropriate foot wear must be worn at all times.
Short shorts, cut offs, unhemmed, athletic, gym, biking, spandex and calf length shorts shall not be allowed.
ARTICLE 13.	PASSENGERS
No driver shall allow anyone, other than employees of the Employer who are on duty, to ride on his truck except by written authorization
- 72 -
Article 13
of the Employer, or except in cases of emergency arising out of disabled commercial equipment or an Act of God. No more than two (2) people shall ride in the cab of a tractor unless required by government agencies or the necessity of checking of equipment. This shall not prohibit drivers from picking up other drivers, helpers or others in wrecked or broken down motor equipment and transporting them to the first (1st) available point of communication, repair, lodging or available medical attention. Nor shall this prohibit the transportation of other drivers from the driver’s own company at a delivery point or terminal to a restaurant for meals.
ARTICLE 14.	COMPENSATION CLAIMS
Section 1.	Compensation Claims
(a)	The Employer agrees to cooperate toward the prompt disposition of employee on-the-job injury claims. The Employer shall provide worker’s compensation protection for all employees even though not required by state law, or the equivalent thereof, if the injury arose out of or in the course of employment. No employee will be disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of filing an on-the-job injury report. The Employer or its designee shall not visit an injured worker at his/her home, at a hospital or any location outside the employee’s home terminal without his/her consent.
(b)	At the time an injury report is turned in, the Employer shall provide the injured employee with an information sheet briefly outlining the procedure for submitting a worker’s compensation claim to include the name, address and phone number of the company’s worker’s compensation representative and other pertinent information relative to claim payment.
(c)	An employee who is injured on the job, and is sent home, or to a hospital, or who must obtain medical attention, shall receive pay at the applicable hourly rate for the balance of his/her regular shift on that day. An employee who has returned to his/her regular duties after sustaining a compensable injury who is required by the worker’s compensation doctor to receive additional medical treatment during his/her regularly scheduled working hours shall receive
-73-
Article 14, Section 1
his/her regular hourly rate of pay for such time. Where not prohibited by state law, employees who sustain occupational injury or illness shall be allowed to select a physician of their own choice and shall notify the Employer in writing of such physician.
(d)	Road drivers sustaining an injury while being transported in company-provided transportation for Company purposes at a layover terminal shall be considered as having been injured on the job.
(e)	In the event that an employee sustains an occupational illness or injury while on a run away from his/her home terminal, the Employer shall provide transportation by bus, train, plane, or automobile to his/her home terminal if and when directed by a doctor.
(f)	The Employer agrees to provide any employee injured locally transportation at the time of injury, from the job to the medical facility and return to the job, or to his/her home if required.
(g)	In the event of a fatality arising in the course of employment, while away from the home terminal, the Employer shall return the deceased to his/her home at the point of domicile.
(h)	The Employer may publish reasonable safety rules and procedures and provide the Local Union with a copy. Failure to observe such reasonable rules and/or procedures shall subject the employee to disciplinary action in accordance with the disciplinary procedures in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. However, the time limitation relative to prior offenses shall be waived to permit consideration of the employee’s entire record of failure to observe reasonable safety rules and/or procedures resulting in lost time personal injuries. This provision does not apply to vehicular accidents.
When issuing progressive discipline under the terms and conditions of Article 14 Section l(h), it is understood that the time limitation relative to prior offenses of failure to observe reasonable safety rules and/or procedures resulting in lost time injuries is waived and may be included in the disciplinary process.
-74-
Article 14, Section 1
However it is also understood that when an employer issues progressive discipline, the employer shall not utilize prior discipline that is in excess of three (3) years old when issuing additional progressive discipline, unless the employee has shown a pattern of failure to observe reasonable safety rules and/or procedures resulting in lost time injuries.
Section 2.	Modified Work
(a)	The Employer may establish a modified work program designed to provide temporary opportunity to those employees who are unable to perform their normal work assignments due to a disabling on-the-job injury. Recognizing that a transitional retum-to work program offering both physical and mental therapeutic benefits will accelerate the rehabilitative process of an injured employee, modified work programs are intended to enhance worker’s compensation benefits and are not to be utilized as a method to take advantage of an employee who has sustained an industrial injury, nor are they intended to be a permanent replacement for regular employment.
An active employee, who is injured on the job, qualifies for workers’ compensation benefits and is subsequently laid off, will continue to receive compensation payments and benefits for the period provided by his/her supplement.
(b)	Implementation of a modified work program shall be at the Employer’s option and shall be in strict compliance with applicable federal and state worker’s compensation statutes. Acceptance of modified work shall be on a voluntary basis at the option of the injured employee. However, refusal to accept modified work by an employee, otherwise entitled to worker’s compensation benefits, may result in a loss or reduction of such benefits as specifically provided by the provisions of applicable federal or state worker’s compensation statutes. Employees who accept modified work shall continue to be eligible to receive “temporary partial” worker’s compensation benefits as well as all other entitlements as provided by applicable federal or state worker’s compensation statutes.
Employees who need additional medical and/or physical therapy
- 75 -
Article 14, Section 2
may go for such treatments during scheduled hours for modified work whenever practical and reasonable.
(c)	At facilities where the Employer has a modified work program in place, temporary modified assignments shall be offered in seniority order to those regular full time employees who are temporarily disabled due to a compensable worker’s compensation injury and who have received a detailed medical release from the attending physician clearly setting forth the limitations under which the employee may perform such modified assignments. Once a modified work assignment is made and another person is injured, the second person must wait until a modified work opening occurs, regardless of seniority. All modified work assignments must be made in strict compliance with the physical restrictions as outlined by the attending physician. All modified work program candidates must be released for eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days per week. The Employer, at its option, may make a modified work offer of less than eight (8) hours per day where such work is expected to accelerate the rehabilitative process and the attending physician recommends that the employee works back to regular status or up to eight (8) hours per day by progressively increasing daily hours. A copy of any release for modified work must be given to the employee before the modified work assignment begins.
It is understood and agreed that those employees who, consistent with professional medical evaluations and opinion, may not be expected to receive an unrestricted medical release, or whose injury has been medically determined to be permanent and stationary, shall not be eligible to participate in a modified work program.
In the event of a dispute related to conflicting medical opinion, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to established worker’s compensation law and/or the method of resolving such matters as outlined in the applicable Supplemental Agreement. In the absence of a provision in the Supplemental Agreement, the following shall apply:
When there is a dispute between two (2) physicians concerning the release of an employee for modified work, such two (2) physicians shall immediately select a third (3rd) neutral physician within seven (7) days, who shall possess the same qualifications as the most qual
-76-
Article 14, Section 2
ified of the two selecting physicians, whose opinion shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Union and the employee. In the event the availability of a qualified physician is in question, the Local Union and the Company shall resolve such matter by selecting the third (3rd) physician whose opinion shall be final and binding. The expense of the third (3rd) physician shall be equally divided between the Employer and the Union. Disputes concerning the selection of the neutral physician or back wages shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
For locations where the Employer intends to implement a modified work program or has a modified work program in place, the Local Union shall be provided with a copy of the current form(s) being used for employee evaluation for release and general job descriptions. This information shall be general in nature, not employee specific.
When a modified work assignment is made, the employee shall be provided with the hours and days he/she is scheduled to work as well as the nature of the work to be performed in writing. A copy of this notice shall also be submitted to the Local Union.
An employee who is placed in a modified work position may be subject to medical evaluation(s) by a physician selected by the Employer to determine if the modified work being performed is accelerating the rehabilitative process as anticipated by Section 2 above. In the event such medical evaluation(s) determine that the rehabilitative process is not being accelerated, the employee shall have the right to seek a second opinion from a physician of his choosing. Any disputes regarding conflicting medical claims shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions outlined above. The employee may be removed from the modified work program based upon final medical findings under this procedure. Employees so removed shall not have their worker’s compensation benefits affected because of such removal. In the event the employee’s temporary disability worker’s compensation benefit is subject to reduction by virtue of an applicable Federal or State statute, the Employer shall pay the difference between the amount of the reduced temporary worker’s compensation benefit to which the employee would be entitled.
- 77 -
Article 14, Section 2
(d)	Modified work shall be restricted to the type of work that is not expected to result in a re-injury and which can be performed within the medical limitations set forth by the attending physician. In the event the employee, in his/her judgment, is physically unable to perform the modified work assigned, he/she shall be either reassigned modified work within his/her physical capabilities or returned to full “temporary total” worker’s compensation benefits. In the event a third (3rd) party insurance carrier refuses to reinstate such employee to full temporary total disability benefits, the Employer shall be required to pay the difference between the amount of the benefit paid by such third (3rd) party insurer and full total temporary disability benefits. Determination of physical capabilities shall be based on the attending physician’s medical evaluation. Under no conditions will the injured employee be required to perform work at that location subject to the terms and conditions of the National Master Freight Agreement or its Area Supplemental Agreements. Prior to acceptance of modified work, the affected employee shall be furnished a written job description of the type of work to be performed.
(e)	The modified workday and workweek shall be established by the Employer within the limitations set forth by the attending physician. However, the workday shall not exceed eight (8) hours, inclusive of coffee breaks where applicable and exclusive of a one-half (1/2) hour meal period and the workweek shall not exceed forty (40) hours, Monday through Friday, or Tuesday through Saturday, unless' the nature of the modified work assignment requires a scheduled workweek to include Sunday. Whenever possible, the Employer will schedule modified work during daylight hours, Monday through Friday, or during the same general working hours and on the same workweek that the employee enjoyed before he/she became injured. In the case of an employee whose workdays and/or hours routinely varied, the Employer will schedule the employee based on the availability of the modified assignment being offered. Any alleged abuse of the assignment of workdays and work hours shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
(f)	Modified work time shall be considered as time worked when necessary to satisfy vacation and sick leave eligibility requirements as set forth in the National Master Freight Agreement and/or its
-78 -
Article 14, Section 2
applicable Area Supplemental Agreements. In addition to earned vacation pay as set forth in the applicable Area Supplemental Agreements, employees accepting modified work shall receive prorated vacation pay for modified work performed based on the weekly average modified work pay. The only time modified work is used in prorating vacation is when the employee did not qualify under the applicable Supplemental Agreement.
Holiday pay shall first be paid in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement as it relates to on-the-job injuries. Once such contractual provisions have been satisfied, holidays will be paid at the modified work rate which is the modified work wage plus the temporary partial disability benefit.
Sick leave and funeral leave taken while an employee is performing modified work will be paid at the modified work rate, which is the modified work wage plus the temporary partial disability benefit. Unused sick leave will be paid at the applicable contract rate where the employee performed modified work and qualified for the sick leave during the contract year.
(g)	The Employer shall continue to remit contributions to the appropriate health & welfare and pension trusts during the entire time period employees are performing modified work. The payment of health & welfare and pension contributions while the employee is on modified work is not included in the health & welfare and pension contributions required by the Supplement when an employee is off work on worker’s compensation. Continuation of such contributions beyond the period of time specified in the Supplemental Agreement for on-the-job injury shall be required. Provisions of this Section shall not be utilized as a reason to disqualify or remove an employee from the modified work program.
(h)	Employees accepting modified work shall receive temporary partial benefits as determined by each respective state worker’s compensation law, plus a modified work wage when added to such temporary partial benefit, shall equal not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of forty (40) hours’ pay he/she would otherwise be entitled to under the provisions of the applicable Area Supplemental Agreement for the first six (6) months from the date the modified
-79-
Article 14, Section 2
work assignment commences. After this initial six (6) month period, the percentage shall increase to ninety percent (90%) for the duration of each individual modified work assignment. The Employer shall not refuse to assign modified work to employees based solely on such employees reaching the ninety percent (90%) wage level. Such refusal shall be considered an abuse of the program and shall be subject to the grievance procedure. Modified work assignments beginning or ending within a workweek shall be paid on a prorated basis; one (I) day equals one-fifth (l/5th).
(i)	Employees accepting modified work shall not be subject to disciplinary action provisions of the Supplemental Agreements unless such violation involves an offense for which no prior warning notice is required under the applicable Supplemental Agreement (Cardinal Sins). Additionally, the provisions of Article 35, Section 3(a), shall apply.
(j)	Alleged abuses of the modified work program by the Employer and any factual grievance or request for interpretation concerning this Article shall be submitted directly to the Regional Joint Area Committee. Proven abuses may result in a determination by the National Grievance Committee that would withdraw the benefits of this Article from that Employer, in whole or in part, in which case affected employees shall immediately revert to full worker’s compensation benefits.
Section 3.	Workers Compensation Pay Dispute
Should an employee have a undisputed pay claim concerning the established state worker compensation amount required by Law, the Employer will provide each individual an emergency dispute phone number which will be operational twenty four (24) hours, seven (7) days a week. The Employer’s Workers Compensation Manager will have authority to make immediate payment. The pay shortage will be reconciled by check delivered by express overnight mail within twenty four (24) hours of the call. If the disputed pay is not received within the twenty-four hour period, an eight (8) hour penalty will be paid the employee for every day until the pay is received.
-80-
Article 14, Section 4
Section 4.	Americans with Disabilities Act
The Union and the Employer recognize their obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is agreed that the Employer shall determine whether an employee is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and, if so, what reasonable accommodations, if any, should be provided. In the'event that the Employer determines that a reasonable accommodation is necessary, the Employer shall notify the Local Union before providing the reasonable accommodation to a qualified bargaining unit employee to ensure that the reasonable accommodation selected by the Employer does not impact another employee’s seniority or other contract rights.
Any dispute over whether the Employer complied with its duty to notify the Local Union before implementing a proposed reasonable accommodation or whether providing the reasonable accommodation violates any employee’s rights under any other provision of the NMFA shall be subject to the grievance procedure. Disputes over whether the Employer has complied with its legal requirements under the ADA, including the ADA requirements to provide a reasonable accommodation, however, shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
ARTICLE 15.	MILITARY CLAUSE
Employees in service in the uniformed services of the United States, as defined by the provisions of the Uniform Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), Title 38, U.S. Code Chapter 43, shall be granted all rights and privileges provided by USERRA and/or other applicable state and federal laws. This shall include continuation of health coverage to the extent required by USERRA, and continuation of pension contributions for the employee’s period of service as provided by USERRA. Employee shall be subject to all obligations contained in USERRA which must be satisfied for the employees to be covered by the statute.
In addition to any contribution required under USERRA, the Employer shall continue to pay health & welfare contributions for regular active employees involuntarily called to active duty status from the military reserves or the National Guard for military-relat-

ed service, excluding civil domestic disturbances or emergencies. Such contributions shall only be paid for a maximum period of eighteen (18) months.
ARTICLE 16.	EQUIPMENT, SAFETY AND HEALTH
Preamble
It is agreed that all parties covered by this Agreement shall comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations pertaining to worker safety and health and subjects covered by Article 16. Failure to do so shall be subject to the grievance procedure, in accordance with Articles 7 and 8 of the NMFA, and any other remedies prescribed by law after the procedures contained in this Agreement are exhausted. Class A casual mechanics will not be allowed to sign off safety related write ups.
Section 1.	Safe Equipment
The Employer shall not require employees to take out on the streets or highways any vehicle that is not in a safe operating condition, including, but not limited to, equipment which is acknowledged as overweight or not equipped with the safety appliances prescribed by law. It shall not be a violation of this Agreement or basis for discipline where employees refuse to operate such equipment unless such refusal is unjustified.
It shall also not be a violation of this Agreement or considered an unjustified refusal where employees refuse to operate a vehicle when such operation constitutes a violation of any federal rules, regulations, standards, or orders applicable to commercial motor vehicle safety or health, or because of the employee’s reasonable apprehension of serious injury to himself/herself or the public due to the unsafe condition of such equipment. The unsafe conditions causing the employee’s apprehension of injury must be of such nature that a reasonable person, under the circumstances then confronting the employee, would conclude that there is a bona fide danger of an accident, injury, or serious impairment of health, resulting from the unsafe condition. In order to qualify for protection under
-82-
Article 16, Section 1
this provision, the employee must have sought from the Employer, and have been unable to obtain, correction of the unsafe condition.
All equipment which is refused because it is not mechanically sound or properly equipped shall be appropriately tagged so that it cannot be used by other employees until the maintenance department has adjusted the complaint. After such equipment is repaired, the Employer shall place on such equipment an “ok” in a conspicuous place so the employee can see the same.

When required by his/her Employer, the employee, before starting his/her next shift, shall make out an accident or incident report in writing on forms furnished by the Employer and shall turn in all available names and addresses of witnesses to the accident or incident. The employee shall receive a copy of the accident or incident report that he/she submits to his/her Employer. Failure to comply with this provision shall subject such employee to disciplinary action by the Employer.
Section 4.	Equipment Reports
Employees shall immediately, or at the end of their shift, report all defects of equipment.
(a)	Such reports shall be made on a suitable form furnished by the Employer and shall be made in multiple copies, one (I) copy to be
- 83 -
Article 16, Section 4
retained by the employee and one (I) copy to be made available for inspection by the next driver operating the unit. Such copy will remain in the truck. Any alleged violation of the above shall not be cause for refusal of the equipment, but shall be subject to the grievance procedure. The Employer shall not ask or require any employee to take out equipment that has been reported by any other employee as being in an unsafe operating condition until the same has been repaired or is certified by a mechanical department that no repairs are needed and the unit is safe to drive.
(b)	When the occasion arises where an employee gives written report on forms in use by the Employer of a vehicle being in an unsafe working or operating condition and receives no consideration from the Employer, he/she shall take the matter up with the officers of the Union who will take the matter up with the Employer. However, in no event shall an employee be required to take out on the streets or highways a vehicle that is not in a safe operating condition or in violation of any federal rules, regulations, standards, or orders applicable to commercial motor vehicle safety as provided in Section I of this Article.
Section 5.	Qualifications on Equipment
If the Employer or government agency requests a regular employee to qualify on equipment requiring a classified or special license, or in the event an employee is required to qualify (recognizing seniority) on such equipment in order to obtain a better job opportunity with his/her Employer, the Employer shall allow such regular employee the use of the equipment so required in order to take the examination on the employee’s own time.
Costs of such license required by a government agency will be paid for by the employee.
An employee unable to successfully pass the DOT Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) examination will be allowed to take a leave of absence for a period not to exceed one (I) year provided the employee makes a bona fide effort to pass the test each time the opportunity presents itself.
- 84 -
Article 16, Section 5
Once obtained an employee must maintain his/her commercial driver’s license with required endorsements unless disqualified by regulatory mandate or documented medical disability.
Section 6.	Equipment Requirements

ARTICLE 29.	SUBSTITUTE SERVICE
Section 1.	Piggyback Operations
(a)	An Employer shall not use piggyback over the same route where the Employer has established relay runs or through runs except to move overflow freight or as otherwise provided in Section 3 herein.
(b)	It is recognized and agreed that there were two distinct and separate types of rail operations in effect on April I, 1994: (I) the use of rail to move overflow freight; and (2) approved and/or agreed to rail operations. Accordingly, the provisions of this Section I shall apply in its entirety to the overflow rail operations. This Section I shall only apply to the approved and/or agreed to rail operations to the extent it has been historically applied prior to April I, 1994.
If a driver is available (which includes the two (2)-hour period of time prior to end of his/her rest period) at point of origin when a trailer leaves the yard for the piggyback ramp, such driver’s runaround compensation shall start from the time the trailer leaves the yard. Available regular drivers at relay points shall be protected against runarounds if a violation occurred at the point of origin.
If the Employer does not have an over-the-road domicile at the point of origin, the Employer shall protect against runaround the available drivers at the first relay point over which the freight would normally move had it not been placed on the rail. Available regular drivers at relay points shall be protected against runaround if a violation occurred at the first relay point.
The Employer shall not reduce or fail to increase the road driver complement, including the addition of equipment, at the point of origin for the purpose of creating an overflow of freight to avoid the application of this Section.
(c)	When an Employer utilizes Piggyback operations as a substitute
- 103 -
Article 29, Section 1
service to deliver overflow loads and such substitute service is matched in both directions (East to West and West to East or North to South and South to North), it is understood and agreed by the parties that the Employer will be required to add a sufficient number of employees and the necessary amount of equipment to move trailers over the road when the volume of matched loads reaches a level to insure efficient utilization of equipment and regular work opportunity for the added employees.
It is the intent of the parties in this Section I to maximize the movement of freight over the Employer’s established relay runs, thereby minimizing the use of substitute service.
The record keeping requirement set out in Section 2 below will provide the Union with the basis of monitoring the use of such piggyback operation.
(d)	The Employer agrees the non-employee owner-operators, birdy-back, fishy-back and barge operations will not be used over the same routes where the Employer has established relay runs during the term of this Agreement.
Section 2.	Maintenance of Records
(a)	Trailers piggybacked as a substitute service as provided in Section I are to be signed in and signed out on the regular dispatch sheet in road operations, and where there are no road operations sign-in and sign-out sheets shall be maintained at an appropriate location, including trailers taken to and from the rail yard by city employees. These sheets will be made available, upon request, to the drivers for a period of thirty (30) days. The Employer shall report in writing on a monthly basis to the Local Union at the rail origin point, or in cases where there are no drivers domiciled at the rail origin point to the Local Union at the first driver relay point affected, the number of trailers put on the rail at the rail origin point. The Employer shall also report the origin, destination, trailer/load number, trailer weight and the time the trailer/load leaves the Employer’s yard for the rail yard. The time limits set forth in the Supplemental Agreement for filing claims based upon the monthly report shall commence to run upon the receipt of the report by the Local Union.
- 104-
Article 29, Section 2
(b)	With regard to use of substitute service as provided in Section 1, full and complete records of handling, dispatch and movement of such units system-wide shall be kept by the Employer and a report, which will include the date of all outbound rail movement, all points of origin and destination, all trailer numbers and the name of each railroad/routing, shall be sent on a quarterly basis to the office of the National Freight Director and the affected Area Regional Freight Director.
Where inspection of the records indicates that piggyback is being used as a substitute for road operations, as defined in Section 1 of this Article, over an established relay, rather than handling overflow traffic, the grievance procedure may be invoked at the appropriate Regional Joint Area Committee by the Regional Freight Coordinator or the office of the National Freight Director to provide a reasonable remedy for the improper usage of piggyback, including the revocation of the use of substitute service, for repeated violations over such relay.
(c)	With regard to trailers moved on rail as an approved intermodal operations set forth in Section 3, the Employer shall report in writing on a monthly basis to each Local Union affected, the number of trailers put on the rail at the rail origin points of the approved intermodal operations. The Employer shall also report the origin, destination, trailer/load number, trailer weight and the time the trailer/load leaves the Employer’s yard for the rail yard.
In addition, the Employer shall, on a quarterly basis, send to the office of the National Freight Director a report containing the total intermodal rail miles as reported on line 6 of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Schedule 600 annual report and the total miles as reported on line 7 of the BTS Schedule 600 annual report.
(d)	With regard to the use of a Preferred Company as provided in Section 6, the Employer shall report in writing on a monthly basis to each Local Union affected, the number of trailers tendered to any Preferred Company. The Employer also shall report the origin, destination, trailer/load number, trailer weight and the time the trailer/load leaves the Employer’s yard.
- 105 -
Article 29, Section 2
In addition, the Employer shall, on a quarterly basis, send to the office of the National Freight Director a report containing the total number of miles the Employer utilized any Preferred Company consistent with the requirements of Article 29, Section 6.
Section 3.	Intermodal Service
(a)	The parties recognize that in 1991, Congress passed the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 and declared the policy of the United States to be one of promoting the development of a national intermodal transportation system consisting of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected manner. The parties have, therefore, entered into this Agreement to enhance the Employer’s opportunities to secure the benefits which flow from this national policy of encouraging intermodal transportation, including long-term stable and secure employment. At the same time, the parties recognize the need to minimize and provide for the impact which intermodal operations may have on certain employees covered by this Agreement.
(b)	Use of Intemodal Service
1.	Subject to the conditions set forth hereinafter, an Employer may establish a new intermodal service over the same route where the Employer has established relay runs or through runs.
Present relay or through operations may not be reduced, modified or changed in any other manner as the result of the implementation of a new intermodal service until such time as the proposed intermodal operation has been approved by the National Intermodal Committee. The Employer shall submit to the National Intermodal Committee an application for approval which shall identify the road operation(s) the intended intermodal service will reduce and/or eliminate; a list identifying the name and seniority date of each driver affected by the intended intermodal service(s); and a list by domicile of each of the road drivers openings available.
In the event the National Intermodal Committee is unable to agree on whether or not the Employer’s proposed intermodal operations meet the criteria set forth below, the proposed operation shall not be approved until such time as those issues are resolved. This provision
- 106-
Article 29, Section 3
shall not be utilized as a method to delay and/or deny a proposed intermodal operation when the criteria set forth below have been clearly satisfied.
(a)	There shall be no more than two (2) intermodal changes approved during the term of this Agreement; and
(b)	No more than ten (10) percent of the Employer’s total active road driver seniority list as of April 1, 1998 shall be affected by the intermodal changes approved during the term of this Agreement.
In the event a proposed intermodal operation also includes the transfer of work that is subject to the provisions of Article 8, Section 6, the proposed intermodal operations and the transfer of work subject to Article 8, Section 6, may be heard by a combined National Intermodal/Change of Operations Committee on a joint record, and the seniority rights of all affected employees shall be determined by such Committee, which shall have the authority granted in Article 8, Section 6(g).
2.	An approved intermodal operation that provides service over established relay and/or through operations shall include protection for all bid drivers during each dispatch day and all extra board drivers during each dispatch week at each of the affected domiciles.
For purposes of determining the weekly protection for extra board drivers, the affected driver’s average weekly earnings during the previous four (4) week period in which the driver had normal earnings shall be considered the weekly protection when violations occur.
3.	When transporting any shipment by intermodal service within the Employer’s terminal network, the Employer shall utilize its drivers subject to the applicable respective area supplemental agreements to pickup such shipments from the shipper at point of origin and/or the Employer’s terminal and deliver them to the applicable intermodal exchange point. The Employer also shall use its drivers to deliver intermodal shipments to the consignee or the Employer’s terminal. A driver may be required to drive through other terminal service areas to the intermodal exchange point to pickup and deliver intermodal shipments without penalty.
- 107 -
Article 29, Section 3
4.	Total intermodal rail miles included on line 303 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report shall not exceed 28 percent of the Employer’s total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. In the event intermodal rail miles exceed this 28 percent maximum, the Employer shall be required to remove an appropriate amount of freight from the rail and add a corresponding number of drivers at each affected domicile. Effective for Calendar Year 2005 and thereafter, the maximum amount of rail miles as a percent of total miles as calculated above will be reduced from 28% to 26%. Effective April 1, 2008 and subject to the provisions of Section 6 of the Article, total intermodal rail miles included on line 303 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report shall not exceed 24% of the Employer’s total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. In the event intermodal rail miles exceed this 24% maximum, the Employer shall be required to remove an appropriate amount of freight from the rail and add a corresponding number of drivers at each affected domicile.
The parties recognize that the current shipping markets demand expedited delivery of freight in a manner that may not be accomplished by hauling certain freight by rail. These market demands create a need to reduce the amount of freight hauled by rail and to use alternative methods of substitute service. As contemplated by Article 20, Section 4, new business opportunities may be pursued that promote new Teamster job opportunities while protecting existing Teamster jobs, benefits, and working conditions. With these facts in mind, the rail miles as a percentage of total miles will be reduced as follows: effective Calendar Year 2010, the maximum amount of rail miles as a percentage of total miles as calculated above will be reduced from 24% to 21.5%. Effective Calendar Year 2011, the maximum amount of rail miles as a percentage of total miles as calculated above will be reduced from 21.5% to 21%. Effective Calendar Year 2012, the maximum amount of rail miles as a percentage of total miles as calculated above will be reduced from 21% to 19%. The reduction in rail miles during the term of this Agreement is subject to the provisions of Article 29, Section 6.
The National Intermodal Committee shall establish rules and guidelines that will allow the Union the opportunity to verify and audit
- 108 -
Article 29, Section's
the Employer’s BTS rail reports. In the event the Union establishes through the grievance procedure that an Employer has falsified the BTS reports in order to increase the maximum amount of intermodal rail miles permitted under this Article, the remedy for such a violation shall include a cessation of the Employer’s affected intermodal service until such time as the issue has been resolved to the satisfaction of the Union.
In the event the BTS rail and/or line haul miles reporting requirements are modified and/or eliminated, the parties will meet to develop a substitute reporting procedure consistent with those of the BTS.
(c)	Job Protection for Current Road Drivers
1.	Rail operations that are subject to the provisions of Section 1(b) above shall not result in the layoff or involuntary transfer of any driver at any affected road driver domicile.
2.	During the term of this Agreement, an Employer shall be permitted no more than two (2) Intermodal Changes whereby the Employer may reduce and/or eliminate existing road operation(s) through the use of intermodal service. It is specifically agreed that a total of no more than ten (10) percent of the Employer’s total active road driver seniority list as of April 1, 2003, shall be affected by the Intermodal Changes during the term of this Agreement.
Any road driver who is adversely affected by an approved Intermodal Operation and would thereby be subject to layoff, or who is on layoff at an affected domicile at the time an Intermodal Operation is approved, shall be offered work opportunity at other road driver domiciles within the Employer’s system. The Employer shall include in its proposed Intermodal Operations specific facts that adequately support the Employer’s claims that there will be sufficient freight to support the work opportunities the Employer proposes at each gaining domicile. In the event there is more than one (1) domicile involved, the drivers adversely affected shall be dovetailed on a master seniority list and an opportunity to relocate shall be offered on a seniority basis, subject to the provisions of Article 8, Section 6. The “hold” procedures set forth in Article 8, Section 6
- 109 -
Article 29, Section 3
of the NMFA shall be applicable. Where the source of the proposed work opportunity is presently being performed by bargaining unit employees over the road, the Employer shall be required to make reasonable efforts to fill the offered positions as set forth in Article 8, Section 6(d)(6).
Drivers who relocate under this provision shall be dovetailed on the applicable seniority list at the domicile they bid into. Health & welfare and pension contributions shall be remitted in accordance with the provisions of Article 8, Section 6(a) and moving and lodging shall be paid in accordance with Article 8, Section 6(c) of the NMFA.
It is understood and agreed that the intent of this provision is to provide the maximum job security possible to those drivers affected by the use of intermodal service. Therefore, the number of drivers on the affected seniority lists at rail origin points at the time an intermodal change becomes effective shall not be reduced during the term of this Agreement other than as may be provided in subsequent changes of operations. Drivers on the affected seniority lists at gaining domiciles at the time an intermodal change becomes effective, shall not be permanently laid off during the term of this Agreement.
The senior driver voluntarily laid off at an intermodal losing domicile will be restored to the active board each time foreign drivers or casuals (where applicable) make ten (10) trips (tours of duty) within any thirty (30) calendar day period on a primary run of such domicile, not affected by a Change of Operations.
For the purposes of this Section, short-term layoffs (1) that coincide with normal seasonal freight flow reductions that are experienced on a regional basis and that include a reduction in rail freight that corresponds to the reduction in truck traffic, or (2) that are incidental day-to-day layoffs due to reasons such as adverse weather conditions and holiday scheduling, shall not be considered as a permanent layoff. Layoffs created by a documented loss of a customer shall not exceed thirty (30) days. Any layoff for reasons other than as described above shall be considered as a permanent layoff. The Employer shall have the burden of proving that a layoff is not permanent.
- 110-
Article 29, Section 3
In order to ensure that the work opportunities of the drivers at the gaining domiciles are not adversely affected by the redomiciling of drivers, the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the drivers at a gaining domicile shall not have their earnings reduced below an average weekly earnings of seven hundred dollars ($700). This seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee shall not start until the fourth (4th) week following the implementation of the approved Intermodal Change of Operation.
It is not the intent of this provision to establish a seven hundred dollar ($700) per week as an artificial base wage but rather a minimum guarantee. This provision shall not preclude the short-term layoffs as defined above. The Employer shall have the burden of proving that drivers at the gaining domiciles have not had their work opportunities adversely affected by the redomiciling of drivers.
The seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee shall be determined based on the average four (4) weeks earnings of each active protected driver on the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the seniority roster. When the earnings of any active protected driver in the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the seniority roster totals less than two thousand, eight hundred dollars ($2,800) during each four (4) week period, the driver shall be compensated for the difference between actual earnings and two thousand, eight hundred dollars ($2,800).
The four (4) week average shall be calculated each week on a “rolling” basis. A “rolling” four (4) week period is defined as a base week and the previous three consecutive weeks. Where an Employer makes a payment to an employee to fulfill the guarantee, the amount paid shall be added to the employee’s earnings for the base week of the applicable four (4) week period and shall be included in the calculations for subsequent four (4) week “rolling” periods to determine whether any further guarantee payments to the employee are due.
Time not worked shall be credited to drivers for purposes of computing earnings in the following instances:
- Ill -
Article 29, Section 3
a.	Where a driver is offered a work opportunity that the driver has a contractual obligation to accept, and the driver elects not to accept such work, the driver shall have an amount equal to the amount of the wages such work would have generated credited to such driver for purposes of determining the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee.
No driver shall be penalized by having contractual earned time off credited for purposes of determining the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee. However, where a driver takes earned time off in excess of forty-eight (48) hours during any work week, that work week shall be excluded from the rolling four (4) week period used to determined the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee.
b.	Where a driver uses a contractual provision to refuse or defer work so as to knowingly avoid legitimate work opportunity and therefore abuse the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee, the driver shall have an amount equal to the amount of the wages such work would have generated credited to such driver for purposes of determining the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee.
Nothing in this subsection applies to or shall be construed to limit claims by any driver on the seniority roster at a gaining domicile alleging that the driver’s work opportunity was adversely affected following the implementation of the Intermodal Change of Operations because of the Employer’s failure to provide adequate work opportunities for existing and redomiciled drivers. However, after the point that the Employer has provided adequate work opportunities for protected drivers (existing and redomiciled), the wage protection for active drivers in the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the seniority roster shall be limited to the seven hundred dollar ($700) guarantee.
As soon as a factual determination has been made that a driver in the bottom twenty-five percent (25%) of the seniority roster is entitled to the seven hundred dollar ($700) average wage guarantee, the driver’s claim shall be paid. All other types of claims that the driver’s work opportunities have been adversely affected shall be held
- 112-
Article 29, Section 3
in abeyance until determined through the intermodal grievance procedure.
Section 4.	National Intermodal Committee
The parties shall establish a National Intermodal Committee composed of four (4) Union representatives appointed by the Union Chairman of the National Grievance Committee and four (4) Employer representatives appointed by the Employer Chairman of the National Grievance Committee. In the event a proposed intermodal operation includes the transfer of work subject to the provisions of Article 8, Section 6, the National Intermodal Committee shall then be considered as a combined National Intermodal/Multi-Region Change of Operations Committee with the authority to resolve all seniority issues in accordance with the authority granted by Article 8, Section 6(g).
The National Intermodal Committee shall establish rules of procedure to govern the manner in which proposed intermodal operations are to be heard, procedures for resolving intermodal issues and procedures for establishing pre-hearing guidelines.
Any grievance concerning the application or interpretation of Article 29, Section 2(c) or concerning any issues that may arise from an approved intermodal operation provided for in this Section 3, shall be first referred to the National Intermodal Committee. If the National Intermodal Committee is unable to reach a decision on an interpretation or grievance, the issue will be referred to the National Grievance Committee.
Section 5.	-
The Employer is prohibited from using rail as a subterfuge to transport freight by truck, driven by those outside of the bargaining unit. To this end, all loads tendered to the railroad shall be tendered by the Employer using bargaining unit employees at the point where the load is to be placed on the rail. Once tendered to the railroad, a load may not be transferred to non-bargaining unit personnel for transport by truck except in bona fide emergencies beyond the control of the Employer and/or the railroad. Such emergencies shall not include the Employer tendering loads to the railroad when the
-113-
Article 29, Section 5
Employer knows or should know the load will not meet the scheduled departure time of the train and the railroad then transports the load by truck. The parties agree that this Subsection shall not apply to the Employer’s existing rail operations, that have otherwise been permitted prior to February 8, 1998, by written agreement of the parties, or through a grievance decision. The parties further agree that nothing in this Subsection shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect the railroads movements of loads within the metropolitan area between railroads or between tracks. This provision shall apply to all rail activities permitted under this Article.
Section 6.
1.	Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Employer shall be permitted to utilize companies for over-the-road purchased transportation substitute service. The parties shall designate at least one (1) Preferred Company for over-the-road purchased transportation substitute service under this Section. Until December 31, 2009, the maximum amount of over-the-road purchased transportation shall be limited to 4% of the Employer’s total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. During Calendar Year 2010, the maximum amount of over-the-road purchased transportation shall be increased from 4% to 6.5% of the Employer’s total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. During Calendar Year 2011, the maximum amount of over-the-road purchased transportation shall be increased from 6.5% to 7% of the Employer’s total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. During Calendar Year 2012, the maximum amount of over-the-road purchased transportation shall be increased from 7% to 9% of the Employer’s total miles as reported on line 301 of Schedule 300 of the BTS Annual Report during any calendar year. In the event the parties fail to designate at least one (I) Preferred Company for over-the-road purchased transportation substitute service, the maximum amount of rail miles provided for in Section 3(b)(4) of the Article shall be returned to 26% for the remainder of this Agreement. It is agreed that any Preferred Company utilized under this Section shall be permitted to drop and pick-up trailers at the Employer’s terminal locations, but shall be
- 114 -
Article 29, Section 6 required to do so in areas of the terminal specifically designated for such exchange.
2.	For purposes of the Employer’s existing rail origin points as described in Article 29, Section 3, the use of a Preferred Company under this Section over established relay and/or through operations shall include protection for all bid drivers during each dispatch day and all extra board drivers during each dispatch week at the originating domiciles. For purposes of determining the weekly protection for extra board drivers, the affected driver’s average weekly earnings during the previous four (4) week period in which the driver had normal earnings shall be considered the weekly protection when violations occur. In the event that the Employer uses a Preferred Company as substitute service, the Article 29, Section 3 job protections for current road drivers shall apply.
3.	All disputes arising under this Article 29, Section 6 shall be referred for resolution to the National Review Committee.
ARTICLE 30.	JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES
In the event that any dispute should arise between any Local Unions, parties to this Agreement or Supplements thereto, or between any Local Union, party to this Agreement or Supplements thereto and any other Union, relating to jurisdiction over employees or operations covered by such Agreements, the Employer and the Local Unions agree to accept and comply with the decision or settlement of the Unions or Union bodies which have the authority to determine such dispute, and such disputes shall not be submitted to arbitration under this Agreement or Supplements thereto or to legal or administrative agency proceedings. Pending such determination, the Employer shall not be precluded from seeking appropriate legal or administrative relief against work stoppages or picketing in furtherance of such dispute.
ARTICLE 31.	MULTI-EMPLOYER, MULTI-UNION UNIT
The parties agree to become a part of the multi-employer, multiunion bargaining unit established by this National Master Freight Agreement, and to be bound by the interpretations and enforcement
- 115 -
Article 31
of this National Master Freight Agreement and Supplements thereto.
ARTICLE 32.	SUBCONTRACTING
Section 1.	Work Preservation
For the purpose of preserving work and job opportunities for the employees covered by this Agreement, the signatory Employer agrees that no operation, work or services of the kind, nature or type covered by, or presently performed by, or hereafter assigned to, the collective bargaining unit by the signatory Employer will be subcontracted, transferred, leased, diverted, assigned or conveyed in full or in part (hereinafter referred to as “divert” or “subcontract”), by the Employer to any other plant, business, person, or non-unit employees, or to any other mode of operation, unless specifically provided and permitted in this Agreement.
In addition, the signatory Employer agrees that it will not, as hereinafter set forth, subcontract or divert the work presently performed by, or hereafter assigned to, its employees to nonemployee owner-operators or other business entities owned and/or controlled by the signatory Employer, or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates.
Section 2.	Diversion of Work - Parent or Subsidiary Companies
The parties agree that for purposes of this Article it shall be presumed that a diversion of work in violation of this Agreement occurs when work presently and regularly performed by, or hereafter assigned to, employees of the signatory Employer has been lost and the lost work is being performed in the same manner (including transportation by owner-operators and independent contractors) by an entity owned and/or controlled by the signatory Employer, its parent, or a subsidiary, including logistics companies, within one hundred twenty (120) days of the loss of the work. The burden of overcoming such presumption in the grievance procedure shall be upon the Employer.
- H6-
Article 32, Section 3
Section 3.	Subcontracting
The Employer may subcontract work when all of his/her regular employees are working, except that in no event shall road work presently performed or runs established during the life of this Agreement be farmed out. No dock work shall be farmed out except for existing situations established by agreed-to past practices. Overflow loads may be delivered pursuant to the provisions of Article 29. Loads may also be delivered by other agreed-to methods or as presently agreed to. Other persons performing subcontracted work which is permitted herein shall receive no less than the equivalent of the economic terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable Supplement.
The signatory Employer shall maintain records identifying persons performing subcontracted work permitted by this Agreement. Said records shall be made available for inspection by the Local Union(s) in the locality affected by such subcontract work.
The normal, orderly interlining of freight for peddle on occasional basis, where there are parallel rights, and when not for the purpose of evading this Agreement, may be continued as has been permitted by past practice provided it is not being done to defeat the provisions of this Agreement.
Section 4.	Expansion of Operations
(a)	Adjoining Over-The-Road and Local Cartage
It is understood and agreed that the provisions of the National Master Freight Agreement shall be applied, without evidence of union representation of the employees involved, to all subsequent additions to, and extensions of, current over-the-road or local cartage operations which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as part of such current operations of the signatory Employer, or any other entity, not operated wholly independently of the signatory Employer within the meaning of Article 3, Section 1 (a). In this regard, the parties agree that newly-established terminals and consolidations of terminals which are controlled and utilized as part of a current operation will be covered by the National Master Freight
-117-
Article 32, Section 4
Agreement and applicable Over-the-Road and Local Cartage Supplemental Agreements.
(b)	New Pick-Up and Delivery Adjoining Current Operations
It shall not, however, be a violation of this Article if, during the term of this Agreement, an Employer commences pick-up and delivery operations which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as part of such current operations with other than its own employees when there is insufficient business to economically justify the establishment of its own employer-operated pick-up and delivery service. However, the above exception shall thereafter terminate when sufficient economic justification develops so as to warrant the establishment and maintenance of the terminal operation by such Employer, in which event, the Employer shall institute a pick-up and delivery operation or continue such operations with companies which maintain wage standards established by this Agreement in the area where the work is conducted. This exception shall not apply in any circumstance where an Employer is presently engaged in pick-up and delivery operations either through his/her own terminal or through companies which maintain such wage standards.
(c)	Non-Adjoining Pick-Up and Delivery Operations
The parties further agree that with respect to all subsequently established over-the-road and local cartage operations and terminals of the signatory Employer which do not adjoin, but are utilized and controlled as part of, current over-the-road and local cartage operations, the provisions of Article 2, Section 3(a) shall govern so that when a majority of the eligible employees of the signatory Employer performing work at that location execute a card authorizing a signatory Local Union to represent them as their collective bargaining agent at the terminal location, then, such employees shall automatically be covered by this Agreement and the applicable Supplemental Agreements.
(d)	Operations permitted by Article 29, and not in violation of any other provisions of this Agreement, are not to be considered as extensions of current operations within the meaning of Section 4.
- 118-
Article 32, Section 5
Section 5.
For the purpose of preserving work and job opportunities, the National Grievance Committee may define the circumstances and adopt procedures by which an Employer and a Local Union, parties to this Agreement, may in compliance therewith enter into a Special Circumstance Agreement which does not meet the standards provided herein.
Section 6.
During negotiations for the National Master Freight Agreement to replace the Agreement which is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2003, the parties discussed employer subcontracting under Article 32 of the NMFA. As a result of these discussions, the parties agreed to the following understandings and clarifications as to the intent of the work preservation, diversion of work, and subcontracting provisions of Article 32:
A.	It is a violation of Article 32 to use vendors to perform work, other than overflow, of the kind, nature, or type currently or previously performed by bargaining unit employees. For example, it is a violation of Article 32 for the size of the bargaining unit to decrease by attrition and the Employer not replace the employees while using vendors to perform work of the kind, nature, or type previously performed by that bargaining unit. Bargaining unit work of the kind, nature, or type includes any pick-up or delivery of freight, dockwork, clerical, or maintenance work functions performed by the bargaining unit under the Agreement.
B.	Although Article 32 permits the Employer to subcontract overflow work, it is a violation for the Employer to regularly subcontract work of the kind, nature, or type currently or previously performed by the bargaining unit, rather than hiring additional employees over and above the existing complement to perform the regularly subcontracted work. Subject to employee availability (for example, inability to hire and/or absenteeism), work is subcontracted regularly in violation of Article 32 when there is a pattern of bargaining unit work being subcontracted on a daily or weekly basis. Nothing
- 119-
Article 32, Section 6
in this Memorandum of Understanding is intended to change the triggers for hiring in the applicable Supplemental Agreements.
C.	Recognizing that shippers may consign freight within their control to/from Mexico at any point in the United States, Article 32 prohibits the Employer from subcontracting work under its control to be performed in the United States of the kind, nature, or type currently or previously performed by the bargaining unit to employees employed by Mexican companies.
D.	It is a violation of Article 32 for the Employer to knowingly subcontract bargaining unit work to be performed by a subcontractor while any regular scheduled or regular unscheduled employees, including “shapes” or “10 percenters” are on lay off. Subterfuge by any party is a serious offense and violates Article 32. Examples of subterfuge may include:
a.	Tendering an amount of freight to a vendor on a given day that exceeds the capacity of that vendor; and
b.	Tendering freight to a subcontractor that knowingly will not be attempted for delivery on the day subcontracted.
Section 7.	National Subcontracting Review Committee
The parties shall establish a National Subcontracting Review Committee composed of two (2) Union representatives appointed by the Union Chairman of the National Grievance Committee and two (2) Employer representatives appointed by the Employer Chairman of the National Grievance Committee. The National Subcontracting Review Committee shall have the authority to review and adjudicate alleged violations of the work preservation, diversion of work and subcontracting provisions of Article 32, including practices by an Employer that are an alleged subterfuge to avoid the requirements of Article 32.
All other grievances arising under this Article shall be processed on an expedited basis pursuant to the procedures contained in Article 8, Section 1(a).

The amount of the cost-of-living allowance shall be determined as provided below on the basis of the “Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers”, CPI-W (Revised Series Using 1982-84 Expenditure Patterns). All Items published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor and referred to herein as the “Index”.
Effective April 1, 2009, and every April I thereafter during the life of the Agreement, a cost-of-living allowance will be calculated on the basis of the difference between the Index for January, 2008, (published February, 2008) and the index for January, 2009 (published February, 2009) with a similar calculation for every year thereafter, as follows:
For every 0.2 point increase in the Index over and above the base (prior year’s) Index plus 3.0%, there will be a 1 cent increase in the hourly wage rates payable on April 1,2009, and every April 1 thereafter. These increases shall only be payable if they equal a minimum of five cents ($.05) in a year.
All cost-of-living allowances paid under this Agreement will become and remain a fixed part of the base wage rate for all job classifications. A decline in the Index shall not result in the reduction of classification base wage rates.
- 122 -
Article 33, Section 4
Mileage paid employees will receive cost-of-living allowances on the basis of .25 mills per mile for each 1 cent increase in hourly wages.
In the event the appropriate Index figure is not issued before the effective date of the cost-of-living adjustment, the cost-of-living adjustment that is required will be made at the beginning of the first (1st) pay period after the receipt of the Index.
In the event that the Index shall be revised or discontinued and in the event the Bureau of labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, does not issue information which would enable the Employer and the Union to know what the Index would have been had it not been revised or discontinued, then the Employer and the Union will meet, negotiate, and agree upon an appropriate substitute for the Index. Upon the failure of the parties to agree within sixty (60) days, thereafter, the issue of an appropriate substitute shall be submitted to an arbitrator for determination. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding.
5.	Education and Training
The Employer will pay each regular employee that completes CDL training and certification after April I, 2008 the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00).
ARTICLE 34.	GARNISHMENTS
In the event of notice to an Employer of a garnishment or impending garnishment, the Employer may take disciplinary action if the employee fails to satisfy such garnishment within a seventy-two (72) - hour period (limited to working days) after notice to the employee. However, the Employer may not discharge any employee by reason of the fact that his earnings have been subject to garnishment for any one (1) indebtedness. If the Employer is notified of three (3) garnishments irrespective of whether satisfied by the employee within the seventy-two (72) - hour period, the employee may be subject to discipline, including discharge in extreme cases. However, if the Employer has an established practice of discipline or discharge with a fewer number of garnishments or impending garnishments, if the employee fails to adjust the matter within the seventy-two (72) - hour period, such past practice shall be applicable in those cases.

Article 35
ARTICLE 35.
Section 1.	Employee’s Bail
Employees will be bailed out of jail if accused of any offense in connection with the faithful discharge of their duties, and any employee forced to spend time in jail or in courts shall be compensated at his/her regular rate of pay. In addition, he/she shall be entitled to reimbursement for his/her meals, transportation, court costs, etc.; provided, however, that faithful discharge of duties shall in no case include compliance with any order involving commission of a felony. In case an employee shall be subpoenaed as a company witness, he/she shall be reimbursed for all time lost and expenses incurred.
Section 2.	Suspension or Revocation of License
In the event an employee receives a traffic citation for a moving violation which would contribute to a suspension or revocation or suffers a suspension or revocation of his/her right to drive the company’s equipment for any reason, he/she must promptly notify his/her Employer in writing. Failure to comply will subject the employee to disciplinary action up to and including discharge. If such suspension or revocation comes as a result of his/her complying with the Employer's instruction, which results in a succession of size and weight penalties or because he/she complied with his/her Employer’s instruction to drive company equipment which is in violation of DOT regulations relating to equipment or because the company equipment did not have either a speedometer or a tachometer in proper working order and if the employee has notified the Employer of the citation for such violation as above mentioned, the Employer shall provide employment to such employee at not less than his/her regular earnings at the time of such suspension for the entire period thereof.
When an employee in any job classification requiring driving has his/her operating privilege or license suspended or revoked for reasons other than those for which the employee can be discharged by the Employer, a leave of absence without loss of seniority, not to exceed three (3) years, shall be granted for such time as the employee’s operating license has been suspended or revoked. The employ

Article 35, Section 2
ee will be given work opportunities ahead of casuals to perform non-CDL required job functions.
Section 3.	Drug Testing
PREAMBLE
While abuse of alcohol and drugs among our members/employees is the exception rather than the rule, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee and the Employers signatory to this Agreement share the concern expressed by many over the growth of substance abuse in American society.
The parties have agreed that the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Program will be modified in the event that further federal legislation or Department of Transportation regulations provide for revised testing methodologies or requirements. The parties have incorporated the appropriate changes required by the applicable DOT drug testing rules under 49 CFR Parts 40 and 382, and agree that if new federally mandated changes are brought about, they too will become part of this Agreement. The drug testing procedure, agreed to by labor and management, incorporates state-of-the-art employee protections during specimen collection and laboratory testing to protect the innocent and ensures the Employer complies with all applicable DOT drug and alcohol testing regulations. In order to eliminate the safety risks which result from alcohol or drugs, the parties have agreed to the following procedures:
NMFA UNIFORM TESTING PROCEDURE
A.	Probable Suspicion Testing
In cases in which an employee is acting in an abnormal manner and at least one (I) supervisor, two (2) if available, have probable suspicion to believe that the employee is under the influence of controlled substances and/or alcohol, the Employer may require the employee (in the presence of a union shop steward, if possible) to undergo a urine specimen collection and a breath alcohol analysis as provided in Section 4B. The supervisor(s) must have received training in the signs of drug intoxication in a prescribed training
- 125 -
Article 35, Section 3
program which is endorsed by the Employer. Probable suspicion means suspicion based on specific personal observations that the Employer representative(s) can describe concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or breath odor of the employee. The observations may include the indication of chronic and withdrawal effects of controlled substances. The supervisor(s) must make a written statement of these observations within twenty-four (24) hours. A copy must be provided to the shop steward or other union official after the employee is discharged. Suspicion is not probable and thus not a basis for testing if it is based solely on third (3rd) party observation and reports. The employee shall not be required to waive any claim or cause of action under the law. For all purposes herein, the parties agree that the terms “probable suspicion” and “reasonable cause” shall be synonymous.
The following collection procedures shall apply to all types of testing:
A refusal to provide a urine specimen or undertake a breath analysis will constitute a presumption of intoxication and the employee will be subject to discharge without receipt of a prior warning letter. If the employee is unable to produce 45mL of urine, he/she shall be offered up to forty ounces of fluid to drink and shall remain at the collection site under observation until able to produce a 45mL specimen, for a period of up to three (3) hours from the first unsuccessful attempt to provide the urine specimen. If the employee is still unable to produce a 45mL specimen, the Employer shall direct the employee to undergo an evaluation which shall occur within five business days, by a licensed physician, acceptable to the MRO who has the expertise in the medical issues concerning the employee’s inability to provide an adequate amount of urine. If the physician and MRO conclude that there is no medical condition that would preclude the employee from providing an adequate amount of urine, the MRO will issue a ruling that the employee refused the test. If an employee is unable to provide sufficient breath sample for analysis, the procedures outlined in the DOT regulations shall be followed for all employees. Such employees shall be evaluated by a licensed physician, acceptable to the Employer, who has the expertise in the medical issues concerning the employee’s failure to provide an ade-
- 126-
Article 35, Section 3
quale amount of breath. Absent a-medical condition, as determined by the licensed physician, said employee will be regarded as having refused to take the test. The Employer will adhere to DOT regulations for employees who are unable to provide a urine or breath specimen due to a permanent or long-term medical condition. Contractual time limits for disciplinary action, as set forth in the appropriate Supplemental Agreement, shall begin on the day on which specimens are taken. In the event the Employer alleges only that the employee is intoxicated on alcohol and not drugs, previously agreed-to procedures under the appropriate Supplemental Agreement for determining alcohol intoxication shall apply.
In the event the Employer is unable to determine whether the abnormal behavior is due to drugs or alcohol, the drug testing procedure contained herein and the breath alcohol testing procedure contained in Section 4B shall be used. If the laboratory results are not known prior to the expiration of the contractual time period for disciplinary action, the cause for disciplinary action shall specify that the basis for such disciplinary action is for “alcohol and/or drug intoxication”.
B.	DOT Random Testing
It is agreed by the parties that random urine drug testing will be implemented only in accordance with the DOT rules under 49 CFR Part 382, Subpart C.
The method of selection for random urine drug testing will be neutral so that all employees subject to testing will have an equal chance to be randomly selected.
The term “employees subject to testing” under this agreement is meant to include any employee required to have a Commercial Drivers License (CDL) under the Department of Transportation regulations.
Employees out on long term injury or disability for any reason shall not be tested.
The provisions of Article 35, Section 3 F 3 (Split Sample Procedures), and Article 35, Section 3 J I (One-Time Rehabilitation), shall apply to random urine drug testing.
- 127 -
Article 35, Section 3
C.	Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Testing
Non-suspicion-based post-accident testing is defined as urine drug testing as a result of an accident which meets the definition of an accident as outlined in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. Urine drug testing will be required after accidents meeting the following conditions and drivers are required to remain readily available for testing for thirty-two (32) hours following the accident or until tested.
Employees subject to non-suspicion-based post-accident drug testing shall be limited to those employees subject to DOT drug testing, who are involved in an accident where there is:
(i)	a fatality, or;
(ii	) a citation under State or local law is issued to the driver for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident in which:
(a)	bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident, or
(b)	one or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requires the vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.
The driver has the responsibility to make himself/herself available for urine drug testing within the thirty-two (32) hour period in accordance with the procedures outlined in this Subsection. The driver is responsible to notify the Employer upon receipt of a citation and to note receipt thereof on the accident report. Failure to so notify the Employer shall subject the driver to disciplinary action.
If a driver receives a citation for a moving violation more than thirty- two (32) hours after a reportable accident, he/she shall not be required to submit to post-accident urine drug testing.
The Employer shall make available a urine drug testing kit and an appropriate collection site for the driver to provide specimens.
- 128 -
Article 35, Section 3
The provisions of Article 35, Section 3 F 3 (Split Sample Procedures), and Article 35, Section 3 J 1 (One-Time Rehabilitation), shall apply to non-suspicion-based post-accident urine drug testing.
D.	Chain of Custody Procedures
Any specimens collected for drug testing shall follow the DHHS/DOT (Department of Health and Human Services/ Department of Transportation) specimen collection procedures. At the time specimens are collected for any drug testing, the employee shall be given a copy of the specimen collection procedures. In the presence of the employee, the specimens are to be sealed and labeled. As per DOT regulations, it is the employee’s responsibility to initial the seals on the specimen bottles, additionally ensuring that the specimens tested by the laboratory are those of the employee.
The required procedure follows:
When urine specimens are to be provided, at least 45 mL of specimen shall be collected. At least 30 mL shall be placed in one (1) self-sealing, screw-capped or snap-capped container. A urine specimen of at least 15mL shall be placed in a second (2nd) such container. They shall be sealed and labeled by the collector, and initialed by the employee without the containers leaving the employee’s presence. The employee has the responsibility to identify each container and initial same. Following collection, the specimens shall be placed in the transportation container together with the appropriate copies of the chain of custody form. The transportation container shall then be sealed in the employee’s presence. The container shall be sent to the designated testing laboratory at the earliest possible time by the fastest available means.
In this urine collection procedure, the donor shall urinate into a collection container capable of holding at least 55 mL, which shall remain in full view of the employee until transferred to tamper resistant urine bottles, and sealed and labeled, and the employee has initialed the bottles.
- 129-
Article 35, Section 3
It is recognized that the Specimen Collector is required to check for sufficiency of specimen, acceptable temperature range, and signs of tampering, provided that the employee’s right to privacy is guaranteed and in no circumstances may observation take place while the employee is producing the urine specimens, unless required by DOT regulations. If it is established that the employee’s specimen is outside of the acceptable temperature range or has been intentionally tampered with or substituted by the employee, the employee will be required to immediately submit an additional specimen under direct observation. Also, if it is established that the employee’s specimen has been intentionally tampered with or substituted by the employee, the employee is subject to discipline as if the specimen tested positive. In order to deter adulteration of the urine specimen during the collection process, physiologic determinations for creatinine, specific gravity, pH, and any substances that may be used to adulterate the specimen shall be performed by the laboratory. If the laboratory suspects the presence of an interfering substance/ adulterant that could make a test result invalid, but the initial laboratory is unable to identify it, the specimen must be sent to another HHS certified laboratory that has the capability of doing so.
Any findings by the laboratory that indicate that a specimen is adulterated as a result of the fact that it contains a substance that is not expected to be present in human urine; a substance that is expected to be present is identified at a concentration so high that it is not consistent with human urine; or has physical characteristics which are outside the normal expected range for human urine shall be immediately reported to the Company’s Medical Review Officer (MRO). The parties recognize that the key to chain of custody integrity is the immediate sealing and labeling of the specimen bottles in the presence of the tested employee. If each container is received undamaged at the laboratory properly sealed, labeled and initialed, consistent with DOT regulations as certified by the laboratory, the Employer may take disciplinary action based upon the MRO's ruling.
E.	Urine Collection Kits and Forms
The contents of the urine collection kit shall be as follows:
- 130-
Article 35, Section 3
1.	The kit shall include a specimen collection container capable of holding at least fifty-five (55) mL of urine and contains a temperature reading device capable of registering the urine temperature specified in the DOT regulations.
2.	Two (2) plastic bottles that are capable of holding at least thirty-five (35) mL, have screw-on or snap-on caps, and markings clearly indicating the appropriate levels for the primary (30 mL) and split (15 mL) specimens.
3.	A uniquely numbered (i.e. Specimen Identification Number) DOT approved chain of custody form with similarly numbered Bottle Custody Seals, and a transportation kit seal (e.g., Box Seal) shall be utilized during the urine collection process and completed by the collection site person. In the case of probable suspicion or other contractually required testing, a Non-DOT chain of custody form will be used for the testing of Non-DOT employees. The appropriate laboratory copies are to be placed into the transportation container with the urine specimens. The exterior of the transportation kit shall then be secured, e.g., by placing the tamper-proof Box Seal over the outlined area.
4.	Shrink-wrapped or similarly protected kits shall be used in all instances.
F.	Laboratory Requirements
1.	Urine Testing
In testing urine samples, the testing laboratory shall test specifically for those drugs and classes of drugs and adulterants employing the test methodologies and cutoff levels covered in the DOT Regulations 49 CFR, Part 40.
2.	Specimen Retention
All specimens deemed positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid by the laboratory, according to the prescribed guidelines, must be retained at the laboratory for a period of one (1) year.
- 131 -
Article 35, Section 3
3.	Split Sample Procedure
The split sample procedure is required for all employees selected for urine drug testing. When any test kit is received by the laboratory, the “primary” sealed urine specimen bottle shall be immediately removed for testing, and the remaining “split” sealed specimen bottle shall be placed in secured storage. Such specimen shall be placed in refrigerated storage if it is to be tested outside of the DOT mandated period of time.
The employee will be given a shrink-wrapped or similarly protected urine collection kit. After receiving the specimen, the collector shall pour at least 30 mL of urine into the specimen bottle and at least 15 mL into the second split specimen botde. Both bottles shall be sealed in the employee’s presence, initialed by the employee, then forwarded to an accredited laboratory for testing. If the employee is advised by the MRO that the first (1st) urine sample tested positive, adulterated, or substituted, in a random, return to duty, follow-up, probable suspicion or post accident urine drug test, the employee may, within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt of the actual notice, request from the MRO that the second (2nd) urine specimen be forwarded by the first laboratory to another independent and unrelated accredited laboratory of the parties’ choice for GC/MS confirmatory testing for the presence of the drug, or other confirmatory testing for adulterants, or to confirm that the specimen has been substituted as defined in 49 CFR Part 40. If the employee chooses to have the second (2nd) sample analyzed, he/she shall at that time execute a special check-off authorization form to ensure payment by the employee. Split specimen testing will conform to the regulations as defined in 49 CFR Part 40. If the employee chooses the optional split sample procedure, and so notifies his Employer, disciplinary action can only take place after the MRO reports a positive, adulterated, or substituted result on the primary test and the MRO reports that the testing of the split specimen confirmed the result. However, the employee may be taken out of service once the MRO reports a positive, adulterated, or substituted result based on the testing of the primary specimen while the testing of the split specimen is being performed. If the second (2nd) test confirms the findings of the first laboratory and the employee wishes to use the rehabilitation options of this Section, the employee shall reimburse the Employer for the cost of the second (2nd) sample’s analysis before entering the reha-
- 132-
Article 35, Section 3
bilitation program, if the second (2nd) laboratory report is negative, for drugs, adulterants, or substitution, the employee will be reimbursed for the cost of the second (2nd) test and for all lost time. It is also understood that if an employee opts for the split sample procedure, contractual time limits on disciplinary action in the Supplements are waived.
4.	Laboratory Accreditation
All laboratories used to perform urine drug testing pursuant to this Agreement must be certified by Health and Human Services under the National Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP).
G.	Laboratory Testing Methodology
1.	Urine Testing
The initial testing shall be by immunoassay which meets the requirements of the Food and Drug Administration for commercial distribution. The initial cutoff levels used when screening urine specimens to determine whether they are negative or positive for various classes of drugs shall be those contained in the Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs (subject to revision in accordance with subsequent amendments to the HHS Guidelines).
All specimens identified as positive on the initial test shall be confirmed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. Quantitative GC/MS confirmatory procedures for drugs and confirmatory procedures for specimens that are initially identified as being adulterated or substituted shall comply with the testing protocols mandated by the Scientific and Technical Guidelines for Federal Drug Testing Programs (subject to revision in accordance with subsequent amendments to the HHS Guidelines).
Validity testing shall be conducted on all specimens, pursuant to HHS requirements, to determine whether they have been adulterated or substituted. All specimens which test negative on either the initial test or the GC/MS confirmation test shall be reported only as negative, unless they are confirmed to be adulterated, substituted, or
- 133-
Article 35, Section 3
invalid. Only specimens which test positive on both the initial test and the GC/MS confirmation test shall be reported as positive. Specimens that are confirmed to be adulterated or substituted shall be reported as such.
When a grievance is filed as a result of a drug test that is ruled positive, adulterated, or substituted, the Employer shall provide a copy of the MRO ruling to the Union.
Where Schedule I and II drugs are detected, the laboratory is to report a positive test based on a forensically acceptable positive quantum of proof. All positive test results must be reviewed by the certifying scientist and certified as accurate.
2.	Prescription and Non-prescription Medications
If an employee is taking a prescription or non-prescription medication in the appropriate described manner he/she will not be disciplined. Medications prescribed for another individual, not the employee, shall be considered to be illegally used and subject the employee to discipline.
3.	Medical Review Officer (MRO)
The Medical Review Officer (MRO) shall be a licensed physician with the knowledge of substance abuse disorders, issues relating to adulterated and substituted specimens, possible medical causes of specimens having an invalid result, and applicable DOT agency regulations. In addition, the MRO shall keep current on applicable DOT agency regulations and comply with the DOT qualification training and continuing education requirements. The MRO shall review all urine drug test results from the laboratory and shall examine alternate medical explanations for tests reported as positive, adulterated, or substituted, as well as those results reported as invalid. Prior to the final decision to verify a urine drug test result, all employees shall have the opportunity to discuss the results with the MRO. If the employee declines to speak with the MRO, or the employee fails to contact the MRO within 72 hours of being notified to do so by the Employer, or if the MRO is unable to contact
- 134-
Article 35, Section 3
the employee within ten (10) days of the receipt of the drug test result being reported to him by the laboratory, then the MRO may report the result to the Employer.
4.	Substance Abuse Professional (SAP)
The Substance Abuse Professional (SAP), as provided in the regulations, means a licensed physician (Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathy), or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or employee assistance professional, or a drug and alcohol counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission or by the International Certification Reciprocity Consortium/Alcohol & Other Drug Abuse). All must have knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol and controlled substance-related disorders and be knowledgeable of the SAP function as it relates to Employer interest in safety-sensitive functions, and applicable DOT agency regulations. In addition, the SAP shall comply with the DOT qualification training and continuing education requirements.
H.	Leave of Absence Prior to Testing
1.	An employee shall be permitted to take leave of absence in accordance with the FMLA or applicable State leave laws for the purpose of undergoing treatment pursuant to an approved program of alcoholism or drug use. The leave of absence must be requested prior to the commission of any act subject to disciplinary action.
2.	Employees requesting to return to work from a voluntary leave of absence for drug use or alcoholism shall be required to submit to testing as provided for in Part J of this Section. Failure to do so will subject the employee to discipline including discharge without the receipt of a prior warning letter.
The provisions of this Section shall not apply to probationary employees.
I. Disciplinary Action Based on Positive Adulterated, or Substituted Test Results
Consistent with past practice under this Agreement, and notwith-
- 135 -
Article 35, Section 3
standing any other language in any Supplement, the Employer may take disciplinary action based on the test results as follows:
1.	If the MRO reports that a urine drug test is positive, adulterated, or substituted, the employee shall be subject to discharge except as provided in Part J.
2.	The following actions shall apply in probable suspicion testing based on DOT and contractual mandates.
a.	If the urine drug test is positive, adulterated, or substituted, according to the procedures described in Part G, the employee shall be subject to discharge.
b.	If the breath alcohol test results show a blood alcohol concentration equal to or above the level previously determined by the appropriate Supplemental Agreement for alcohol intoxication, the employee shall be subject to discharge pursuant to the Supplemental Agreement.
c.	If the breath alcohol test is negative and the urine drug test is negative, the employee shall be immediately returned to work and made whole for all lost earnings.
J. Return to Employment After a Positive Urine Drug Test
1.	Any employee with a positive, adulterated, or substituted urine drug test result (other than under probable suspicion testing), thereby subjecting the employee to discipline, shall be granted reinstatement on a one (I) - time lifetime basis if the employee successfully completes a course of education and/or treatment program as recommended by the Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). The SAP will recommend a course of education and/or treatment with which the employee must demonstrate successful compliance prior to returning to DOT safety-sensitive duty. The SAP will refer him/her to a treatment program which has been approved by the applicable Health and Welfare Fund, where such is the practice. Any cost of evaluation, education and/or treatment over and above that paid for by the applicable Health and Welfare Fund, must be borne by the employee.
- 136-
Article 35, Section 3
2.	Employees electing the one-time lifetime evaluation and/or rehabilitation must notify the Company within ten (10) days of being notified by the Company of a positive, adulterated, or substituted urine drug test. The evaluation process and education and/or treatment program must take a minimum of ten (10) days. The employee must begin the evaluation process and education and/or treatment program within fifteen (15) days after notifying the Company. The employee must request reinstatement promptly after successful completion of the education and/or treatment program. After the minimum ten (10) day period and re-evaluation by the SAP, the employee may request reinstatement, but must first provide a negative return to duty urine drug test, to be conducted by a clinic and laboratory of the Employer's choice, before the employee can be reinstated. Any employee choosing to protest the discharge must file a protest under the applicable Supplement. After the discharge is sustained, the employee must notify the Company within ten (10) days of the date of the decision, of the desire to enter the evaluation process and education and/or treatment program.
3.	While undergoing treatment, the employee shall not receive any of the benefits provided by this Agreement or Supplements thereto except the continued accrual of seniority.
4.	Before reinstatement after the minimum ten (10) day period, the employee must be re-evaluated by the Substance Abuse Professional to determine successful compliance with any recommended education and/or treatment program. The employee must then submit to the Employer’s retum-to-duty urine drug test (and alcohol test if so prescribed by the SAP) with a negative result. The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced follow-up urine drug tests in the first year, as determined by the SAP. If, at any time, the employee tests positive, provides an adulterated or substituted specimen, or refuses to submit to a test, the employee shall be subject to discharge.
(a)	Retum-to-duty drug test is a urine drug test which an employee must complete with a negative result, after having been reevaluated by a SAP to determine successful compliance with recommended education and/or treatment.
- 137-
Article 35, Section 3
(b)	Follow-up drug testing shall mean those unannounced urine drug tests required (minimum of six (6) in a twelve (12) month period) when an employee tests positive, provides an adulterated or substituted specimen, or refused to be tested and has been evaluated by the SAP, completed education and/or treatment, been re-evaluated by SAP and returned to work. The requirements of follow-up testing follow the employee through breaks in service (i.e. layoff, on-the-job injury, personal illness/injury, leave of absence, etc ). In addition, the requirements of follow-up testing follow the employee to subsequent employers. The SAP has the authority to order any number of follow-up urine drug and/or alcohol tests and to extend the twelve (12) month period up to sixty (60) months.
K.	Special Grievance Procedure
1.	The parties shall together create a Special Region Joint Area Committee consisting of an equal number of employer and union representatives to hear drug-related discipline disputes. All such disputes arising after the establishment of the Special Region Joint Area Committee shall be taken up between the Employer and Local Union involved. Failing adjustment by these parties, the dispute shall be heard by the Special Region Joint Area Committee within ninety (90) days of the Committee’s receipt of the dispute. Where the Special Region Joint Area Committee, by majority vote, settles a dispute, such decision shall be final and binding on both parties with no further appeal. Where the Special Region Joint Area Committee is unable to agree on or come to a decision on a dispute, the dispute will be referred to the National Grievance Committee.
2.	The procedures set forth herein may be invoked only by the authorized Union Representative or the Employer.
L.	Paid-for Time
1.	Training
Employees undergoing substance abuse training as required by the DOT will be paid for such time and the training will be scheduled in connection with the employee’s normal work shift, where possible.
2.	Testing
- 138-
Article 35, Section 3
Employees subject to testing and selected by the random selection process for urine drug testing shall be compensated at the regular straight time hourly rate of pay in the following manner provided that the test is negative:
a.	Random Drug Tests
(1)	for all time at the collection site.
(2)	(a) for travel time one way if the collection site is reasonably en route between the employee’s home and the terminal, and the employee is going to or from work; or
(b) for travel time both ways between the terminal and the collection site, only if the collection site is not reasonably en route between the employee’s home and the terminal.
(3)	When an employee is on the clock and a random drug test is taken any time during the employee’s shift, and the shift ends after eight (8) hours, the employee is paid time and one-half for all time past the eight (8) hours.
(4)	The Employer will not require the city employee to go for urine drug testing before the city employee’s shift, provided the collection site is open during or immediately following the employee’s shift.
(5)	During an employee’s shift, an employee will not be required to use his/her personal vehicle from the terminal to and from the collection site to take a random drug test.
(6)	If a road driver is called at home to take a random drug test at a time when the road driver is not en route to or from work, the driver shall be paid, in addition to all time at the collection site, travel time both ways between the driver’s home and the collection site with no minimum guarantee.
b.	Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Testing
(1)	In the event of a non-suspicion-based post-accident testing situ
- 139-
Article 35, Section 3
ation, where the employee has advised the Employer of the issuance of a citation for a moving violation, but the Employer does not direct the employee to be tested immediately, but sends the employee for testing at some later time [during the thirty-two (32) hour period], the employee shall be paid for all time involved in testing, from the time the employee leaves home until the employee returns home after the test.
(2)	When the Employer takes a road driver out of service and directs the employee to be tested immediately, the Employer will make arrangements for the road driver to return to his/her home terminal in accordance with the Supplemental Agreement.
Section 4. Alcohol Testing
The parties agree that in the event of further federal legislation or DOT regulations providing for revised methodologies or requirements, those revisions shall, to the extent they impact this Agreement, unless mandated, be subject to mutual agreement by the parties.
A.	Employees Who Must be Tested
There shall be random, non-suspicion-based post-accident and probable suspicion alcohol testing of all employees subject to DOT mandated alcohol testing. This includes all employees who, as a condition of their employment, are required to have a DOT physical, a CDL and are subject to testing for drugs under Article 35, Section 3 B.
Employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement who are not subject to DOT-mandated alcohol testing are only subject to probable suspicion testing as provided in Article 35, Section 3 of the NMFA or the appropriate article of the applicable Supplemental Agreement. The alcohol breath testing methodology outlined in this Section will be utilized for all employees required to undergo probable suspicion testing. (For test results and discipline, refer to NMFA, Article 35, Section 3 I 2.)
B.	Alcohol Testing Procedure
All alcohol testing under this Section will be conducted in accor
- 140-
Article 35, Section 4
dance with applicable DOT/FMCSA regulations. All equipment used for alcohol testing must be on the NHTSA Conforming Products List and be used and maintained in compliance with DOT requirements. Breath samples will be collected by a Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) who has successfully completed the necessary training course that is the equivalent of the DOT model course and who is knowledgeable of the alcohol testing procedures set forth in 49 CFR Part 40 and any current DOT Guidance. Law enforcement officers who have been certified by state or local governments to conduct breath alcohol testing are deemed to be qualified as Breath Alcohol Technicians. The training shall be specific to the type of Evidential Breath Testing (EBT) device being used for testing. The Employer shall provide the employees with material containing the information required by Section 382.601 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations.
1.	Screening Test
The initial screening test uses an Evidential Breath Testing (EBT) device, unless other testing methodologies or devices are mandated or agreed upon, to determine levels of alcohol. The following initial cutoff levels shall be used when screening breath samples to determine whether they are negative or positive for alcohol.
Breath Alcohol Levels:
Less than 0.02% BAC - Negative
0.02% BAC and above - Positive (Requires Confirmation Test)
2.	Confirmatory Test
All samples identified as positive on the initial screening test, indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02% BAC or higher, shall be confirmed using an EBT device that is capable of providing a printed result in triplicate; is capable of assigning a unique number to each test; and is capable of printing out, on each copy of the printed test result, the manufacturer's name for the device, the device’s serial number and the time of the test unless other testing methodologies or devices are mandated or mutually agreed upon.
- 141 -
Article 35, Section 4
A confirmation test must be performed a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes after the screening test, but not more than thirty (30) minutes, unless otherwise provided by conditions set forth and defined in 49 CFR Part 40.
The following cutoff levels shall be used to confirm a positive test for alcohol:
Breath Alcohol Levels:
Less than 0.02% BAC - Negative
0.02% BAC to 0.039% BAC - Positive*
0.04% BAC and above - Positive*
*Refer to Section 4 L for Discipline Based on a Positive Test
C.	Notification
All employees subject to DOT-mandated random alcohol testing will be notified of testing by the Employer, in person or by direct phone contact.
D.	Pre-Qualification Testing for Non-DOT Personnel
Section has been deleted
E.	Random Testing
The method used to randomly select employees for alcohol testing shall be neutral, scientifically valid and in compliance with DOT regulations.
The annual random testing rate for alcohol use shall be the rate established by the Administrator of the FMCSA.
In the event of a grievance or litigation, the Employer shall, upon written request from the employee, release to the employee and the Union (in its capacity as representative of the grievant and as a decision maker in the grievance process), information required to be maintained under the DOT alcohol testing regulations and arising
- 142 -
Article 35, Section 4
from the results of an alcohol test which is subject to release under the regulations.
The parties agree that no effort will be made to cause the system and method of selection to be anything but a true random selection procedure ensuring that all affected employees are treated fairly and equally.
Employees subject to random alcohol testing shall be tested within one (1) hour prior to starting the tour of duty, during the tour of duty, or immediately after completing the tour of duty.
Employees who are on long-term illness or injury leave of absence, disability or vacation shall not be subject to testing during the period of time they are away from work.
F.	Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Testing
Employees subject to non-suspicion-based post-accident alcohol testing shall be limited to those employees subject to DOT alcohol testing, who are involved in an accident where there is:
(i)	a fatality, or;
(ii)	a citation under State or local law is issued to the driver for a moving traffic violation arising from the accident in which:
(a)	bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the accident, or
(b)	one or more motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident, requires the vehicle(s) to be transported away from the scene by a tow truck or other vehicle.
Alcohol testing will be required under the above conditions and employees are required to submit to such testing as soon as practicable. Under no circumstances shall this type of testing be conducted after eight (8) hours from the time of the accident.
It shall be the responsibility of the driver to remain readily available
- 143 -
Article 35, Section 4
for testing after the occurrence of a commercial motor vehicle accident. It is also the responsibility of the employee to not use alcohol for eight (8) hours or until a DOT post-accident alcohol test is performed, whichever occurs first. It is not the intention of this language to require the delay of necessary medical attention or to prohibit the driver from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or necessary medical attention.
Prior to the effective date of the DOT alcohol testing regulations, the Employer agrees to give each employee subject to DOT nonsuspicion based post-accident testing written notification of the procedures required by the DOT regulations in the event of an accident as defined by the DOT.
G.	Substance Abuse Professional (SAP)
I.	The Substance Abuse Professional (SAP), as provided in the regulations, means a licensed physician (Medical Doctor or Doctor of Osteopathy), or a licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or employee assistance professional, or a drug and alcohol counselor (certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors Certification Commission or by the International Certification Reciprocity Consortium/Alcohol & Other Drug Abuse). All must have knowledge of and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol and controlled substance-related disorders, be knowledgeable of the SAP function as it relates to Employer interest in safety-sensitive functions, and applicable DOT agency regulations. In addition, the SAP shall comply with the DOT qualification training and continuing education requirements.
2.	The Employer will provide the employee with a list of resources available to the driver in evaluating and resolving problems with the misuse of alcohol as soon as practicable but no later than thirty-six (36) hours after the Employer’s receipt of notice from the BAT that the employee has a BAC of 0.04% or higher, exclusive of holidays and weekends. The SAP will be responsible for recommending the appropriate course of education and/or treatment required prior to the employee returning to work and is the only person responsible for determining, during the evaluation process, whether an employ
- 144-
Article 35, Section 4
ee will be directed to a rehabilitation program, and if so, for how long.
3.	Follow-up and retum-to-duty tests need not be confined to the substance involved in the violation. If the SAP determines that a driver needs assistance with an alcohol and drug abuse problem, the SAP may require drug tests to be performed along with any required alcohol follow-up and/or retum-to-duty tests, if it has been determined that a driver has violated the drug testing prohibition.
4.	Any cost of evaluation by the SAP and/or rehabilitation recommended by the SAP associated with the abuse of alcohol while performing or available to perform safety-sensitive functions under this Agreement, over and above that paid for by the applicable Health and Welfare Fund, must be borne by the employee. The Employer will pay for random, non-suspicion-based post-accident and probable suspicion alcohol testing. Retum-to-duty and follow-up alcohol testing that is prescribed by the SAP, will be paid for by the Employer, provided the employee tests negative.
H.	Probable Suspicion Testing
Employees subject to DOT probable suspicion alcohol testing under this Section shall be tested in accordance with current, applicable DOT regulations.
For all purposes herein, the parties agree that the terms “probable suspicion” and “reasonable cause" shall be synonymous.
Probable suspicion is defined as an employee’s specific observable appearance, behavior, speech or body odor that clearly indicates the need for probable suspicion alcohol testing.
In the event the Employer is unable to determine whether the abnormal behavior or appearance is due to alcohol or drugs, the Employer shall specify that the basis for any disciplinary action or testing is for alcohol and/or drug intoxication. In such cases, the employee shall be tested in accordance with Article 35, Section 3 A, and applicable DOT alcohol testing regulations.
- 145 -
Article 35, Section 4
In cases where an employee has specific, observable, abnormal indicators regarding appearance, behavior, speech or body odor, and at least one (1) supervisor, two (2) if available, have probable suspicion to believe that the employee is under the influence of alcohol, the Employer may require the employee, in the presence of a union shop steward or other employee requested by the employee under observation, to submit to a breath alcohol test. Suspicion is not probable and thus not a basis for testing if it is based solely on third party observation and reports.
The supervisor(s) must make a written statement of these observations within twenty-four (24) hours. Upon request, a copy must be provided to the shop steward or other union official after the employee is discharged or suspended or taken out of service.
All supervisors and Employer representatives designated to determine whether probable suspicion exists to require an employee to undergo alcohol testing shall receive specific training on the physical, behavioral, speech and performance indicators of how to detect probable suspicion alcohol misuse and use of controlled substances as required by DOT regulations.
In the event the Employer requires a probable suspicion test, the Employer shall provide transportation to and from the testing location.
I.	Preparation for Testing
All alcohol testing shall be conducted in conformity with the DOT alcohol regulations. Any alleged abuse by the Employer, such as proven harassment of any employee or deliberate violation of the regulations or the contract shall be subject to the grievance procedure to provide a reasonable remedy for the alleged violation.
Upon arrival at the testing site, an employee must provide the Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) with proper identification. The employee shall not be required to waive any claim or cause of action under the law.
A standard DOT approved alcohol testing form will be used by all testing facilities. In the case of probable suspicion or other contrac
- 146-
Article 35, Section 4
tually required testing, a Non-DOT chain of custody form will be used for the testing of Non-DOT employees.
J.	Specimen Testing Procedures
All procedures for alcohol testing will comply with Department of Transportation regulations.
No unauthorized personnel will be allowed in any area of the testing site. Only one alcohol testing procedure will be conducted by a BAT at the same time.
The employee will provide his or her breath sample in a location that allows for privacy. The Employer agrees to recognize all employees’ rights to privacy while being subjected to the testing process at all times and at all testing sites. Further, the Employer agrees that in all circumstances the employee’s dignity will be considered and all necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the entire process does nothing to demean, embarrass or offend the employee unnecessarily. Testing will be under the direct observation of a Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT). All procedures shall be conducted in a professional, discreet and objective manner. Direct observation will be necessary in all cases.
The employee shall provide an adequate amount of breath for the Evidential Breath Testing device. If the individual is unable to provide a sufficient amount of breath, the BAT shall direct the individual to again attempt to provide a complete sample.
If an employee is unsuccessful in providing the requisite amount of breath, the Employer then must have the employee obtain, within five (5) days, an evaluation from a licensed physician selected by the Employer and the Local Union and who has the expertise in the medical issues concerning the employee’s inability to provide an adequate amount of breath. If the physician is unable to determine that a medical condition has, or with a high degree of probability could have, precluded the employee from providing an adequate amount of breath, the employee’s failure to provide an adequate amount of breath will be regarded as a refusal to take the test and subject the employee to discharge.
- 147 -
Article 35, Section 4
K.	Leave of Absence Prior to Testing
An employee shall be permitted to take leave of absence in accordance with the FMLA or applicable State leave laws for the purpose of undergoing treatment pursuant to an approved program of alcoholism or drug use. The leave of absence must be requested prior to the commission of any act subject to disciplinary action. This provision does not alter or amend the disciplinary provision (Article 35, Section 4 L) of this Section.
Before returning to work from a voluntary leave of absence, the employee must have completed any recommended treatment and taken a return to duty test, with a result of less than 0.02% BAC, and further be subject to six (6) unannounced follow-up alcohol tests in the first twelve (12) months following the employee’s return to duty.
The Supplemental Agreements shall address the issue of an extra board driver who, while at his home terminal, has consumed alcohol, is then called for dispatch and requests additional time off. Requesting time off under this provision shall not be used as a subterfuge to avoid taking a random alcohol (and/or drug) test.
L.	Disciplinary Action Based on Positive Test Results

Second Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Positive Test - 0.02% BAC and higher - Subject to discharge.
6.	An employee’s refusal to submit to any alcohol test will subject the employee to discharge.
M.	Return to Duty After a Positive (Greater than .04 to the State Limit) Alcohol Test
Before returning to work the employee must be evaluated by a SAP, comply with any education and/or treatment recommended by the SAP, be re-evaluated by the SAP to determine compliance with recommended education and/or treatment, and take a retum-to-duty alcohol test, showing a result of less than 0.02% BAC. The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced follow-up alcohol and/or drug tests as determined by the SAP. The requirements of follow- up testing follow the employee through breaks in service (i.e. layoff, on-the-job injury, personal illness/injury, leave of absence, etc.). In addition, the requirements of follow-up testing follow the employee to subsequent employers. The SAP has the authority to order any number of follow-up alcohol and/or urine drug tests and to extend the twelve (12) month period up to sixty (60) months.
N.	Paid-for-time -Testing
Employees subject to testing and selected by the random selection process for alcohol testing shall be compensated at the regular
- 150-
Article 35, Section 4
straight time hourly rate of pay provided that the test is negative:
1.	Random Alcohol Tests
a.	Paid for all time at the collection site.
b.	(1) for travel time one way if the collection site is reasonably en route between the employee’s home and the terminal, and the employee is going to or from work; or
(2)	for travel time both ways between the terminal and the collection site, only if the collection site is not reasonably en route between the employee’s home and the terminal.
c.	When an employee is on the clock and a random alcohol test is taken any time during the employee’s shift, and the shift ends after eight (8) hours, the employee is paid time and one-half for all time past the eight (8) hours.
d.	The Employer will not require the city employee to go for alcohol testing before the city employee’s shift, provided the collection site is open during or immediately following the employee’s shift.
e.	During an employee’s shift, an employee will not be required to use his/her personal vehicle from the terminal to and from the collection site to take a random alcohol test.
f.	If a road driver is called to take a random alcohol test at a time when the road driver is not en route to or from work, the driver shall be paid, in addition to all time at the collection site, travel time both ways between the location of the driver when called and the collection site with no minimum guarantee.
2.	Non-Suspicion-Based Post-Accident Testing
a.	In the event of a non-suspicion-based post-accident testing situation, where the employee has advised the Employer of the issuance of a citation for a moving violation, but the Employer does not direct the employee to be tested immediately, but sends the employee for testing at some later time (during the eight (8) hour period),
- 151 -
Article 35, Section 4
the employee shall be paid for all time involved in testing, from the time the employee leaves home until the employee returns home after the test.
b.	When the Employer takes a driver out of service and directs the employee to be tested immediately, the Employer will make arrangements for the driver to return to his/her home terminal in accordance with the Supplemental Agreement.
O.	Record Retention
The Employer shall maintain records in a secure manner so that disclosure of information to unauthorized persons does not occur.
Each Employer or its agent is required to maintain the following records for two years:
1.	Records of the inspection and maintenance of each EBT used in employee testing;
2.	Documentation of the Employer’s compliance with the Quality Assurance Program for each EBT it uses for alcohol testing; and
3.	Records of the training and proficiency testing of each BAT used in employee testing.
The Employer must maintain for five years records pertaining to the calibration of each EBT used in alcohol testing, including records of the results of external calibration checks.
P.	Special Grievance Procedure
1.	The parties shall together create a Special Region Joint Area Committee consisting of an equal number of Employer and Union representatives to hear drug and alcohol related discipline disputes. All such disputes arising after the establishment of the Special Region Joint Area Committee shall be taken up between the Employer and Local Union involved. Failing adjustment by these parties, the dispute shall be heard by the Special Region Joint Area
- 152-
Article 35, Section 4
Committee within ninety (90) days of the Committee’s receipt of the dispute. When the Special Region Joint Area Committee, by majority vote, settles a dispute, such decision shall be final and binding on both parties with no further appeal. Where the Special Region Joint Area Committee is unable to agree or come to a decision on a dispute, the dispute will be referred to the National Grievance Committee.
2.	The Procedures set forth herein may be invoked only by the authorized Union representative or the Employer.

This Article also covers employees with a qualified disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act, although whether the Employer has complied with the ADA’s statutory requirements shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
- 154-
Article 38
ARTICLE 38.
Section 1.	Sick Leave
Effective April 1, 1980 and thereafter, all Supplemental Agreements shall provide for five (5) days of sick leave per contract year.
Sick leave not used by March 31 of any contract year will be paid on March 31st at the applicable hourly rate in existence on that date. Each day of sick leave will be paid for on the basis of eight (8) hours’ straight-time pay at the applicable hourly rate.
Effective April 1, 2008, sick leave will be paid to eligible employees beginning on the first (1st) working day of absence.
Effective January 1, 2009, the accrual and cash out dates for sick leave will move from April 1 to January 1. As an example, employees will be entitled to cash out accrued unused sick leave on April 1, 2008, and will accrue an additional 5 days sick leave between April 1, 2008, and December 31,2008, and will be entitled to cash out any unused sick leave on January 1, 2009. In addition, no employee will lose their entitlement to the cash out of unused sick leave on January 1, 2009, because they were not able to satisfy the present eligibility provision of having received 90 days of compensation during the shorten qualifying period of April 1,2008, through December 31, 2008.
The additional sick leave days referred to above shall also be included in those Supplements containing sick leave provisions prior to April I, 1976. The National Negotiating Committees may develop rules and regulations to apply to sick leave provisions negotiated in the 1976 Agreement and amended in this Agreement uniformly to the Supplements. The Committee shall not establish rules and regulations for sick leave programs in existence on March 31, 1976.
Section 2.	Jury Duty
Effective April 1, 2003, all regular employees called for jury duty will receive the difference between eight (8) hours pay at the applicable hourly wage and actual payment received for jury service for
- 155 -
Article 38, Section 2
each day of jury duty to a maximum of fifteen (15) days pay for each contract year.
When such employees report for jury service on a scheduled workday, they will not unreasonably be required to report for work that particular day.
Time spent on jury service will be considered time worked for purposes of Employer contributions to health & welfare and pension plans, vacation eligibility and payment, holidays and seniority, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Supplemental Agreements to a maximum of fifteen (15) days for each contract year.
Employees, who have been selected to serve on a jury, including those selected as an alternate jury member and who are scheduled to work shifts beginning after 4:00 p.m., will be given the option of working either the day their jury duty begins or the day following the day their jury duty begins and thereafter shall not be required to work on any day in which the jury is in session.
Section 3.	Family and Medical Leave Act
All employees who worked for the Employer for a minimum of twelve (12) months and worked at least 1250 hours during the past twelve (12) months are eligible for unpaid leave as set forth in the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
Eligible employees are entitled to up to a total of 12 weeks of unpaid leave during any twelve (12) month period for the following reasons:
1.	Birth or adoption of a child or the placement of a child for foster care;
2.	To care for a spouse, child or parent of the employee due to a serious health condition;
3.	A serious health condition of the employee.
- 156-
Article 38, Section 3
The employee’s seniority rights shall continue as if the employee had not taken leave under this Section, and the Employer will maintain health insurance coverage during the period of the leave.
The Employer may require the employee to substitute accrued paid vacation or other paid leave for part of the twelve (12) week leave period.
The employee is required to provide the Employer with at least thirty (30) days advance notice before FMLA leave begins if the need for leave is foreseeable. If the leave is not foreseeable, the employee is required to give notice as soon as practicable. The Employer has the right to require medical certification of a need for leave under this Act. In addition, the Employer has the right to require a second (2nd) opinion at the Employer’s expense. If the second opinion conflicts with the initial certification, a third opinion from a health care provider selected by the first and second opinion health care providers, at the Employer’s expense may be sought, which shall be final and binding. Failure to provide certification shall cause any leave taken to be treated as an unexcused absence.
As a condition of returning to work, an employee who has taken leave due to his/her own serious health condition must be medically qualified to perform the functions of his/her job. In cases where employees fail to return to work, the provisions of the applicable Supplemental Agreement will apply.
It is specifically understood that an employee will not be required to repay any of the contributions for his/her health insurance during FMLA leave. No employee will be disciplined for requesting or taking FMLA leave under the contract absent fraud, misrepresentation, or dishonesty.
Disputes arising under this provision shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
The provisions of this Section are in response to the federal FMLA and shall not supersede any state or local law which provides for greater employee rights.
- 157-
Article 38, Section 3
The Employer may not force an employee to use pre-scheduled vacation time as FMLA leave, provided the vacation involved was prescheduled in accordance with the applicable supplemental agreement.
The Employer may not force an employee who has taken separate hours of unpaid leave for medical reasons to substitute those hours as accrued leave under the FMLA.
The Employer may not force an employee to substitute accrued leave for FMLA leave if the employee is receiving supplemental loss-of-time disability benefits from a benefit plan under the Agreement.
ARTICLE 39.	DURATION

Questions arising out of alleged conflicts shall be submitted directly to the National Grievance Committee.
- I69 -
ARTICLE 40.	SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
Section 1.	Operations Covered
a)	This Agreement shall cover all classifications of employees hereinafter referred to or subsequently covered who are employed by any member Employer (which includes any other Employer, whose employees are represented by a Union who may become a member of the Employer Association after the date of this Agreement and a copy of whose approved application for membership in the Employer Association shall be filed with the Union by the Employer Association) as well as any non-member of the Employer Association which becomes a party to this Agreement, except that it shall not apply in the case of any such employees whose hours of work, wages and working conditions are governed by separate contracts between Union and the Employer Association, relating to particular branches of truck service, such as the moving of household goods.
(b)	The executive of this Agreement on the part of the Employer shall cover all local operations of the Employer within, into and out of the area and territory described above.
(c)	All operations and work covered herein shall be performed exclusively by employees covered by this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement).
Section 2.	Employees Covered
(a)	Employees covered by this Agreement shall be construed to mean, but not limited to. any driver, chauffeur, or driver-helper operating a truck, tractor, motorcycle, passenger or horse-drawn vehicle, or any other vehicle operated on the highway, streets or private road for transportation purposes when used to defeat the purposes of this Agreement. The term employee also includes, but is not limited to. all employees used in dock work, checking, stacking, loading, unloading, handling, shipping, receiving, switching, forklift. Teamster Rigger, and assembling or drag line and allied work.
It is understood, however, that the term employee shall be construed
- I70-
to mean those employees of the Employer, employed directly and indirectly by and/or under the control of the Employer, and who are represented by the Local Union or during the life of this Agreement may come to be represented by the Local Union.
(b)	In the absence of a training program, employees on student trips shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
(c)	Teamster Rigger rates shall apply except where work is performed under AGC Agreement on job site construction. Rigging is in addition to cribbing, blocking, etc., and includes any specialized equipment other than a crane or a similar type of equipment making lift or hoist.
Section 3.	Local Operations
(a)	This Agreement shall cover all local dock work or city pickup and delivery service and local operations within a radius of forty (40) miles. Road drivers shall not be permitted to perform dock work or city pickup and delivery service except as specifically permitted in this Agreement.
(b)	At no time shall any provision of this Agreement permitting pickup and delivery supersede the provisions of any Local Cartage Agreement, which prohibits such pickup and delivery.
(c)	The prevailing Local City Cartage Agreement shall govern all wages and conditions on runs exclusively within a radius of forty (40) miles from the Employer’s terminal for those Companies whose terminal is located outside of the City of Philadelphia. The forty (40) mile radius for those Companies whose terminal is located in the City of Philadelphia shall be measured from City Hall.
(d)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 3, in the area between a twenty (20) mile radius and a forty (40) mile radius, an over-the-road driver en route to a Philadelphia area terminal shall be allowed to make a delivery of freight. Such over-the-road driver shall, in addition, be allowed to drop a full trailer load of freight and pick up an empty trailer and proceed into the terminal. The same en route pickup and delivery procedure applies in the same area when
- 171 -
an over-the-road driver is dispatched outbound from the Philadelphia area terminal.
An over-the-road driver will not be permitted to pick up or deliver or to drop trailers within a twenty (20) mile radius as defined in (c) above except the Employer and the Local Union involved may mutually agree to specific exceptions to the above. Failure to agree, the matter shall be referred to the Philadelphia Supplemental Negotiating Committee. If not resolved, the matter will be referred to the Eastern Region Joint Area Committee. A road driver en route to or from a Philadelphia area terminal shall be allowed to deliver or pick up freight, drop or pick up trailers within the twenty (20) mile radius, provided that such work is new business as of April 1, 1994. The Employer shall notify the Local Union involved if and when this becomes an established practice.
(e)	The Local Unions and Transport Employers Association shall establish a Local Cartage Committee, which, upon written proposal from any Local Union or Local Cartage Carrier, shall be empowered to resolve problems and issues peculiar to the competitive situation of such Local Cartage Carriers. Such Local Cartage Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of union representatives and employer representatives. The Committee shall adopt rules and procedures for the implementation of this paragraph.
(0 Any reference to radius mile is intended to mean air mile.
(g) Subcontracting
The signatory parties to this agreement recognize that subcontracting is a very important contractual issue. Violation through intentional subterfuge for the purpose of defeating the Labor Agreement will not be permitted. It is further recognized that Employers may subcontract overflow freight in accordance with the terms and conditions listed below. Overflow freight is defined as freight that cannot be delivered due to overcapacity, to a subcontractor for delivery, generally on the day the subcontracting occurs. It is understood as stated below, that all regular employees have been offered a work opportunity on the day the subcontract occurs. It is understood that several factors, including absenteeism, contribute to a carrier’s need
- 172 -
to subcontract freight. Recognizing the significance of this issue, the parties agree to establish a Philadelphia Supplemental Subcontracting Committee. This Committee shall be empowered to resolve disputes, which allege a violation of this section. The Philadelphia Supplemental Subcontracting Committee shall be comprised of the Union and Employer Supplemental Chairmen, or their designees, of the Philadelphia Supplemental Negotiating Committee, two (2) Union panel members and two (2) Employer panel members. This Committee will meet on an as needed basis, to resolve disputes of this Article. This Committee will recognize that subterfuge by any party is a serious offense. Examples of subterfuge may include: tendering an amount of freight to a subcontractor on a given day that exceeds the capacity of that subcontractor; tendering freight to a subcontractor that knowingly will not be attempted to delivery on the day subcontracted; failure to add employees to the seniority list. There shall be no postponements of grievances filed under this Article.
The Supplemental Subcontracting Committee will additionally have authority to consider and weigh the ramifications of absenteeism and its effects on a subcontracting dispute. The Supplemental Subcontracting Committee shall be committed to rendering fair and expedited decisions in the spirit of preserving work and job opportunities for employees covered by this Agreement. In the event this Committee fails to resolve a dispute, the matter shall be forwarded to the Eastern Region Joint Area Committee for resolution.
For the purpose of: (1) preserving work and job opportunities for the employees covered by this Agreement; (2) protecting the standards of employment covered by this Agreement; and (3) recapturing lost job opportunities; all to the maximum extent legally possible. (A) There shall be no subcontracting, transfer, lease, assignment or conveyance in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, of any of the work or services of the kind, nature or type covered by this Agreement, and presently performed or hereafter assigned to the collective bargaining unit; nor shall the Employer be part of, or permit any other arrangement whereby such work or services may be performed by other than employees of the Employer in the collective bargaining unit covered by this Agreement; (B) provided, how
- 173-
ever, that the Employer may subcontract to an employer whose employees receive economic terms and conditions of employment as favorable to employees as those provided by this Agreement, solely in the event that all of the employees on the seniority list of the Employer are fully employed and there has been no significant reduction in the number of employees on said seniority list in the 3-month period prior to the proposed subcontract. Prior to any subcontracting pursuant to this subsection, the Employer must give the Local Union ten (10) days advance notice in writing of the intent to subcontract and the full and specific details of the subcontract including the work involved: the duration of the subcontract; the identity of the subcontractor; the economic terms and conditions of employment of the subcontractor’s employees. If the Local Union notifies the Employer that it considers the proposed subcontract to be in violation of this Agreement, the matter may be submitted to the Local grievance machinery provided in this Agreement, for an expedited hearing, and the subcontract shall not be implemented unless and until it is determined not to be in violation of the agreement. There may be times when the seniority list is not completely employed. In this event, the Employer may subcontract freight of a minimum nature to an outlying area that is not being regularly served.
The principle of each carrier’s past practice shall be considered in applying this Article. The principle of “past practice” is intended to mean the specific subcontractor utilized. A subcontractor that has and is being utilized is covered by the term past practice. Any new subcontractor must be in compliance with the terms of this Article. The term “past practice” is not intended to define the scope of the operation.
ARTICLE 41.	ABSENCE
Section 1.	Leave of Absence
Any employee desiring a leave of absence from his employment without discrimination or loss of seniority rights and without pay shall secure written permission from both the Union and the Employer. The maximum leave of absence shall be for sixty (60) days and may be extended for like periods. Permission for same
- 174-
must be secured from both the Union and the Employer. During the period of absence, the employee shall not engage in gainful employment in the same industry in classifications covered by this Agreement. Failure to comply with this provision shall result in the complete loss of seniority rights for the employee involved. Inability to work because of proven sickness or injury shall not result in the loss of seniority rights.
An employee shall be permitted to take a leave of absence for the purpose of undergoing treatment of an approved program for alcoholism. The leave of absence must be requested prior to the commission of any act subject to disciplinary action. Such leave of absence shall be granted on a one-time basis and shall be for a maximum of sixty (60) days unless extended by mutual agreement. While on such leave, the employee shall not receive any of the benefits provided by this Agreement, Supplements or Riders except the continued accrual of seniority, nor does this provision amend or alter the disciplinary provisions.
Section 2.	Time Off for Union Activities
The Employer agrees to grant the necessary and reasonable time off, without discrimination or loss of seniority rights and without pay, to any employee designated by the Union to attend a labor convention or serve as an elected or appointed officer, business agent or organizer, provided forty-eight (48) hours written notice is given to the Employer by the Union, specifying the approximate length of time he may be off. The Union agrees in making its request for time off for Union activities that due consideration shall be given to the number of men affected in order that there shall be no disruption of the Employer’s operation due to lack of available employees.
Section 3.
(a)	Time off during any leave of absence shall be included in the total length of service for determining the number of weeks of vacation which an employee shall receive, but this time off shall not be counted as days worked for purposes of qualifying for a vacation or a holiday.

The probationary employee after working thirty (30) days within the next sixty (60) working days shall be placed on the seniority list as of the first day worked in the probationary period. If the new hire rate is not implemented within ten (10) working days, the Company shall not deduct overpayment from employees. The probationary employee may be terminated without further recourse, provided, however, that the Employer may not terminate for the purpose of evading this contract. The Local Union shall be advised by the Employer of all probationary employees and must further be notified in writing of the termination of any probationary employee. A company having more than one (I) probationary employee working at the same time shall work probationary employees in the order they started.
(c)	A probationary employee who is terminated during the probationary period and is worked two (2) or more days at any time within the next twelve (12) months at the Employer’s location within the jurisdiction of the Local Union shall be added to the seniority list with a seniority date as of the first day the probationary employee is again worked.

Protests to any employee’s seniority date or position on such list must be made, in writing, to the Employer within thirty (30) calendar days after such seniority date or position first appears, and if no protests are timely made, the dates and positions posted shall be deemed correct. Any such protest which is timely made may be submitted to the Joint Grievance Procedure.
(c)	Any employee on the seniority list who is absent because of illness or injury shall continue to accrue seniority during such absence for the purpose of determining his place on the seniority list. However, upon being able to return to work, he shall immediately inform the Employer of his return date.

Employees who do not have an established starting time shall make themselves available to their Employer each day before accepting employment elsewhere. In each terminal the Union and the Employer shall establish procedures as to how and at what time each day non-starting time men shall be told if there is work available for them that day.
(g)	Terminal seniority, as measured by length of service at such terminal, shall prevail, excepting in those instances where the Employer, the Unions involved, and the Joint Area Committee agree to the contrary.
(h)	The Local Union and the Employer shall agree, subject to the approval of he Joint Area Committee, on circumstances under which persons who leave the classification of work covered by this Agreement, but remain in the employ of the Employer in some other capacity may retain seniority rights upon their return to their original unit.

- 178-
Section 3.
(a)	All regular runs (except those “House Concerns” with original drivers) positions, starting times, classifications and shifts are subject to seniority and shall be posted for bids for a period of not less than seven (7) calendar days. The Employer shall not post starting times, which are less than thirty (30) minutes apart.

For the purpose of employees signing in seniority order, the steward may assist the Company in the bidding procedure. All posting shall be at a conspicuous place so that all eligible employees will receive notice of the vacancy or starting time bid. Such posting of bids shall be made not more than twice each calendar year. Vacancies, new starting times and new classifications shall be posted for bid immediately. unless otherwise mutually agreed upon. Such posting of bids must be posted at least once each calendar year and cannot be posted more than twice each calendar year.
(c)	There shall be a mutually established procedure at each private and contract carrier regarding starting times, call times, etc.
(d)	A minimum of ninety percent (90%) of all regular city employees shall have a regular established starting time, subject to change only if mutually agreed upon after once established, except the Employer shall have the right to change starting time with one (1) week’s notice to the Union. A regular established starting time is defined as not varying by more than three (3) hours. The Employer may bring in the remaining ten percent (10%) of the men prior to the regular starting time provided that this is not done with regularity. If with regularity and with sufficient work to accomplish a week’s work, such starting time has to be posted for bid at that time.
- 179 -
(e)	It is understood that any layoff will be in seniority order. If work develops and such laid off employee: (a) is called in less than two (2) hours prior to his bid starting time, he shall receive overtime until his regular bid starting time, or (b) is called in less than two (2) hours after his regular bid starting lime, he shall be paid from his regular bid starting time.
(f)	Where the starting time of an entire shift is to be changed, one (I) week’s notice shall be given except in the event of an Act of God. When the starting time of less than an entire shift is changed, the employee(s) shall be given notice no later than the end of his previous shift.
(g)	If an employee is required to report for work before his regular starting time, he shall be paid for such period at the overtime rate applicable for that day. When an employee is called in earlier than their bid start time the employee must complete their regular bid time to qualify for the up front overtime.
(h)	Seniority shall prevail in that the Employer recognizes the general principle that senior employees shall have preference to choose on a permanent basis the job where the rate is highest, and have the choice of day or night shift, provided such employee is qualified for such work. Dispatch assignments shall be at the sole discretion of the Employer, except when more than two (2) drivers are dispatched at the same time. Other than bid, the two (2) most senior employees shall be permitted the choice of dispatch. Dispatch shall be defined as any work assignment, city, road or dock. Discrimination shall be subject to the grievance machinery.

If still unemployed on the Monday following the layoff, employees with greater terminal seniority, if qualified, may bump employees with lesser terminal seniority, provided — (I) a city driver shall not have the right to bump a road driver or vice versa and (2) no platform man or helper may bump a city or a road driver.
- 180-
(j)	Where there is a mutual agreement by past practices to the contrary such past practices shall prevail unless mutually agreed to the contrary, then the above shall prevail, except where it is mutually agreed to in the future to have a one (I) seniority board system.
(k)	Employer shall notify the steward in advance of layoff or of recall.
Section 4.
(a)	If a private carrier, which has delivered its freight and merchandise with its own truck and driver, then decides to lease or hire a truck and driver from an Employer covered by this Agreement, such Employer shall take the driver formerly employed by the House Concern and assign him to the leased truck.

(d)	New work acquired by the House Concern shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall be offered to the House Concern employees.
(e)	The House Concern Employer shall not transfer bargaining unit work without maintaining the hourly rate of pay and equivalent fringe benefits.

Section 5.
In accordance with Article 8, Section 6(g), the parties agree that in the event of an approved change of operations, employees who bid on the initial move but are not successful because of seniority shall be afforded additional opportunity to transfer in the event additional regular work opportunity develops within six (6) months of the approved change of operations.
ARTICLE 43.	MAINTENANCE OF STANDARDS
Section 1. Protection of Conditions
(a)	The Employer agrees that all conditions of employment relating to wages, hours of work, overtime differentials, general working conditions and bonuses shall be maintained at not less than the highest standards in effect at the time of the signing of this Agreement and the conditions of employment shall be improved wherever specific provisions for improvement are made elsewhere in this Agreement.
(b)	Oral testimony by an employee claiming a past practice not accompanied by substantiating proof or records existing at the time of the alleged past practice shall not be considered as presumptive proof that such past practice existed.
ARTICLE 44.	GRIEVANCE MACHINERY
Section 1.
The Union and the Employers agree that there shall be no strike, lockout, tie-up or legal proceedings without first using all possible means of a settlement, as provided for in this Agreement, of any controversy which might arise.
Section 2.
(a	) Disputes and grievances may first be taken up by the steward,
- 182 -
and settled in accordance with this Agreement and if no settlement is reached, then taken up between the business agent of the Local Union involved and the Employer representative.
(b	) 1. All grievances must be made known to the other party, in writing, within fifteen (15) working days after the reason for such grievance has occurred or within fifteen (15) working days after the driver has returned to his home terminal. Provided, however, that those grievances alleging that the Employer did not pay the proper contractual rate of pay or the employee was not paid for the proper amount of hours which he actually worked may be filed within fifteen (15) working days of the date on which the employee became aware of the cause of such grievance.
2.	The time limitation of ten (10) working days is applicable to an Employer taking disciplinary action against an employee except in cases of dishonesty or involving the investigation of an accident. In those instances, the Employer may take appropriate action within ten (10) working days from the date on which the Employer first became aware of the employee's involvement in an alleged dishonesty or accident. Failure of the Employer to complete or mutually extend in writing by the employee, with a copy to the Local Union, any investigation within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of letter of investigation shall forfeit the Employers’ right to discipline.

ARTICLE 53. VACATIONS
Section 1.
Every regular employee who has been continuously in the employ of an Employer shall if he meets the other qualifications set forth herein, receive paid vacation as set forth below. The qualifying year for vacation shall be measured from an employee’s anniversary date.
Vacation	Years of Continuous 1	Weeks of Servi
	1 2	1 2
	8	3
	15	4
	20	5
	30	6
Section 2.
(a)	To qualify for a vacation an employee in addition to having been continuously employed by the Employer for the specified number of years must not have been absent from work during his anniversary year for more than fifty (50) days on which he was afforded the opportunity to work by the Employer provided that absence caused by legitimate illness, or an accident, shall not be counted.
(b)	By “continuously” is meant the following: If an employee loses less than six (6) calendar months or less than one hundred thirty (130) working days because of proven illness, accident or layoff
-212-
during his anniversary year, he shall be entitled to his full vacation with pay. If an employee loses six (6) or more calendar months or one hundred thirty (130) or more working days because of proven illness, accident or layoff during his anniversary year, he shall be entitled to a pro rata share of his vacation. Upon permanent layoff, death or retirement, an employee on the seniority list with one or more years of service, shall be entitled to vacation pay on a pro rata basis. Such pro rata vacation shall be computed as follows:
The total number of days worked (including days for which he was paid holidays or the previous year’s vacation) shall be divided by 130. The resulting figure, when multiplied by the vacation amount he would have been entitled to if not off, is the pro rated vacation due. Example: If an employee normally entitled to $734.85 as a week’s vacation pay worked only 112 days, his vacation is as follows:
112 (days worked)
130 (total possible days) = .86 (factor)
$734.85 x .86 = $631.97 (pro rata vacation due)
(c)	If an employee is discharged or quits and has been on the seniority list one (1) or more years, he shall be entitled to vacation on a pro rata basis to be computed as follows:
The total number of days worked (including days for which he was paid holidays or previous year’s vacation) shall be divided by 260. The resulting figure when multiplied by vacation amount he would have been entitled to if he had not quit or been discharged, is the pro rata vacation due. Example: If an employee normally entitled to $734.85 as a week’s vacation pay worked 112 days, his vacation is as follows:
112 (days worked)
260 (total possible days) = .43 (factor)
$734.85 x .43 = $315.99 (pro rata vacation due)
- 213 -
Section 3.
(a)	The Employer shall have the right to schedule the number of men in each classification who shall receive vacations at a particular time. Employees within a particular classification must select their vacations according to their seniority, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the Union and the Employer. The vacation period of each qualified employee shall be set with due regard to the desire, seniority and preference of the employees, consistent with the efficient operation of the Employer’s business.

Where he takes the 4th, 5th and/or 6th week(s) off, the 4th, 5th and/or 6th week(s) vacation need not be consecutive. When the man works the 4th, 5th and/or 6th week(s), the man shall receive his vacation pay plus pay for time worked. The 4th, 5th and/or 6th week(s) of vacation may be taken as individual days, however, the employee must select to do so at the time the vacations are selected. Ample notice must be given by the employee when selecting individual days with the Employer having the right to schedule according to business demands.
Vacations may be taken in consecutive weeks provided, however, that as to any employee who is entitled to more than two (2) weeks vacation, the Employer may schedule the weeks in excess of two (2) separate from the other weeks of vacation.
(d)	If, in the future, the Employer and Union agree that a manpower shortage has developed, an employee may be required to work during the vacation period, but in such event he shall receive in addition to his earnings for that week the pay to which he would have been entitled had he been on vacation.
