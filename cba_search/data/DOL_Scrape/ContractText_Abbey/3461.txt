principle of Company seniority shall be followed when it becomes necessary to layoff employees due to slackness of business; that is, the employee on duty in the classification in which the reduction is being made having a shorter period of continuous service shall be laid-off before any other employee having a longer period of continuous service; and preference to laid off employees shall be given in recall within the particular classification.

Suite Attendants will service the same three suites assigned at the end of the previous season except during occurrences of sales or labor reduction.

observed in designating the days off.
6.3	Promotion Policy: It is the policy of the Employer to promote qualified employees when vacancies in higher positions occur, providing that management determines the vacancy can be filled. All openings must be posted for at least four (4) days or two (2) events, whichever occurs first, to the most senior bidder, provided he/she is qualified. The burden of proving whether any unsuccessful senior bidder was “qualified” shall rest with the Union in any arbitration proceeding brought under this provision.
6.4	Classification Seniority:	In addition to those matters to which seniority now
applies, suites and bar classification seniority shall apply in cases where there is a permanent vacancy in work location, shift, or where possible, sections and voluntary time off.

ARTICLE 10	- FOOD & BEVERAGE VENDORS
10.1	Food and Beverage vendors will not be required to call off when not coming to work. If a Food and Beverage vendor is not in by the time the numbers are beginning to be posted on the board, the vendor goes to the back of the board or works support and is given, but not charged, an excused absence or goes home, and either uses an excused absence or gets a zero for that day on the Revision List.
10.2	Food & Beverage Vendors List Revisions: The Food and Beverage list shall be revised once at the beginning of each season and twice during the season - total of three times per year. The Food and Beverage vendors revision list shall not include post regular baseball season sales numbers. The revisions will be reviewed with the stewards within three (3) days after the revisions are completed. The Vendor Revision Sales List for the beginning of the 2004 season is Schedule “B” attached hereto and made part hereof. Food and Beverage vendors revision will be based on commission only, in accordance with the following formula:
Revision Steps:
Total the earnings for each vendor
Sort each vendor using the total dollars earned as the criteria
The higher numerical position from the previous list decides ties
No vendor can move more than twenty spots either up or down during each revision
18
Excused absences: Excused absences will appear as games worked for the purpose of the revision sales list. Vendors will not be penalized financially because of an excused absence. An average of the earning of the vendors immediately above and below for the date of the excused absence will become the amount to be credited as earnings for the excused absences. If either (or both) of those should also be absent, the next one(s) in succession shall be used. And with regard to absences by the first or last vendor on the list, he/she will be credited with the amount earned by the vendor below or above him/her respectively.
10.3	Excused Absences: Food and Beverage vendors will be allotted eight (8) excused absences per season. No absence counted for non-competitive work on approved leave of absence. The eight (8) excused absences can be used at any time during the season except for two (2) day games. Food and Beverage vendors may be required to work two-day games per season for which they may not use an excused absence. All make up games shall be at the employee’s option.
10.4	The Food and Beverage vendor penalty shall be a 1-day suspension for the infraction of running or selling beer after the 7th inning. Multiple infractions may result in progressive discipline up to and including discharge for just cause.
10.5	Food and Beverage vendors shall be allowed to sell anywhere in the Stadium venue when the tarp is on the infield. Food and Beverage vendors may not vend within 10 feet of Food and Beverage stands.
10.6	Food and Beverage commission will be paid as follows:
2004	2005	2006
Item	Upper	Lower	Upper	Lower	Upper	Lower
Beer	16.75%	16.25%	17.00%	16.50%	17.25%	16.75%
Hot Dogs	17.25%	16.75%	17.50%	17.00%	17.75%	17.25%

Water	17.50%	17.00%	17.75%	17.25%	18.00%	17.50%
19
Snacks	17.75%	17.25%	18.00%	17.50%	18.25%	17.75%
Pretzels	17.75%	17.25%	18.00%	17.50%	18.25%	17.75%
Peanuts	17.75%	17.25%	18.00%	17.50%	18.25%	17.75%
Frozen Product	15.75%	15.25%	16.00%	15.50%	16.25%	15.75%
10.7	Two portable beer locations shall be offered to the Food and Beverage vendors at site #301 and the site at the Bullpen at commissioned rate of 8% to be paid to the workers at each portable beer stand. Selection of these positions shall be made once each month between home stands.
10.8	Food and Beverage vendor discipline shall be imposed 96 hours after the incident, except for cases of gross misconduct, which shall include selling alcohol after the 7th inning, and running. In the event a Food and Beverage vendor is disciplined for selling to a minor and subsequently returned to work due to lack of merit of the discipline, he/she shall be paid time and one-half the commission rate he/she would have earned if the time off had been treated as a series of excused absences at straight time.
10.9	Worn vendors aprons shall be exchanged for new ones.
10.10	On V-14 the sales numbers will be given to employees at the end of each shift. On V-14, employees must wait for the commission receipts to be calculated.
10.11	If a vendor is injured on the job and cannot complete the workday, the vendor will be paid the stand attendant’s rate if their earnings for the day do not equal that of a stand attendant. Vendors who are injured on the job will be credited in the same way for the day on which they were injured or any other days they miss due that injury. Each day will be designated as an “injury absence” and will not be subtracted from the eight (8) excused absences the vendor has a right to. After the eighth (8th) missed event in succession, that vendor’s position will be frozen through the revision after the end of the season, but this “freezing” shall not be abused through numerous unrelated absences. The same procedure applies to any vendor who misses eight (8) events due to documented medical problems, even if not work-related. Individual cases will be evaluated jointly by the Employer and the Union.
10.12	Food and Beverage vendors may wear shorts, when authorized, as part of the appropriate uniform, the style and color of which is determined by the Company.
10.13	Food and Beverage vendors shall be allowed to check in forty-five (45) minutes before game time for 7:05 p.m. games.
