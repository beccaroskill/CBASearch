To be eligible for Holiday pay, an employee must work four (4) hours of die regularly scheduled work day immediately preceding the Holiday and four (4) hours of the regularly scheduled work day immediately succeeding the Holiday. If s/he does not work the required hours before and after each Holiday, one day of Holiday pay will be deducted for each day four (4) hours not worked up to a maximum of two (2) days except if s/he is on
22
emergency leave, military induction or in the event of a verified personal illness and the Holiday falls within seven (7) working days of the employee’s last day worked. An employee on temporary layoff will receive Holiday pay regardless of whether or not s/he meets the above qualifications. No employee shall receive Holiday pay if s/he fails to report to work after accepting a work assignment for that day.
48.	Section 3. Observance of Holidays, (a) Whenever any of the above named Holidays not already rescheduled to provide for a "Christmas shutdown" fall on Sunday, the following Monday shall be observed as such. If the following Monday is already a Holiday, the following Tuesday will be recognized, etc.
(b) Whenever any of the above named Holidays not already rescheduled to provide for a "Christmas shutdown" fall on Saturday, the preceding Friday shall be observed as such. If the preceding Friday is already a Holiday, the preceding Thursday will be recognized.
49.	Section 4. Distribution of Overtime. The parties expect employees to review overtime records for accuracy, commit to overtime in a timely manner, and work the overtime to which they commit to. Overtime will be administered and tracked by the Facilitator/Steward PARTNERSHIP or their assigned designees. (The Steward will not be allowed to ask for overtime).
Employees who do not work after committing to overtime:
On the first occurrence of an employee failing to work the overtime for which s/he had committed or working fewer hours than committed (unless there is no work or the overtime was canceled), the employee will be counseled by the PARTNERSHIP as to their overtime expectations.
Distribution Procedure:
The parties agree to establish a procedure that distributes overtime equitably among all employees on all shifts.
1)	The section/organizational unit's overtime needs for the next week and the appropriate employees to fill these needs will be determined by the section/ organizational unit or PARTNERSHIP by the close of each shift on Wednesday.
23
2)	The appropriate employees will be asked for overtime by the first break of each shift on Thursday.
3)	Employees have until lunch on each shift on Thursday to commit to or refuse the overtime. Failure to meet this deadline will be considered a chargeable refusal of overtime.
4)	All overtime requests will be completed by end of each shift Thursday.
5)	By first break of each shift on Friday, the list of employees accepting and refusing overtime and the planned work activity for each employee will be posted in the work area for review by all employees.
6)	Employees have until lunch of each shift on Friday to review the overtime records for accuracy and identify errors. The PARTNERSHIP will review and correct all errors identified before the end of the normal shift. Any error identified by an employee after lunch break on Friday will not be corrected.
If Thursday and/or Friday are Holidays, the process will be adjusted accordingly one or two days to offset the Holidays.
Unplanned Overtime:
Overtime not requested and posted by first break on each shift on Friday for the following work week will be considered to be unplanned overtime. Unplanned overtime will be filled through an agreement between the PARTNERSHIP.
(a)	Overtime shall be as equitably distributed as practicable among employees, employees with higher seniority status among those regularly performing the work being given preference in the first assignment of overtime and receiving further assignments of overtime in their regular turn. In assembly and test where round robin overtime is used and an overtime assignment requiring continuity of effort is needed for work both Saturday and Sunday, the low overtime employee will be asked for both days. Any deviation from "round robin" overtime must be concurred by the Chief Steward prior to the overtime being worked.
(b)	An employee who is in the process of being transferred shall continue to receive further assignments of overtime in the section/organizational unit s/he is being transferred from until s/he is physically moved to his/her new section/organizational unit.
24
(c)	Employees working overtime shall not work in other than their own sections/organizational units unless they have been specifically assigned to overtime work in such section/organizational unit and do not prevent employees regularly performing the work from receiving the overtime assignment.
(d)	The COMPANY will make every effort to give at least twenty-four (24) hours notice to employees requested to work overtime.
(e)	Those employees given a twenty-four (24) hour advance notice will be considered to have had their turn whether they accept the work or not. Such turn will not be charged when the notice is less than twenty-four (24) hours and the employee does not accept the work.
(f)	When an employee accepts an overtime assignment, s/he will be charged in the overtime records, whether s/he works the overtime or does not work the overtime, for the full amount of time s/he accepted at the applicable overtime rate.
(g)	When an employee, after reporting for work, leaves of his/her own volition, prior to completing the amount of overtime s/he accepted, s/he will be charged with the full amount of time s/he accepted at the applicable overtime rate.
(h)	An employee who is on a leave of absence for a full work week or more and misses his/her regular turn at overtime will be charged in the overtime records, for a maximum of thirty (30) consecutive days, with the number of hours pay s/he would have received had s/he been at work. After thirty (30) consecutive days of leave, s/he will be averaged into the section/organizational unit to which s/he is returned. Any portion of the week preceding the first full work week in which an employee is on leave of absence shall not be included in the thirty (30) day period for receiving overtime charged.
(i)	An employee who misses his/her regular turn at overtime while s/he is on earned vacation will not be charged in the overtime records. An employee who takes an earned vacation of one or more weeks is entitled to time off on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday) or the sixth and seventh day following each week of earned vacation but not preceding the vacation.
25
(j)	An employee on a disciplinary layoff who misses his/her turn at overtime will be charged in the overtime records for the time s/he would have been offered had s/he been here.
(k)	No employee will be charged in the overtime records for overtime refused if the work is not the type of work normally performed in his/her job classification or if the work to be performed is located in a building complex other than the one where the employee normally works.
(1)	When overtime is offered to an employee whose turn it is to work and s/he won’t work the full amount of time offered, s/he will be considered as having refused the full amount of time offered and charged in the overtime records accordingly provided s/he has had twenty-four (24) hours notice..
(m)	If there is an overtime assignment which requires continuity of effort and follow through and which will require working both Saturday and Sunday, only those employees who will accept both days need be asked. An employee refusing overtime for one of the days shall be charged for the day s/he refused. (See (a) above)
(n) When overtime is scheduled for a group of Assembly Operators on a progressive assembly line and enough operators refuse the overtime making it necessary for the COMPANY to cancel the overtime assignment, the amount of overtime refused by these operators should be charged on the overtime record provided they were asked twenty-four (24) hours in advance. No lime shall be charged in the record for employees who accepted the overtime and would have worked if the COMPANY had not been forced to cancel it.
(o)	When an employee (who is a member of a National Guard or Organized Reserve Unit) is required for training or emergency duty of short duration and therefore misses his/her regular turn for overtime work, s/he shall not be charged in the overtime record.
(p)	Employees on loan or temporary transfer to another section/organizational unit or shift will have any overtime they work charged in their home section/organizational unit.
26
(q)	When a new or transferred employee reports to a section/organizational unit s/he will be given an overtime starting credit equal to the average amount of overtime worked by the employees s/he will share the overtime with.
(r)	An employee who accepts a training posting will be considered eligible for overtime assignments in the section/organizational unit to which the employee is assigned as a trainee provided the employee used (during overtime) does not prevent employees regularly performing the work from receiving the overtime assignment. (Employees regularly performing the work are employees in the same job code family in that section.) The employee may also be used during overtime in the section/organizational unit in which they were formerly assigned.
(s)	Weekly up-to-date overtime records will be kept and posted in each section/organizational unit for review by employees. The COMPANY will use a standard form for recording and posting overtime. Request for Adjustments concerning overtime which resolutions result in one (1) hour or less pay will not be charged in employees overtime records.

NOTE: During recent negotiations, the Parties discussed flexibility in starting wages for new hires depending on the hiring environment and reached the following understanding:
The COMPANY will choose the labor grade to be flexible in with notice to the Union Office. Once a new hire is hired in at a higher rate than the previous employees, all employees in that labor grade will progress to that higher wage. Once a higher wage rate has been established, the hiring wage will remain the same for a 3 month period starting from the date of the last increase. The starting wage may be raised at anytime upon notification of the Union Office. Notification of the Union Office will be the starting date of the 3 month starting wage freeze. No employee will move backwards in pay rate in case of a lower hiring rate. The current alternate wage rate will be posted on the posting board. ARS employees successfully bidding a promotion during their first year of employment (but after their probationary period) will receive the same relative ARS rate of the new position. In no case will employees be required to spend more than 52 workweeks in the alternate rate structure.
Qj Employees who become displaced from their job classification due to a reduction in force shall exercise their seniority rights in accordance with applicable provisions of the Labor Agreement and shall be placed in the comparable step of the alternate rate structure of the job classification to which they move.
A)	Advances in pay rates are per ARTICLE XIII, Section 3, "Advances in Rate of Pay Within Wage Group".

Neither the Committee nor this letter will supersede any existing local language on this subject.
The parties agree to utilize the Committee to review current benefits plans, administration and vendors, to explore whether alternative benefit plans should be considered and implemented, and for involvement in making recommendations in decision-making regarding certain benefits plans. It is understood that the Company will have the ultimate right to select the vendor, drug formularies and other administrative decisions as long as the Company retains responsibility for the plan. Any benefit plan change mutually recommended by the Committee, which would amend or modify the Collective Bargaining Agreements between the parties, will be subject to approval of the Company and ratification by the majority of the membership at each location where the Unions are represented.
The composition of the Committee will include one Union representative from each Company location covered by this agreement, and International Union Representation from each of the respective Unions, and management representatives that will not exceed the number of union representatives.
The Committee will meet not less that once every six months, unless otherwise agreed, at a mutually agreed location. Company agrees to reimburse the local union representatives’ expenses for theses meetings and any additional requirements as agreed to by the committee. The parties will try to minimize expenses, including the use of tele- or video-conferencing where practical. A written agenda will be mutually prepared for these meetings. Committee meetings should serve to provide education, involvement and input regarding such employee benefit topics as:
77
Cost trends
Communication plans
Utilization data
Vendor performance
Vendor selection processes General employee issues
Topics of discussion and input could include all benefit plans, i.e., medical, dental, prescription drugs, mental health, vision, 401K, pension, life insurance's. By mutual agreement, a consultant may be utilized for data presentation and analysis at the Company's expense.

The Committee recognizes that the Shared Services Operation (Cypress, CA) is involved in similar work and is chartered with this responsibility by the Company, so duplicative actions may be recommended by them as well to the Committee.
No discussions or actions of the Committee will be the basis for a grievance, arbitration, or unfair labor practice charge or any other legal proceeding by either party. However, the formation of this Committee will not prevent the Union from filing grievances on benefit provisions contained in the CBA.

LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Outsourcing Discussions
The COMPANY and the UNION recognized that the job security of al! employees can be enhanced by improving the competitiveness and efficiency of the business. For this purpose, the Parties have agreed during recent negotiations to meet and discuss the subject of outsourcing, or other viable alternatives, that will improve the competitiveness of custodial and grounds maintenance work.
82
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING
Outsourcing Notification
The businesses that form Rockwell Collins and the UNIONS that represent bargaining unit employees within those businesses have jointly agreed to work toward establishing and maintaining a relationship that is based on cooperation, communication and mutual trust. The foundation of this relationship is the recognition that the COMPANY and the UNION are joint partners in the success of the businesses. In order for this relationship to continue to evolve and flourish, both Parties must actively seek opportunities for joint involvement in proactively addressing and resolving the competitive issues that each business will face.
Therefore, in situations where the COMPANY cannot continue to competitively perform work in-house, they will meet with the UNION to jointly explore viable alternatives to outsourcing. No work currently being performed in-house by bargaining unit employees will be outsourced unless the COMPANY and UNION have met, and the UNION is given every opportunity to have input into the decision.
The purpose of these discussions will be to present the COMPANY’S needs for its considered action. The UNION and the COMPANY will then enter into discussions to jointly determine if there are any opportunities available to the Parties that would preclude the need for this action.
Intent to Outsourcing Notification Letter of Understanding
Our existing Letter of Understanding states the Company will "meet with the Union" when considering outsourcing work from "in-house", because of "competitive issues", in order to "explore viable alternatives to outsourcing." The LOU further stated "no work currently being performed in-house by bargaining unit employees will be outsourced unless the Company and Union have met, and the Union is given every opportunity to have input in the decision."
The parties agree that the intent of this language was not to interfere with management's right to assign work amongst its many plant locations; management routinely adjusts the flow of work at and
83
amongst it sites to optimize production, employment, and, ultimately, customer satisfaction.
However, in cases where the Company may desire to move an operation or a product line from one of our union plants to one of our non-union sites and the factor driving that decision is higher costs in the represented plant, the Company will meet with the union first to determine if labor concessions could change that decision.
LETTER OF UNDERSTANDING

2.	Employees who are laid off as a result of the closure will receive one (1) week of severance pay for each one (1) year of service, up to a maximum of ten (10) weeks.

3.
