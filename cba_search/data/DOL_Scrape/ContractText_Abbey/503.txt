ARTICLE II
TERRITORY
1.	The territory covered by this agreement shall include all the franchise territory of the Company.
2.	This agreement shall bind the successors of the Company by merger or consolidation as to the provisions and territory covered by this agreement. For the purpose of preserving and protecting work opportunities and job security for the bargaining unit, it is agreed that:
a.	An absolute precondition to the sale, lease, transfer, or takeover by sale, transfer, lease, assignment, corporate reorganization, receivership, or bankruptcy proceeding of the entire operation or any part thereof is that any purchaser, transferee, lessee, assignee, etc. shall agree and become party to and bound by all the terms, conditions, and obligations of this agreement.
13
b.	Any increased or additional work of a continuing or permanent nature performed at or in conjunction with the Company’s existing facilities or from a transfer of work occasioned by the closing or partial closing of an operation previously covered by this agreement, shall be deemed bargaining unit work and shall be fully covered by the terms, conditions, and obligations of this agreement.
ARTICLE III
RECOGNITION
1<	The parties to this agreement recognize that a strong union with full and active participation on the part of all employees in the bargaining unit is desirable,
2.	The Brotherhood recognizes that the management of the Company, the direction of its working forces, the determination of the number of employees it will employ or retain, the right to hire, suspend, discharge, discipline, promote, demote, or transfer, and the right to release employees because of lack of work or for other proper and legitimate reasons, are vested in and reserved to the Company, subject, however, to the provisions of this agreement and the employees’ right to adjustment of grievances as provided herein. The Company agrees that there shall be no discrimination, interference, restraint, or coercion by the Company, or by any of its agents, on behalf of or against any employee because of the employee’s membership in the Brotherhood or because of any lawful activities on behalf of the Brotherhood.
3.	Foremen and other Supervisory personnel who are not within the bargaining unit shall not perform work of the type and grade performed by represented employees except during emergencies.
ARTICLE IV
UNION SECURITY

On individual written authorizations of members of the Brotherhood, and while such authorizations remain in effect, the Company shall deduct from the wages of such members initiation fees and dues provided for in the constitution and by-laws of the Brotherhood, and shall remit the same within ten (10) days to the Financial Secretary of the Local Union 97, IBEW.
14
2.	When employees covered by this agreement are added to or removed from the payroll or changes in address of such employees are recorded in the Company’s personnel records, the Company shall promptly give notice thereof to the Financial Secretary of the Local Union 97, IBEW.
3.	Employees who are not members of the Brotherhood in good standing shall be barred from employment or from continuance of employment in anyjob classification covered by this agreement, except that employees hired under or transferred to any such job classification shall be permitted a thirty-one (31) day period of service before membership in the Brotherhood becomes mandatory. Any such employee so barred from employment shall not receive any separation allowance or pension from the Company. The Brotherhood reserves the right to discipline its members in accordance with its constitution and by-laws. It is further agreed that the Brotherhood will give the Company and employees concerned thirty (30) days’ written notice of the Brotherhood’s request that any employee be discharged under this paragraph.
4.	Any contract entered into by the Company for construction or maintenance work in its franchise territory shall be let to a contractor, when such a contractor is available, who agrees to employ labor in harmony with the trades, except in those cases where the Company cannot comply because such contract must be awarded to the lowest bidder on specifications prepared by or subject to the approval of a governmental officer, board, commission or authority. Where there has been compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be no delay in the prosecution of any work if a dispute thereafter arises between a contractor and the Brotherhood or the trades.
5.	The use of contractors, when considered, will be in accordance with the “Guidelines for the Use of Contractors” as negotiated between the parties. The Company and the local union 97. IBEW will discuss, in advance, all aspects of workload, man hours and/or overtime requirements in association with Article XVIII of this Labor Agreement.
The intent of the Memorandum of Agreement “Guidelines for the Use of Contractors” is to limit the use of contractors during the term of the Labor Agreement. The result of this understanding will be to provide improved bargaining unit job security and increased upward job opportunities for bargaining unit
15
employees under the Post and Bid Procedure of the Labor Agreement.
The Company will not abolish bargaining unit jobs and hire contractors in a specified work group if it can be shown that a regular ongoing position exists.
ARTICLE V

1.	It is agreed that during the life of this agreement the Brotherhood will not authorize a strike or work stoppage and the Company will not engage in a lockout. The Brotherhood further agrees that it will take every reasonable means within its power to induce employees engaged in a strike or work stoppage to return to work, to keep the Company’s plants in continuous operation and to prevent damage to the Company’s property.
2.	In consideration of the foregoing undertaking of the Brotherhood and of the faithful execution thereof, the Company agrees that it will not bring any action or proceeding against the Brotherhood or any of its agents for damages for breach of this agreement on account of any strike action or work stoppage beyond the Brotherhood’s control.

JOB FLEXIBILITY
A.	Preamble
This agreement between the Brotherhood and the Company regarding the implementation of job flexibility is a commitment of both parties to address the future uncertainties and competitive changes in our utility industry.
Job flexibility is a joint effort to reduce costs, improve customer service, provide job security, and offer opportunities to learn additional job skills while allowing for increased efficiency through job flexibility as outlined herein under the conditions set forth in this article.
Both parties agree and recognize that safety and training are paramount to the successful implementation of work force job flexibility. Employees will be able to be assignedjob tasks of equal, lower rated, or higher rated job classifications commensurate with their skills, training and knowledge of the jobs to be assigned under the provisions of this article.
64
B.	Definitions
1.	Job Flexibility
The ability to perform tasks of other job specifications either as part of an employee’s performance of day-to-day job duties, or as part of a job assignment associated with a specific project, mixed crew and/or as workload demands.
2.	Day-to-DayJob Flexibility
The performance of job tasks of other job specifications performed in association with an employee’s day-to-day job duties and tasks.
3.	Project Job Flexibility
The performance of job tasks of other job specifications performed while assigned responsibilities in another department.
4.	Work Crew Flexibility
The performance of job tasks using employees of varied job specifications as part of a mixed crew.
5.	Job Family
A grouping of job specifications generally recognized to possess a common community of job related tasks and responsibilities.
6.	Work Crew/Work Group
Where the term “work crew” is used it is interchangeable with the term “work group.” Additionally, where the term "chief* is used it is interchangeable with the term “lead person."
7.	Mutual Agreement
Where the term “by mutual agreement” is used it means “agreement between the President/Business Manager of Local Union 97, IBEW or designee and the Company”.
65
C. Understandings:
1.	Attrition
(a)	The Company will not use Job Flexibility as a method to abolish occupied, full-time regular positions. The Company does, however, intend to seek opportunities to accomplish workforce reductions through attrition whenever possible.
(b)	When vacancies arise, the Company will notify Local Union 97, IBEW as to whether the position will be filled or abolished in accordance with the appropriate appendix. The Company may, with mutual agreement, leave vacancies unfilled for extended periods.
(c)	If a layoff becomes necessary, Job Flexibility stops in the department/location where the abolishments occur. The union and management will meet to mutually agree whether Job Flexibility can be restarted. In the event an occupied, full-time regular position is abolished, employees will not flex into or out of the affected department at the specific work location involved unless the position is recreated and filled, or by mutual agreement. Likewise, full Job Flexibility will continue unaffected in other departments at the work location involved.
(d)	It is not intended that Job Flexibility be used to backfill for abolished occupied, regular full-time positions. In the event employees are reassigned from other work locations for the purpose of performing the work of the abolished position job flexibility in or out of the department/location providing the replacement personnel will be suspended until mutually agreed to restart.
(e)	Where the following events occur, resulting in the abolishment of occupied, regular full-time positions, Job Flexibility will continue unaffected and the facts and circumstances will be reviewed in detail with Local Union 97, IBEW in advance of any job abolishments. Local Union 97, IBEW reserves its rights under the labor agreement should it determine the facts and circumstances were misrepresented.
66
IJMunicipalization, opposed by the Company, of any Company franchise territory, plants or facilities.
2)GovernmentaI action or take over, opposed by the Company, which removes functions or services.

2.	Training and Safety
Training and or retraining will be provided to employees in advance of being assigned to perform work which they cannot otherwise perform knowledgeably and safely. Training provided in accordance with the provisions of this article will be developed with the participation and assistance of representatives of the Local Union. Likewise, representatives of Local Union 97, IBEW will participate in the implementation of training programs under this article as appropriate. The safe performance of job tasks assigned under this article is paramount to the company and union. With this mutually shared interest, the proper training of employees to perform new tasks is recognized and its importance stressed as a vital component of job flexibility.
3.	Offer versus assignment during flexing
(a)	With safety as a priority, employees may be assigned work at or below the B level of equal or lower rated job classifications within or out of their job families as outlined in table A of this article. After receiving any necessary additional training, employees may perform tasks above the B level.
67
(b)	Work assignments made under this article for Project or Work Crew job flexibility assignments which are outside of an employee’s home department will be done in the following manner:
l)For work at the B level or below, assignments will be offered by seniority within the affected work group. In the event the company is unable to fill manpower needs through this method, employees will be drafted in inverse order of their company seniority from within the affected group.
2)	In the event operational needs dictate, and the work to be performed is of an unskilled nature, the company may bypass senior employees.
3)In the event the Company is seeking to fill a Project or Work Crew flexibility assignment involving an employee performing a full range of journey level work in the assignment, the Company will offer the assignment by seniority in the affected work group but cannot draft employees. In some situations drafting employees in inverse order of their company seniority may be permitted if the Project or Work Crew flexibility assignment involves performing only certainjourney level tasks and does not require the employee to perform a full range of journey level work.
4.	Seniority bypass due to special skills
In the event that the company cannot honor seniority due to special skills required and the condition persists the company will afford senior employees the necessary training upon request.
5.	Offer by Seniority
The offering of Job Flexibility assignments by seniority is not applicable on day-to-day activities. This includes the incidental performance of journey level tasks of another job classification. Mixed crew and work projects can only be flexed by offering on a seniority basis first, and the company determines the work groups to be flexed.
68
6.	Valuable work experience to be gained
When assignment by seniority is not applicable and work activities provide valuable work experience in other classifications the company may rotate crews upon request.
7.	Initial Implementation
Prior to initial implementation of job flexibility, discussion with the appropriate Union Steward will occur.
8.	Legitimate Fear
In the event an employee expresses, and proves, a legitimate fear of performing tasks assigned under the provisions of this article the company will accommodate the employee’s request by either not assigning the work to the employee or by modifying the assignment. A legitimate inability to perform work assigned under this article will not be held against an employee in the performance of work within the employee’s regular job classification so long as the basis for the legitimate inability does not preclude the employee from performing the essential functions of their classification.
9.	Work Crew/Project Flexibility
The lead worker in the crew will be from the lead department.
10.	Joint Determination of Qualifications
The qualifications of employees assigned under the job flexibility provisions will be jointly determined by the supervisor and crew chief. Should a question or dispute arise as to the qualifications of the employee, the facts and circumstances of the matter will be discussed between the appropriate Union and Management representatives prior to assigning the employee the work.
11.	Flex in - Flex out
The Company will not use the provisions of this article to assign employees out of their home department while backfilling with employees assigned under Job Flexibility from another department, although it may occur on
69
a day-to-day activity basis. Likewise, the Company will not assign employees out of a department if using contractors in the same job classification, work group or department, unless otherwise mutually agreed to.
12.	Contractor impact
One of the objectives of job flexibility is to assist the Company in the reduction or elimination of the use of contractors.
13.	Progression Series
Employees in a bidjob or progression series will not have their time adversely affected if assigned tasks outside their job series. Calculation of employees’ time in grade will include time worked outside their bid job or progression series for the purposes of calculating increases in pay. Employees under these conditions returning to their normal job series will be required to complete the necessary training and/or demonstrate the required abilities prior to being assigned full duties of the next level.
14.	Upgrade prior to flexing
Upgrading will be used in the home department where applicable prior to the use of job flexibility. This will include jobs in the progression scries.
15.	Upgrading
Employees performing tasks of a higher rated job classification under job flexibility outside of their job series, will be upgraded to the appropriate rate on an hour for hour basis up to four (4) hours, after which Article XI, paragraph 5 applies. Except for the last six (6) months of each progression step, employees in a progression series will be upgraded in accordance with Article XI, paragraph 5, when performing work of a higher level in their series.
16.	Promotion/Demolion
Job experience gained through the performance of tasks assigned under job flexibility will be recognized, considered and applied in determining an employee’s qualifications, skills and experience for the awarding of
70
positions under the post and bid procedures and demotion procedures of the labor agreement. In the event an employee’s experience gained reflects a major portion of that classifications work the experience gained will be counted in determining the level at which the job is awarded.
17.	Overtime
In situations involving the assignment of employees under the provisions of job flexibility, employees in the affected job classification of the home department will have first opportunity for overtime. Issues involving unexpected overtime occurring at the end of the workday will be reviewed and resolved locally.
18,	Call Outs
Call Out practices are not affected by job flexibility.
19.	Higher level and ChiePs Jobs
The Company does not intend to specifically target higher level jobs or Chief s jobs for elimination.
20.	Qualifying Crews
Employees flexing under this article will not fully qualify a crew. On a task-by-task basis in instances where an employee is flexing into a department, and is trained and qualified, the employee may qualify the crew to perform that task.
21.	Departmental Core Work
Employees will typically perform the core work associated with their job specification. Likewise, it is understood that job flexibility will routinely allow for work outside the employee’s normal job but not to the extent that an employee no longer performs their traditional work.
22.	Post & Bid vs. Job Flex

COMPETITIVE OPPORTUNITIES
The terms and conditions of the Labor Agreement will apply to work currently performed for regulated customers within the franchise territory. When new work is identified within the franchise territory, Local Union 97, IBEW will be afforded, on a preferential basis, the first opportunity to develop a proposal which will meet cusr tomers’ requirements in a competitive manner. If an agreement cannot be reached, other options, including contractors, may be used. When work is developed for customers outside the franchise territory, Local Union 97. IBEW may be asked to submit a proposal.
ARTICLE XXVIII
WORK PRACTICES
1.	Four 10-Hour Days:
The implementation of ten (10) hour work day schedules for all employees in compliance with the definition of day (Monday through Friday) and scheduled (Monday through Saturday) workers in Article VI of the Labor Agreement including Notes 1, 2,3, 4 and 5 and the day workers included in Note 6 of Schedule A is as follows:
(a)	Work schedules will be implemented using four consecutive, ten (10) hour work days where there is a practical application. For example, where five day coverage (internal support or customer service) is critical, a sufficient number of employees and supervisors at a location or in a department must be present in order for it to be practical to implement four 10-hour days. For example, a one crew line facility is not practical; a two crew facility may or may not be, depending on location and size of crews. Management shall determine the economic and practical applications of four - tens, and will strive to do so in a fair and equitable manner. Ail work hours will be paid at the employee’s straight time base hourly rate.
(b)	Field Personnel
Four tens need not be offered to every crew or classification in a work group, however, four tens will be assigned by seniority of the chief. Where four tens are applied to field crews, this work schedule will be used during the construction season
77
(May 15 - Oct. 15) unless modified by mutual agreement. If the company terminates the four ten-hour schedule and returns to five eight-hour schedule, a mutual agreement with the union is required to reinstate a four ten-hour schedule during that construction season.
(q) All Other Non-Field Personnel
Four ten hour schedules may be assigned to any number of employees within a work group by seniority. If the company terminates the four ten-hour schedule and returns to a five eighthour schedule within a calendar year, a mutual agreement with the union is required to reinstate a four ten-hour schedule during the calendar year.
(d) Any time worked in excess of ten (10) hours per day will be paid at the rate of time and one half the employee’s base hourly rate. For example, the eleven th through sixteenth hours will be at time and one-half. Hours beyond sixteen will be paid at double time.
(a) Employees working ten (10) hour schedules will be ineligible for overtime meals or meal stipends. Employees working in excess of ten (10) hours will be eligible for overtime meal stipends.
(f)	During work weeks which include a company holiday, the company will reschedule affected employees to five, eight (8) hour days for that work week.
(g)	Employees working a ten (10) hour day will have their vacation leave converted to their hour equivalent and will be available to use on that basis. When using vacation leave, the employee will be charged ten (10) hours of vacation leave for each vacation day taken.
(h)	Employees on disability leave will be paid ten (10) hours of pay for each work day absent. Absences in excess of 40 hours will convert to the second week of absence in accordance with the labor agreement.
(i)	Floating holiday benefits will be converted to their hour equivalent and will be available to employees to be used on that basis. Employees working a ten (10) hour day and who take a floating holiday will be charged ten (10) hours for the day.
78
Q) Consistent with the labor agreement, Sunday will be considered the second day of rest. All other scheduled off days will be considered to be the employee’s first day of rest.
(kJ Lunch periods for field workers will be paid twenty minute periods (brown bag concepts) and will be included in the ten hour day. Lunch periods for clerical workers will be an unpaid thirty minutes unless modified by local mutual agreement.
(1)	Starting time for day workers will be in accordance with the labor agreement.
2-	Inclement Weather Guidelines:
During periods of inclement weather; (1) workers will reduce the number of inclement weather days by performing work that is generally accepted to be suitable for construction work; (2) management will assess the needs of its workforce for training and safety program compliance and have the training material ready in advance; and (3) workers will continue to perform tasks such as housekeeping, tool repair, and vehicle preparation. Definitions will be used which the crew chief can interpret at the job site to determine if the weather is unsuitable for normal work.
Local management and Union representatives will jointly review the current skills of the workforce needed to safety perform its normal work function as well as those additional duties specified by the job flexibility memorandum pertaining to each work group. Those reviews will be translated into prioritized lists of topics to be presented when the weather is unsuitable for normal work. Materials, meeting facilities, and personnel will be made available to present information addressing the topics identified by the assessment.
Any of three conditions will determine that an inclement weather condition exists:
(a)	The temperature is less than 0 degrees Fahrenheit.
(b)	Snow is falling at a rate greater than that defined by the Weather Bureau as “light”. “Light” snowfall is defined as a condition with visibility being greater than 1100 yards. As a guideline to determine the visibility in the vicinity of a job site, the crew chief shall select an object such as a road sign or building near the road and drive 0,7 miles. If the selected object is visible when
79
standing outside the vehicle, the weather is deemed suitable for normal work.
(c)	Rain is falling at a rate greater than that defined by the Weather Bureau as ‘'light”. “Light” is defined as taking more than two minutes to cause pavement or any other similarly dry surface to become completely wet. As a guideline to determine whether rainfall is too heavy to perform normal work, the crew chief shall place a dry board at least twelve inches on a side on a fairly level surface. If it takes more than two minutes for the board to become completely wet, the weather is deemed suitable for normal work.
The crew chief is solely responsible for applying the above criteria. The Company will not subject a crew chief to any disciplinary action as a result of those interpretations. Any concerns with the use of these criteria which are not resolved locally should be referred to the leadership of Local Union 97. IBEW and management representatives.
3-	Onsite Reporting (Field Personnel);
The On-Site Reporting Project Planning Worksheet will be utilized to define the project, scope, crew size, crew augmentation, start and end date and economic justification.
For designated capital and/or maintenance projects three (3) days or longer with a maximum of six weeks unless otherwise mutually agreed to, workers will report to the Niagara Mohawk project site. Job continuity may require a two (2) week extension of the above limitation without mutual agreement. Employees will be ready to start work at the beginning of the period for which the employees will be paid. Sanitary and drinking water facilities will be readily available at locations previously arranged by the Company (e.g,, restaurants, fire departments, portable facilities).
A project is defined as an activity or set of continuous activities defined by a common work scope with an identified start and end date.
The intent of on-site reporting is for full crews, as they normally operate, however, if other job classifications are required to on-site to augment these crews, they will be dedicated to the project.
80
Mileage payments will be made according to Internal Revenue Service announcements for distances determined by the road miles from the normal work headquarters, or home whichever is less, to the project site. Total miles driven (both ways) will be paid.
If the distance from the normal work headquarters to the job site is greater than 45 road miles, either the cost of a single room or daily mileage will be paid. Any additional fees or tails incurred will be reimbursed by the company.
These employees will be returned to the call-out list of their normal work headquarters on weekends, holidays or when assigned to a project that does not include prearranged overtime. For onsite in excess of twenty-five miles, employees will have the option of using a company vehicle, if available.
£ Lunch Breaks (Field Personnel):
During the construction season, the lunch period will be taken as a twenty (20) minute paid lunch period (brown bag concept) between the hour of 12 noon to 1:00 p.m. at the job site and will be included in the ten (10) hour or eight (8) hour days. Starting time for day workers will be in accordance with the labor agreement.
5. Coffee Break (Field Personnel):
There will be one fifteen-minute break taken on the job site mid-morning. On a local basis, by mutual agreement, this practice can be modified (e.g. report to work 15 minutes later or take break at headquarters during first 15 minutes).
However, if any employee or crew is sent out to work before or during their break, they will be entitled to a fifteen minute break on the road.
A mid-afternoon fifteen-minute coffee break will also be taken at the job site when employees are scheduled to work four ten-hour days.
End of Day Wash-Up Time (Field Personnel);
Wash up time at the end of the day will be on the employee's own time. This is applicable all year round.
2- Construction Season:
The construction season will generally run from May 15 -
Bl
October 15. Modifications may occur after discussions with the President/Business Manager of Local Union 97, IBEW or designee regarding safety concerns involving traveling to the job site in the winter months and the necessity of performing specific jobs in the winter months. Such modifications would require mutual agreement.
Seasonal Employees:
Up to 25 Collection Representatives A & B will be utilized as seasonal workers with the understanding that other current seasonal positions will be eliminated by December 31, 2001. After December 31, 2001, the use of seasonal workers in other classifications will require mutual agreement.
82
ARTICLE XXIX TERM OF AGREEMENT
This agreement shall take effect as of June 1. 2001 and on that day shall supersede all previous agreements between the Company and Local Union 97, IBEW, and shah remain in full force and effect until September 30, 2004 and shall automatically renew itself from year to year thereafter unless either party notifies the other in writing, at least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration date, of a desire to amend or terminate the same.

APPENDIX A-I
WESTERN DIVISION SENIORITY PROVISIONS PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE GROUP
A.	Seniority Status
I.	The Company shall furnish the Brotherhood rosters of represented employees revised from time to time which indicate the job and/or Company seniority of each employee.
2.	Company seniority is as defined in Article VI, Paragraph 14.
3.	Job seniority of a regular employee is the total length of service in a particular type and grade of work in a particular department or sub-department, including length of service in any higher rated job in the natural line of promotion or as determined by prior mutual agreement for particular individuals while continuing in the job series held by them prior to June 1, 1966.
(a) An employee’s job seniority transcends the job seniority of all other employees in the lower rated jobs shown in the employee’s particular department or sub-department.
B.	Promotions
I.	In all cases of promotion, the following factors shall be considered.
(a)	Company seniority except as specifically provided in A-3 of this Appendix.
(b)	Knowledge of, application to and training for the job, ability, skill and experience on olherjobs.
(c)	Physical fitness for the job. If factors (b) and (c) are relatively equal, factor (a) shall govern.
2.	Transcending seniority unless modified by mutual agreement will be as follows:
(a)	The seniority rights of an employee demoted prior to June 1, 1975 and occupying a demoted position because of a prior curtailment of departmental activities shall transcend the seniority rights of other employees when a vacancy occurs in any higher rated job formerly held by the demoted employee in the employee’s former department.
H5
(b)	The seniority rights of an employee demoted after une I, 1975 and occupying a demoted position because of prior curtailment of activities shall transcend the seniority rights of other employees when a vacancy occurs in any higher rated job classification formerly held by the demoted employee within the Division.
3.	Post and Bid
(a)	Job vacancy postings shall be for seven (7) days, Wednesday through Tuesday. The Company shall post the notice of job vacancy on bulletin boards throughout the division at the work headquarters of the employees covered hereby. After a job is posted it will not be withdrawn unless mutually agreed to.
(b)	Except for vacancies to be filled by job seniority, all vacancies shall be posted for a period of seven (7) days throughout the Division. Bids submitted will consider regular employees of the Western Division P&M and TOC (including laid off employees on the preferential rehiring list) in order of their company seniority. Employees not on regular status are not eligible bidders, but they may use the standard bid form to express their interest in vacancies. There is no obligation on the Company to consider such employees, whether or not there are regular bidders.
If there is no qualified bidder, the vacancy may then be filled by outside hiring. After a job is posted, it will not be withdrawn unless mutually agreed to.
(c)	After June 1, 1966, an employee awarded a job under this Post and Bid Procedure will have an asterisk placed after their name on their occupational group seniority list. When an employee with an asterisk after their name acquires senior position on their occupational group seniority list, the next vacancy above will be posted,
(d)	Stewards may submit bids for employees who are absent during the posting period.
(e)	The Company shall make every effort to interview and award all jobs within a reasonable period of time after publication ofjob Summary Sheet.
(f)	The starting job in a progression series will be the one posted. Employees qualified for a higher grade may receive
116
the award to which they are otherwise entitled in whatever grade they are qualified for, up to but not beyond the highest grade to which the progression applies. Exceptions to this rule may occur in new positions which the Company specifically desires to fill in the new starting grade. They will be so marked on the posting.
(g)	If, after promotion, a regular employee is found within six (6) months to be unsuited for the duties of the new position, the employee shall be returned to their former job, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon and in any event without loss of seniority.
(h)	When an employee is awarded a job under this procedure, the transfer to the new job will be effected within not more than three (3) weeks from the date of the award barring unusual or unforeseen events. The rate for the new job and seniority in a progression series will become effective not later than three (3) weeks from the date of the aw'ard.

C.	Demotions, Layoffs and Terminations
1.	Demotions resulting from curtailment of activities or reemployment of military personnel upon termination of military leave of absence shall be made after it has been determined by the Company that a demotion or layoff is necessary. Any reassignment of personnel shall, unless modified by mutual agreement, be on the basis of Company seniority, except that for employees with job seniority on the occupational group seniority lists, the selection of employees will be based on job seniority as defined in Section A-3 of this Appendix. This does not preclude P&M employees from displacing TOC employees.
(a)	If it does not adversely affect the Company’s need for qualified employees in the available job, employees may displace other employees with lesser Company seniority in equally rated jobs (same pay group) or successively lower rated jobs for which they are qualified or reasonably trainable in the inverse order of their Company seniority.
117
(b)	It is understood that this section shall not preclude bumping into an automatic progression series if the employee can qualify at the level of the employee being bumped.
(c)	A displaced employee may also displace a less senior higher rated employee if they previously held that job classification.
(d)	Any employee who is demoted three (3) or more pay groups may elect to take a separation allowance rather than accept transfer to the lower grade of work. If the employee accepts the separation allowance, it will be computed under the terms, conditions and limitations of the Separation Allowance Plan on the basis of the wage rate then applicable to the job from which the employee is demoted. An employee who elects to take a separation allowance in lieu of transfer to another job in the same geographical area will not be on the preferential rehiring list, and if subsequently rehired, wil] be hired as a new’ employee.
Employees unable to obtain a position in their own geographic area are not precluded from being placed on the preferential rehire list.
2.	Unless modified by mutual agreement, layoffs shall be made after employees have been demoted under the provisions of Section C, Paragraph 1, in the inverse order of Company seniority.
3.	When as a result of changing Company operations, it is necessary to consolidate existing seniority lists, the lists will be consolidated by applicable Company or Job seniority as defined in Section A of this Appendix.
(a)	In the event of employees having identical job seniority dates, the employee with the longest Company seniority shall be placed highest on the consolidated lists.
(b)	In the event of employees having identical Company seniority dates, the employee with the lowest employee number shall be considered senior.
D.	Rehiring
1.	Former regular employees who have been laid off shall for a period of two (2) years from the layoff date be considered for reemployment in the Company in order of Company seniority as of the layoff date. If the layoff period does not exceed two (2)
H8
years, reemployment will be as a regular employee with seniority status for the purpose of their contract rights only (not pension rights) deemed to be the same as if employment had not been interrupted. If the layoff period exceeds two (2) years, the employee will not have their former seniority rights restored to them and will be considered a new employee.
2,	Former temporary and probationary employees, if rehired, will be considered as new employees.
3.	When a former employee is offered employment of substantially the same type and grade of work in the same geographical area as that performed by the employee prior to the layoff and the employee refuses to accept it, there is no further obligation on the part of the Company to offer any other employment at a future date.
4.	When a former regular employee accepts reemployment, the Company may require a physical examination looking to such reemployment, and if the employee appears to be in substantially the same physical condition as when the employee last left the employ of the Company, there will be no bar to reemployment upon physical grounds.
5.	An employee shall be considered on the preferential re hiring list for a period of two (2) years from the layoff date.

125
8.	In case there are no bidders, the Company will discuss the filling of the vacancy with the President/Business Manager of Local Union 97, IBEW or designee before hiring a new employee.

When an employee is awarded a job under this procedure, the transfer to the new job will be effected within not more than three (3) weeks from the date of the award barring unusual or unforseen events. The rate for the new job and seniority in a progression series will become effective not later than three (3) weeks from the date of the award.

C.	Demotions and Layoffs
1.	The Company shall determine whether a reduction in the work force in the Division is necessary. The selection of
126
employees affected by a reduction in the work force shall be in the inverse order of their Company seniority unless otherwise mutually agreed.
2,	Employees with less than ten (10) years seniority whose specific jobs are abolished, who are bumped from their positions, or displaced by the Company for the purpose of placing employees eligible for security' clause benefits, will be afforded the fob lowing options:
(a)	Employees may bump back to their last prior regularjob classification, first by their former work headquarters, then by geographical area in which they held the position if they are senior to the incumbent. If the incumbent is senior in this position, employees may then look back to their next to last previous regular job first by former work headquarters, then by geographic area, and so on until they are able to bump a junior employee. (Employees are required to displace the first junior employee they are able to bump) or;
(b)	Employees may bump a junior employee in a regular position in their own presentjob classification in the following sequence:
1.	The junior employee in their current work headquarters
2.	The junior employee in a work headquarters in their geographic area
3.	The junior employee in a work headquarters in their division
Note: For the purposes of this Appendix, geographic area is described as;
a.	Mohawk Valley Area
b.	Potsdam Area
c.	Syracuse/Oswego Area
d.	Watertown Area
Under the provisions of Paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) of this section, employees may bump junior employees holding higher rated jobs in a progression series but shall enter the series at the level which they last held in that series. In addition, unless previously held, employees will be excluded from bumping into the Line Mechanic HS position.
127
3.	(a) Employees who are unable to place themselves
through the bumping procedure above will be assigned by the Company on a seniority basis to the positions occupied byjunior employees for which they meet the job qualifications, including the starting level of a progression series. To the extent practicable, the Company will recognize seniority when making placements with the intent of minimizing any reduction in pay and location changes. Employees will not be assigned to a position that results in an immediate pay increase but may be assigned to a progression series that ultimately results in a higher pay level.
(b)	Employees unable to obtain a position in their own geographic area either through the bumping or placement process will be eligible to be placed on the rehire list.
(c)	At the completion of the bump and placement pi occss, the number of employees in excess of the number needed for the operation of the Company shall be laid off.
4.	Any employee who is demoted three (3) or more pay groups may elect to take a separation allowance rather than accept demotion under these provisions to a lower grade of work. If the employee accepts the separation allowance, it will be computed under the terms, conditions and limitations of the Separation Allowance Plan on the basis of the wage rate then applicable to the job from which the employee is demoted. An employee who elects to take a separation allowance in lieu of a demotion to another job in the same geographic area, will not be on the preferential rehiring list, and if subsequently rehired, will be hired as a new employee.
5.	A regular employee who has been demoted to work of the same grade or of a lower grade shall have preferential seniority rights within the local union over other employees for the job from which the employee teas demoted or for a lower job in that series of jobs until the original vacancy becomes available without surrendering the original preferential seniority rights. Such transcending seniority rights shall also apply to employees assigned positions under the provisions of Article XI, Paragraph 12(a) including employees who reach their former rate. Such transcending seniority rights shall not accrue to employees who subsequently bid other jobs, who are returned to their former jobs after temporary promotion, or are demoted after unsuccessful trial in a higher rated job, nor to employees who are demoted at their own
128
request. This preferential consideration does not transcend the seniority rights of employees who have returned to their former jobs after having been on leave of absence for military service.
D.	Transfers
The Company may, at it’s discretion, transfer employees up to 35 miles from the employee’s current work location or residence. When it becomes necessary for the Company to transfer an employee or employees from one locality or plant to another, or to newly-built facilities without expanding the work force, employees whose position is being transferred by the Company in the affected location will be first offered the opportunity to transfer to the new location. In the event that any affected employee (s) do not accept the transfer, the following process will be used:
H The Company shall first offer and assign the transfer to qualified employees who currently hold the type and level of position in the local department being transferred by the Company, The offering and assignment will be made in order of employees’ company seniority.
2} If positions remain unfilled, the Company shall then assign the transfer to qualified employees who currently hold the type and level of position in the local department being transferred by the Company. Such assignments will be made in inverse order of the employees’ company seniority.
21 Subsequent vacancies within the local department will be filled by the Company by assigning the employees in the affected location within the department in order of their company seniority,
£. Rehiring
1.	Former regular employees who have been laid off shall for a period of two (2) years from the layoff date, be considered for reemployment in their geographic area first, and the division second in accordance with their company seniority as of the layoff date. Regular employees who have been laid off, will be given preference before any new applicants are considered for a new job. If the layoff period does not exceed two (2) years, the employee’s seniority status, upon reemployment for the purpose of their contract rights only (not pension rights) shall be deemed to be the same as if their employment had not been interrupted.
129
2.	Former temporary and probationary employees, if rehired, will be considered as new employees.
8.	When a former regular employee is offered employment of substantially the same type and grade of work in a regular position in the same geographic area as that performed by the employee prior to layoff and the employee does not accept it, there is no further obligation on the part of the Company to offer any other employment at a future date.
4.	When a former regular employee accepts reemployment, the Company may require a physical examination looking to such reemployment, and if the employee appears to be in substantially the same physical condition as when the employee last left the employ of the Company, and the employee is physically able to perform the duties of the position being filled, there will be no bar to reemployment upon physical grounds.
5.	When a regular employee is granted two or more successive leaves of absence, totaling a continuous period of six months or more, that portion of the leave of absence extending beyond six months shall be deducted in computing length of service, unless the leaves of absence were granted because of the personal disability of the employee or their military service.
F. Temporary Partial Upgrading
Whenever a Technical, Office and Clerical employee is temporarily assigned to perform some of, but not all of, the duties of a higher paid job, their rate of pay will be adjusted for the duration of such work. If the difference in pay is less than four (4) pay groups, the employee shall be paid the_rate for the higher paid job as shown in Schedule A. If the difference in pay is four (4) pay groups or more, the increase in pay shall be determined by mutual agreement between the parties at the local level. This provision shall not apply in those cases where an employee’s job specification indicates the requirement to direct the activities of other employees during the absence of a supervisor or other higher rated employee.
<4. Stewards

3.	Guidelines for the Use of Contractors
Management has agreed to limit the use of contractors on Niagara Mohawk, property.
The IBEW believes that the use of contractors inevitably leads to replacement of Niagara Mohawk union labor with contract labor, causing the loss of both positions and overtime potential.
Management believes that the flexibility to contract is necessary to conduct its business in a competitive manner.
Both parties recognize that steadily increasing competition has created increasing pressure on the Company to control rising customer costs.
For its part, the IBEW has indicated a willingness to work with the Company to control costs. But it maintains that contracting is not a solution. The IBEW contends that issues such as quality and work force morale create “hidden costs” that ultimately exceed any short-term savings associated with contracting. Both parties agree that some level of contracting is required to deal with legitimate peak manpower requirements; emergency situations; and to meet unusual skill requirements.
The following guidelines for the use of contractors provide for the use of contract labor in a manner that meets the interest of both the management and the IBEW.
A.	Joint Interpretation of Article IV, Section 5
1.	The use of the word “limit” as used in Article IV, Section 5, Paragraph 2, is understood by the parties to mean; the controlled use of contractors with the intent to maximize the use of in-house personnel.
2.	The use of the term “specific work group" as used in Article IV, Section 5, Paragraph 3, and elsewhere, is understood by the parties to mean:
a.	In the Western Division - location and department
b.	In the Central Division - local union and district department
c.	In the Eastern Division - local union and district department
154
3.	Article IV, Section 5, 3rd Paragraph, in its entirety is clarified by the following:
a.	In the event of a reduction of the work force, the Company will not eliminate bargaining unit jobs and replace those jobs with contractors.
b.	If workload materializes that has a defined scope and duration less than or equal to one year, the use of temporary positions, overtime, work sharing, etc. will be explored before the consideration of contractors.
c.	If continuing long-term (greater than one year) workload materializes, the posting of jobs will be considered in good faith.
d.	No employee will be laid off or suffer loss of straight-time pay as a result of contracting in that specific work group.
B,	Analyzing the Need for Contractors
The ingredients for analyzing the need for contractors include the following:
1.	Supporting documentation that compares in-house work force capacity (includingscheduled overtime) with work load forecasts, identifying relative variances and include the following:
a.	Work schedule windows
b.	Net availability of in-house work force
c.	Ability of in-house work force qualifications
d.	In-house work force qualifications e. in-house work force priorities f. Overtime use;
If the Company contracts work that is normally done by represented employees, the Company must offer a mutually agreeable amount of overtime as determined in good faith in the affected specific work group while sustaining mutually agreed upon productivity levels. Emergency response will be a consideration in the good faith discussions.
2.	When cost is included as part of the Company’s justification for the use of contractors, the following information will also be included in the analysis:
155
a. Project cost comparison between in-house work force and contractors.
i.	All contractor cost comparisons will include fully loaded NMPC costs including NM Inspection and administration costs.
ii.	IBEW leadership will be provided all information regarding the con tractor/bid award process, final project cost figures and contractor performance evaluations in advance of meetings.
3.	In order to facilitate the effective communication of cost information associated with 2(b) above, a joint committee will be formed to develop a method of comparing in-house vs, contractor costs with all information to be shared with the Brotherhood.
C.	Inspection and Evaluation of the Performance of Contractors
1.	At the conclusion of each contract initiated under this Memorandum of Understanding, the parties involved in the original good faith meeting will meet to review contractor performance. Contractor performance will be evaluated in regard to compliance with Company standards, total cost, and overall job quality. The contractor evaluation form will be reviewed and given to the local union representative at that time.
D.	Notifications
1.	Following the conclusion of the good faith meeting, the Union will be formally notified and provided by the appropriate system, divisional or regional department head, with a listing of projects discussed, for which contractors will be used. This notification will include the reasons why union alternatives, if submitted, were or were not adopted.

7.	Memorandum Regarding the Rubber Glove Method to be used on 15kV or below
Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and Local Union 97 have agreed to utilize the rubber gloving method on voltages up to 15kV subject to the conditions set forth below. The Joint Committee prior to commencing work utilizing the rubber glove method up tp 15kV will hold meetings, with appropriate members of the Union committee present, who participated in the crafting of this Agreement. The purpose of these meetings is to relate the intent of and sincere commitment under which this Agreement was reached. These meetings are intended to convey the cooperation, understanding of assignments, consideration of safety, and assure an amicable transition into the rubber glove work procedure.
*	Current practices with regard to 5kV class rubber glove methods will continue.
•	The Joint Committee formed to institute policies and work practices will initiate a training program to introduce rubber gloving on NMPC property. The training will be administered to all hot stick line department personnel including supervision, throughout the company. This is paramount to both the introduction and utilization of rubber gloving up to 15kV on Niagara Mohawk’s property. The training will be included in all future progression schools. Additionally, the Joint Committee will visit other utilities, jointly selected, and meet with appropriate personnel to discuss their transition to rubber gloving above 5kV and their procedures and practices.
•	A transitional period consisting of 12 months from the completion of gloving training will be instituted. During this transitional period, only single phase 7.6kV class voltage will be rubber gloved while 5kV single phase and 3 phase work will continue. After the transitional period, work will commence on the system up to 15kV, to include 3 phase configuration, within the confines of this Agreement.
•	There will be no use of the rubber glove method on voltages above 5kV after sundown.
174
•	If an issue arises in the field that requires a decision rubber glove or to use other methods, the crew chief w— have the authority to decide whether to glove or not. it is decided that rubber gloving would not be appropr-ate, the Chief in the field mil determine whether to h<_ stick the work or to de-energize.
•	Work on energized conductors above 5kV will be performed from insulated aerial devices, bucket trucks only.
*	Upon request by the crew in the field, the necessary auto reclosers'will be placed in -non-automatic".
•	The Joint Committee will get assistance from appropriate company personnel who will assist with the development of design configuration that will be conducive to the rubber glove method.
The company recognizes and will include in the Safety rules and procedures relating up to 15kV energized work that a crew has the right to refuse to perform any job at any time, if they believe that is a threat to their life or limbs. The Chief will be provided extra help at anytime, and will not be refused. Upon refusal to perform a job under this provision, no other crew will be assigned until the Company has reviewed thejob with the crew to determine the facts relating to the refusal. Prior to any reassignment of this job, the union shall be notified. Any dispute regarding the implementation and/or administration of this Agreement will be referred to this Joint Committee,
During the term of this Agreement or any extension thereof, the Company wall not make any changes to the above without first negotiating such changes with IBEW Local Union 97.
Genera] Statement of Rules and Training Procedures for Gloving Voltages above 5kV up to and Including the 15kV Class
Protective Equipment:
•	The word “shall" has been used many times herein and it is interpreted to mean that the practice is to be followed at all times.
*	All protective equipment will be selected and used as specified in these rules. These rules are to be used as a
175
supplement to the Company Safety Manual and Accident Prevention Rules. The rules and procedures apply only to personnel when working with rubber gloves and sleeves on conductors and equipment energized at voltage above 5kV. These rules and procedures were developed for gloving above 5kV and are intended for use by line personnel performing line work only. The chief, super visor and personnel actually doing the work “shall" be held responsible for the enforcement of these rules.
•	Work shall be performed by three methods:
1.	Gloves from insulated bucket trucks.
2.	Live line tools.
3.	De-energized and grounded.
It is understood that whenever the term “gloves" is used, it shall mean both gloves and sleeves.
Working Conditions and Rubber Gloving
•	The minimum crew to perform work with rubber gloves on electric lines carrying a nominal voltage of the 15kV class shall consist of two (2) qualified H.S. Line Mechanics, one of which must be a Working Chief Line Mechanic H.S. or a minimum of two (2) trained Hot Sticks, one (1) upgraded to Chief.
*	After the transitional period it is understood that the rubber glove method may be used on three phase configuration within the confines of this Agreement. It is also understood that the Chief in the field has control over how these functions will be performed. Issues that need resolution will be referred to the joint Committee co-chairs for resolution.
♦	Work on energized 5kV to 15kV conductors and equipment shall only be performed by employees wearing Class 2 rubber gloves and sleeves and working at all times only from an approved insulated bucket truck.
♦	All energized conductors or equipment within reaching distance shall be covered with approved protective equipment or floated free from the pole except those parts which are actually being worked on.
176
When work is performed on energized 5kV to 15kV class primary conductors, or other conductors, neutral grounds and potential grounds including the cross arms and pole head within reaching distance shall be covered with approved protective equipment. Also all grounded members such as secondaries, neutral conductors, guy wires, telephone wires or cables within reaching distance of the employee shall be covered with approved protective equipment utilizing the insulate and isolate method.
When work is being performed on energized conductors of the 5kV to 15kV class and more than one person is working on the same pole or structure, the work shall be confined to only one phase of a circuit at a time and to one work location unless it is a coordinated job involving more than one structure.
The job shall be so coordinated that the workers are safeguarded from unexpected changes in clearances due to the moving of conductors or equipment. If clearance changes are to be made, the work shall stop until the changes are made and all personnel on the job are completely made aware of these changes.
When working from an aerial device, accident preven tion rules that are presently in place regarding safety harnesses, and snapping in procedures, will be followed. Line Mechanics SHALL attach their safety lanyard to the attachment provided for that purpose and shall keep their feet on the floor of the aerial bucket at all times.
Pole top and bucket rescue training shall be provided once everjr six (6) months. When an existing live circuit is to be reconductored and the new conductor is to be pulled on the same arm only one conductor at a time shall be run in and temporarily deadened before the installation of the next conductor is started. Conductors should be installed under tension.
Company-owned facilities maybe floated clear of the pole when possible when work is being performed on or near energized conductors. A ground bond to the neutral conductor may be temporarily removed after ajumper has been placed between the neutral and the pole ground.
177
esting and Equipment:
Rubber Gloves and Sleeves:
*	Rubber gloves and sleeves shall be tested after three (3) months of in-service use, numbered and assigned to the individual lineman. They will be returned to the Line Mechanic after each test. Gloves will be tested more often upon request. No gloves without being retested can be stored for more than six (6) months. The test shall be a 20k V AC or 50kV DC test for three (3) minutes or shall comply with OSHA and ANSI standards. The more stringent shah apply. Each truck will be assigned a pair of rubber gloves and sleeves as replacement spares.
Class 0 Rubber Gloves:
♦	Class 0 rubber gloves that are issued to line department personnel will be tested on a four (4) month interval.
Rubber Blankets:
*	The policy presently in place for testing rubber blankets will remain.
Jumpers:
•	15kV jumpers without load pickup heads can be used. No "pickup’ jumpers will be used above 5kV for any application. All jumpers shall be considered uninsulated. If the jumper cable cannot be isolated so there is not a possibility of contact with personnel, other conductors, poles, cross arms, or hardware, the jumper cable must be covered with line hose or blankets in the same manner as other conductors would normally be covered. All jumpers will be tested according to the present policy.

During storm conditions in Niagara Mohawk’s service territory, line crews will be assigned consistent with normal working conditions and in accordance with this agreement as two-person crews.
11.	It will be the responsibility of the Management of the Company to see that all Line Mechanics are thoroughly trained. If at any time the Brotherhood feels that there is neglect on the Company’s part in providing this training, the Brotherhood will notify the company and the parties will discuss and take measures to ensure that adequate training is provided.
12.	The parties recognize and acknowledge that the plan to introduce two-person line crews on Niagara Mohawk property will not be a cause for a reduction in Line Mechanics. The Company
189
has the ability to increase the number of two-person crews from time to time. Any increase in the number of two-person line crews will not result in the relocation of filled line mechanic positions at any given location and will not result in an increase in the number of contractors hired to do distribution or transmission line work.
13.	The parties recognize the importance for an agreed upon Rescue Procedure in regards to two-person line crews (bucket rescue). Should an issue arise it will be referred to the Joint System Safety Committee for expeditious review and reported to Local Union 97, IBEW. The parties have agreed on the ARDS Rescue System as a viable rescue procedure for two-person crews (one person on a pole).

ATTACHMENT 1
(Memorandum Regarding Two-Person Line Crew)
As a result of this Agreement, the following commitments were made relative to service crews:
Syracuse Area
Service crews presently exist as three-person crews at Fulton Street (three crews) and at Towpath (one crew), These crews are assigned normally overhead and underground service removals, installations and/or replacements. The Company intends to continue these assignments for these crews.
It is further understood that these service crews will retain three men per truck for three years regardless of the number of vacancies that occur. At the end of three years, as vacancies occur on a truck-by-truck basis, it will be incumbent on the Company to exercise one of the following options:
A.	Reduce the crew size from three-person to two-person after discussion with the Local Union involved; or
B.	Fill the vacancy on that particular crew.
When exercising Option A for the purpose of forming additional two-person crews above the number stated in Attachment I, the Company can only draw from vacancies on the four service crews or by adding a new position to the department.
If Option B is followed and subsequent vacancies occur on that particular truck, before the Company can use that vacancy to create an additional two-man crew, it will require mutual agreement with the Local Union involved.
Oswego Area
Service crews presently exist as two-person crews in Oswego, Volney and Pulaski, These crews will remain as presently administered.
Watertown Area
Presently there are three (3) person service crews in this local. These crews will be a part of the three (3) person crew complement, will continue to be staffed as three (3) person crews and perform the duties they have been assigned in the past. The procedure for filling vacancies on these crews will continue as in the past.
191
Potsdam Area
Service crews presently exist in this local. There are three two (2) person crews and two three (3) person crews. It is understood that these three (3) person crews will go to two (2) person crews through attrition.
The present procedure of how these crews are filled and the work assignments will continue.
Western Division
Southwest and Genesee Region
These crews are presently two-person crews and the procedure for filling vacancies and the type of work assigned will be continued and in accordance with the Two-Man Crew Agreement.
Frontier and Niagara Region
These crews are three (3) person crews and perform line functions along with service installation, removals and/or renewals.
The procedure for filling vacancies on these crews will remain as presently administered. Should it be decided to reduce these crews to two-person crews, such move will be through attrition and will be discussed with the Union. These moves would be a part of the staffing ratio and would not be for the purpose of reducing line mechanics.
