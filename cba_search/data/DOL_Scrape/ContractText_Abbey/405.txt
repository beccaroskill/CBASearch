3	Effective Date of Progression Increase
When an employee completes a period of service entitling the employee to a wage increase, such wage increase will be effective on the first day of the week in which such period of service is completed.
4	General Wage Schedule Increases
The increases in the wage schedules set forth below shall be computed on an exponential basis. Hourly Wage Schedules shall be rounded to the nearest penny. Weekly Wage Schedules shall be rounded to the nearest dollar,
(a)	Initial Wage Increase
Wage schedules shall be increased by 2.0% on the Maximum Rates and by 2.0% on the Minimum Rates in effect on May 11, 2002. The initial general wage increase shall be effective on Sunday, May 12, 2002.
(b)	Second Wage Increase

15
Article G17
6	Reassignment to a Title in a Lower Wage Band in Same Locality
When an employee is reassigned to a position in a lower wage band, such employee's standard rate shall not be reduced unless:

(b)	The employee is reclassified to his or her former title following a temporary promotion, in which case the standard rate shall be changed to the standard rate the employee would have acquired had the employee remained in the lower title.
(c)	The reassignment is employee initiated, in which case the employee’s new standard rate will be determined by placing the employee on the same step of the lower schedule as the employee occupied on the higher schedule.
7~Promotions
(a)	If an employee's attendance and job performance are satisfactory, the Company will consider many factors including but not limited to, seniority, technical skills and experience in determining an employee’s qualification for promotion within the bargaining unit.

(b)	Each employee promoted from one occupational job to another occupational job with a higher maximum standard rate of pay shall have his or her standard rate of pay in the higher rated job determined by allowing the employee full wage experience credit, both in progression and at maximum, except that when an employee is promoted to an occupational job having a longer progression schedule than that of the occupational job from which the employee is promoted, an employee's wage experience credit shall not exceed one step down from maximum on the longer wage schedule. If the effect of applying the step down is to decrease the employee's standard rate, then the employee will be placed on the first step of the new schedule that results in a standard rate increase.

(E)	AT&T PERFORMANCE AWARD FOR OCCUPATIONAL EMPLOYEES
AT&T Performance Award for Occupational Employees
AT&T, the Communications Workers of America, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers agree to an annual bonus plan linked to the overall financial success of AT&T. This plan shall be called the AT&T Performance Award for Occupational Employees (APA).
Plan Purpose
The AT&T Performance Award for Occupational Employees (the APA “Plan") is a profit sharing like plan designed to recognize and reward eligible employees by having them share in an annual bonus plan that is linked to AT&T's key financial measures.
APA Plan Year
The APA Plan Year for measuring financial results and determining employee eligibility to share in those results shall be the calendar year. The first such year will commence January 1, 2002 and will include financial performance through December 31, 2002.
Eligibility
To be eligible to participate in APA, an occupational employee must meet both of the following criteria;
1.	Have a minimum of eighty-eight (88) calendar days of active employment (either management or occupational) with the Company as a U.S. based employee during the APA Plan Year and,
2.	Be a regular full-time or regular part-time AT&T employee on December 31 of the applicable APA Plan year (except as noted in subsequent paragraphs).
Leaves of Absence
Local Leave of Absence - Within any APA Plan Year a service credit period of up to thirty (30) days shall be added to offset a Local Leave of Absence to be included in the 88 calendar days of active employment.
Short Term Disability Leave of more than one (1) month - An absence period attributed to Sickness or Accident Disability or the disability portion of the Anticipated Disability Leave of Absence shall be included in calculating the award. It shall also be included in determining whether the employee has met the eighty-eight (88) day requirement set forth above. An employee shall not lose eligibility if he/she is on such an absence on December 31 of the APA Plan Year.
Unpaid Leave of Absence (personal leave, the non-disability portion of an anticipated disability leave, union leave, care of newborn/newly adopted child, family care leave, unpaid military leave) - An employee’s time on an unpaid leave of absence granted by the Company of more than thirty days shall not be counted toward the eighty-eight (88) day requirement set forth above nor shall such time be counted in determining the amount of the award. An employee shall not lose eligibility if he/she is on such a leave on December 31 of the applicable APA Plan Year.
122

An employee separated from the active payroll due to force reduction, retirement on a service or disability pension, expiration of benefits or death during the Plan year shall not lose eligibility due to such separation. The award for an employee under these circumstances shall be prorated based on the number of calendar days on the active payroll or otherwise included in the calculation during the APA Plan Year.
An employee who resigns prior to December 31 or last day of the APA Plan Year or is dismissed prior to the payout date for any reason shall not be eligible for an award.
An employee who is on Long Term Disability Leave of Absence on December 31 of an APA Plan Year shall not be eligible for an award.
Promotions or Temporary Upgrades to Management and Transfers
An employee permanently or temporarily promoted to management or transferred to a former Bell System company under the Post Divestiture Shared Services Force Transfer Agreement, if otherwise eligible, shall receive a prorated award for time spent as an occupational employee of AT&T under this Plan.
Payment Criteria - Pro-Rated (Time Worked)
The award to an eligible full-time occupational employee shall be pro-rated based on the number of calendar days on the active payroll as an occupational employee during the APA Plan Year.
The award to an eligible part-time occupational employee shall be pro-rated based on both the part-time employee's part-time Equivalent Work Week as of December 31 of the applicable APA Plan Year and the number of calendar days on the active payroll as an occupational employee during the APA Plan Year.
The Award to an eligible occupational employee receiving the Extend Compensation Option of the AT&T Option Program (ATTOP) shall be prorated based on the number of calendar days on the active payroll as an occupational employee during the APA Plan Year prior to their election to participate in ECO and, in addition, for the number of days as an ECO participant the Award amount will be 15% of the Award received by an eligible full-time employee.
123
Other Agreements
APA Plan Payment Calculations
For APA Plan Years 2002 and 2003 an Occupational Standard Award amount of $680.00 will be used to calculate the award payment. For purposes of the APA Plan payment calculations for the 2002 APA Plan Year, the financial success of AT&T’s businesses shall be measured by the achievement of two key business goals. These two financial measures are Revenue and Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT). Funding for the APA Plan payments will be determined as follows;
AT&T Consumer funding will be based on 70 percent on meeting EBIT targets and 30 percent on meeting revenue targets.
AT&T Business funding will be 60 percent based on meeting EBIT targets and 40 percent on meeting revenue targets.
Each Occupational employee’s APA payment will be based on the weighted average of AT&T Business’ and AT&T Consumer's overall funding percentages as described above. The weighting will be tied 70 percent to AT&T Business' overall funding percentage and 30 percent tied to AT&T Consumer's overall funding percentage.
The bonus pools will be funded against the revenue and/or profits of the Company. If the Company’s performance exceeds the targets, the bonus pool funding will increase to a maximum of 200%. The measures for the revenue and EBIT target weighted averages are threshold performance (50% funding level), target performance (100% funding level), and above target performance (200% funding level).
The corporate financial measures and associated targets used in years subsequent to 2002 for the Management Bonus Plan will also be used for the Occupational APA Plan.
Award Payment Amounts
•	Payout at or below Threshold Performance Level = $400
•	Payout at Target Performance Level = 100% of Occupational Standard Award ($680)
•	Payout above Target Performance Levels = Capped at 200%
Award Payments
Award payments will be made by separate check to be delivered by the end of the first quarter of the year following the applicable APA Plan Year. Such payments shall be subject to federal, state, and local tax and FICA withholding.
Where appropriate, award payments shall be used in calculating an employee’s wage rate for determining the amount of union dues deductions.
124
Other Agreements
Application of the Awards to Payment for Overtime Worked and Other Benefits, Allowances or Allotments:
•	For the twelve (12) month period following each Award, the Award will enter into computations of pay for overtime worked. Such computation shall be based on the amount of the Award, divided by the number of weeks during said twelve (12) months. The result of such computation shall be entered into the standard Overtime Adjustment formula during each payroll period.
For the twelve (12) month period following each Award, the Award shall be included in the calculation of the following benefit payments or allotments:
•	Group Life Insurance (Basic, Supplementary, Accidental Death & Dismemberment and Accidental Loss)
•	Death Benefits
•	Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)
The Award shall be subject to LTSSP Allotment Deductions.
The Award will not be part of the employee’s Standard Rate of pay or basic wages for any other purpose nor shall they enter into the computation of any payments made under any other pension or benefits plan, fringe benefit, allowance or differential.
Employee Information
The Company will provide periodic information to employees regarding its financial performance during each APA Plan Year.
The Company may extend coverage of this APA Plan to other AT&T units and to occupational employees other than those represented by the Unions.
Dispute Resolution
Company determination under this plan shall be final and binding. The Union may present grievances relating to matters covered by the APA Plan, but neither the APA Plan nor its administration shall be subject to arbitration.
Extraordinary Financial Occurrences
The Company reserves the right to adjust the level of payment so as to insulate it from the effects of unanticipated, extraordinary major fluctuations in business transactions or conditions. The Company shall provide the Union with advance notice of any such adjustments and shall discuss the matter with the Union upon request.

For purposes of this determination, "Post-March 1, 1990 retirees" shall mean management and occupational employees (who retired on or after March 1,1990) and former employees who are covered by the Retiree Medical Plan due to their receipt of long term disability benefits under the AT&T Long Term Disability Benefit Plan for Management Employees or the AT&T Long Term Disability Benefit Plan for Occupational Employees.

Effective January 1, 2003, the maximum “Aggregate Company Contribution” that the Company shall provide toward single or family medical and dental coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan for 2003 and for each year
131
Other Agreements
thereafter, shall not exceed the sum of the products of (a) and (b) (as separately determined) for each of the four retiree medical cap categories set forth above, where “(a)” equals the average number of the Post-March 1, 1990 retirees eligible to participate in each of the respective retiree medical cap categories (under age 65-single, under age 65-family, age 65 and oversingle and age 65 and over-family) during the plan year that is two plan years immediately prior to the plan year for which the Aggregate Company Contribution is being determined, and “(b)” equals the corresponding dollar amount set forth above for each of the four retiree cap categories, respectively.
3	Total Cost of Plan
Effective January 1, 2003, the total costs of the Plan for medical and dental claims under the Retiree Medical Plan for 2003 and for each year thereafter (hereinafter referred to as the “Determination Year") shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) below:
1)	For purposes of calculating the total costs of the Plan, the Company will determine the sum of (a) the amount of claims for medical and dental coverage (for Post-March 1, 1990 retirees, and their respective covered dependents) for the plan year that is two plan years immediately prior to the Determination Year, and (b) the Retiree Medical Plan administrative fees (for Post-March 1, 1990 retirees, and their respective covered dependents) for the plan year that is two plan years immediately prior to the Determination Year.
2)	Once the sum of (a) and (b) has been determined, such sum shall be reduced by the amount of claims for medical and dental coverage for (i) surviving lawful spouses (of Post-March 1, 1990 retirees) and their covered dependents under the family security program feature of the Retiree Medical Plan, (ii) class II dependents (of Post-March 1, 1990 retirees) and (iii) COBRA claims or such other claims where the participant is responsible for the premium, for the plan year that is two plan years immediately prior to the Determination Year.
3)	The amount remaining after completion of (1) and (2) above shall be multiplied by (i) the medical consumer price index growth factor (“Medical CPI Growth Factor” - Medical CPI No. 1 divided by Medical CPI No. 2 in the same manner as has heretofore been used), and (ii) 1.04 (to reflect a 2% per year increase for utilization).
132
Other Agreements
4	Aggregate Retiree Contributions
Effective January 1, 2003, the aggregate amount of contributions, if any, that all eligible occupational employees (who retired on or after March 1, 1990), including Occupational LTD Participants, shall be required to pay to continue to receive medical and dental coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan for 2003 and each year thereafter shall equal the difference (which yields a positive value) between (a) the total costs of the Plan (as described above in "Total Costs of Plan”), and (b) the “Aggregate Company Contribution". This difference is hereinafter referred to as the "Amount in Excess of the Caps". In the event that this difference is zero or less for a particular year, no contributions are required to be paid by eligible occupational employees (who retired on or after March 1, 1990), including Occupational LTD Participants, for medical and dental coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan for such year.
5	Monthly Retiree Contribution For Medical and Dental Coverage
Effective January 1,2003, the monthly retiree contribution, if any, for medical and dental coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan for January 2003 and each month thereafter shall equal one-twelfth of the Amount in Excess of the Caps (as determined in accordance with the provisions set forth above), allocated in such manner among the eligible occupational employees (who retired on or after March 1, 1990 - including Occupational LTD Participants), so that the contribution for family medical and dental coverage shall be two times the contributions for single medical and dental coverage, respectively. As a result of the above calculation methodology, effective for the calendar year beginning January 1, 2003, all eligible occupational employees who retired on or after March 1, 1990, including the Occupational LTD Participants, shall be responsible for making contributions toward medical and dental coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan in the amount of $54 per month for single coverage and $108 per month for family coverage. Such monthly retiree contribution may be paid from such retired occupational employee’s monthly pension annuity under the AT&T Pension Plan.
An eligible retired occupational employee may waive medical and dental coverage under the Retiree Medical Plan during an annual enrollment period, which shall result in a deferral of coverage, and may be reinstated in the Plan, during the plan year for which coverage is deferred if (a) a qualified change in family status for the retiree occurs, and (b) a timely election for reenrollment is made by the retiree. If these mid-year reenrollment conditions are not satisfied, the earliest time that medical and dental coverage may be reinstated prospectively for any year by the retiree who has waived coverage is during the first annual enrollment period for the Retiree Medical Plan occurring after such coverage was terminated.

Other Agreements
6	Additional Benefits
For 2002 and 2003, each occupational employee who retired (or became an Occupational LTD Participant) on or after March 1, 1990 (including those who have not yet commenced payment of their pensions or have taken lump sum pension payments under the AT&T Pension Plan) will be eligible for a health care reimbursement account as an additional annual Plan benefit for each such year not to exceed the amount set forth below (prorated in 2002 for each full month as a retiree or LTD recipient after May 31,2002, and for 2003 for each full month as a retiree or LTD recipient prior to December 1, 2003, rounded to the nearest whole dollar):

Family: $150	Family:	$1,200
Single: $100	Single:	$ 600
Waive: $100	Waive:	$ 600
The determination of the Additional Benefit amount will be based on coverage in effect on June 1,2002 for the year 2002, and enrollment election made for January 1, 2003 for the year 2003. The amounts set forth above shall be sufficient to provide full reimbursement of the required contributions for the duration of this Agreement. As set forth above, the required monthly contributions will be $14 for single coverage and $21 for family coverage for 2002 and $54 for single coverage and $108 for family coverage for 2003. In accordance with the requirements of applicable law, the above amount may be used to reimburse such former employee for otherwise unreimbursed medical contributions (i.e., the retired occupational employee's portion of the contribution for coverage or HMO premium), copayments, deductibles, out of pocket expenses, or other Plan expenses related to health care that would otherwise be deductible for that year under Internal Revenue Code Section 213 (notwithstanding the percentage limitation on deductible amounts).
Any individual eligible for this provision who waives medical and dental coverage for any period of time under the Plan shall remain eligible for this, but no other medical or dental provision of the Plan, during such waiver period. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, a waiver is considered as any action by the retired employee to defer medical and dental coverage In accordance with the rules of the Plan.

Other Agreements
(Z) AT&T TRANSFER AND REHIRE SYSTEM (ATS/ARS)
AT&T, CWA, and IBEW agree that the AT&T Transfer System (ATS) and the AT&T Rehire System (ARS) shall continue during the 2002 Memorandum of Agreement.
1	Purpose
(a)	The AT&T Transfer System (ATS) is designed to provide regular full-time or regular part-time occupational employees an opportunity to request new career opportunities on a current or future basis and provide surplus employees with an increased opportunity to continue employment with AT&T. Temporary and occasional employees are excluded from the system. All employee movement under ATS is voluntary through a self-nomination process and should not be construed to be a force adjustment, force rearrangement, assignment or reassignment initiated by the Company.
(b)	The AT&T Rehire System (ARS) is designed to provide former AT&T employees the opportunity to apply for regular full-time or regular part-time occupational positions and be reemployed by AT&T. This plan does not replace any existing recall rights to which former employees may be entitled, but the rehiring of a former employee under this program satisfies the Company’s recall obligation.
(c)	ATS/ARS does not replace any contractual, internal movement of personnel procedures contained in applicable Memoranda of Agreements. As to those bargaining units, ATS supplements those movement of personnel procedures and shall be applied after those movement of personnel procedures have been exhausted.
2	System Coverage
(a)	This system provides the exclusive means by which active regular full-time and regular part-time occupational employees, former employees who were laid off by the Company with recall rights, or employees who left the Company because of an authorized hardship or an AT&T trailing spouse condition covered by this Agreement may request consideration for transfer to occupational positions within and across the bargaining units which are covered by this Agreement. These former employees, for a period of three (3) years from the date of termination, will be able to contact a unique 800 number, listen to open jobs and nominate for openings. The Company may extend coverage of this system to occupational employees other than those represented by the Unions. Temporary, term and occasional positions are not filled by ATS/ARS.
135
Other Agreements
(b)	An employee request for lateral movement within his/her Business Operating Unit or Division and in the same Local Placement Area (LPA) is administered by management; however, an employee may also place an intra-Business Operating Unit or Division request in the same LPA on file with ATS/ARS.
(c)	ATS/ARS does not preclude the Company from making Company initiated transfers, force adjustments, reassignments or rearrangements. Nor shall anything in this system preclude the Company from temporarily limiting or prohibiting occupational employee movement via this system if the Company determines that excessive movement from any organization or work group would impair the operation of the business. Temporary limits or prohibitions on occupational employee movement will not exceed sixty (60) days under this Plan. An employee covered by the sixty (60) day prohibition may self-nominate for vacancies if the report date occurs after the last day of the prohibition. The temporary limits or prohibitions on occupational employee movement described herein shall not apply in sale situations.
(d)	Initial employee participation in ATS/ARS shall require the employee/former employee to verify, supply, or update personnel data relative to work experience, education or training.
3	Definitions
(a)	An UPGRADE is movement from an employee’s current Level Equalization Group to a position in a Level Equalization Group of a higher numeric value.
(b)	A DOWNGRADE is movement from an employee's current Level Equalization Group to a position in a Level Equalization Group of a lower numeric value.

Gentlemen:
Re:	Administrative and Other Improvements to ATS
This will confirm our understanding reached during 2002 Bargaining that the Unions and the Company, recognizing the proven advantages of continuing to simplify administrative processes and other improvements concerning the AT&T Transfer and Rehire System (ATS/ARS) agree that:
The ATS/ARS Review Board will continue to seek ways to address the following subjects:
The staffing of ATS/ARS positrons requiring a security clearance.
Review and update the employee information package, skill codes, job titles, and level equalization groups data (target date of 4th quarter 2002).
Educate the general ATS employee population that registration with ATS is essential.
Discuss potential areas for enhancement regarding the ATS/ARS system as well as the ATS/ARS Web site.
Review Time-in-Title for all Operations Represented Titles (target 4th quarter 2002). Any changes to be implemented will be effective January 1, 2003.
Review Time-in-Title for LNS Represented Titles (target 4th quarter 2002). Any changes to be implemented will be effective January 1, 2003.
Review and discuss the feasibility of new selection criteria. During September, 2003, the Review Board will review their findings regarding this effort.
Continue to seek ways to mechanize and electronically provide information regarding employee status on individual placement requests.
Review and discuss ATS/ARS job requisitions to ensure candidates are selected and/or job requisitions are closed in a timely manner.
155
Other Agreements
Further, should emerging technology make additional simplification or improvements possible, the Company will pursue such programs. The schedule for implementation of all enhancements will be established and monitored by the Joint ATS/ARS Review Board, with input from the Integrated Workforce Solutions (IWS) organization.
Very truly yours,

Other Agreements
(SS) MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING NEUTRALITY AND CONSENT ELECTION
This agreement between CWA, IBEW and AT&T supersedes all previous agreements between the parties concerning union organizing, access to employees and code of conduct applicable to union organizing efforts, card check, values, etc. It is effective on July 1,1999.
The Unions and the Company recognize that it is in their mutual interest to operate in the spirit of partnership and common vision. The parties also share the mutual goals of building a world class, high performance enterprise and addressing employment security through business success and employee development. As a means to achieve these goals the parties will mutually support regulatory and legislative efforts, marketing/sales and service efforts, and other business initiatives leading to employment security and AT&T’s business success.
The parties also recognize that the Unions’ goal of growing membership is intrinsically linked to the successful growth of the business. In order to maintain this perspective and to also avoid unnecessary confrontation, the parties agree that the following principles regarding neutrality and consent election will be applicable to all AT&T Business Operating Units and Divisions listed on Attachment 1 and shall be the exclusive means by which the Unions, their locals, or individuals acting on their behalf, will conduct an effort to organize nonmanagement employees in the covered AT&T Business Operating Units or Divisions listed.
1	Employee Choice
Both the Unions and the Company support and agree with the principle that the decision as to whether or not to become represented by a union is one that does not belong to either the Union or to the Company. Rather, it is an individual decision that belongs to the employee. With the parties’ mutual recognition of this fundamental tenet, the following provisions are intended to establish, encourage, and nurture an environment during a union organizing drive that will allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. All negotiations concerning appropriate unit, access, conduct, and voting will be performed by local management and Local Union officials, i.e., those directly impacted by these discussions. The local union and management officials may request a meeting with the appropriate union and company headquarters representatives at the beginning of this process.
2	Neutrality
The Company and the Unions agree that an organizing drive should be and will be met by a neutral position by the company. This statement is consistent with and reinforces the previously established principle of employee choice. It should follow that an environment intended to foster employee choice would be a neutral environment and that information communicated by either party would be fact based and not misleading, distorted or disparaging. Neutrality means the following:
160
Other Agreements
(a)	Management will not be anti-union nor will the Union be antimanagement.
(b)	Management will not advocate that employees should not vote for a union to represent them.
(c)	The Unions will be afforded reasonable opportunities for access to employees to get their message communicated.
(d)	Management will respond to employee questions, and is obligated to correct inaccurate or misunderstood information by employees.
(e)	The Union(s) will be referred to by name and will not be characterized as a "third party" or "outsider".
(f)	Any written information distributed to employees by either party relative to the organizing campaign will be shared with the other. The parties’ communications with employees will be in accordance with this agreement.
(g)	Neither party will hire consultants who encourage an adversarial relationship.
(h)	Neither managers nor union representatives will be personally attacked.
(I) Neither the Union nor the Company will be attacked as institutions.
(j) The Company will not conduct "captive" audience meetings.
Allegations of violations of these provisions will be handled via the dispute resolution process contained in this Agreement.
3	Rules
The procedures to be followed are listed below:
(a)	The Union must show a minimum of 50% + 1 show of interest on signature cards of the appropriate unit.
(b)	If an election is conducted and the Union is not successful, another election will not be scheduled for twelve months.
(c)	A vote of 50% + 1 of those who vote, validated by the Third Party Neutral (TPN), will determine the outcome.
(d)	The TPN will resolve any issue concerning challenged ballots in similar fashion to the NLRB process.
4	Time Bound
It is in the interest of both parties that the organizing campaign be conducted expeditiously. The union is therefore obligated to notify management of its intention to conduct a formal organizing drive before it begins. The date of this notification will "start the clock". The entire campaign, including the consent election, will be concluded in ninety (90) days. It is the intent of the parties that the ninety (90) day time frame will include discussion and agreement on the unit. In the event the parties are unable to agree on the
161
Other Agreements
unit, the dispute resolution process set forth below will be utilized and the time period will be extended by the number of days required to reach agreement on the unit, but in no event will the total campaign, including resolution of the scope of the bargaining unit and the consent election process, exceed one hundred twenty (120) days. If employees vote not to be represented, the union agrees not to initiate another campaign (nor continue the current campaign) in that same work group for twelve (12) months from the date of the conclusion of the campaign. This would not preclude the Local Union from having contact with the workers in the group. If employees vote to be represented, collective bargaining over the terms and conditions of employment will commence within sixty (60) days and will be limited to the agreed upon unit.
5	Informed Decision
Both parties agree that employees should be fully informed about all aspects of union representation. The Union will provide fact-based information to employees as it endeavors to convince prospective members of the merits of being represented by a labor union. Management’s role during this process will include:
(a)	responding to individual employee inquiries
(b)	explaining the organizing process, including obligations and responsibilities
(c)	correcting any inaccuracies or misstatements or misunderstandings disseminated by the Union.
6	Free from Coercion
Consistent with the basic tenet of employee choice, the parties want to ensure that employees have expressed their choice from an informed position and are completely free from any coercion by the Company, the Union, or any other party or parties. One way to ensure this objective is to have an NLRB conducted election.
In the alternative, the Company and the Union agree to use a process called “Consent Election”. This process will work as follows:
(a)	As part of the access discussions, the parties agree to use “Consent Election".
162
Other Agreements
(b)	The Unions shall initiale the consent election process by providing to a third party neutral (TPN) proof of support by means of show of interest cards from 50% + 1 of the employees in the unit. The neutral will then notify AT&T and request a list of names, job titles and home addresses. The Company will furnish the list within three working days. The applicable union will also be furnished with the list. The "show of interest" cards will clearly state their purpose and that a secret ballot consent election will be conducted to determine the will of the unit. If the neutral determines that the Union(s) has a sufficient show of interest, he/she will schedule a Consent Election process in accordance with this agreement.
(c)	The election process will be supervised by a mutually selected neutral, whose role it is to ensure the integrity of the process itself, and will be conducted within two (2) weeks of the submission of the Union's show of interest to the TPN. Employees will be asked to express their individual preference in a manner that will ensure that their choice will not be known to either party. The neutral will count the votes and advise the parties of the outcome. Consistent with this agreement, a vote of 50% +1 of those who vote will control. The parties may have an observer present when the TPN counts the ballots.
(d)	In all cases, the election process shall take place within fourteen (14) days of receipt and verification of the Union's show of interest cards by the neutral. In those cases in which there is no dispute about the composition of the unit, the election process will be held within seven days. The election may be held at the Company location or at a neutral site as agreed by the parties. The cost of using a neutral site will be spirt equally by the parties.
If there is a dispute as to the composition of the unit, the neutral shall either decide the issue within an additional seven days or order an election as described above with the decision as to the composition of the unit to follow the election within no more than seven days.
7	Access Agreement
As soon as reasonably practicable after a request by the CWA/IBEW for access, local management and CWA/IBEW representatives will meet to discuss the details related to reasonable access to the unit by CWA/IBEW representatives. The Union(s) will be allowed reasonable opportunities for access to AT&T facilities. It is the intent and commitment of AT&T and the CWA/IBEW that the access agreed upon will not interfere with the operation and other normal and routine business activities, plans and programs of AT&T generally and, specifically, the selected unit. Access agreed upon will be in non-working areas and during employee non-working times. Agreements as to eventful access, such as access to conference rooms, will be reasonable in length and there will be reasonable periods between requests for eventful access. However, uneventful access, such as a prearranged meeting with an individual employee, will not be affected by this.
163
Other Agreements
If AT&T and the CWA/IBEW are unable to agree on reasonable access, the third party neutral will be asked to resolve the issue. Successful access agreements utilized at other units will be looked to for guidance as to what works and is reasonable. AT&T and the CWA/IBEW commit that they will reach such an access agreement in each instance in an expeditious manner.
8	Dispute Resolution
(a)	Questions or disputes arising during the course of an organizing effort within a particular unit of non-represented employees will, in all cases, be addressed first by and between the parties themselves and, in particular, local AT&T management and appropriate CWA/IBEW representatives. It is the intent and desire of AT&T and the CWA/IBEW that such matters be dealt with and are best dealt with by and between the parties themselves, particularly at the local level, without having to resort to the assistance of a third party. It is also agreed, however, that, if every good faith and reasonable effort has been made, but the matter still remains unresolved, the process described below will be utilized.
(b)	The Third Party Neutral (TPN) will resolve disputes in the manner set forth in this agreement. Either AT&T or the CWA/IBEW can refer a question or dispute, unresolved after good faith efforts have been made to resolve the dispute locally, to the chosen Third Party Neutral by providing three working days' written notice to both the other party and the TPN. The notice will provide a complete statement of the question or dispute to be addressed and a statement that the parties have attempted in good faith but have been unable to resolve the matter by and between themselves.
(c)	The TPN has the authority (pursuant to Section 8) to issue appropriate remedial orders in connection with claimed violations of the NCE which would restore the conditions necessary to allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner consistent with the provisions of paragraph (1) Employee Choice and (2) Neutrality of the NCE Agreement. Such remedies, applicable to either the Company or the Union, may include the posting of notices; cease and desist orders; postponement of the election for the notice posting period; ordering the postponement or barring of organizing efforts by the Union; an election, card check or recognition (as described in paragraph (9)) below, at a specific location.
(d)	If the question or dispute involves a matter related to access (i.e., the nature, event, time, location, individuals involved, etc.), the TPN will fully investigate all relevant facts surrounding the question or dispute. The TPN will then call the parties together and attempt to facilitate resolution of or otherwise mediate the matter.
164
Other Agreements
If, after a good faith attempt at facilitated resolution or mediation, the access question or dispute is still not resolved, the TPN will attempt to render an immediate decision, which includes a method or alternative methods of resolving the perceived access problem. However, in no event will the TPN take longer than five (5) days thereafter to render a decision. The decision of the neutral will be final and binding and the parties agree to abide by his/her decision. This process, from the time the TPN is contacted to the time his or her opinion is issued, will not take more than fifteen (15) days unless the parties agree otherwise.
(e)	If the dispute involves the appropriateness of the bargaining unit the Union seeks to organize and the parties are unable to agree, after negotiating in good faith for a reasonable time, upon the description of an appropriate unit for bargaining, the issue of the description of such unit shall be submitted to the TPN and a hearing shall be conducted consistent with the rules of the AAA. The neutral shall be confined solely to the determination of the appropriate unit for bargaining and shall be guided in such deliberations by the statutory requirements of the National Labor Relations Act and the decisions of the National Labor Relations Board and Appellate reviews of such Board decisions.
(f)	Regardless of the type of question or dispute that is submitted to the Third Party Neutral, the parties will each be given a full opportunity to present their positions and supporting factual information prior to the issuance of any opinion. No written briefs will be submitted. There shall be no ex parte contact with the Third Party Neutral without the concurrence of all parties. AT&T, the CWA and IBEW believe that matters pertaining to these values are best handled by and between the parties themselves and resort to a TPN should be necessary in only a limited number of cases.
AT&T and the CWA/IBEW agree that the parties may distribute a decision of the TPN to employees in the selected unit but not outside to the public such as the press.
(g)	The parties agree that the process set forth herein shall be the exclusive means for resolving disputes covered by this dispute resolution process, and neither party will utilize any other forum (e.g. NLRB, federal court, etc.) to address issues subject to resolution pursuant to this process.
(h)	All expenses resulting from the use of the TPN process shall be split equally by AT&T and the Union.
9	Card Check Remedy
(a)	Within seven days after an election, charges of NCE violations may be referred to the TPN. If the TPN finds an instance(s) of a serious or repeated NCE violation(s) by management in any organizing effort at a location where formal notice has been given by the union, the TPN may remedy the situation by setting aside the results of the election and requiring the company to recognize the Union in the appropriate unit at
165
Other Agreements
that location in which the election was held, provided that proof of majority support has been submitted to the AAA and verified, and provided that the TPN concludes that the Company has engaged in substantial non-compliance of the neutral environment provided for in paragraph (2) ‘Neutrality’ of the NCE agreement and therefore preventing employees from choosing whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner as provided in paragraph (1) 'Employee Choice’ of the NCE Agreement,
(b)	If the TPN finds an instance(s) of a serious or repeated NCE violation(s) by management in any organizing effort at a location where formal notice has been given by the union but a request for election has not yet been submitted, the TPN may provide for recognition for card check in the appropriate unit at that location subject to the union’s notice. The cards may be submitted during a 90 day period following the TPN’s decision if he/she has concluded that the Company has engaged, at that location, in violations of the NCE of such severity that other remedies (including those set forth in paragraph 8 (c)) would not restore conditions which would allow employees to choose whether or not to become represented in a fully informed and uncoerced manner. In these cases, charges of NCE violations must be submitted to the Company and the TPN within 7 days of the claimed violation. It being understood that both parties will endeavor to resolve any and all disputes as soon as possible. In the event the TPN finds such a severe violation of the NCE, the Union shall provide the required show of interest cards to the AAA during the 90 day period. The Company shall then provide to the AAA its Excelsior list of unit employees within three business days of the date the Company is notified of receipt of such cards by the AAA. If there is a dispute as to the composition of the unit it shall be referred to the TPN, After receipt and verification by the AAA, if the majority support has been provided, the Union will be recognized at that location.

(k) PENNSYLVANIA LENGTH OF SERVICE
| “Term of Employment" as used in Article 14 - Vacations of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Company and the Union shall mean Net Credited Service. Length of service as used in Article OS2 (Weekly Work Schedules and Hours of Work), Paragraph 2, shall mean service as measured from the date of last hiring by AT&T or, if such hiring was prior to January 1, 1984, any Company which was part of the former Bell System.
(w) ELECTRONIC MONITORING
Sampling of service, used in the spirit of trust and respect, is a valuable tool to enhance customer service. To assure courteous treatment, accurate information and superior service, customer calls may be monitored to assist in the training and development of employees, identification of customer needs and product evaluation. Such call sampling includes individual monitoring and process monitoring (i.e. monitoring not performed on a specific individual.)
Sampling will be conducted by trained observers. When individual monitoring is done, employees will be given prior notification the day sampling is to take place and each will have the option of remote or side-by-side monitoring. All remote monitoring will be taken from within the work area of the employee being monitored. Feedback of all calls sampled will be provided to the employee by the end of the day of the completed contact (defined as the day the employee being sampled has initiated and/or provided the service requested by the customer). The employee will be notified of exceptional service or gross customer abuse immediately. This policy shall also apply to group sampling. Process monitoring (i.e. monitoring not performed on a specific individual) may be conducted without employee notification.
No employee shall be disciplined as a result of individual or process monitoring except for gross customer abuse, fraud, violation of privacy of communications, or when developmental efforts have not been successful. The Union may appeal such action pursuant to the provisions of Article G7 (Grievance Procedure) and Article G8 (Arbitration and Mediation).
It is agreed that all past practices and local letters of agreement which restrict the practice of service observing and monitoring are eliminated. The Company will continue to comply with any applicable laws regarding service monitoring or observation.

(A1) CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP COUNCIL
The Constructive Relationship Council shall meet on a quarterly basis. The CRC will consist of an equal number of management and union representatives. At each quarterly meeting at least one member of the senior leadership team of the Company’s business units shall participate in a CRC meeting. At the meeting, the Business Unit leader will review with the Union’s leadership the state of the business, technological developments and projected contracting initiatives which are expected to take place. The Union will be provided the opportunity to suggest and recommend alternatives to the anticipated contracting and to discuss the impact of these technological developments upon employees the Unions represent and the Company agrees to give serious consideration to the Unions’ suggestions and recommendations. The discussions are not intended to preclude the Company from sub-contracting but allow the parties the opportunity to conduct open and thorough dialogue in understanding both the Company’s business needs and the Unions’ institutional needs. The parties may agree to schedule additional meetings with individuals in Business Units to discuss issues raised in the meeting.
The parties agree to share such information as is necessary and appropriate but because such information will in most cases be confidential and competitively sensitive, the Union agrees that information disclosed at or in connection with the CRC shall not be released or disclosed beyond the individuals participating in the meeting without the express written consent of the Company. Any questions or disputes about the adequacy or relevance of any information provided or requested at the meeting shall be addressed exclusively by the participants in the meeting, and shall not be subject to the grievance procedure nor the basis for litigation or NLRB proceedings.
Nothing contained in this letter shall be deemed to authorize the submission of contracting disputes or the Company's decision to introduce new or enhanced technology to arbitration. Notwithstanding, the goal of the parties will balance the needs of customers, the provision of excellent service, economic factors and the needs of bargaining unit employees for employment security.
171
Other Agreements
(B1)	SUBCONTRACTING COMMITTEE
A challenge to an effective union-management relationship is the on-going debate about the need to respond efficiently to competitive market conditions and customer demand while recognizing the importance of employment security and job opportunities for current and future employees. Issues around contracting out of work have been particularly difficult to resolve to the satisfaction of both the Union and the Company.
The Union and the Company agree that each has a responsibility to suggest and consider solutions for enabling the use of bargaining unit employees for work most effectively done by employees. To be successful, this requires a good faith effort by both parties.
To accomplish this, the Constructive Relationship Council will form a Committee to discuss AT&T’s contracting out initiatives. This committee will be made up of three (3) IBEW representatives, a staff person from the CWA Communications and Technologies Office, two (2) Local Officers appointed by the Vice-President of that office and three (3) representatives of AT&T. Additional people may be brought in as “subject-matter-experts,” when necessary, upon mutual agreement by the parties.
The Committee shall, under the direction of the CRC, discuss current and future Contracting initiatives. In the case of new initiatives, the Company will provide as much notice as reasonably possible to facilitate discussions on alternatives to subcontracting. The Company will provide to the members of this Committee information necessary to fully examine the current and future contracting initiatives. This may include, but is not limited to, a list of all Contractors, their function, the Business Units they work for, the number of hours/days they worked that month, the particular work location, the hourly rate and the total cost of the Contract, economic factors, the skills necessary to perform the work and the impact such subcontracting may have on employment security.
The purpose of these discussions is for the parties to understand the specific conditions that have influenced the Company’s decision to contract work out and provide the Union an opportunity to discuss alternatives that would meet our common goals of balancing the needs of the customers, economic factors, the provisions of excellent service, and the needs of the bargaining unit employees for employment security.
This agreement in no way changes the intent and meaning of Article 30 and G23 and the Bahr/Williams letter.
The Constructive Relationship Council will provide oversight and direction to the Committee and, if necessary, may amend the above.

1.	The reason a test is being changed or developed;
2.	An overview of the test development plan;
3.	Feedback as the test or change is being developed.
The subcommittee will also determine what data, if any, is necessary to help the subcommittee answer questions about issues around current tests.
173
Other Agreements
(D1) AT&T RESOURCE CENTERS (ARC)
AT&T, CWA and IBEW agree to establish a Joint ARC Steering Committee to discuss the AT&T Resource Centers (ARC). The Committee will include two (2) members from the IBEW and the CWA and four (4) from the Company.
The Committee will look at the roles of the current ARC’S in AT&T and where possible, review ways to enhance the role of the AT&T Resource Centers to more closely follow the model of the Employee Resource Centers. The Committee will review the services provided by the ARC'S which may include the following:
•	education and training;
•	career and personal counseling;
•	resource data for local area jobs and skills required;
•	interface with AT&T Transfer and Rehire System (ATS/ARS) and the Alliance;
•	assistance and referral concerning benefit programs;
•	other services and counseling deemed to be appropriate by the Joint ARC Steering Committee.
174
Other Agreements
(E1) CARD CHECK
The Company will neither help nor hinder efforts by the Union to organize and represent occupational employees in the Company’s Dual Party Relay Centers, provided, however, that the Company is not precluded from responding to employee’s inquiries related to the issue of union representation.
When the Union claims that at least sixty five per cent (65%) of such employees have signed authorization cards designating the Union as their exclusive bargaining agent in an appropriate unit, the Company will recognize the Union as the bargaining agent of such employees without an NLRB-supervised election, provided the following conditions are satisfied:
(a)	The Company and the Union have mutually agreed that the bargaining unit in which the Union seeks recognition is an appropriate bargaining unit; and
(b)	The Company and the Union have mutually agreed upon the number and identity of the employees eligible for representation in such a unit; and
(c)	The Union submits to a mutually selected third party signed authorization cards from at least sixty five per cent (65%) of the employees in the agreed-upon bargaining unit, all of which expressly state that by signing the card the employee designates the Union as his/her exclusive bargaining representative, and further, understands that if a majority of the employees in the unit also sign such cards, the Company will recognize the Union without an NLRB-supervised election; and
(d)	The Union’s majority status in the agreed-upon bargaining unit is confirmed by the mutually selected third party. If the Company and Union fail to agree upon either of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the matter may be referred to the NLRB for determination.
(e)	The Union has notified the Company of its intent to conduct an organizing drive before it begins. The campaign will begin following receipt of the notice and the entire campaign must be concluded within ninety (90) days from receipt of the notice. No authorization cards may be solicited or signed before the Union provides the required notice to the Company. If the Union does not present cards from the requisite number majority of the employees in the agreed upon unit within the ninety (90) day period, the Union will not initiate another organizing effort (nor continue the existing one) for a period of twelve (12) months after the expiration of the ninety (90) day period.

(hi) CUSTOMER ENGINEER NEGOTIATIONS
This will confirm the understanding of the parties that negotiations shall begin as soon as possible to discuss the establishment of a tiered pay structure for the title of Customer Engineer based on the attainment of certifications. The highest wage tier agreed to will be in a separate universe for forced management purposes and be listed in Appendix 4 as a separate schedule. However, if offered, all Customer Engineers will be eligible for a Voluntary Termination Pay (VTP) offer regardless of wage tier. Subject to the parties being able to reach agreement on a tiered wage structure, such agreement will include an $8.00 increase to the top step of the New Jersey wage zone retro active to the effective date of the contract.
