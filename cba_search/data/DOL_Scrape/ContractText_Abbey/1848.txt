A.	Work Covered: The work covered under this Agreement shall be all of the work performed by craftworkers falling within the recognized jurisdiction of the fUBAC, AFL-CIO and the
2
OPCM1A, AFL-CIO. The Union has shown that the work, covered in Exhibit “A” has been assigned by Decisions of Record by the NLRB, and/or decisions by the Stipulated Plan for the Settlement of Disputes of the BCT Dept, for the Construction Industry assigning such work to the IUBAC or the OPCM1A as outlined, but not limited to Exhibit “A” attached hereto and made a part hereof. Also included under this section shall be International Agreements granting jurisdiction of any work to the IUBAC or OPCMIA. Coverage shall also extend to and include any additional classifications, technological changes, and new products that may be developed and other means and methods of installation that is introduced in the area of trade practice as provided for in Section I0.E (New Job Classifications.) The established Jurisdictional Decisions of Record by the NLRB, The Stipulated Plan of the BCT for The Construction Industry Decisions, and International Union Agreements as covered and provided for in Exhibit “A” of this Agreement shall supersede any other jurisdictional claims made by any other trade unions.
B.	The Union claims, and the Contractor acknowledges and agrees, that a majority of its employees performing covered work have authorized the Union to represent them in collective bargaining. The Union has offered to establish its majority status by allowing the Contractor to examine authorization cards voluntarily executed by employees in the appropriate unit and the Contractor is satisfied that the Union represents such majority and has waived the opportunity to examine such cards; therefore, Contractor recognizes, pursuant to Section 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, the Union as a sole and exclusive bargaining representative of all employees covered under this Agreement performing bargaining unit work.
C.	Employees Covered
1.	The employees covered by this Agreement are those employees of the Contractor employed in the State of Hawaii in the classifications set forth in the Classification and Hourly Wage Schedule which is attached hereto as Exhibit “A” and made a part hereof, including any additional classifications that may be added thereto pursuant to the provisions of Section Wages 10.E (New Job Classifications) of this Agreement.

D.	As set forth in Exhibit “A. 1,” attached hereto and made a part hereof, this Agreement further covers all work which falls within the recognized jurisdiction of the Plastering Trade as established and recognized by the Building and Construction Trades Department of the AFL-CIO and the Union Constitution. Should said jurisdictional coverage be revised during the term of this Agreement, then said Exhibit “A.l,” shall be deemed automatically amended to incorporate said revisions.
E.	Contractors shall assign work covered by this Agreement only to bargaining unit employees covered by this Agreement. Assigning of covered work shall be made prior to the start of any project and the Union notified of such assignment. In the event a dispute arises as to the assignment of such covered work, the parties involved shall meet immediately to resolve the dispute. If an Agreement between parties cannot be made, then the issue shall be immediately
3
sent to the International Unions for settlement under the Stipulated Plan for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes in the Construction Industry as approved by The Building and Construction Trade Dept., AFL-CIO. Each Association or Contractor signatory to this Agreement shall agree to be bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan and will sign the Stipulation form which is made a part of Exhibit “A.”

F.	Understanding Jurisdiction:
1.	The parties agree to allow the use of composite crews in accordance with the Contractors’ or their subcontractors’ past practices.
2.	The contractors commit that they will not pressure in any way subcontractors signatory to the Masons union to become signatory with other trades for the performance of work covered by this Agreement. Contractors will not back charge a subcontractor signatory to the Masons Union for any work which it performs with its own force as a result of any jurisdictional dispute over work covered by this Agreement and work claimed by any other trade or union.
3.	The above classification of work shall be in compliance with any jurisdictional agreements between international unions. Whenever the work in question can be claimed by more than one craft or the work required would result in inefficient situations, the parties shall attempt to establish composite crews.

3.	When an employee is laid off for lack of work, said employee shall be paid all wages earned and due as of the time of separation. If the employee’s separation paycheck is drawn in an incorrect amount due to the employee leaving work early, being a “no-show” on one of the employee’s scheduled workdays during that week, or for other cause for which the employee is responsible, then the employee’s separation check, as corrected, shall be paid to him/her no later than the working day following the date of layoff.
10
4.	When an employee is discharged for cause, said employee shall be paid all wages due at the time of discharge. However, if the discharge occurs at a time and under conditions which prevent the Contractor from making immediate payment, then all wages due must be paid to the employee no later than the working day following the discharge.
5.	When an employee quits, said employee shall be paid all wages due no later than the next regular pay day either through regular pay channels or, if requested by the employee, by mail. However, if an employee gives at least five (5) working days’ notice of his/her intention to quit, the Contractor shall pay all wages earned and due to said employee at the time of separation.
6.	Inasmuch as the provisions of Paragraph 4, and 5, above are requirements of State law, it is incumbent upon the Contractor to develop and maintain appropriate procedures for payment of same.

Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Association from negotiating or making agreement with the Union covering any new job classifications which fall within the jurisdiction of the Operative Plasterers’ and Cement Masons’ International Association, AFL-CIO, but which are not presently covered by this Agreement. If and when such new job classifications are contemplated, authorized representatives of the Association and of the Union shall immediately enter into negotiations to establish proper wage rates for such classification(s).
2.	In the event the aforesaid parties are unable to reach agreement on the matter, either party may refer the disagreement to the State Joint Board.	"
3.	Pending the establishment of such wage rate, the Contractor may introduce and use said classification(s) at a temporary rate of pay as determined by such Contractor. Should a higher rate of pay be established for said classification(s) by either the negotiating parties (i.e., the Union and the Association) or by the State Joint Board, the retroactive application of said higher wage rate shall be limited to twenty (20) working days.

3.	The provisions of paragraph 2, above, are designed to allow a Contractor the flexibility of “making-up” time during that same workweek for time lost on said Contractor’s project(s) due to the causes listed, as well as to provide employees the opportunity to secure additional work hours during that week which would not otherwise be made available to them. In that connection, the use of the phrase “any other condition or circumstance which is beyond the control of the Contractor” is intended to cover situations of a substantive and verifiable nature.
4.	Contractors shall not schedule Saturday make-up days to “make-up” work lost due to a holiday specified under Section 13-A, (Subject to mutual written agreement with the Union, the Contractor may establish a work week of four (4) ten (lO)-hour days on weeks where a holiday is observed).

(3)	PLUS disqualifying the Contractor from further use of the Saturday “make-up” day provision on the project involved.
(4)	PLUS Contractor to show cause to the State Joint Board with respect to said Contractor’s future use of said provision(s) on any of such Contractor’s projects for the duration of the Agreement.
6 The Contractor (may) by written mutual agreement with the Union, (on a project-by-project basis) schedule:
(a)	four (4) consecutive ten (lO)-hour days during the period from Monday through Friday which shall be paid for at the regular straight time hourly rate, or
(b)	four (4) nine (9)-hour days (Monday through Thursday) plus four (4)-hours on Friday, all of which hours shall be paid for at regular straight time hourly rates.
(c)	In either of such events, either Friday and/or Saturday may, at the Contractor’s option, be scheduled as a straight time make-up day under the same conditions as set forth in paragraph 2, above.

2.	However, if a State law, local ordinance, or job specification, or written instruction of the owner or his/her representative requires that work commence at a later hour, it shall be at the Contractor’s discretion as to whether the starting time as provided in paragraph B.I., above, shall apply or whether the starting time as imposed by State law, local ordinance, job specification, or by the aforementioned written instruction shall apply, in either case without payment of overtime or other premium rate. In such situation, the Contractor shall nevertheless afford the affected employees with eight (8) straight time hours of work opportunity (exclusive of meal periods), or pay for same unless the employee quits, voluntarily lays off, or is suspended or discharged prior to the completion of said eight (8) hour period, or the Contractor is unable to provide such work due to weather conditions, equipment breakdown, power failure, accident, suspension of work by written order of the contracting agency, or other reason outside of his/her control.
