satisfactory. An employee who has had a sabbatical leave can become eligible for another sabbatical leave after serving an additional seven (7) years in the District. A sabbatical leave of one (1) semester, one (1) or two (2) quarters or one (1) year constitutes a sabbatical leave when considering individual eligibility.
5.	An employee on sabbatical leave will receive one-half (14) of the contract salary he/she would have received if he/she had remained on active duty.
6.	Seniority service credit and status of an employee on sabbatical leave will not be impaired except as may be provided for elsewhere in this Agreement. The salary of an employee during the period of sabbatical leave will be paid in monthly installments just as though the person were on duty in the District. Sabbatical leave for study entitles a staff member to the normal increments provided that during the leave period at least twenty-two (22) semester hours or thirty-three (33) quarter hours of college credit have been earned or study with credit required in a degree program has been performed. Credit requirements for study leave on a quarter or semester basis shall be prorated. Sabbatical for study-travel will qualify if all requirements for the university or college program have been met. Credit earned during the summer period(s) adjacent to the study leave shall be included in the computation of credits for increment purposes.
7.	An employee receiving salary while on sabbatical leave will not engage in teaching or other remunerative occupation during such period. This does not prevent an employee from furthering his/her education on a teaching scholarship or fellowship.
8.	Employees who have been granted sabbatical leaves will return to regular service in the District for a period of at least one (1) year. If an employee does not return to regular service with the District at the expiration of a sabbatical leave, all salary paid during the sabbatical leave will become immediately due and payable to the District (Note exception in item 9.)
9.	If an employee should die while on sabbatical leave, the estate of that person will not be held liable for any salary paid while on leave. If a staff member should become permanently disabled while on leave, no repayment of salary paid while on leave. If a staff member should become permanently disabled while on leave, no repayment of salary paid while on leave will be required.
10.	Employees who take sabbatical leave for professional improvement must submit a written report to the sabbatical leave committee by October 1 following the year of their sabbatical leave. The report shall substantiate the objectives stated in their request for sabbatical leave.

4.	The employee may, at any time, request in writing that an alternative class assignment, disciplinary contract or specific assistance be provided for a pupil whose conduct or misbehavior warrants a recommendation for change. Such request shall include a documentation of the pupil's problem and a list of the types of corrective action already taken.
Administrative Response:
1.	When a written report is sent to the principal or other school administrator regarding student discipline, a request for alternative class assignment and/or specific assistance, or recommendation for suspension or expulsion, the principal or school administrator shall respond to the employee in writing concerning the action taken, contacts made with the parents or guardians, and any conditions imposed on the student's return to class.
2.	When school authorities endeavor to correct misconduct or misbehavior through counseling and/or conferencing with the pupil and his/her parents, the employee will be notified and be involved upon his/her request.
Recommending Suspension/Expulsion: If, in the employee's judgment, pupil conduct warrants suspension or expulsion of the pupil, the employee shall make written recommendation accordingly to the building administrator.

Any recommendation must include specific examples and/or documentation of the disruptive or disorderly conduct.
Special Education Discipline: The District will comply with all pertinent state and federal laws and Board policy when disciplining special education students.

Within the IEP process, which includes a meeting of the parent, teacher and District representative who is qualified to provide or supervise special education services, a plan may be established for the discipline of a specific behavior in order to reach behavior goals. This plan may include removal from school for specified amounts of time as a part of the IEP. The statements of Student Rights, Responsibilities and Regulations are not to be used when following the IEP plan as the IEP itself will prescribe the disciplinary procedures. Either the appropriate school personnel or the parent may request a new IEP meeting if either finds that the plan is not satisfactory or in need of revision. In the absence of a specific IEP discipline plan, all other items of Section 45. Student Discipline/Administrative Responsibility, will apply.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN TACOMA SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 10 (DISTRICT) AND
THE TACOMA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION (TEA)
REGARDING PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY STIPEND
The District and Association affirm the following beliefs and expectations:
a- providing a quality education to all students in the Tacoma School District is dependent upon hiring and retaining the highest quality certificated staff,
b.	providing a quality education to all students requires, from the regularly employed full and part-time certificated staff, a commitment to the education profession beyond the base contract and supplemental work days,
c.	the additional commitment required from Tacoma’s regularly employed full and part-time certificated staff cannot be measured accurately in hours or days.
For the reasons stated above, the District will provide a Professional Responsibility Stipend as determined by the employee’s placement on the negotiated Professional Responsibility Stipend Schedule, as an incentive to provide the additional services required of all certificated staff members in the Tacoma School District outside of the base contract and supplemental work days. Payment for this Professional Responsibility Stipend shall be made in twelve (12) equal monthly installments. A parttime employee will receive a pro-rata share of this stipend based on the employee’s fulltime equivalency (FTE).
The Professional Responsibility Stipend recognizes that employees provide a professionally responsible level of services in, but not limited to, the following areas which are beyond the basic contract and consistent with Project Quality Standards:
a.	attendance at the day before the first student day of the year and at the conference/semester day,
b.	preparation of the classroom or work space before, after, and during the school year for quality instruction or support of instruction,
c.	conferencing with parents and/or students,
d.	preparation for and attendance at reasonable building activities such as open houses, curriculum nights, parent education nights, school and community functions, student orientation and concerts,
e.	participation in self-reflection, goal setting and related professional growth activities such as workshops, classes, conferences, seminars or research projects.
