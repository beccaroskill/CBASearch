PREAMBLE
The Board and Association recognize their mutual obligations pursuant to ACT 379 of the Public Acts of 1965 to bargain collectively with respect to hours, wages and terms and conditions of employment. Both parties have entered into and conducted extended and good faith negotiations in which each party has had the right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with regard to all bargainable subjects.

ARTICLE 2
PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS
A.	ASSOCIATION DUES
1.	On or before October 15 of each year, any employee may sign and deliver to the Board an authorization (the form and administrative procedures thereof to be approved by the Board) for payroll deductions of Association membership dues and PAC contributions. Such sums shall be deducted in approximately equal amounts each payday from the regular salaries of all such employees during the remaining pay periods. Each employee who has previously signed an authorization form shall have deducted from his/her salary Association membership dues and PAC contributions beginning the second (2nd) paycheck of the school year providing the Board's Executive for Business Services received from the Association or its designee the continuing membership list on or before September 1st of that year.
2.	Authorization to deduct such dues and PAC contributions for ensuing school years shall continue in effect unless revoked by the employee, in writing, by July 1st of each year. Notice of such cancellation must be sent to the Board's Executive for Business Services with a copy to the Association.
3.	The Association will notify the Executive for Business Services prior to July 1st as to the amount of dues to be deducted from each employee in 1. and 2. above.
4.	Any amount deducted from employees' salaries as Association dues shall be remitted monthly to the Association by the Board's Office according to its rules and regulations.
B.	OTHER DEDUCTIONS
Payroll deductions will be available to the employees on a mutually agreed upon basis for the Grand Rapids Teachers Credit Union, for the purchase of United States Savings Bonds, for the United Way and for insurance premiums.
11
Payroll deductions shall also be available for the following:
1.	MESSA and MEA Financial Services Programs:
a.	Tax Deferred Annuity Plans
b.	MEA Financial Services Life Insurance
c.	Variable Options
2.	West Michigan Internet Services and other Internet Service providers mutually agreed by the Board and Association.
3.	And other programs approved by the Board
C.	ANNUITY PROGRAMS
The parties agree that the annuity programs approved by the Board shall be available to each employee.
D.	SAVE HARMLESS
The Board shall not be liable for any errors or losses in the administration of this Article unless it is shown that the Board was negligent in the care and handling of the monies involved.
E.	ASSOCIATION SECURITY
1.	Service Fee. Each employee in the bargaining unit who is regularly employed to work at least eight (8) hours or more per week shall, on or before thirty-one (31) days from the commencement of duties, either (a) join the Association and pay Association dues or (b) pay a service fee to the Association. The service fee shall be determined in a legally permissible manner and shall not exceed the amount of dues uniformly required of the members of the Association, less any amounts not permitted by law.
2.	Deduction of dues and service fees. The employee may authorize payroll deduction for such dues or service fees. In the event an employee shall not pay such service fee directly to the Association, or authorize payment through payroll deduction, the Board shall, at the request of the Association, deduct the service fee from the employee's wages and remit same to the Association. Payroll deductions made pursuant to this provision shall be made in equal amounts, as nearly as possible, from the regular paychecks of employees.
3.	Non Payment. The procedure in all cases of non-payment of the service fee shall be as follows. The Association shall notify the employee of non-compliance by personal service and/or certified mail, return receipt requested. Said notice shall detail the non-compliance, and shall provide ten (10) days for compliance, and shall further advise the
12
recipient that a request for wage deduction may be filed with the Employer in the event compliance is not effected.
a.	If the employee fails to remit the service fee or authorize deduction for the same, the Association may request the Board to make such deduction pursuant to the provision above.
b.	The Board shall, upon receipt of request for involuntary deduction, provide the employee with an opportunity for a timely due process hearing limited to the question of whether or not the employee has remitted the service fee to the Association or authorized appropriate payroll deduction.
c.	The Board and the Association may mutually agree in writing to withhold and/or suspend involuntary wage deduction, and/or to place any involuntary wage deductions into an escrow account pending any legal challenges.
d.	An employee who elects to pay a service fee in lieu of joining the Association shall be afforded the same representation rights as are extended to Association members.
4.	MEA Policy. Pursuant to Chicago Teachers' Union vs.Hudson, 106 S Ct 1066 (1986), the Association has established a "Policy Regarding Objections to Political-Ideological Expenditures." That policy, and the administrative procedures (including the timetable for payment) pursuant thereto, applies only to employees who are not members of the Association. The remedies set forth in that policy shall be exclusive and, unless and until such procedures (including any administrative or judicial review thereof) shall have been availed of and exhausted, no dispute, claim or complaint by an objecting employee concerning the application and interpretation of this article shall be subject to the grievance procedure set forth in this Agreement.
5.	Timelines. Due to certain requirements established in recent court decisions, the Association represents that the amount of the Service Fee charged to non-members, along with other required information, may not be available and transmitted to non-members until mid school year (December, January or February). Consequently, the parties agree that the procedures in this Article relating to the payment or non-payment of the Service Fee by non-members shall be activated thirty (30) days following the Association's notification to non-members of the Service Fee for that given school year.
13
6.	Certification. The Association will certify at least annually to the Employer, fifteen (15) days prior to the date of the first payroll deduction, the amount of Association dues and service fees to be deducted by the Employer, and that said service fees include only those amounts permitted by the Agreement and by law.
7.	Indemnification. The Association shall indemnify and save the Grand Rapids Public Schools, its Board of Education, past and present members of the Board of Education, and past and present administrators harmless against any and all claims, demands, suits, or other forms of liability of whatsoever kind and nature that shall arise out of action taken by the Board for the purpose of complying with the provision of this Agreement, provided
a.	That the Association shall defend any such legal action, at its own expense and through mutually selected legal counsel; and
b.	The Board gives timely notice of such action to the Association and permits the Association intervention as a party if it so desires; and
c.	The Board gives full and complete cooperation to the Association and its counsel in securing and giving evidence, obtaining witnesses, and making relevant information available at both trial and appellate levels; and
d.	The Association shall have the complete authority to compromise and settle all claims it defends under this section; and
e.	The damages have not resulted from negligence, misfeasance, or malfeasance of the District or its agents.
8.	Inoperative. Should the Association or its agent challenge the legality or enforceability of subparagraph 7, this Article shall immediately be considered inoperative and severed from this Agreement.
9.	Employee change of status. Once per month, the Board shall provide, in writing, to the Association, the name(s) of any employee who has a status change and the nature of that change and the status of all open positions.
14

c.	If the concern has progressed through the aforementioned guidelines without satisfactory resolution, the building/unit council chairperson may request a total building/unit council meeting and the building/unit administrator shall effectuate the building/unit council meeting to be chaired by the building/unit council chairperson.
d.	The building/unit council shall also serve as the communication vehicle to the constructional and/or
16
Executive Council or to any administrator, provided the possible resolution of the concern is under the authority of such administrator. The building/unit administrator shall be informed prior to any such action.
I.	SHARED DECISION MAKING
1.	Shared Decision Making (SDM) is a process for improving student learning through the involvement of all appropriate employees in the decision making process. It is a process through which those individuals responsible for the implementation of a decision at the building/ program level are actively and legitimately involved in making decisions.

A.	RIGHT TO ORGANIZE
Pursuant to Act 379 of the Public Acts of 1965, the Board hereby agrees that each employee shall have the right to organize, join and support the Association for the purpose of engaging in collective bargaining.

The Board shall not discriminate against any employee with respect to hours, wages or any terms or conditions of employment by reason of membership in the Association, participation in any activities in the Association or collective bargaining with the Board, or institution of a grievance, complaint or proceeding under this Agreement (or otherwise) with respect to any terms or conditions of employment.

E.	ANNEXATION OF ANOTHER CITY
In the event that other school districts shall become attached to the Grand Rapids District, employees who have acquired tenure in the annexed districts shall be given tenure by the Board. Further, the Board shall, immediately upon annexation, adjust the wages, hours and other conditions of professional employment of employees in the annexed districts to conform to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
F.	COPYRIGHT
Any copyrightable work prepared solely or in collaboration with others by employees within the course of their employment by the Board is the property of the Board.

years of employment and may be placed on a third (3rd) year of probation at the discretion of the Board.
2.	After completion of the probationary period, non-tenure employees shall not be terminated without just cause.
H.	PROFESSIONAL COMMITMENT
1.	The joint mission of the Grand Rapids Public Schools and the GREA is to ensure that all students are educated, self
19
directed, and productive members of society. Grand Rapids Public School professional employees are expected to create a positive learning climate for their students, build student achievement, develop strong parent-teacher communication, respect cultural and ethnic diversity, and work cooperatively to improve education continuously for Grand Rapids Public School students.
2.	An employee's primary responsibility is in the classroom or regular facility in which his/her basic assignment occurs. Additionally, as an employee of the Board, the employee also has student supervision responsibilities throughout the building and grounds during regular school hours at the place of employment and the responsibility to comply with citywide functions as assigned by supervision in accordance with this Agreement.
3.	Second only to actual teaching, the most valuable contact the District has with those it serves is between employees and parents or guardians. This contact is the prime basis upon which parents choose Grand Rapids Public Schools over the competition. To that end, the District and its employees commit to better acquaint our public with the dedication and high quality of our professional educators, and to form supportive learning teams with our parents and guardians. Employees will continue to make themselves reasonably available to discuss student progress and to provide support.
I.	ACADEMIC FREEDOM
1.	The parties seek to educate people in the democratic tradition, to foster a recognition of individual freedom and social responsibility, to inspire meaningful awareness of and respect for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and to instill appreciation of the values of individual personality. It is recognized that these democratic values can best be transmitted in an atmosphere which is free from censorship and artificial restraints upon free inquiry and learning and in which academic freedom for employees and students is encouraged, except that:
a.	The employee must be acting within accepted and/or
adopted curriculum and courses of study.
b.	The employee must submit a written request to the
building principal, the principal's designee or the immediate supervisor to obtain written approval prior to allowing a resource speaker into the class room.
c.	The employee must exercise responsibility and must realize that teaching places responsibility upon the employee to carefully consider the maturity level of
20
the student and the circumstances that surround the teaching/learning relationship.
2.	If a principal or immediate supervisor denies an employee's request to invite a resource speaker into his/her classroom, the employee may appeal the decision to a committee composed of one (1) Board Representative and one (1) Association Representative. The committee shall make a recommendation to the principal concerning its decision.
3.	Any employee accused of the improper use of academic freedom may be dismissed only after proof of alleged impropriety has been provided. Any allegation found to be untrue shall be completely removed from the employee's record and the employee's status shall be immediately restored if any reduction may have been made.
J.	TENURE ACT
As stated in the Michigan Teacher Tenure Act, no employee shall terminate his/her services with the Board during the current school year except by mutual agreement. Employees who do not provide notice of intent to resign at least 60 days before the beginning of the school year are subject to forfeiture of tenure status.
K.	RECORD KEEPING
1.	It is a professional responsibility of GREA members to record and maintain accurate student attendance records. The Board may promulgate and enforce reasonable policies to direct its workforce accordingly.
2.	It is a professional responsibility of GREA members to timely prepare and submit reports and forms as needed to obtain State or Federal funds, grants, entitlements and the like, including but not limited to Medicaid reimbursement forms, as directed or required.

M. EVALUATION
1.	Definitions
a.	Evaluation - A formal written record, signed by the immediate supervisor and employee, that is placed in the employee's permanent file.

2.	Who is evaluated
Tenured teachers and non-tenure employees who have completed the probationary period ("non-probationary employees"), are expected to be evaluated, utilizing the Progressive Evaluation Process described below, no more than once per three (3) school years, unless there is performance warranting special attention due to identified problems, in which case the teacher or non-probationary employee may be evaluated in other years. As stated in the Tenure Act, if the teacher or non-probationary employee is not evaluated at least once per three (3) school years, the teacher or non-probationary employee is deemed to be satisfactory. Probationary teachers are also to be evaluated using the Progressive Evaluation Process.
3.	The building/unit administrator or immediate supervisor shall present a copy of the current Evaluation of Performance form and/ or Revised Progressive Evaluation Process (P.E.P.) manual to each employee new to the Grand Rapids Public Schools and shall make it available upon request to those presently employed. P.E.P. will be utilized as a segment of the total evaluation procedure, unless the employee and the evaluator mutually agree to use another form, as described below.
A tenured teacher or non-probationary employee who has demonstrated consistent satisfactory performance and is scheduled for a sequenced PEP required by the Michigan Tenure Act and/or this Master Agreement may, in lieu of participating in a "traditional" PEP, engage in an alternative professional improvement plan/process. Such Participation in an alternative plan/process must be mutually agreed upon by and between the employee and their evaluating supervisor.	Failure to reach agreement
regarding an alternative will result in both evaluating supervisor and employee complying fully with the "traditional" PEP.
If an alternative plan/process is utilized, the evaluating supervisor will continue to be the primary person
22
responsible for the Evaluation - traditional or alternative. (Note: App F, para 1) The PLP and Teacher Specifications are examples of resources for an alternative plan/process; other resources may be utilized.
An alternative professional improvement plan/process may include:

E.	TRANSFER RELATIVE TO SENIORITY
When a vacancy exists, the Board will make every reasonable effort to relocate an employee at the employee's request. When the applicant(s) is certified by the State of Michigan and meets minimal requirements, as outlined in Section B. above, for the position, the applicant with the most seniority (as defined in Article 10, Section A.) shall be granted the transfer. It is acknowledged and supported that student achievement is furthered when the employee and building/program are committed to the same educational philosophies and strategies. Therefore, the District is encouraged to place as much information as is reasonably possible concerning building/program philosophy or strategy on the job posting so that employees can make an informed choice about bidding on a position.
F.	TRANSFER RELATIVE TO RACIAL BALANCE
Deviations from the transfer procedure may occur in accordance with the transfer requirements of Appendix D.
G.	TRANSFER PROCEDURE
1.	Application for a position may be made at any time during the posting period for that position.

5.	Any vacancy which occurs on or after two (2) weeks before the first staff report day of the school year shall be filled without posting at that time. However, the employee's assignment to the position shall not be permanent until after the position has been posted and filled as follows. For grades 9-12 and elective subjects in grades 6,7, and 8, these positions will be posted during the fall semester and the relocation will take place at semester break. For positions in adult education; special education; pre-K; grades K through 5; and core subjects in grades 6, 7, and 8, these positions shall be posted in the first spring posting and the relocation will take place at the start of the school year. For any Middle School positions assigned to both core and elective subjects, the determination will be made by using the majority of the position's assignment. Core subjects are Language Arts, Science, Social Studies, and Mathematics.
6.	Beginning the first day of K-12 student instruction and ending the sixth (6th) Friday of the school year, the Board will have a non-posting period for those Adult Education positions which are filled by Adult Education employees reassigned within the division. However, positions filled by recall or by newly hired employees during this time period will be posted, and involuntary transfers shall be in accordance with Section I. below.
7.	Notwithstanding the above, a voluntary transfer may be denied when the employee's immediate past performance evaluation or ongoing	performance	evaluation	is
unsatisfactory as reflected on a final or interim evaluation form on record at the time of the bid.
39
8.
When a position is defined as vacant, said position will be posted and filled as set forth in 1. through 7.above.
a.	If the filling of the original vacancy creates a second and third vacant position, that position(s) will be posted and filled subject to the provisions and limitations outlined in 1. through 7. above except if a third vacant position is created as a result of the last posting in July. That vacant position will be posted for filling the second semester or following school year as set forth in 5. above.
b.	A position that is not staffed during the school year, after the operation of 5. and 6. above, and any other vacancy which remains unfilled after the posting period above, shall be filled by recall if there is someone on the recall list who meets the requirements of the vacancy.
c.	A position which is filled on paper for the subsequent semester or fall and cannot be temporarily filled by recall may be filled by a temporary employee or new hire at the Board's discretion.
d.	An employee temporarily placed in a vacancy which has been filled on paper will be considered to be in a temporary placement and shall be given notice of involuntary transfer at the end of the appropriate semester.
9.	An employee shall be eligible for no more than one (1)
voluntary transfer per year.
10.	An employee who has successfully bid on a position in
a building and who may only be assigned on paper shall be considered as part of that new building/program staff for the following semester (or following fall) for the purpose of Section I.l.a.l) below.
I.	INVOLUNTARY TRANSFERS
1.	It is recognized that an involuntary transfer may be necessary at any time for the following reasons. There shall be two types of involuntary transfers.
a.	Type A Involuntary Transfer.
In the event it is necessary to accomplish one of the following:
1)	To reduce an over-staffed building or program in which case the person(s) in the affected building
40
or program with the lowest seniority shall be transferred out of the building or program.
2)	To close a building or eliminate a program.
3)	To maintain a racial balance in a particular building or program as set forth in the Federal District Court Order of 1973. (Appendix D)
b.	Type B Involuntary Transfer.
In the event it is necessary to accomplish one of the following:
1)	To resolve a personality conflict when both
parties agree there is such a conflict.
2)	An employee who volunteers for an involuntary
transfer shall receive a type B involuntary transfer notice, regardless of the initial reason for the involuntary transfer.
2.	Involuntary transfer process.
a.	No later than April 24 of each year, the Board shall provide written involuntary transfer notices to all individuals whose jobs are known to be eliminated for the following school year. The list of individuals and positions of those bargaining unit members with seven (7) or less years of seniority will be available at the District office (1331 Franklin SE) and the GREA office (3100 29th SE) .
b.	Individuals receiving a Type A involuntary transfer notice and who have twelve (12) or more years of seniority shall have until 4:00 p.m. on May 15 (unless May 15 is a Saturday or Sunday, in which case the deadline will be 4:00 p.m. of the following Monday) to notify Personnel Services in writing if they wish to exercise their right to displace another as per Article 9 I. 5. They shall also indicate the person/position whom they wish to displace. Personnel Services will then begin processing the displacement requests in seniority order. If more than one person with an involuntary transfer notice attempts to displace the same individual, the most senior of those involuntarily transferred will be awarded the position. If the person awarded the position vacates it at a later date, the displaced individual will be offered his/her contractual "right to home" (Article 91.4.). As per Article 9 I. 5., no more than 25% of a particular building or program staff may be displaced. The exercise of the bump of a less senior
41
person shall not preclude the later use of one or both of his/her two rights to bid into subsequently posted positions.
c.	For those individuals receiving notice of involuntary transfer after April 24 of each year, 2 a. and 2 b. above shall not apply, and all contractual provisions shall apply.
3.	Second Bid. An employee who receives a type A or B involuntary transfer notice shall have the opportunity to exercise a second successful bid.
4.	Right to Home. Any employee who receives a type A involuntary transfer notice shall maintain the right to return to his/her previous building or program in the event a position for which he/she is certified and qualified is reauthorized prior to or during the subsequent school year. The position will be offered to the employee without posting and will only be posted in the event the employee chooses not to accept it.
5.	Displacement. An employee with twelve (12) or more years of seniority who holds a type A involuntary transfer notice shall have the right to displace any other employee in the Bargaining Unit having seven (7) or less years of seniority providing the involuntarily transferred employee possesses the certification/endorsement and qualifications appropriate to the new assignment. This provision shall take full effect unless, by displacement, twenty-five (25%) of a particular building's and/or program staff is affected. The seven (7) or less years employee affected by the displacement may have the choice of lateral movement into an open position within the building and/or program, or become the applicant for the next available vacancy. An employee may not displace another employee if the displacement would cause the building or program to come out of racial balance as defined in Appendix D.
6.	No employee, qualified as defined in Section B. above, shall be involuntarily transferred out of a middle school or a high school if it would be possible by rearrangement of existing assignments or schedules within that building/program to cause an involuntary transfer of a lesser senior employee out of that building.
A teacher grieving an alleged violation of this provision must identify in the grievance the rearrangement of assignments or schedules which it is claimed should have been made.
42
J.	VACANCY DEFINED
1.	For the purpose of this Agreement a vacancy shall be defined as a position for which an employee is required and will be assigned or hired.
2.	A position vacant as a result of an approved leave of absence under Article 16, Section D. 4., and Article 17, Sections B. and F., will not be considered as a vacancy and may be filled by a temporarily contracted person.
3.	The actual vacancy created as a result of adding staff or as a result of the fact that an employee has retired, resigned, died, been discharged, or transferred shall be the vacancy posted.
4.	Positions held by employees laid off in the spring shall not be deemed vacant until after July 15th. Positions which are anticipated to be open as a result of first semester layoff will be posted prior to the start of the second semester.
5.	In addition to the requirements as outlined in Section B. above, posting of elementary positions shall include building and level, posting of secondary positions shall include building and department(s), all other postings shall include building(s) or program(s) of assignment. In bilingual postings, the language will be specified. Where appropriate, postings should include the name and number of a contact person and a description of the school, program and/or position expectations. Prospective applicants are encouraged to contact the school/program administrator and staff to become familiar with the expectations.
K.	NOTIFICATION OF TRANSFER
1.	The Association shall be informed of Pre K-12 and Special Education transfers in a format similar to that followed with newly hired employees. Adult Education transfers will be provided in a program format.
2.	Said notification will be made within fifteen (15) days of the transaction.
L.	EXPERIMENTAL OR PILOT PROGRAMS
Assignments or transfers to pilot or experimental programs (including charter schools) are granted at the discretion of the Superintendent or designee after consultation with the Association designee.	Upon completion of the pilot or
experimental program (the duration of which will be designated by the Superintendent or designee), the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement will then apply. However, either party may demand to bargain over any transition issues.
43
M.	UNFILLED POSITIONS
In the event there are no qualified applicants for a posted position, the District shall:
1.	first recall a qualified employee from the appropriate

10.	Should additional criteria be necessary to break a tie, the following priority will be utilized:
a.	The transfer shall be given to the person with the highest total years of service in positions represented by the Association; if this does not break the tie then,
b.	The highest number of total years of employment for the Grand Rapids Board of Education; if this does not break the tie then,
c.	The highest number of years teaching in that Division (i.e., Elementary, Secondary, Special Education, Adult Education); if this does not break the tie then,
d.	The highest total of graduate semester hours on record in the Office of Personnel Services; if this does not break the tie then,
e.	The date and time of the letter offering employment into the bargaining unit; if this does not break the tie then,
45
f.	The number of days the individual was employed as a substitute prior to hiring into the bargaining unit.
B.	LAYOFF
In the event it becomes necessary through layoff to reduce the number of employees within the Elementary, Secondary, Special Education and Adult Education divisions, the proposed reductions shall be discussed with the Association prior to implementation.
1.	The Board shall lay off by division (i.e., Elementary, Secondary, Special Education and Adult Education) to a point in time which may vary within each division.
2.	Any layoff pursuant to this Agreement shall automatically terminate the individual's employment contract and all Board paid benefits allowed therein. Upon recall, the individual's employment contract and all benefits under this Master Agreement shall be reinstated in full.

5.	Seniority shall continue to accrue through layoff subject only to the limitations of Section A., 4. above.
6.	Any bargaining unit member who collects unemployment compensation during the summer months (MESC's "summer denial period") and who is recalled before the start of his/her normal work year so that he/she suffers no actual loss of district compensation shall be obligated to reimburse to the District the amount of unemployment compensation, upon the written request of the District. In this case, the bargaining unit member shall be offered the choice of repayment by either payroll deduction of the appropriate amount in equal payments over the entire year or direct payment to the district by September 30.
C.	LAYOFF PROCESS
Written notice of layoff must be mailed to the affected bargaining unit members by the day following the first Board meeting of June, or June 4, whichever occurs first.
46
D.	RECALL
The Board will establish in each division a recall in inverse order of layoff. The Board will make every effort to relocate each laid off employee at the employee's request.
1.	Laid off employees shall be placed on a single master list which shall provide the opportunity for each employee to identify the areas for which he/she is qualified, certified and available. Each employee's current area will be identified in the first posting of the master recall list. "Area," as used herein, shall refer to: Elementary, Secondary, Vocational, Special Education, Bilingual, Adult Education. The list shall be constructed placing employees in seniority order and shall note current certification and/or qualifications as defined in Article 9, Section B.
2.	The list will be published and posted in buildings throughout the district. Specific distribution will be determined by mutual agreement between the Association and the Board.
3.	It is the responsibility of the employee to verify the accuracy of the certification and additional requirements identified on the list and to notify the Office of Personnel Services, in writing, within ten (10) working days of the date appearing on the list, if he/she wants to be added to or deleted from other areas for which he/she possesses certification. Proof of certification and/or additional requirements must be provided by the employee to the Office of Personnel Services.
4.	Following the ten (10) working day period, Personnel Services will republish, within ten (10) working days, the final list. Recall will be based on this final list unless the employee later submits verification of certification and/or additional requirements subsequently gained in other areas. At such time he/she will be added, according to seniority, to the newly appropriate area. Should the person added to the area, as a result of newly attained certification and/or additional requirements, have the greatest seniority in the area, said employee will be the next individual recalled but will not displace a less senior employee previously assigned.
5.	An employee on layoff shall initially be recalled by a letter sent by first class mail to the employee's address which is on file in the Office of Personnel Services.
A copy of the letter will be sent to the Association office on the same day. The employee shall notify Personnel Services, in writing, of acceptance within five (5) working days from the date of the postmark. An employee who does not timely respond shall be sent the same recall letter,
47
marked "final notice, " by certified mail and a copy of the letter will be sent to the Association the same day. If the employee fails to notify Personnel Services, in writing, within five (5) working days of the postmark stamped on the certified receipt or if the letter remains unclaimed for five (5) working days, it shall be exclusively presumed that said employee has terminated all employment with the District.
To eliminate the necessity of formal acceptance within the prescribed time limits above, an employee on layoff may leave a letter with the Office of Personnel Services indicating acceptance of a position should one be offered. The letter shall expire when school resumes session.
6.	The list will be divided at the tenured/ probationary point. No probationary employee shall be recalled if there is any tenured person in any area certified for the position.
7.	No new employee shall be hired while a laid off employee exists. Exception to this shall be made only when no one on the laid off list has the certification and/or additional requirements for the position.
8.	An employee recalled to a position with less time than worked during the previous year or recalled to a division other than that in which the employee had his/her name appear shall have the right to refuse such a position without jeopardizing his/her recall rights.

4.	When Act of God Days are rescheduled pursuant to the current State Aid Act or subsequent statutes, employees shall be required to report to work. Neither the closure of schools due to Acts of God, nor the rescheduling of such day(s) shall act to increase or decrease the amount of compensation due an employee in accordance with his/her step and level on the salary schedule, including all salary schedules/payments set forth in any of the appendices in this Agreement.
5.	Should it become lawful, during the term of this Agreement, to permit Act of God Days without a requirement that such days be rescheduled, the parties agree to be governed by the provisions of 1., 2. and 3. above.
6.	Should an Act of God Day cause the scheduling of additional student instruction time to meet the K-12 180-day or Adult Education hour requirement, the first make-up day for K-12 will be May 25, 2001. Additional day (s)/hours will be scheduled at the end of the school year.
G.	ADULT EDUCATION EXEMPTIONS
1.	Adult Education employees shall be exempted from the following: Article 12, Sections K., 9., M., and R.
2.	Adult Education employees, represented by the Association, are classified as follows:

b.	Contracted
Any employee working eight (8) hours or more per week will be placed on a contract (first year probationary) following the first semester of employment.
H.	REORGANIZATION
The Board will make every effort to avoid closure or reorganization of classrooms or programs after the school year has begun. However, in the event such a reorganization becomes necessary, a teacher affected by the reorganization shall be provided with at least one (1) full day of released time to prepare for the new assignment. Additional days may be granted at the discretion of the supervisor. In addition, if the
107
teacher has expended his/her personal funds for materials or supplies for the original assignment, the Board will reimburse him/her upon a showing of receipts.
I.	PROBLEM SOLVING QUALITY INITIATIVE (PSQI)
The parties agree to establish a schedule of regular problemsolving meetings (no fewer than 9 times per year) . The Association President, one Uniserv Director and two GREA members will represent the Association, who will be released as necessary. The Executive Director of Labor Relations or designee and three other representatives selected by the Executive Director of Labor Relations will represent the District. PSQI may establish subcommittees to make recommendations on various issues, as they see fit. Both sides may bring in resource people as they may find necessary. Letters of Agreement negotiated through this process will be subject to normal ratification processes.
J.	EDUCATOR'S ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (EAP)
Effective with the 2000-2001 school year, all employees will be eligible for up to $160.00 annual reimbursement. Employees may apply for reimbursement only once per year, and must apply on the appropriate form, with original receipts attached. Expenses eligible for reimbursement include classroom resources, field trip expenses, professional or classroom supplies, professional publications, conference fees, home internet access, and computer software. Additional categories of expenses may be approved by mutual agreement of the Board and the GREA EAP (formerly ECTAP) Committee. All expenses must be related to the employee's professional assignment. When calculating the value of a substitute day, $100 per day will be used to account for the actual payroll costs. (i.e., payroll taxes, retirement costs, etc.)
ARTICLE 22
RETIREMENT
ACCUMULATED LEAVE DAYS PAYMENT
Any employee who has reached the age requirement of the Michigan Public School Employees Retirement Act and has completed at least ten (10) years of service with the Grand Rapids Public Schools shall receive, upon retirement, thirty-five dollars ($35.00) for each day of unused leave days (accumulated at the time of retirement) or fifty dollars ($50.00) per year for Grand Rapids service, whichever is the greater.
108
ARTICLE 23
MENTOR TEACHERS
A. PURPOSE
1.	Each teacher in his or her first three years of classroom teaching as defined in section 1526 of the Michigan Revised School Code will be assigned a mentor. The mentor shall be available to consult and advise the new teacher. The purpose of the mentor assignment is to provide the new teacher with a peer who can offer assistance, resources and information in a non-threatening and collegial fashion. The parties pledge their mutual support of the mentor concept to assist new employees in meeting the high standards of the Grand Rapids Public Schools.
2.	In addition, the District may provide mentors to new employees not covered by section 1526 of the School Code. In this event, all of the terms of this article shall apply.
B.	MENTOR SELECTION/ASSIGNMENT
Employees interested in mentoring should notify their building principal or program supervisor at the beginning of the school year.
1.	Participation as a mentor shall be voluntary.
2.	Within the available pool of qualified mentors, new teachers and mentors shall be matched within the same building or program to the extent reasonably possible. Documents identifying the assigned mentors shall be submitted to Human Resources by the principal or program supervisor.
3.	As soon as reasonably possible after assignments are made, the list of mentors and new teachers shall be provided to the Association President.
C.	MENTOR AUTHORITY
Because the purpose of the mentor/new teacher match is to acclimate the new teacher and to provide necessary assistance toward the end of quality instruction in a non-threatening and collegial fashion, the parties agree that the relationship between the mentor and new teacher shall be confidential. Only the fact that a mentor was provided shall be mentioned on the new teacher's evaluation. The mentorship shall not be mentioned on the mentor's evaluation unless the mentorship was provided as the mentor's Professional Learning Plan (PLP) as described in section H. below. Neither the mentor nor the new teacher shall be called or required to testify as a witness in any grievance
109
or administrative hearing involving the professional competence of the mentor or new teacher, or the mentor relationship. However, nothing herein excuses the mentor or new teacher from testifying or cooperating with an investigation of alleged criminal or illegal conduct.
D.	ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT
Upon request, the Administration shall make available reasonable release time using the allocated visitation days currently allowed in Article 17, Section D., 3 so that the mentor may work with the new teacher in his/her assignment during the regular work day.
E.	NEW EMPLOYEE ORIENTATION
1.	The District will continue to provide three days of new employee orientation immediately prior to the start of the school year, which will include at least the following topics:
a.	Mentor/probationer relationships
b.	District/building/program policies and procedures
c.	Successful performance evaluation
d.	Statutes which impact probationers and all teachers
e.	Instructional resources
f.	School or program improvement
g.	Staff development
h.	Special Education/Regular Education relationships
i.	GREA shall have 120 minutes on the agenda for GREA membership orientation and GREA contract orientation.
2.	Employees hired after the beginning of the school year shall attend three evening orientation sessions scheduled by the District (typically no later than November 30) , to satisfy the three day orientation requirement.
F.	EXPECTATION
The expectation is that the mentor relationship shall last three (3) years.
G.	It is expected that mentors of first year new teachers shall document attendance at: A mentor orientation session scheduled by the district, up to four (4) organizational meetings with the new teacher, and meetings at least every other week with the new teacher.
H.	The principal/supervisor and the mentor can make any of the following alternate arrangements for the first year of the mentorship:
110
1.	If the mentor is scheduled for a sequenced evaluation, the principal/supervisor and mentor may agree to use the mentorship as the Professional Learning Plan (PLP).
2.	At the secondary level, mentoring may be assigned by mutual agreement pursuant to Article 12, K, 3 f.
3.	The Principal/Supervisor and mentor may agree on an appropriate amount of compensatory time for the mentor within the existing parameters for compensatory time (Article 12, R).
4.	The Principal/Supervisor may agree to compensate the mentor of a first year employee $400 from the building budget.
5.	Any other mutually acceptable arrangements.
I.	In addition, mentors of a first year new teacher who meet the expectations described above (Section G), may, with the approval of the principal/supervisor, use second Monday meeting time and/or the fourth Mondays designated for professional development, for mentoring activities in which case the time will count as professional development time for both the mentor and the new teacher. This time must be documented in accordance with State rules for such time.
J.	In the event the parties agree to continue the mentorship after the first year, the principal and mentor shall reach an agreement on the arrangement needed for the second and/or third year. If the compensation alternative is selected, the amount will be $200 in the second year of the mentorship and $100 in the third year from the building budget.
K.	The Staff Development Council will evaluate the program during the 2001-02 school year. This may include surveying principals, mentors and new teachers participating in the program, reviewing the materials provided to the participants, reviewing the training, and reviewing the contract language of this article. The Council will issue a written report no later than July 31, 2002. Any proposed contract language changes shall be subject to approval by Human Resources and GREA.
Article 24
SHARED TIME
A. DEFINITION
Shared Time is the program in which Grand Rapids Public Schools provides educational services to area non-public schools.
111
B.	AGREEMENT
This Agreement applies to Grand Rapids Education Association bargaining unit members who work in the shared time program. Unless specifically referenced in this article, all terms and conditions of the current Master Agreement apply.
C.	PROBLEM-SOLVING
Upon the request of either party, the Grand Rapids Education Association and the Grand Rapids Public Schools will meet to discuss problems or concerns with the implementation of the program. By mutual agreement, additional written letters of agreement may result from these discussions.
D.	WORK YEAR
Because the school calendars of the non-public buildings serviced vary, it is expressly recognized that the actual schedule may vary for shared time staff from the published GRPS school calendar. However, in no event shall a shared time teacher be required to report more than the total number of teacher attendance days for all GREA staff, as described in the Master Agreement. Shared time teachers are required to report the same total number of teacher attendance days as all GREA staff.
E.	INDIVIDUAL CALENDARS
On an on-going basis throughout the year, each shared time employee will communicate with his/her supervisor concerning the actual teacher attendance days, based on the needs of the building he/she services. If it appears the employee will report more teacher attendance days than provided in the Master Agreement, he/she and the supervisor will discuss how best to reduce the teacher attendance days. If it appears the employee will report less than the teacher attendance days required in the Master Agreement, he/she and the supervisor will discuss how best to increase the teacher attendance days, without decreasing the number of student contact days.
F.	MEETINGS
On the first and third meetings of each month, employees are required to attend shared time staff meetings at 3:45 p.m. Employees who miss part of the meeting are responsible for obtaining the information from the meeting by contacting the shared time office.
G.	PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES
In order to be eligible for paid conference exchange days, shared time teachers will attend 18 hours per year of school sponsored parent-teacher contact time as scheduled by their
112
assigned school(s). If 18 hours are not scheduled, the teacher shall discuss with his/her supervisor how to make up the 18 hours. If no agreement is reached, the teacher shall be assigned alternate duties to achieve the 18 hours.
H.	SCHOOL CLOSING DAYS
Shared Time teachers shall work at their assigned sites when the assigned sites are open, regardless of whether or not. Grand Rapids Public Schools is open or closed. On days when their shared time site is unexpectedly closed due to Acts of God, shared time teachers are not required to report for work unless needed to achieve the requisite number of teacher attendance days per paragraph E. herein. However, on an individual basis, they may choose to work at an alternate site, upon advance approval of the Shared Time Office. In this case, as part of the discussions with the supervisor, a teacher who needs to add teacher attendance days to the year should communicate to his/her supervisor that he/she plans to work on Acts of God days for the non-public school. They should discuss the location, type of work, etc. If for any reason this agreement cannot be followed, the teacher shall so inform the supervisor in advance or as soon as reasonably possible, and the supervisor will have the authority to assign the teacher to alternate duty.
I.	The Shared Time staff understand the need to maximize student FTE counts to fund the program, therefore, GREA agrees that the six (6) hours of professional development for a school improvement day (floating SIT) will not be used for staff development in shared time. Rather, the Shared Time staff will instruct the six (6) hours during the school year. Therefore, Shared Time staff will have thirty (30) hours of professional deve1opment time.
J.	In the event Shared Time teachers are teaching in programs which have school in session at any time during the Winter break for GRPS or Martin Luther King Day or the Friday before Memorial Day (if GRPS is not in session) the individual Shared Time teacher shall have the option of using personal days on any such days, subject to the following limitations:
1.	There must be a substitute known to be available to provide coverage by no later than five (5) school days before the intended absence.
2.	In the event there are not enough substitutes to provide coverage, GREA seniority order will be used to determine which requests will be honored.
3.	So that the Shared Time Office has adequate time to assess if sufficient substitutes are available, and so that staff whose requests cannot be honored are given adequate advance notice, the following are the deadlines for making requests for use of personal days:
113
a.	For Winter Break, the deadline is December 1.
b.	For Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the deadline is the last day of school before the GRPS Winter Break.
c.	For the Friday before Memorial Day (if GRPS is not in session), the deadline is March 28.
(This is an exception to Article 17 C.l.c. and d.)
K.	The parties agree that the Shared Time Office and Shared Time teachers shall make arrangements for the October professional development day to occur on another day, to maximize student contact time.

APPENDIX D
1.	Court Order
In July of 1973 Federal District Court Judge Albert J. Engle issued an opinion and Order in a metropolitan desegregation action identified as George and Carolyn Higgins et al, Plaintiffs vs. Board of Education of the City of Grand Rapids, Michigan et al, Defendants. The Order, primarily, provided for the elimination of racial identifiability of teaching and administrative personnel at the school level within the Grand Rapids Public Schools. The Court further retained jurisdiction in the lawsuit and along with representatives of the Grand Rapids Public Schools, the Michigan Education Association and the Grand Rapids Education Association, prepared a plan for the assignment and reassignment of teaching and administrative personnel which expeditiously, effectively and fully eliminated the racial identifiability of staff at the school level.
The approved plan established a percentage range of minority staff to determine parity at each school. This was determined by calculating the percentage of minority staff and arbitrarily provided for a five percent (5%) deviation to remain within the Order of the Court. (Subsequently, the Grand Rapids Public Schools have reported to Federal District Court each year regarding assignment of teaching personnel in regular K-12 schools using the five percent (5%) deviation applied to the existing percentage of minority personnel.)
2.	Implementation
The parties agree that implementation of this Appendix should not be unduly disruptive of existing staff. A joint committee is made to locating employees within their areas of certification and in locations of their choice consistent with the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and this Appendix.
In all calculations, only full-time employees assigned to positions represented by the Association assigned to the building/program will be counted. The percentage of minority employees within the secondary (middle and high school), elementary, Adult education and special education divisions shall be based on the percentage of minority employees as of the previous fall. As the minority percentage of employees increases that percentage shall be annually reviewed and raised if necessary. Consistent with the intent of the original court order, a five percent (5%) deviation shall be allowed. To be in compliance each elementary, secondary, Adult education and special education building/program shall have between fifteen percent (15%) and twenty-five percent (25%) minority employees.

3.	Contract
Deviations from the contract requirements of Article 9, Section D., of the Master Agreement will be made if the contractually appropriate transfer would either cause an out of compliance building/program not to move to compliance or cause an incompliance building/program to move out. In such cases the Board will transfer the racially appropriate candidate with highest seniority (Article 9, Section H., l.a.3) and H., l.b. Transfers).
The Board shall post positions with racial designations wherever needed.
When there is a vacancy for which there are no racially appropriate applicants and there are persons unassigned, the Board shall follow these steps:
a.	Place the highest senior employee of the appropriate race, from the unassigned list, who is properly certified and qualified for the position, offering this employee options whenever possible; unless this employee is nontenured and there are tenured, properly certified employees on the unassigned list (although they may be racially inappropriate for the vacancy).
b.	If a. above does not fill the vacancy, and there were applicants from existing staff, the highest senior appropriately certified and qualified applicant shall be moved into the position even though he/she may be racially inappropriate.
c.	If there were no applicants for the vacancy and a. above does not fill the position, then the Board shall place the highest senior properly certified and qualified employee unassigned even though he/she may be racially inappropriate for the vacancy.
d.	If the vacancy is not filled by operations a. through c. above, the Board shall hire a properly certified and qualified person of the needed racial group or force transfer the lowest senior appropriately certified and qualified employee of the needed racial group unless his/her transfer would cause the building to which he/she
132
is currently assigned, to go out of compliance. In such case the second lowest senior person shall be selected and so on.
If the end result of an Article 9, Section H.,	5.
displacement would cause an out of compliance building/program not to move toward compliance or cause an in compliance building/program to move out, the displacement order will be adjusted so th? racially appropriate person is displaced or the employee originally affected may select another site.
4.	Affirmative Action
The parties to this Agreement are mutually committed to increasing the number of racial minority employees recruited by and hired into positions within the Grand Rapids Public Schools represented by the Association. The parties further reaffirm their commitment to the goal set forth in Article 8, Section A., of the contract.
In an effort to improve the hiring and utilization of racial minorities, the parties have negotiated additional provisions into the contract that bear either directly or indirectly upon Affirmative Action goals. These provisions are Article 8, Section A., and Article 9, Sections E. and H., l.d.
There shall be established an Affirmative Action Monitoring Committee composed of an equal number of representatives of the Association and of the Board. The Committee shall monitor implementation of Article 8, Section A., of the contract. It shall also monitor the implementation of Article 9, Sections E. and H., l.d., and Article 10, Section C.
As part of this monitoring function, the Committee shall also issue a report after the first semester of each year detailing the number of employees hired and reassigned. The Committee shall report annually to the Superintendent on progress in complying with the requirements of this Appendix as well as hiring patterns and shall make recommendations as they deem appropriate to improve all aspects of racial balance and affirmative action.
For such reporting purposes the following groups of employees shall not be counted as new hires:
a.	Part-time employees who become full-time employees
b.	Recalled employees
133
APPENDIX E
State Required Minimum Number of Hours of Pupil Instruction

5.	Employees assigned to the program continue to be entitled to take every third summer off without pay, subject to the restriction that they must schedule it by August 15, 2 001 for the summer of 2002.
6.	The parties agree to negotiate a calendar for 2002-2003 if a waiver is sought by the District or KISD.
7.	The 230 day salaries for 2001-2002 will be calculated in the following way:
a)	The K-12 salary schedule for 2000-2001 will be divided by 193 to establish base daily pay rates for each pay step.
b)	The negotiated percentage increase shall be applied to each of these steps.
c)	Each daily pay amount will be multiplied by 231, the number of earnings days for "230 day employees" in the 2001-2002 school year.

APPENDIX L
Procedures and Guidelines for Collaborative Planning
1.	The Professional Development/School or Program Improvement/ Collaborative Planning Days (October 19,	2001, October 18
2002, Second Mondays and fourth Mondays in November, January and April) are planned sessions in which teachers and administrators at a site work together as a whole group or in teams/workgroups on activities or projects intended to achieve the mission of the school and improve student achievement.
2.	The activities should focus on achieving the objectives and strategies of the School Improvement Plan. These activities should meet the needs of the school and should be mutually agreed upon by the administration and the teaching staff. The administrators and teachers of a school should plan the day together. Teachers and administrators should agree upon a process for planning the day. The agreed upon process should include one of the following methods:
•	Agree to have the School Improvement Team and administrator plan the Collaborative Planning Day activities
•	Select a special team of teacher representatives to meet and plan with the school administrator(s)
•	Agree to have the School Improvement Team and administrator plan the activities in an "open meeting" format in which any interested teacher on the staff may join in the discussion and planning for the use of the time
In all planning for the Collaborative Planning Days, the school's needs as described in their improvement plan and/or mission should be the focus of the activities. The planning group should be as inclusive as possible and attempt to seek input and suggestions from all interested teachers during the planning.
The school principal and the teacher-planning group (outlined above) must, mutually agree to the Collaborative Planning time activities.
3.	The activities for the day may include but are not limited to the items listed below. These types of activities may be done in various combinations:
•	Whole staff planning and problem solving
•	Meeting in teams or workgroups (e.g.	department,
instructional "families," grade levels, etc.)
•	Curriculum planning (e.g. curriculum mapping, teaching and learning activities, planning thematic units, etc.)
148
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
•	Planning strategies/activities related to the School Improvement Plan
•	Analyzing school and student data - planning appropriate action
•	Staff training based on building needs

The identified activities of all staff on the Collaborative Planning Day should be goal oriented, clearly articulated and have a specific outcome or result related to the guidelines above. Schools might consider that closing activities for the day are planned in which all staff or teams are responsible to explain, demonstrate and/or display their work as appropriate. These closing activities should be undertaken as a unifying event with all staff in order to reinforce everyone's work, improve communication, share ideas, instill pride as well as provide accountability for the planned outcomes.
4.	As clarification and assistance in planning, the following guidelines are provided:
The	collaborative	time is intended to be -	The collaborative time is not -
Time in which all teachers are engaged as either a whole staff or in teams to accomplish an agreed upon goal for the school	Intended for individual teacher planning or preparation of the classroom (e.g. preparing bulletin boards, cleaning, getting supplies, etc.)

A time for teachers and administrators to collaborate, plan and share ideas to further the achievement of students	For preparing individual lesson plans or student records
Time	for	developing	and organizing instructional teams	For gathering teaching materials and supplies
An opportunity for problem solving on issues related to the school, teams or workgroups	For conducting school functions such as open houses, conferences, orientations, etc.
An opportunity for planning thematic units by teams of teachers, researching and reviewing materials	
5.	It is the intent of the district-wide Collaborative Planning Committee to provide follow-up and support to the Collaborative Planning time by conducting a survey and evaluation of the use of the time and whether or not it achieves the desired outcomes set forth in this agreement.

APPENDIX M
MEA Groups
DRUG & ALCOHOL AGREEMENT
The Board of Education of the Grand Rapids Public Schools ("Board") and the Grand Rapids Education Association and Grand Rapids Educational Support Personnel Association and Grand Rapids Association of Educational Office Personnel and GRACEN and GREOA ("Associations") agree to the following conditions which shall govern drug and alcohol testing of all bargaining unit members who are not subject to the Omnibus Employee Transportation Act of 1991 (OTETA):
1.	Statement of Philosophy. The Grand Rapids Public Schools recognizes the contributions of individual employees and their right to make choices for which they accept responsibility. Therefore, the parties agree that there should be opportunities for employees to seek counseling and/or rehabilitation. Further, the parties recognize that off-duty drug or alcohol use is not subject to testing unless it results in impaired at-work performance, or otherwise violates this agreement, Board Policy or work rules.
Therefore, the Board and Association agree that the performance of job responsibilities with detectable levels of blood or breath alcohol (.04 or above), illegal, or unauthorized drugs in employees1 bodies is a violation of Board Policy or work rules. ("At work with detectable levels".)
2.	Reasonable suspicion. Only reasonable suspicion testing shall occur; when it occurs it will be subject to the terms of this agreement. Reasonable suspicion must be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations at work concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odor that the employee may be at work with detectable levels of alcohol (. 04 or above), illegal or unauthorized drugs.
3.	DOT or Comparable Training. At Board expense, and with no use of Association Days (if applicable) , up to five (5) Association representatives from each bargaining unit may participate in the reasonable suspicion training conducted in 1999-2000, excluding DOT-covered employees, and thereafter as mutually agreed. Association representatives will only be paid for this time if it occurs during their normal work hours. Administrators who make a determination of reasonable suspicion must have been trained regarding reasonable suspicion training within the thirty-six (36) months prior to the determination.
150
4.	Test Reports, Confidentiality. Test results will be reported to the Board and will be maintained by the Board in a separate medical file with restricted access1. The Board will provide results to the Association only after the employee consents in writing to the disclosure. Except as expressly required by law, the Board will not release test results without the employee's written consent. Upon written request at any time, the Board will provide the Association with the contents of all investigatory files pertaining to violations of this agreement, excluding test results (unless the employee has consented.)
5.	Notice to Employees. The Association will use its best efforts to provide a copy of this agreement to all employees for ratification. The Board will use its best efforts to distribute this agreement to all employees within thirty (30) days after ratification. It shall also be distributed at new employee orientations. The Board will have it available for employee review in all District buildings.
6.	Drug and alcohol testing. All testing will occur at a laboratory certified to conduct DOT testing. All testing expenses shall be paid by the Board, unless otherwise stated in this agreement. The test protocols contained in 49 CFR part 40 which apply to the reasonable suspicion testing mandated by OTETA, including the split sample, shall be used. The drug test used shall be the N.I.D.A.-like type and automatic M.R.O. (Medical Review Officer) review, including any revision to the N.I.D.A.-like test. The N.I.D.A.-like test currently detects amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, opiates, and phencyclidine (POP).
Employees may request a split sample test. The employee will pay for the analysis of the split sample test at the time of the request. If the analysis of the split sample is below the current N.I.D.A.-like threshold, the Board will reimburse the employee the cost and the test shall be considered negative.
The alcohol test used shall be the breath alcohol test. If an employee produces a positive breath alcohol test (.04 or above), he/she may request a blood alcohol test at employee expense. The Board will consider the results of all tests conducted before determining what, if any action to take. If the employee is unable to produce sufficient breath volume after three attempts, the employee may be directed by the Board to submit to a blood alcohol test at Board expense.
7.	Definition of "at work." This agreement is applicable only when the employee is performing responsibilities for the Board, immediately before the employee is to perform such responsibilities, or just after the employee has ceased
1 The medical files of an employee are kept separate from the personnel records. Access is limited to those with a legitimate business reason to have access.
151
performing such responsibilities. Extra-duty responsibilities for which the employee is compensated, such as coaching field trips, evening functions, etc. are included in the definition of "at work."
8.	Self-Identification. Employees who believe they have a substance abuse problem are encouraged to self-identify Or voluntarily refer themselves to the Employee Assistance Program (E.A.P.), or seek other treatment options. To this' end employees who voluntarily request assistance or self-identify' before discipline is pending or imposed pursuant to this agreement, will not be subject to discipline because of the self-identification. However, an employee may not avoid disciplinary consequences by taking such action after receiving notice of a directive for reasonable suspicion testing. In addition, self-identification or referral will not preclude the Board from disciplining an employee for misconduct, which would otherwise constitute grounds for discipline.
9.	Board Right to Mandate Test Upon Reasonable Suspicion.
a.	First Incident.
1.
If two trained administrators, using the "Observed Behavior-Reasonable Cause Record" (which is attached to this agreement) have made a determination that there is reasonable suspicion that an employee may be at work with detectable levels of alcohol (. 04 or above), illegal, or unauthorized drugs in their body, the employee shall receive a Notice of Rights (attached). The Notice of Rights shall be signed by the employee to indicate that it has been received, and a copy shall be placed in an investigative file. The issuance of the Notice of Rights may not be grieved or arbitrated. The Notice of Rights is not considered discipline nor is it evidence of substantiated unprofessional conduct. No further action will take place unless there is another reasonable suspicion incident (within 36 months of the issuance of the notice) in which two trained administrators make a determination that there is reasonable suspicion that an employee is at work with detectable levels of alcohol (.04 or above), illegal, or unauthorized drugs in their body.
2 .
Upon the first occurrence of reasonable suspicion, the employee will be placed on sick leave for the remainder of the day/shift and transported home. If the test results are positive, the employee may face adverse disciplinary consequences, up to and including discharge.
152
3.	The employee shall be referred to the E.A.P. for an evaluation. The evaluation shall be during regular work hours and at no expense to the employee. Failure on the part of the employee to attend and cooperate without good cause shall subject the employee to discipline, up to and including discharge. The E.A.P. counselor will report to the Board only that the employee	attended.	All other information	is
confidential.
4.	The employee may submit a written statement, not exceeding five pages, to be appended to the Notice maintained in	the investigative file. At the
employee's option, he/she may submit to the Board evidence of a medical condition, which might be mistaken for substance abuse. The employee may voluntarily request a drug and alcohol test upon the first occurrence of reasonable suspicion. If the test is negative, the Notice of Rights will not be issued or placed in an investigative file. If the test results are positive, the employee may face adverse disciplinary consequences, up to	and including
discharge.	Labor Relations will	review the
investigative file to ensure that the procedures described herein were substantially followed.
5.	If, after thirty-six calendar months, there is no similar incident, the investigatory file and Notice of Rights shall be of no effect and/or be destroyed. Any further incidents shall be .considered a first incident.
b.	Subsequent Incident(s). If an employee has received a Notice of Rights within the past 36 months and two trained administrators, using the "Observed Behavior-Reasonable Cause Record" determine that there is reasonable suspicion the employee is at work with detectable levels of alcohol (.04 or above), illegal, or unauthorized drugs in his/her body, the Board shall direct the employee to submit to a test. The observation must be made by two trained administrators based on the "Observed Behavior-Reasonable Cause Record" which is attached to this agreement. Before the Board directs the employee to submit to a test, the Board will advise the employee of his/her right to Association representation. The unavailability of a particular Association representative will not delay the testing process. In unusual circumstances (such as late night) a telephone contact with an Association representative will suffice. Upon being so directed, the employee must immediately cooperate and submit to the test. The individuals who make the determination of reasonable suspicion shall not conduct the test. The Board will transport the employee to the test site. At the time of the observation, or just after the observation, the
153
trained administrators will each describe in writing the observations that led to the reasonable suspicion. However, not later than within one scheduled business day-after the observation, the trained administrators will submit to Labor Relations the "Observed Behavior-Reasonable Cause Record" and any other pertinent information concerning the basis for the reasonable suspicion.
c.	Refusal to test. Any employee who is directed to submit to a test and who refuses shall be subject to discipline, up to and including discharge. Refusal to test shall include (but is not limited to) : refusing to provide a useful specimen; knowingly contaminating or attempting to dilute the specimen; or failing to cooperate in the timely completion of the test.
10.	Discipline. The Board will determine the discipline, up to and including discharge, to be imposed as a result of a positive test. All discipline shall be subject to just cause and the applicable grievance arbitration procedure. Nothing in this agreement will preclude the Board from disciplining an employee for misconduct which would otherwise constitute grounds for discipline.
11.	Use of another's prescription. An employee with a positive test who claims that he/she took the medication prescribed for another person, shall have up to three (3) business days to produce evidence to support this claim. When an employee provides reasonable evidence to support their use of another person's prescription, the test results shall be considered negative, only on the first occurrence. The employee will then be warned in writing by the Board that this practice is illegal and will be considered a positive result on the next occurrence.
