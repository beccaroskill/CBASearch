RE: Tentative Agreement
March 2,2004	.
PROFESSIONAL AGREEMENT
RECENED MftR 0 2 2W*

Dear Board Members,
After marathon informal meetings over the weekend, I believe we have reached agreement • on contract terms for the current year. •
The resolutions we reached were not 100% what we might have hoped for, but do represent' contract terms I can wholeheartedly, recommend to you for approval. I will plan to attend your board ; meeting on Thursday evening to answer any questions you might have. Also, although we have cancelled the Factfinding hearing scheduled for this Saturday, there will still be a meeting at the District Office to formalize tentative agreement. I hope that some or all of you can attend, both to show support for getting an agreement this year and, maybe, to set a positive tone as we begin bargaming again.	।
The meetings this past weekend were with Les.Kuhns, Sharon Kailey, Mark. Braun and me. It is my opinion that the discussions were extremely frank and open-much more so than when there is an "audience.”
The actual terms agreed to do not differ significantly ftom where we were last summer. But with the school year over half over and a probable 45-60 days before the conclusion of Factfinding and its aftermath, it seemed to be in the best interest of both sides to reach agreement where we .could and move forward.
The articles with tentative agreement are attached. In addition, the board had noticed five articles for complete deletion from the contract. NEA-T had objected to those deletions. The compromise we reached was that the articles would sunset at the end of this contract year and that .USD 501 and NEA-T would seek a determination bythe Kansas Department of Human Resources as ;to whether these issues are mandatorily negotiable. If the final decision is that they are not i mandatory, they are gone for good; if they are mandatory they will be returned to the agreement and I either side can .then notice them for bargaining in the future. •	. ....________

APPENDIX B
PROCEDURE FOR REDUCTION IN FORCE
Once a determination has been made that a reduction in force will be necessary the following steps will be completed in the order listed below to determine which professional employees’ positions will be reduced. This procedure will apply to non-probationary teachers.
i	J
Step 1 Qualifications	|
A' review of licensure/endorsement will be conducted to determine which professional employees hold credentials which qualify them for available positions in the district. Those who do not hold credentials appropriate to available positions will be reduced. Professional employees who hold both an appropriate license/endorsement and certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards will be retained. If additional reductions will be necessary the process will advance to step 2
Step 2 Evaluations
A; review of the most recent three (3) evaluations of the remaining displaced professional employees will be conducted. Employees with ope or more evaluations with recommendations for probational renewal or nonrenewal will be reduced- If additional reductions will be necessary the process will advance to step 3,
Step 3 Seniority
A review of the professional experience of the remaining displaced professional employees will be conducted. Employees will be assigned 1
point per year of credited professional experience. An additional 1 point per year will be assigned for experience in the area to which the employee could be assigned. Reductions will be accomplished by first reducing those with the fewest points and working up the list in point order until sufficient professional employees have been reduced. Should two or more professional employees have an equal number of points, those with the lesser experience in the area(s) of available positions will be reduced before those with greater experience. Should two or more
.dE 14:58 FAI 785 273 7580 KASB
@011/025
professional employees have an equal number of points, those with lesser experience in Topeka Public Schools will be reduced before those with greater experience. If, after applying these factors, two or more professional employees are still equally situated and some will be retained and others reduced, step 4 will be used to break ties.
Step 4 Other Considerations
In the even that a tie must be broken between twp or more employees to determine which will be retained and which reduced, the following factors will be used in the order listed to determine the order of I
reduction.
: A. Average annual hours spent in service to the district, paid and unpaid, beyond time spent to accomplish the duties of the primary contract, based on the following scale;
1-40 hoars 47-80 hours 81-120 hours 121-160 hours 161-200 hours 201+hours
5 points 10 points 15 points 20 points 25 points 30 points Each individual employee may choose to use the most recent one , two, or three years of experience to average annual service.
B. Placement on column on the salary schedule, one point per column starting with the BS column
i C. Additional license/endorsements beyond what is required for any j available position, one point for each additional endorsement.
I D. Professional development points; credited by any Professional i Development Council recognized by the Kansas State Department of Education which were earned during the five years immediately preceding the notice of a reduction in force, one point for each eight PDC points.
,E- In the event that a tie still exists, the superintendent will decide which employee(s) will remain.
