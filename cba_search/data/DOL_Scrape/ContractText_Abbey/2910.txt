ARTICLE 1	- SCOPE OF AGREEMENT
Section 1.
This Agreement is made and entered into by and between the State of Oregon (hereinafter the "Employer"), acting through its Department of Administrative Services, Labor Relations Unit on behalf of the Department of Corrections (hereinafter the "Agency"), and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFL-CIO) (hereinafter the "Union"), and is binding upon the Union and the Employer and all designated representatives of the Union and the Employer.
Section 2.
The Agencies recognize the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for the employees within the certified or recognized bargaining units. All aspects of the employees' wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment shall be determined by this Agreement, except in regard to recruitment and selection of applicants for initial appointment to State service. The terms and conditions of employment set forth in this Agreement shall apply to all classified positions (except temporary positions and those positions excludable by ORS 243.650) within the appropriate bargaining units within the Department of Corrections which are:
a.	Security Unit - Encompasses all classified employees in strike-prohibited classifications excluding supervisory and confidential employees as defined in ORS 243.650 and employees covered by the Association of Oregon Corrections Employees at Oregon State Penitentiary, Oregon State Correctional Institution, South Fork Forest Camp and Mill Creek Correctional Facility.
b.	Oregon State Penitentiary Minimum - Encompasses all strike-prohibited classified employees, excluding supervisory and confidential employees defined in ORS 243.650, working within the Oregon State Penitentiary Minimum.
The parties agree that the term "classified employee" does not include temporary employees appointed under the provisions of ORS 240.380 or part-time employees who regularly work thirty-two (32) hours or less per month.
Section 3.
If the Agency establishes a new position which is not clearly excluded from the bargaining unit under ORS 243.650 or reclassifies an existing bargaining unit position, the Employer shall notify the Union in writing within seven (7) days following the action, as to whether or not it believes the classification to be within the bargaining unit. The Union must notify the Employer in writing within ten (10) days from receipt of the notification if it disagrees about the inclusion or exclusion of the classification in the bargaining unit or the matter becomes closed. If notice of the disagreement is received within the ten (10)-day period, the parties shall meet within fourteen (14) days of above notification to discuss the matter. If an agreement is not reached within thirty (30) days, the Union may submit the matter to the Employment Relations Board. Should the matter not be submitted to the Employment Relations Board within the specified thirty (30)-day period, the matter shall be considered resolved.
Section 4.
This contract incorporates the sole and complete Agreement between the Agency and the Union resulting from negotiations held pursuant to the provisions of ORS 243.650 et seq and supersedes all prior labor contracts. It is acknowledged that during negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each party had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter appropriate for collective bargaining and that the understandings and agreements arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity are set forth in this Agreement. It shall not be modified in whole or in part except by another written instrument duly executed by the parties.

Section 5.
a.	The parties agree that the Human Resource Services Division Personnel Policies and Agency Procedures relating to their implementation are without effect upon the Agency or members of the bargaining units.
b.	Other policies, procedures, and rules of the Agency which directly relate to mandatory subjects of bargaining as defined by statute and which affect bargaining unit members on the day this Agreement becomes effective shall be continued, unless modified or deleted elsewhere in this Agreement. Should the Agency wish to change such a policy, procedure, or rule, or to issue a new one, notice will be given to the Union. If the Union believes the policy, procedure, or rule to be unreasonable, then within seven (7) days of the date upon which the Union knows, or by reasonable diligence should have known, of the subject action, the Union shall request that the Agency meet to discuss the issue.
c.	Such meeting shall occur within fifteen (15) days of:
1.	Agreement that the issue is a mandatory subject, or
2.	An Employment Relations Board ruling that the issue is a mandatory subject of bargaining.
If agreement which alters the policy, procedure or rule is reached, it shall be reduced to writing and signed by both parties. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement within fourteen (14) days following the Level C meeting and the Union continues to believe the policy, procedure, or rule to be unreasonable, it shall notify the Agency in writing of its intent to submit the matter to interest arbitration. Such written notification must be made during the fifteen (15)-day period immediately following the above mentioned fourteen (14)-day period. Failure to file such written notification within the prescribed time shall be understood by both parties to waive the Union's right to any further objection.
d.	The parties shall meet within the five (5) days immediately following receipt of notification of the Union's desire to arbitrate and select an arbitrator. Selection of an arbitrator shall be as prescribed in Article 51, Grievance and Arbitration.
e.	The parties agree that the decision or award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on each of the parties and that they will abide thereby, unless the award is vacated pursuant to statute. The power of the arbitrator in this process shall be limited to determine whether the policy, procedure, or rule is unreasonable.
If the arbitrator's ruling is that the policy, procedure, or rule is unreasonable, the Agency shall immediately withdraw the policy, procedure or rule.
f.	The arbitrator's fee and expenses shall be paid by the losing party. If, in the opinion of the arbitrator, neither party can be considered the losing party, then such expenses shall be apportioned as in the arbitrator's judgment is equitable. All other expenses shall be borne exclusively by the party requiring the service or item for which payment is to be made.
g.	Time limits specified in this procedure must be observed, unless either party requests a specific extension of time, which, if agreed to, must be stipulated in writing and shall become part of the record.
ARTICLE 2	- TERM OF AGREEMENT

Negotiations for a successor agreement will commence between January 2, 2007, and February 15, 2007, or sooner upon mutual agreement of the parties.
ARTICLE 3	- UNION SECURITY
Section 1.	New Employees.
The Agency agrees to inform all new employees hired into positions included in the bargaining unit of the Union's exclusive recognition, and shall provide all present and future employees in the bargaining unit with a copy of its Agreement, provided the parties shall share equally in the costs of preparation and distribution of the Agreement. The Agency agrees to allow duly certified Union Representatives thirty (30) minutes, when new employee orientation classes are held, to speak to new employees about the Union's exclusive recognition, its benefits, and services available to the membership. This time will not be used for discussion of labor-management disputes.
If the Union Representative is an employee of the institution, the representative will be allowed time off without loss of pay to make the presentation.
Section 2.	Union Access.
Accredited representatives of the Local, District Council 75, or International American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, upon proper introduction and notice, shall have reasonable access to the premises of the Agency during all working hours to conduct Union business (with appropriate observation of the security regulations of the Agency). During periods of bona fide emergency, this provision may be temporarily suspended by the Agency as required for the duration of the emergency.
Section 3.
Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the internal business of the Union shall be conducted by the employees during non-duty time.
All policies, procedures, and rules, and all provisions of this Agreement shall be applied equitably among employees to whom they apply.
Section 4.	Stewards.
The Union may select, and shall certify in writing to the Agency, employees to act as Union Stewards. Stewards shall have authority to investigate and resolve grievances and to distribute Union informational material provided that such activity does not interfere with the regular work routine with prior approval of management. The investigation and processing of employee grievances will be permitted during working hours without loss of compensation. If the permitted activities would interfere with either the Steward's or the grievant's duties, management shall, within the next working day, arrange a mutually satisfactory time for the requested activities. Time spent in grievance activities without the proper notification and release by an appropriate supervisor involved will be considered unauthorized leave without pay for both the Steward and the grievant. An employee may request and have present a Shop Steward or Union Representative at any formal discussion on disciplinary actions, or grievance proceedings, or any other matter that might adversely and substantially affect their future employment, pay, or chances for promotion.
Management will provide written notification to an officer of the Local Union and the Union Business Agent of an impending disciplinary action (suspension, reduction, demotion or dismissal) against an employee.
Section 5.	Union Business Leave.
AFSCME shall indemnify and hold the State and Agency harmless against any and all claims, damages, suits, or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the Employer and/or Agency for the purpose of complying with this provision.

Not to exceed a maximum of four (4) employees at any one time, employees elected to Union office or otherwise selected by the Union to conduct Union business that takes them away from their employment may be granted leave without pay or leave with pay reimbursed by the appropriate AFSCME local, within thirty (30) days of receipt of billing, to the Agency for a reasonable period of time not to exceed seven (7) working days, upon seven (7) days' advance notice by the Union. The determination for granting such leave shall be made by the Agency based on operational needs of the Agency. Leave will be requested through the normal agency procedure.

Such requests will be granted unless the affected Functional Unit can demonstrate that the employee’s absence would adversely impact the operating needs of the employee’s work unit.
If the Agency cannot grant such leave based on lack of funding, the Union may offer to reimburse, within thirty (30) days of receipt of billing, the Agency for required overtime costs (including: salary, benefits, paid leave time, pensions and all other employer-related costs) to allow the designated employee to take Union business leave. The Agency and the Union agree to meet and discuss and clarify if any overtime costs are to be paid by the Union prior to the requested leave.

The amount to be deducted shall be certified to the Agency by the Treasurer of the Union, and the aggregate deductions shall be remitted monthly together with an itemized statement, to the Treasurer of the Union.
Section 8.	Fair Share.
The terms of the contract have been made for all employees in the bargaining unit, not solely for members of the Union. The parties recognize that it is fair that each employee in the bargaining unit should bear a fair share of the costs incurred by the Union in meeting its responsibilities as a recognized bargaining unit representative.
Each employee not exempt under recognition of this contract shall, within thirty (30) days of hire, have deducted monthly from their pay by the State, a sum equal to the amount of current Union dues. Such sum shall constitute the employee's dues if the employee is a member of the Union, or shall otherwise constitute that employee's fair and equitable contribution to the expenses of administering this contract on the employee's behalf by the Union. Such deduction shall be made only if accrued earnings are sufficient to cover the service fee after all other authorized payroll deductions have been made.
The deduction and disbursement to the Union of dues and service fees provided herein shall be accomplished monthly by the State and payment to the Union shall be made on or before the fifteenth day following the date such deductions were made.
Any employee who is a member of a bona fide religious organization which teaches as a doctrine of faith that payment of Union dues is wrong may follow the procedures allowed by State law to have in lieu of dues payment paid to a non-religious charity.
The Union shall indemnify and save the Agency harmless against any and all claims, damages, suits or other forms of liability which may arise out of any action taken or not taken by the Agency for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this section.
Section 9.	Employee Statistics.
The Labor Relations Unit and the Agency will, upon request of the Union, provide any regularly produced computer runs containing non-confidential statistics of the Union's bargaining unit members. This will include one (1) printout annually showing names and addresses of all bargaining unit employees and monthly information currently furnished. Any costs incurred in compiling and photocopying these statistical reports under this Agreement shall be billed to the Local Union making the request.
ARTICLE 4	- UNION/MANAGEMENT MEETINGS
Section 1.	Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to promote harmonious relations between the parties.
Section 2.	Meetings.
Either the Agency Head/Functional Unit Manager or the Union President may request a meeting.

Off duty personnel participating in such meetings must do so on their own time. The actual meeting time will be
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security

established through mutual agreement. Refusal of either party to meet on a given subject does not constitute a contract violation.

Necessary bills for implementation of the other provisions shall be submitted promptly by the Department of Administrative Services to the Legislative Assembly and both parties shall jointly recommend passage of the funding and statutory changes.
Nothing in this provision shall be construed as to require the Governor to call a special session of the Legislature.

ARTICLE 6	- EFFECT OF LAWS AND RULES
Section 1.
This Agreement is subject to all applicable existing and future laws of the State of Oregon. In the event of a conflict between a provision of this Agreement and a rule or regulation of the Department of Administrative Services or any of its Divisions, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.

The Agency further agrees to provide written procedures which will outline the proper methods for requesting this legal defense.
ARTICLE 7 - SEPARABILITY OF PROVISIONS
If any provision of this Agreement shall be found to be invalid by any court having jurisdiction in respect, thereof, such findings as to such provision shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement, and all other terms and provisions hereof shall continue in full force and effect as set forth herein. In such event, the parties shall enter into immediate negotiations for the purpose of arriving at a mutually satisfactory replacement for such term or provision.

Section 4.

ARTICLE 10	- MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
The Union agrees that the Employer retains all inherent rights of management and hereby recognizes the sole and exclusive right of the State of Oregon, as the Employer, to operate and manage its affairs in accordance with its responsibilities to maintain efficient governmental operations. The Employer retains all rights to direct the work of its employees, including, but not limited to, the right to hire, promote, assign, transfer, demote, suspend, or discharge employees for proper cause; to schedule work; determine the processes for accomplishing work; to relieve employees from duties because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons; to take action as necessary to carry out the missions of the State; or determine the methods, means, and personnel by which operations are to be carried on, except as modified or circumscribed by the terms of this Agreement. The retention of these rights does not preclude any employee from filing a grievance, pursuant to Article 51, Grievance and Arbitration, or seeking a review of the exercise of these rights, when it is alleged such exercise violates provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 11	- CONTRACTING OUT
The Agency may determine to contract or subcontract work provided that, as to work which is presently and regularly performed by employees in the bargaining unit, the Agency agrees to notify the Union and negotiate the decision and impact of the pending action.

ARTICLE 12	- INSURANCE
Section 1.
An Employer contribution will be made for each eligible employee who has at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in the month.
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
11
The contribution for eligible participating part time employees with eighty (80) or more hours paid time for the month will be prorated based on the ratio of paid regular hours to full-time hours to the nearest full percent.
a.	Effective January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2005, the Employer shall make a contribution sufficient to cover the premium costs for PEBB health, dental and basic life benefits chosen by each eligible full-time employees who has at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in a month.
These Employer contributions are understood to currently cost a monthly composite of eight hundred eighteen dollars ($818) per eligible full-time employee statewide.
b.	For plan year 2006, the Employer will increase its monthly contributions a sufficient amount beyond the 2005 statewide composite ($818) to continue to fully pay the PEBB health, dental and basic life benefits chosen by each eligible full-time employee who has at least eighty (80) paid regular hours in a month.
c.	For plan year January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007 the Employer will increase its monthly contributions by up to twelve percent (12%) of the actual monthly composite resulting for plan year 2006, should the cost of insurance premiums increase by that amount or more.
Section 2.	PEBB Petition.
Should rates for plan year 2007 exceed the Employer contribution, the parties will jointly petition the Pubic Employees Benefit Board to use reserve funding to support a portion, or all, of any premium increase above twelve (12) percent.
In the event the premium increase in excess of twelve percent (12%) is not covered by PEBB reserves, the two percent (2%) salary schedule adjustment (12/01/2006) shall be reduced by one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) for each one percent (1%) increase in insurance premiums above twelve percent (12%).
The parties may also jointly petition the PEBB to continue to do as follows: Employees who live in counties where the PEBB considers there to be an insufficient number of preferred providers within the PPO network will receive the same level of benefits when they use a non-preferred provider as they would using a preferred provider.
ARTICLE 13	- SALARY AND WAGES
Section 1.	Public Employees Retirement System (“PERS”) Members.
For purposes of this Section 1, “employee” means an employee who is employed by the State on August 28, 2003 and who is eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.
Retirement Contributions. On behalf of employees, the State will continue to “pick up” the six percent (6%) employee contribution, payable pursuant to law. The parties acknowledge that various challenges have been filed that contest the lawfulness, including the constitutionality, of various aspects of PERS reform legislation enacted by the 2003 Legislative Assembly, including Chapters 67 (HB 2003) and 68 (HB 2004) of Oregon Laws 2003 (“PERS Litigation”). Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any party’s rights, claims or defenses with respect to the PERS Litigation.
Section 2.	Oregon Public Service Retirement Plan Pension Program Members.
For purposes of this Section 2, “employee” means an employee who is employed by the State on or after August 29, 2003 and who is not eligible to receive benefits under ORS Chapter 238 for service with the State pursuant to Section 2 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.
Contributions to Individual Account Programs. As of the date that an employee becomes a member of the Individual Account Program established by Section 29 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003, and pursuant to Section 3 of that same chapter, the State will pay an amount equal to six percent (6%) of the employee’s monthly salary, not to be deducted from the salary, as the employee’s contribution to the employee’s account in that program. The employee’s contributions paid by the State under this Section 2 shall not be considered to be “salary” for the purposes of determining the
12
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
amount of employee contributions required to be contributed pursuant to Section 32 of Chapter 733, Oregon Laws 2003.
Section 3.	Effect of Changes in Law (Other than PERS Litigation).
In the event that the State’s payment of a six percent (6%) employee contribution under Section 1 or under Section 2, as applicable, must be discontinued due to a change in law, valid ballot measure, constitutional amendment, or a final, non-appealable judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction (other than in the PERS Litigation), the State shall increase by six percent (6%) the base salary rates for each classification in the salary schedules in lieu of the six percent (6%) pick-up. This transition shall be done in a manner to assure continuous payment of either the six percent (6%) contribution or a six percent (6%) salary increase.
For the reasons indicated above, or by mutual agreement, if the State ceases paying the applicable six percent (6%) pickup and instead provides a salary increase for eligible bargaining unit employees during the term of the Agreement, and bargaining unit employees are able, under then-existing law, to make their own six percent (6%) contributions to their PERS account or the Individual Account Program account, as applicable, such employees’ contributions shall be treated as “pre-tax” contributions pursuant to Internal Revenue Code, Section 414(h)(2).
Section 4.	Salary Adjustments.
a.	Effective January 1,2006, salary rates will be adjusted upward by two percent (2%).
b.	Effective January 1, 2006, Correctional Officers, Corporals and Sergeants shall receive a one-and-one-quarter percent (1.25%) market adjustment.
c.	Effective December 1, 2006, Compensation Plan salary rates shall be increased by two percent (2%).
d.	Effective July 1, 2006, an additional step shall be added to all salary ranges. Implementation shall be on a least cost basis. Employees who have been at the top step of their salary range on the effective date shall have their former salary eligibility date restored for future increases. This does not apply to anyone red circled above new top step.
Section 5.	Recoupment of Wage and Benefit Overpayments/Underpayments.
a.	Overpayments. In the event that an employee receives wages or benefits from the Agency to which the employee is not entitled, regardless of whether the employee knew or should have known of the overpayment, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing of the overpayment which will include information supporting that an overpayment exists and the amount of wages and/or benefits to be repaid. For purposes of recovering overpayments by payroll deduction, the following shall apply.
1.	The employee with or without Union representation and the Agency shall meet and attempt to reach mutual agreement on a repayment schedule within thirty (30) calendar days following written notification. The employee, with or without Union representation and the Agency shall meet and attempt to reach mutual agreement on a repayment schedule within thirty (30) days following written notification.
2.	If there is no mutual agreement at the end of the thirty (30) calendar day period the Agency shall implement the repayment schedule stated in subsection 3 below.
3.	If the overpayment amount to be repaid is more than five percent (5%) of the employee’s regular monthly base salary, the overpayment shall be recovered in monthly amounts not exceeding five percent (5%) of the employee’s regular base salary. If an overpayment is less than five percent (5%) of the employee’s regular monthly base salary, the overpayment shall be recovered in a lump sum deduction from the employee’s paycheck. If an employee leaves Agency service before the Agency fully recovers the overpayment, the remaining amount may be deducted from the employee’s final check(s).
4.	Subsections 1-3 of this Section shall not apply to payroll adjustments necessitated by a discrepancy between actual hours of paid time versus hours projected for payroll purposes from one pay period to another. For example, if an employee utilizes leave without pay near the end of a month but is paid for such time because such leave without pay was not anticipated at the
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
13
payroll cutoff date for that month, the employee’s pay and benefit entitlements may be adjusted on the following month’s paycheck.
5.	The Agency shall not attempt to correct any overpayment to employees discovered older than two (2) years from notification.
b.	Underpayments. In the event the employee does not receive the wages or benefits to which the record/documentation has for all times indicated the employer agreed the employee was entitled, the Agency shall notify the employee in writing of the underpayment. This notification will include information showing that an underpayment exists and the amount of wages and/or benefits to be repaid. The Agency shall correct any such underpayment made within a maximum period of two (2) years before the notification.
c.	This provision shall not apply to claims disputing eligibility for payments which result from this agreement. Employees claiming eligibility for such things as leadwork, work out-ofclassification pay or reclassification must pursue those claims pursuant to the timelines elsewhere in this Agreement.
ARTICLE 14	- SALARY ADMINISTRATION
Section 1.
Employees shall be eligible for annual performance pay increases on the employees' eligibility date provided the employee is not at the top step of the salary range of the employees' classification. The employee may be denied the annual performance pay increase if there has been a serious performance or attendance problem. Denials are subject to review within six (6) months. Denials may be grieved under the provisions of Article 51.
Effective January 1, 2006 step increases shall resume pursuant to the terms of the agreement at the time of each eligible employee’s salary eligibility date.
Section 2.
Any employee requiring an emergency draw shall be authorized once during the term of this Agreement to make such a draw without explanation. Additional draws may be requested in accord with existing policy and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Section 3.	Submission of Salary Increases.
Salary increases must be made to be effective on the first day of the month and must be submitted prior to the proposed effective date. However, salary increases to correct errors or oversights and retroactive payments resulting from grievance settlements will be authorized. The effective date for annual salary increases shall be on the employee’s salary eligibility date. In no event shall any retroactivity exceed twelve (12) months from the date upon which the oversight or error is brought to management's attention in writing, or, in the case of a grievance settlement, the date the grievance was filed in writing.
Section 4.	Salary on Promotion.
An employee shall be given an increase to the next higher rate in the new salary range effective on the date of the promotion and on the first of the month following completion of trial service after promotion and annually thereafter until employee has reached the top step of the salary range.
Section 5.	Salary on Demotion.
Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a lower range that has a salary rate the same as the previous step, the employee's salary shall be maintained at that step in the lower range.
Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a salary range which does not have salary steps corresponding with the employee's previous salary but is within the new salary range, the employee's salary shall be maintained at the current rate until the next eligibility date. At the
14
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
employee's next eligibility date, if qualified, the employee shall be granted a salary rate increase of one (1) full step within the new salary range plus that amount that their current salary is below the next higher rate in the salary range. This increase shall not exceed the highest rate in the new salary range.
Whenever an employee demotes to a job classification in a lower range, but the employee's previous salary is above the highest step for that range, the employee shall be paid at the highest step in the new salary range.
This Section shall not apply to demotions resulting from official disciplinary actions.
Section 6.	Effect of Break in Service.
When an employee separates from State service and subsequently returns to the State service (except as a temporary employee), the employee's salary eligibility date shall be determined by the Agency as follows:
a.	Return from Layoff List. When a former employee who was laid off is recalled, the employee will be paid at the step they were at the time of layoff. Employee's previous salary eligibility date adjusted by the amount of break in service shall be restored.
b.	Return from Reemployment. When a former employee is reemployed to a position in the same class in which the employee was previously employed or in a related class with the same salary range, the employee may be paid at or below the step at which the employee was being paid at the time of termination. If an employee is reemployed in a position in a class with a lower salary range than that of the employee's previous position, the employee may be paid at any step in the lower salary range not exceeding the rate the employee was being paid in the higher class, except where exceptional circumstances justify payment of a higher rate. The previous eligibility date adjusted by the amount of break in service shall represent the earliest salary eligibility date following return. However, the salary eligibility date may be established by the Agency as the first of the month in any future month up to twelve (12) months from date of reemployment.
ARTICLE 15 - OVERTIME
Section 1.
All time for which an employee is compensated at the regular straight time rate of pay, except on-call time but including holiday time off, compensatory time off, and other paid leave, shall be counted as time worked.

Overtime for employees working a regular workweek is time worked in excess of eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week within the employee's basic workweek. Overtime for employees working an irregular work schedule four/ten (4/10) is time worked in excess of the scheduled hours per day or forty (40) hours per week within the employee's basic workweek. Time worked beyond regular schedule by employees scheduled for less than eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week is additional straight time worked rather than overtime until work exceeds eight (8) hours per day or forty (40) hours per week within the employee's basic workweek.

If an employee is required to work more than eight (8) hours in any twenty-four (24)-hour period, the employee shall be paid at the overtime rate for all hours in excess of eight (8) during that same twenty-four (24)-hour period. Employee workweek is defined as the seven (7)-day period beginning with the employee's first scheduled workday.

Section 4.
Overtime shall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1-1/2). The form of compensation for overtime shall be pay or compensatory time off. If compensatory time is used, it shall be credited at the appropriate overtime rate. Any compensatory time accrued in excess of eighty (80) hours will be paid off within the pay period of the month following the month in which it is accrued.
No application of this Article shall be construed or interpreted to provide for compensation for overtime at a rate exceeding time and one-half (1-1/2), or to effect a "pyramiding" of overtime, i.e., time and one-half (1-1/2).
Overtime shall be voluntary except during periods of emergency or unless management is unable to fill a work assignment by voluntary means.
Section 5.	Exemptions from Overtime.
All employees who are exempt from overtime under the standards established by the FLSA shall be excluded from overtime. The Agency and the Union shall apply FLSA standards to reach agreement upon exempt employees.
Grievances which grieve the eligibility of employees for overtime shall follow the procedure in Article 51, Grievance and Arbitration, Steps 1 and 2. If the grievance is still unresolved after Step 2, the affected employee may file a charge with the Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI), Wage and Hour Division, or with the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).
Section 6.
Any employee assigned to escort inmates out of State will be compensated eight (8) hours per day at the straight time rate, and one and one-half (1-1/2) times the straight time rate for any hours actually worked over eight (8) hours per day, unless escorting on the employee's regular day off, where the employee shall receive overtime for the first eight (8) hours also.
Section 7.
Shift changes as a direct result of job bidding requiring the bidding employee to work more than five (5) consecutive days will be compensated at the regular straight time rate of pay.
Section 8.
The parties agree that an employee's compensatory time is payment for work already accomplished. Compensatory time may be used by the employee in lieu of vacation or sick leave.
Section 9.	Distribution of Voluntary Overtime.
Volunteers will be sought by contact with all staff on shift followed by contact of a volunteer list as determined by local labor/management committees. No employee shall be required to work more than sixteen (16) hours of overtime per week unless there is an emergency or valid cause. The method of assigning and limits on mandatory overtime and limits on voluntary overtime may be determined by the local labor/management committees and formalized in a Letter of Agreement (LOA). Voluntary overtime may be denied for valid cause. Mandatory overtime lists will be posted.

Section 2.
This provision will not apply when call back results from employee oversight, i.e., taking home necessary keys, equipment necessary at the Institution, etc. The provision does not prevent the Agency from calling employees for information not requiring call back.

ARTICLE 24	- USE OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
Section 1.	Policy.
The Department of Corrections and AFSCME agree the purpose of this Agreement on alcohol and drug testing is to help ensure the work place is free from the effects of drug and alcohol abuse, and to do so in a way as to protect each employee’s constitutional and statutory rights. The Department of Corrections is committed to assisting regular status employees to overcome drug and alcohol problems through appropriate treatment programs and, if necessary, disciplinary action.

20
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
d.	Possession of any controlled substance including marijuana while on Agency property or in Agency vehicles or equipment at any time, including rest and meal periods. However, this excludes substances that have been legally prescribed for an employee’s own use.
e.	Being at work under the influence of any controlled substance, including marijuana, or having such substances present in the body while on Agency property or in Agency vehicles or equipment at any time, including rest and meal periods. An employee has controlled substance present in the body when the employee tests positive in blood or urine tests administered by the Agency for drug and alcohol testing. An employee shall be deemed to test positive for cannabinoids (marijuana or hashish) if his or her urine test indicates fifty (50) or more manograms THC metabolites/ml. However, this excludes substances that have been prescribed for an employee’s own use.
f.	Abusing any substance which is lawfully prescribed by regularly taking it in excessive quantities or by unlawfully obtaining it for purposes of abuse.
g.	For purposes of this Agreement, the term controlled substance shall be defined in accordance with ORS 475.005(6).
Section 3.	Under the Influence.
The term under the influence of controlled substances including marijuana or alcoholic intoxicants covers not only all the well-known and easily recognized conditions and degrees of impairment and intoxication, but any perceptible abnormal mental or physical condition which is the result of indulging to any degree in controlled substances, marijuana or alcoholic intoxicants which perceptibly tend to deprive the use of that clearness of intellect and control the employee would otherwise possess.
Section 4.	Discipline and Other Action.
Prohibited conduct described in Sections 2a and 2d above shall result in termination. Prohibited conduct described in Sections 2b, 2c, 2e and 2f shall result in actions specified in Section 6 below.
Section 5.	Reasonable Suspicion Testing.
a.	Where the Agency has a reasonable suspicion that en employee is under the influence of any alcoholic intoxicants or controlled substances, including marijuana, or has a controlled substance, including marijuana, present in the body, the Agency may require that the employee immediately consent and submit to field and impairment tests and sampling (blood, urine or Breathalyzer test) at an approved laboratory. The Agency shall pay for the costs of the tests. A refusal to consent and submit to any of these tests shall be deemed the same as a positive test result.
b.	When the employee is notified he or she is required to consent and submit to such test, or to searches as described in Section 8 of this Article, he or she may request the presence of a Union representative to witness the tests or searches. The tests or searches may not be unduly delayed in order to wait for a representative. The absence of a representative shall not be grounds for the employee to refuse to consent and submit to such tests or searches, however the Agency shall make every reasonable effort to provide a Union representative. The presence of a representative shall not disrupt or interfere with the tests or searches.
c.	Before a supervisor, acting on behalf of the Agency under this policy, may require an employee to consent and submit to any test(s) specified in this section, the supervisor must first obtain concurrence from the supervisor’s department head or his designee that the information available to the Agency about the subject employee is sufficient to determine reasonable suspicion that prohibited conduct will be established as a result of such test(s).
d.	The employee shall give consent to a blood, urine or Breathalyzer test by signing a consent form. The form shall contain the following information:
1.	Employees consent to release test results to the Agency;
2.	The procedure for confirming an initial positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana;
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
21
3.	The consequences of a confirmed positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana;
4.	The consequences of a positive test for alcohol, including one at or above .02% by volume/weight of alcohol in the blood;
5.	A listing provided by the employee of legally prescribed and over-the-counter medications which may be in the employee’s body. At the employee’s option, this information may be submitted in a sealed envelope to be opened only by the Medical Review Officer if the test result is positive;
6.	The right to explain a confirmed positive test result for a controlled substance, including marijuana, or a positive test for alcohol to the Medical Review Officer;
7.	The right to have a Union representative present during the preliminary interview and any follow-up investigation;
8.	The consequences of refusing to consent to the blood, urine, or Breathalyzer test.
e.	The drug testing process shall be one that is scientifically proven to be at least as accurate and valid as urinalysis using an immunoassay screening test, with all positive screening results being confirmed utilizing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry before a sample is considered positive. The alcohol testing process shall be one that is scientifically proven to be at least as accurate and valid as (1) urinalysis using an enzymatic assay screening test, with the positive screening results being confirmed using gas chromatography before a sample is considered positive, or (2) breath sample testing using breath analyzing instruments which meet NIDA/SAMSHA testing standards.
f.	If a blood or urine test is confirmed as positive, the Agency will instruct the laboratory to retain the blood or urine sample for a period of not less than thirty (30) calendar days from the date the test results are communicated to the employee for the purpose of allowing the employee to conduct an independent test of the sample at his or her own expense at a laboratory approved by the State of Oregon.
g.	The procedure followed under this Agreement to obtain, handle and store blood and urine samples and to conduct laboratory tests shall be documented to establish procedural integrity and chain of evidence. Such procedures shall be administered with due regard for the employee’s privacy and the need to maintain confidentiality of test results to an extent which is not inconsistent with the needs of this policy. The employee shall be notified of the results of all tests conducted pursuant to this policy. Additionally, all facts and circumstances upon which the reasonable suspicion testing is based, shall be documented and given to the employee when he or she is notified of the test results.
Section 6.	Consequences of Test Results.
a.	Test results which do not positively establish the employee has engaged in prohibited conduct as described in Sections 2b, 2c, 2e or 2f of this Article shall result in no further action against the employee related to an alleged violation of those sections. The employee shall be informed of such test results in writing. Persons who do not test positive shall not have any record of the test placed in his or her official personnel file. Working files may contain records of the observations which led to the reasonable suspicion testing but not records of the test itself. If the employee subsequently demonstrates similar behaviors, these records may be relied upon by the employer in disciplinary proceedings.
b.	If an employee who tests positive and has not previously committed prohibited conduct specified in Sections 2b, 2c, 2e or 2f of this Article, the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid for by the Agency. The evaluation will determine the extent of the employee’s use of, and dependence on, the applicable substance(s) and, if necessary, recommend an appropriate program of treatment, including but not limited to rehabilitation and counseling to prevent future use. If a program of treatment is recommended by the doctor, the employee shall enroll in it immediately. Failure by the employee to enroll in the recommended program or to complete it successfully shall result in his or her termination from employment. The cost of such treatment shall
22
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
be at the employee’s expense except as it may be covered by insurance. The employee may take paid leave or leave without pay for the period of treatment.
c.	The first instance of an alcohol test result of .02% to .039% shall not be considered a positive test result for alcohol for the purpose of requiring a medical evaluation by a doctor. An employee may use vacation and/or sick leave benefits for this time period. It will, however, require that the employee be removed from duty until their next scheduled shift. An alcohol test result of a .04% or greater will subject the employee to all provisions of this Agreement.
d.	If an employee who tests positive and has previously committed prohibited conduct specified in Sections 2b, 2c, 2e or 2f, and subsequently is found to have committed such prohibited conduct a second time within three (3) years, he or she shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination. The level of discipline imposed for subsequent instances of such prohibited conduct beyond three (3) years may be termination but shall be determined on a case-by-case basis.
Section 7.	Voluntary Rehabilitation.
a.	The primary objectives of the Agency’s drug and alcohol policy are to maintain employee performance and good health and a safe work environment. If, prior to a requirement by the Agency that the employee submit to any of the tests specified in Section 5 of this Article, the employee notifies a supervisor he or she has drug or alcohol problems that require treatment, then in that event the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid for by the Agency and shall enroll in a treatment program recommended by the doctor. An employee may seek such evaluation and treatment from the employee’s own doctor, at the employee’s expense. The employee shall notify the employer of the name of the doctor. An employee who enters rehabilitation and successfully completes rehabilitation under the terms of this paragraph shall not be subject to discipline. The cost of such treatment shall be at the employee’s expense except as it may be covered by insurance. The employee may take paid leave or leave without pay for the period of treatment.
b.	If an employee has previously enrolled in a voluntary rehabilitative treatment described in subsection a and subsequently again volunteers for such treatment in advance of being required to submit to any of these tests specified in Section 5 of this Article, then the employee shall immediately submit to a medical evaluation by a doctor selected and paid for by the Agency and shall successfully complete the treatment program recommended by the doctor. An employee may seek such evaluation and treatment from the employee’s own doctor, at the employee’s expense. The employee shall notify the employer of the name of the doctor. If the employee fails to complete the treatment program successfully, he or she shall be subject to discipline up to and including termination. The cost of such treatment shall be at the employee’s expense except as it may be covered by insurance. The employee may take paid leave or leave without pay for the period of treatment.
Section 8.	Searches.
The Agency reserves the right to conduct searches for any reason of Agency equipment or facilities generally, and may search anything or area in which the employee has an expectation of privacy (i.e., desk, locker, outer garment clothing or personal property) to the extent permitted by law. Refusal by the employee to submit to a lawful search shall result in termination.
Strip searches and frisk searches will be undertaken in the event of a criminal investigation and only for probable cause as determined by the investigating law enforcement agency.
Section 9.	Consequences of Search Results.
a.	Reasonable suspicion searches which do not reveal the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, including marijuana (but excluding any substance lawfully prescribed for the employee’s use which has not been obtained for the purpose of abuse), shall result in no further action against the employee related to an alleged violation of Section 2d. The employee shall be informed of such search results in writing.
b.	Searches which reveal the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, including marijuana (but excluding any substance prescribed for the employee’s use which has not been obtained for the purpose of abuse), shall result in those consequences specified in Section 4 as though a positive blood or confirmed urine test had been administered.
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
23
Section 10.	Training.
The Agency recognizes that, in order to administer the standards and procedures set forth in this Agreement fairly and to minimize the possibility of unwarranted testing and searches, supervisory personnel shall receive training in how to recognize and deal effectively with substance abuse in the work place. Accordingly, the Agency will provide such training to supervisors and designated Union representatives before the requirements of this Agreement are implemented and enforced.

Section 7.	Time Trades.
Employees may agree to time trades with other employees who are qualified to perform the duties required in the course of the trade. Such agreement shall be in writing and signed by the affected employees. Supervisors shall not withhold approval of time trades without valid cause.

The intent is that an employee in the AFSCME security series on July 1, 1994, keeps the seniority date negotiated in the 1992-94 Agreement for as long as the employee remains in the classification and functional unit the employee was in on that date. Once the employee leaves that position by promoting to a higher classification in the security series, transferring to a position in the same classification in another AFSCME-represented functional unit, or leaves the bargaining unit security series for any reason and then returns, the employee's seniority date will be recomputed to meet the definition of "time in class in the security bargaining unit." Seniority not sanctioned by this Agreement will not be recognized.

Eastern Oregon Correctional Institution
a.	All security posts, except those specified as exempt, shall be included in the bid system with seniority prevailing.
b.	All security section posts not exempt shall have an established rotation period of six (6) months as existed on July 1, 2001. A rotation period can be changed to three (3) months at the discretion of the Institution, however the Union can grieve the reasonableness of the decision under paragraph e below. The mechanics of the bidding procedure shall be determined by the Agency. The affected post shall then be assigned to the senior employee placing a bid, and such employee must remain on such post until the next rotation date occurs. All affected employees must bid each time their respective post rotates. An employee cannot use seniority to secure a post for more than two (2) consecutive bids nor use seniority to secure a bid for the same post during a two (2)-year period. Seniority will prevail on every bid, but the post an employee may bid by seniority will vary as per above. An employee who has not successfully bid a post or an employee who did not bid a post may be assigned by the Institution until such employee is able to make a successful bid.
c.	A senior employee may be denied or removed from a post for valid cause only.
d.	If an employee is assigned for Institution convenience to an exempt post herein
specified, the Institution will provide adequate training prior to assignment. The posts exempt from bidding are:

Control Center Staff on All Shifts
Segregation Unit Staff on All Shifts

Control Center Officers must rotate after one (1) year, but Control Center staff will not rotate out at the same time. Rotations shall be staggered to ensure that an experienced staff member is working in Control at all times. All exempt posts listed above, except Segregation, Tool and Key shall be held for a maximum period of one (1) year, at which time the incumbent must return to a bid position. In the event of circumstances beyond the control of the Institution, management may temporarily hold an employee in one (1) of these positions not to exceed six (6) months.
In addition to the above exempt posts, there shall be training posts that are exempt from the bid system in this Section. The actual number of exempt training posts utilized may fluctuate and if the number exceeds the ratio of one (1) training post for each ten (10) employees in the bargaining unit, then the Union may challenge the Agency's decision to create a greater number of training posts under paragraph e of this Section. When the designated posts are not utilized as training posts, they will be subject to the bid system until they are again needed as training posts. These posts will be discussed through the local labor/management process.
e.	Should the institution wish to remove a security post from the bid list or wish to establish a post outside the bid list, notice will be given to the Union. If the Union believes the specified removal to be unreasonable, then within seven (7) days of the date upon which the Union knows, or by reasonable diligence, should have known of the subject action, the Union shall request the Institution meet to discuss the issue. Failure to reach agreement on the disputed post shall allow the Union to proceed to arbitration under the provisions of Article 1, Section 5. Timelines established in Article 1, Section 5 shall apply to meetings and appeals under this section.
f.	Work Schedules. Schedules showing each employee's shift, workdays, and hours shall be posted in the appropriate department at all times. Changes in work schedules, from shift to shift, may occur for valid cause or as mutually agreed.
g.	Employees who extend their bid for a back-to-back assignment may not use their seniority to bid the same assignment until two (2) years from the date they were scheduled to vacate the post. Where an employee does not bid the same post back to back, the employee may not exercise their seniority to bid the same post until twenty-four (24) months has passed from the date of the employee's assignment.

ARTICLE 44	- LAYOFF PROCEDURE
Section 1.
A layoff is defined as a separation from service for involuntary reasons not reflecting discredit on an employee. An employee shall be given written notice of a pending layoff at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date stating the reason for the layoff.
Section 2.
Employees shall be laid off and service credits calculated within the following mutually exclusive categories:
a.	Full-time,
b.	Part-time (including job share).
Section 3.
Layoff shall be by classification as defined in Section 11. The classification, geographic area, and functional unit to be affected by any particular layoff shall be identified by the Agency at the time the layoff is declared. Order of layoff within the designated classification, functional unit, and geographic area shall be determined by the lowest service credit.
It is understood that when an employee who is to be laid off possesses knowledge, skill, or ability, the loss of which in the judgment of the Agency would seriously impact operations, the Agency may hold that employee in active status, while laying off the next employee in service credit order in the employee's stead. When it is necessary to hold an employee, who would otherwise be laid off, the Agency will document the need and such documentation shall be accessible to the Union for its review. Any dispute in this regard may be taken up as a grievance by the Union.
If an employee is underfilling a position, the employee will be considered in the higher classification for the purposes of this Article. If it is found that two (2) or more employees in the
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
43
Agency in which the layoff is to be made have equal service credits, the order of layoff shall be in inverse order of the greatest length of continuous State service. If ties between employees still exist, the order of layoff shall be determined by the Appointing Authority in such a manner as to conserve for the State the services of the most qualified employees.
Section 4.	Service Credit.
Seniority is defined as total length of continuous Agency service. One (1) point shall be allowed for each full month of unbroken service. An employee's seniority shall be computed from the date of the employee's employment by the Agency in any capacity within the Division/Department, except that a new employee shall be on trial service for the appropriate period. A new employee shall be placed on the seniority list and given seniority ratings as of the first day the employee was hired by the Agency.
Seniority shall be forfeited if an employee has a break in service from the Agency of more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, other than layoff, or fails to respond within five (5) consecutive work days after receiving notice by registered letter mailed to the last address on the Agency's records, unless prevented from responding by conditions beyond the employee's control. A break in service is a separation or interruption of employment without pay of more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days.
Seniority lists shall be prepared by the Agency, during January, updated periodically, and posted on bulletin boards in the Agency. Time with the Board of Parole and the Department of Corrections shall be interchangeable. Time spent by former employees of the EOH&TC who were employed at that facility and transferred to EOCI within six (6) months of EOH&TC's closure, shall count toward the calculation of Department of Corrections seniority in that geographic area only.
Section 5.	Options in Lieu of Layoff.
Any employee who is given notice of layoff may file a written request to exercise an option in lieu of layoff with the Appointing Authority within five (5) work days of receipt of such notice. The employee's options shall be as follows:
a.	Any employee notified of layoff may opt to displace the least service credit person in the geographic area in the same classification provided the employee can perform the specific requirements of the position within approximately two (2) weeks.
b.	Any employee notified of layoff may elect to demote within the functional unit to a lower classification for which the employee is qualified provided the employee can perform the requirements of the position within approximately two (2) weeks, if a position exists which is not protected from layoff and where the incumbent has the least seniority.
c.	If no such option exists within the functional unit, the employee may elect to displace the least senior undesignated person in the geographic area in a lower classification for which the employee is qualified, provided the employee can perform the requirements of the position within approximately two (2) weeks.
Section 6.
The name of a demoting employee shall then be placed on the appropriate layoff list for the class the employee demoted from. Any employee demoted in lieu of layoff may request at that time and shall be paid for all accrued compensatory time at the rate being earned prior to demotion in lieu of layoff.
Section 7.
If an employee's selection in Section 6 results requires moving, moving expenses shall be assumed by the employee.
Section 8.	Layoff List.
A layoff list shall be a list of employees by classification and geographic area who are laid off from the Agency. Such lists are maintained in inverse order of layoff for the geographic area. Recall shall be from the list, one (1) name at a time, to the vacancy in the classification and within the
44
2005-2007 AFSCME DOC Security
geographic area from which the employee was laid off provided the employee can perform the specific requirements of the position within approximately two (2) weeks. No new employees may be hired within that geographic area until all employees on the layoff list in that class have been offered reemployment. Names shall be maintained on the appropriate layoff list(s) for two (2) years from the effective date of layoff.
Section 9.
