In the event the Unions signatory hereto enter into any agreement with any individual Employer or groups of Employers competing in the highway and heavy construction industry which provides for terms and conditions of employment more favorable to said Employer than herein provided, these more favorable terms and conditions may, at the option of the Employers signatory hereto, be implemented as a part of this contract, provided the Basic Trades Liaison Committee has first met and studied the evidence and is convinced the Union has, in fact, given better conditions or wages to the other party. In the event the Basic Trades Liaison Committee deadlocks, the arbitration procedure in the grievance Article will be followed to reach a final decision.
ARTICLE 8
Violation of Agreement

The Funds shall be known separately as the Laborers' Pension Fund, the Laborers' Health and Welfare Fund, the Laborers' Vacation Fund, the Construction Laborers Education, Apprenticeship and Training Fund of Minnesota and North Dakota, the Laborers Health and Safety Fund, and the Laborers-Employers Cooperation and Education Trust (LECET) Fund and collectively as the Laborers' Fringe Benefits Fund under separate Trust Agreements (“Fund”), copies of which are available on request and to which the Employer is automatically bound. The Fund's Trustees shall equally represent the Union and the Employer.
1.	Contributions to be paid on one check with all other fringes to an administrative agency with a local office.
2.	(a) Reporting forms and instructions standardized with other basic trades.
(b) All Fringe Benefit contributions are paid on an hourly basis on all hours worked. This includes straight time, one and one-half time and double time. The Vacation contribution is taxable and is paid for work performed at one and one-half and double time (see Schedule 13). The Pension, Health and Welfare, Training and LECET contributions are not pyramided, but should be paid for all hours worked. Example: If hourly wage is $3.00 plus $.10 for Pension, Health and Welfare, Training and LECET plus $.02 Vacation; time and one-half overtime wage rate is $4.50 plus $.10 for Pension, Health and Welfare, Training and LECET plus $.03 Vacation; double time overtime wage rate is $6.00 plus $.10 for Pension, Health and Welfare, Training and LECET plus $.04 Vacation.
3.	(a) In the event that a National Health Insurance Program is enacted, the Employer contribution to the current Health and Welfare Plan, as
10
described in Schedule 13, shall be applied to any cost incurred by the employer and/or the Employees covered hereunder in connection with such National Health Plan.
(b) If the current Employer contribution is in excess of the cost of such National Health Plan, then at the discretion of the Employees covered hereunder, the difference shall become a contribution to either a supplemental health and welfare insurance plan and/or one of the existing Pension Plans.
4.	Any Insurance Carrier, Administrator, Consultant, Actuary, Fiduciary Agent which may be used shall be selected by competitive bidding upon invitation by Trustees.
5.	There shall be no requirement that Employees sent to work outside the scope of this Agreement be paid fringes, nor shall the Employer be required to duplicate fringe contributions.
6.	(a) An Employer shall be considered "delinquent" for a particular work month if its required report and payment for that month are not postmarked on or before the 15th day of the following month (the "due date"), irrespective of whether such delinquency is willful or otherwise.
(b)	If an Employer becomes delinquent for a particular work month (as provided in (a) above), they shall also be required to pay, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to 10% of the payment otherwise due for such work month, it being understood and acknowledged by the parties that actual damages are extremely difficult or impossible to ascertain and that the amount so fixed as liquidated damages is reasonable.
(c)	If an Employer becomes delinquent for a particular work month (as provided in (a) above), as to any or all of the Trust Funds, and if the report and the full payment due for such work month (including liquidated damages), are not postmarked in the office of the Fund Administrator on or before the 15th day of the month following the applicable due date such Employer shall (in addition to paying the full amount due) be required to post in the office of the Fund
11
Administrator a cash or fringe benefits surety bond (in a form acceptable to the Fund Administrator) for each month of delinquency in a form satisfactory to the Trustees and in the face amount of the greater of $20,000 or 125% of the amount due (or estimated to be due) for the delinquent month, which shall cover all of the Trust Funds and assure payment of all sums called for by this Agreement in the event of the Employer's subsequent delinquency as to any or all of the Trust Funds, and which shall be kept in force and maintained in the full face amount for a period of not less than 12 consecutive calendar months during which no further delinquency has occurred on the part of such Employer.
Should the Trust Funds reasonably deem itself insecure in the payment or collection of fringe benefit payments by reason of the Employer's past delinquencies, insolvency, insufficient capitalization, and/or lack of assets subject to attachment within the State in which work is performed, then the Fund Administrator, upon submission of an affidavit to Employer attesting to same, shall have the right to compel the Employer to post a cash or fringe benefits surety bond (in a form acceptable to the Fund Administrator) in the face amount of the greater of $20,000 or 125% of the total fringe benefit payments reasonable estimated to come due within the six months following the date of Fund Administrator's affidavit. This bond may be required whether or not a delinquency exists at the time and may be required in addition to a bond posted for a prior delinquency.
The Union shall refuse to supply persons and shall prohibit Employees covered by this Agreement from working for any such delinquent Employer who fails or refused to provide or maintain any bond under this Paragraph 6(c).
(d)	Illustration of clauses (a), (b), and (c): If an Employer's report and payment for the January work month have not been postmarked before February 16, such Contractor becomes delinquent at that point and must pay the full amount due, plus 10%. If the report and the full payment for January (including the 10% liquidated damages amount) are not postmarked before March 16, the Employer must then post a bond in addition to reporting and paying the full amount due. If, for example, the delinquency is $10,000, the required bond is $20,000. If,
12
for example, the delinquency is $20,000, the required bond is $25,000. If a delinquency occurs in a subsequent month, an additional bond for that month is required and must be posted. Further, for example, if the Fund Administrator reasonably determines that future delinquencies are likely to occur, another, additional bond may be required to be posted in an amount based on a reasonable estimate of the following six months of fringe benefit payments to come due, even though a bond for prior delinquencies has been posted.
(e)	The delinquent Employer shall also be required to pay all costs of collection actually incurred by the Trust Funds, including all attorney fees, service fees, filing fees, court reporter fees, and all other fees, costs and disbursements incurred by or on behalf of the Trust Funds in collecting the amount due. Trustees at their discretion may reimburse (from the Fund) the Unions for picketing and bannering expense actually incurred by the Union in collecting amounts due the Trust Funds, which expenses shall be deemed to be costs of collection incurred on behalf of the Trust Funds.
(f)	Each Employer who is required to make payments to the Trust Funds shall promptly furnish to the Trustees, or the Unions, or their authorized agents, on demand, all necessary employment and payroll records relating to its Employees covered by this Agreement, including any other relevant information that may be required in connection with the administration of the Trust Funds. The Trustees, the Unions, or their authorized agents may examine such employment, or payroll records whenever such examination is deemed necessary by the Trustees, the Unions, or their authorized agents in connection with the proper administration of the Trust Funds.
If any Employer fails or refuses to furnish its payroll records to the Trustees, the Unions or their authorized agents upon demand or refuses to afford the Trustees, or their authorized agents reasonable opportunity to examine the same in accordance with standard auditing procedures, the Trustees or the Unions may enforce such rights by legal action, in which event all attorney fees, service fees, filing fees, court reporter fees and other legal costs and disbursements, as well as the auditing fees and costs incurred in conducting such audit, shall be paid by such Employer on direction by the Trustees. The Unions shall
13
also have the right to take economic action to enforce such rights on behalf of the Unions and the Trustees and the Trust Funds shall reimburse the Unions for picketing and bannering expenses actually incurred in enforcing such rights.
(g)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 10 Settlement of Disputes, the failure, refusal or neglect of an Employer to report and to pay sums due the Trust Funds or otherwise to comply with the terms and provisions of this Article shall not be subject to arbitration.
(h)	The parties to this Agreement acknowledge that the provisions of this Agreement establishing rates of pay, wages, all hours of employment and other terms and conditions of employment, including fringe benefits, apply to Employees employed in job classifications within the jurisdiction of the Union, from the first day of employment, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF THE UNION.
7.	Any and all fringe contribution rates shall be open for adjustment on any anniversary date upon thirty (30) days written notice to the Contractors. Such adjustments shall operate to adjust wages in like amount.
8.	The Parties agree to the possibility of starting an annuity (defined contribution plan) during the term of this Agreement funded out of the existing package and administrated by the Pension Fund Trustees.
ARTICLE 22 Saving Clause
This agreement is intended to be in conformity with all applicable and valid State and Federal laws, rules and regulations. Any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the terms of any such laws and regulations shall cause the provisions of this Agreement so in conflict to be superseded or annulled but shall not supersede or annul the terms and provisions of this Agreement which are not so in conflict.
