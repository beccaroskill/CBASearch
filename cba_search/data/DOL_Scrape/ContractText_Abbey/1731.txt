Trustees
The Board of Trustees is the sponsor of any Plan established pursuant to this Trust. The individual Trustees listed above, their successors, and any Administrator designated by theTrustees shall be, for purposes of ERISA, the named fiduciaries with respect to any such Plan.
The Board of Trustees shall consist of six Trustees. The Contributing Employers, through the Painting and Decorating Contractors of America, Chapter No. 2, and the Union shall each designate three Trustees. The individual Trustees so designated shall collectively constitute the Board of Trustees.
The Trustees are authorized to hire an Administrator and delegate to such Administrator such authority and responsibility as they determine to delegate and which may lawfully be delegated. The Trustees are further authorized to appoint one from their number to serve as Managing Trustee and to delegate to such Managing Trustee such authority and responsibility as they determine to delegate and which may lawfully be delegated. The Trustees may also establish committees or subcommittees composed of one or more Trustees to carry out any of their duties under this Trust, including the collection of employer contributions or other amounts due to the Trust.
The Trustees shall designate one Trustee as Chairman to serve for a term of one year, commencing with the date of election and until a successor Chairman is thereafter selected, for the purpose of presiding at the meetings of the Trustees. The Chairman shall initially be selected from the Trustees representing the Union, the following year from the Trustees representing the Employers, and thereafter similarly alternately selected.
A quorum for the transaction of business shall consist of the presence at the meeting of at least four Trustees, two of whom represent the Employers and two of whom represent the Union. Decisions of the Trustees shall be made by majority vote. If an unequal number of Employer and Union Trustees attends a meeting, the voting power of the group with fewer Trustees present shall be and stand increased to that of the group with more Trustees present so that there shall be equal voting strength between Employer and Union Trustees at all times at such meeting.
A deadlock shall be deemed to exist whenever either of the following situations arises: (1) a proposal, nomination, motion, resolution, or other matter is voted upon, and the votes cast are evenly divided and remain evenly divided; or (2) a quorum is lacking at a meeting duly called and a majority of the Trustees present declare a deadlock due to
— 3 —
the inability to obtain a quorum. In the event of such deadlock in either case arising, the Employer Trustees and the Union Trustees shall meet promptly for the purpose of agreeing upon an impartial umpire to break such deadlock by casting the deciding vote or deciding any dispute in question or matter under consideration. In the event of the inability of the Employer Trustees and Union Trustees to agree upon the selection of such impartial umpire, then an impartial umpire shall, on the petition of either the Employer Trustees or Union Trustees, be appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the district wherein the principal office of the Trust is located. The decision of any such impartial umpire shall be final and binding on the Trustees and all concerned.
Either the Chairman or the Managing Trustee or any two Trustees may call a meeting of the Trustees or direct the Administrator to call such a meeting at any time by giving at least five days’ written notice of the time and place thereof to each Trustee. Any meeting so called may be postponed once for a reasonable period upon the request of any Trustee upon showing of justifiable cause therefor. Any meeting of the Trustees may also be held at any time without notice if all of the Trustees consent thereto or if all attend and act. If all of the Trustees shall concur in writing upon any proposition, no formal meeting thereon need be held by the Trustees. The Managing Trustee, in the written notice, shall notify the Trustees of the subjects to be discussed, but this shall not be construed to limit any other subjects of discussion properly placed before the meeting.
The Trustees may receive reimbursement for expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of their duties as Trustees when approved by the majority of the Trustees. Reasonable compensation may be paid to the Trustees for services rendered in the performance of their duties as Trustees, provided such payments are made in accordance with the Federal and State laws and regulations then in effect governing trusts. Additionally, the Trustees may receive reimbursement for expenses incurred in attending educational conferences, seminars, and meetings, provided that the Trustees determine in each case that the subject matter of the conference, seminar, or meeting is relevant to the administration of this Trust and that the expenses incurred are reasonable.
Any Trustee may resign by giving 30 days’ notice in the United States Mail to the other Trustees and to the Board of his intent to so resign. The Union may discharge any of the Trustees appointed by it by giving 30 days’ notice in the United States Mail to that Trustee, to the other Trustees, and to the Board of such intent to discharge. The Employers may discharge any Trustee appointed by them by giving 30 days' notice in the United States Mail to that Trustee, to the other Trustees, and to the Board of such intent to discharge. The resignation or removal of a Trustee shall be automatic at the end of the 30-day period of notification either by the Trustee or by the Union or the Employers, as described above, of resignation or removal. In the event that any of the Trustees selected by the Union shall die, be incapable of acting hereunder, resign, or be removed, a successorTrustee shall immediately be appointed by the Union and duly certified by the Board. In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Employers shall die, become incapable of acting hereunder, resign, or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Employers and duly certified by the Board. Failure of the Union or the Employers to select a successor Trustee promptly shall not prevent the remaining Trustees from carrying on the affairs of this Trust.
The Unity Hall Corporation, the Union, and the Trustees of the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare, Pension, Group Insurance, Vacation, and Apprenticeship and Journeyman Training Trusts shall have no role whatsoever in the selection or removal of Employer Trustees.

AMENDMENT NO. 8 TO PAINTERS DISTRICT COUNCIL NO. 2 WELFARE TRUST AGREEMENT
The Board of Trustees of the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Trust hereby amend the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Trust Agreement by adding the following new Article XII and changing the number of the current Article XII to Article XIII and the current Article XIII to Article XIV. This amendment shall be effective on April 14, 2003.
The Board of Trustees, in order to carry out its legal responsibilities and to properly administer the Welfare Plan and the Welfare Trust, requires access to information maintained by the Welfare Plan. This information may include individually identifiable health information that is protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). The Board of Trustees shall only use such protected health information as is necessary to carry out its proper administration of the Welfare Plan and the Welfare Trust. For example, the Board may access individually identifiable health information from the Welfare Plan and the Welfare Trust in order to carry out its legal responsibility of handling claims on appeal. The Board shall not use or disclose protected health information for any purpose beyond its plan administration functions.
Specifically, the Board of Trustees will handle protected health information as follows:
1.	The Board of Trustees will not use or disclose protected health information other than as permitted by this plan document or as required by applicable law;
2.	In the event that the Board of Trustees must disclose protected health information to a third-party to carry out its proper plan administration functions (e.g. to a licensed professional to assist with a claim on appeal), the Board will ensure that such third-party agrees to the same restrictions that apply to the Board as to the use and disclosure of protected health information;
3.	The Board will not use or disclose protected health information for any employment-related actions and decisions or in connection with any other benefit plan administered by the Board;
4.	The Board shall promptly report to the Welfare Plan any use or disclosure of protected health information received from the Welfare Plan that is inconsistent with the uses and disclosures permitted of the Board;
5.	The Board will make any protected health information in its possession available to the Welfare Plan as is necessary for the Welfare Plan to meet its legal obligations of providing individual access to health information, providing an accounting of disclosures of protected health information, and amending protected health information;
6.	The Board will make its internal practices, books, and records relating to the use and disclosure of protected health information received from the Welfare Plan available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the purposes of determining compliance by the Welfare Plan with the HIPAA Privacy Rule;
7.	If feasible, the Board will return or destroy all protected health information received from the Welfare Plan that the Board still maintains in any form and will retain no copies of such information when it is no longer needed for the purpose for which the disclosure was originally made;
8.	Access to protected health information maintained by the Board of Trustees or the Welfare Plan will be limited to those employees with the responsibility of carrying out the plan administration functions of the Welfare Plan and the Trust. Such access will be limited to that which is necessary to carry out the plan administration functions and Trust functions;
9.	Employees who violate these provisions by using protected health information beyond that which is necessary to carry out their plan administration and Trust functions will be sanctioned under the Welfare Plan’s adopted policy for sanctioning employees that violate the Welfare Plan’s health information privacy policies and procedures.

payment is made or due under a plan maintained solely for purpose of complying with applicable workmen’s compensation, or unemployment compensation or disability insurance laws; and
3.	Hours of service are not required to be credited for a payment which solely reimburses an employee for medical or medically related expenses incurred by the employee.
For purposes of this paragraph 1.19B, a payment shall be deemed to be made by or due from an employer regardless of whether such payment is made by or due from the employer directly or indirectly through, among others, a trust fund or insurer, to which the employer contributes or pays premiums and regardless of whether contributions made or due to the trust fund, insurer or other entity are for the benefit of particular employees in the aggregate.
C.	An hour of service is each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is either awarded or agreed to by the employer. The same hours of service shall not be credited both under paragraph 1.19A or 1.19B, as the case may be, and under this paragraph 1.19C.
D.	Effective July 1, 1986, for purposes of computing hours for determining whether a one-year break in service has occurred only, an hour of service includes each hour up to a maximum of 501 hours, during a period of absence from covered employment, if the absence from such employment was due to any one of the following:
1.	Pregnancy of the Participant;
2.	Birth of a child of the Participant;
3.	Placement of a child with the Participant in connection with the adoption of such child by the Participant, or
4.	Caring for such child by the Participant
The amount of hours to be credited for the period of absence shall be the number of hours that normally would have been credited to the Participant but for the absence from covered employment if such an amount can be ascertained. If this amount is not able to be ascertained, the Participant shall be credited with eight hours of service for each working day during the leave. The hours for service shall be credited in the vesting computation year in which they occur, if the leave occurs totally within one vesting computation year. If the leave takes place in more than one vesting computation year, the hours of service shall be credited in the vesting year during which the absence begins, if the crediting is necessary to prevent a break in service; otherwise the hours of service shall be credited in the following vesting computation year.
Hours of service under this subparagraph shall be computed only for purposes of determining whether a one-year break in service has occurred. Such hours will not be counted toward credited service nor will they be counted toward determining whether the Participant has completed a year of service for vesting purposes.
The Participant is required to furnish, upon request by the Plan Administrator or an authorized representative thereof, such timely information as the Plan may reasonably require to establish that the absence was for one of the reasons stated in this subparagraph and/or to establish the number of days for which there was such an absence.
E.	Effective January 1, 1994, an hour of service for purposes of determining whether a Participant has completed a year of service for vesting purposes will include hours of service the Participant would have earned but for his having taken approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Such hours will not be counted for purposes of benefit accrual.
Hours of Service shall be computed and credited in accordance with Department of Labor Regulations 2530.200b.

ARTICLE V
Accrual of Benefits
5.1	General Rules. This Article sets forth the rules for determining and computing the amount of a Participant’s accrued benefit under the Plan. The accumulation and retention of accrued benefit credits are subject to the requirements concerning Years of Vesting Service. The Benefit Amounts are subject to reduction on account of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (Article VIII) and modification if the Participant retires with an annuity starting date other than his normal retirement date, or with a form of benefits other than the normal form of benefits.
Eligibility depends on meeting the conditions for benefit entitlement (Article VI) and/or the rules concerning Years of Vesting service and permanent break in service.
5.2	Normal Form of Benefit. For purposes of this Plan the normal form of benefits is a life annuity, with a 60 month guarantee. This form includes the payment of a monthly amount commencing with the Annuity Starting Date and continuing until the month in which the Participant dies. If the death of the Participant occurs after his Annuity Starting Date, but before all sixty (60) guaranteed monthly payments have been made, the remaining payments shall be made to the named beneficiary, if then surviving, or if such beneficiary is not then surviving, to the contingent beneficiary, if then surviving. If no designated beneficiary is surviving at the time of the Participant’s death, the remaining payments shall be made to the Participant’s estate. If a beneficiary who is receiving guaranteed payments dies before all guaranteed payments are made, payments will continue to the contingent beneficiary, if one is then surviving. If no contingent beneficiary is then surviving, the remaining payments will be made to the estate of the beneficiary who last received a payment, until all guaranteed payments have been made.
The amount of benefit stated in the Plan (Section 5.3) is the amount which the Participant would receive each month, if the Participant receives a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, commencing at normal retirement date. In the event the Participant receives a form of payment different from the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, or in the event the Participant begins to receive benefits at a time other than his normal retirement date, the monthly amount which the Participant will be entitled to receive will be different from the amount stated in this section. The amount received will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit stated in Section 5.3; that is, it will be the
— 6 —
actuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would be entitled to under the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee form of payment, commencing at normal retirement date.
5.3	Amount of Benefit Stated in the Normal Benefit Form. The amount of benefit that a Participant accrues stated in the normal form of benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at Normal Retirement Date, is the sum of the amount determined under subsection 5.3A and the amount determined under Section 5.3B.
A.	The amount determined under this subsection (“accredited past service benefit”) is $2.50 for each year of accredited past service for any Participant who participated on and after July 1,1964, but who commenced participation prior to July 1,1965. An eligible Participant receives a year of accredited past service for each continuous year of service prior to July 1,1965. No Participant who first participated in the Plan after July 1,1965 shall beentitled to past service credits. Theamountdeterminedunderthissubsectionissubject to the rules concerning permanent breaks in service.
B.	The amount determined under this subsection (“accredited future service benefit”) is the sum of the amounts earned by the Participant under all applicable tables. Accredited future service benefit will be accrued under this subsection for each 12 consecutive month period commencing with July 1,1964, and subsequent anniversaries thereof (“benefit accrual year”), based on the number of “hours of service” completed by the Participant during the particular benefit accrual year, subject to the following rules:
1.	No accredited future service benefit will be accrued by a Participant for any benefit accrual year during which the Participant fails to complete at least 400 hours of service.
2.	The accrual of accredited future service benefit under this subsection is subject to the rules concerning permanent breaks in service.
3.	The amounts set out in these tables are subject to the rules contained in subsection 5.3C.
The amount of accredited future service benefit accrued by a Participant during each benefit accrual year is:

1.	Any Participant or Beneficiary whose annuity starting date was prior to July 1, 1984 (including disability benefits), shall, effective with the monthly payment due on July 1,1984, receive benefits in the amount of his June 1984 payment, increased by 20%.
The monthly benefit amount of any Participant or Beneficiary whose Annuity Starting Date (including disability benefits) is July 1, 1984 or thereafter, shall be based on the greater of:
a.	The Participant’s accrued benefit as of the Annuity Starting Date determined under the tables set
out in subsection 5.3B; or
b.	The Participant’s accrued benefit as of June 30, 1984 determined under the tables set out in subsection 5.3B, increased by 20%.

ARTICLE VI
Conditions for Benefit Entitlement/Types of Benefits
In order to be entitled to receive benefits under this Plan, a Participant or Beneficiary must meet the requirements for one of the types of benefits described in this Article VI.
6.1	Normal Retirement Benefit. If a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date while still an active Participant in the Plan (i.e. prior to his Participation ceasing within the meaning of Article HI), the Participant shall be entitled to a Normal Retirement Benefit If a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date while not an active Participant, but has met one of the requirements of Article VII such that he has become vested in his accrued benefit, the Participant shall be entitled to a Normal Retirement Benefit upon reaching his Normal Retirement Date.
A Normal Retirement Benefit is paid in the form provided under Article Vm and is based on the Participant’s accrued benefit as computed under Article V, without reduction for early retirement
A Participant who has met the requirements for a Normal Retirement Benefit is entitled to begin to receive benefits as of his Normal Retirement Date without regard to whether he continues to work in covered employment and without regard to whether he is entitled to Social Security Benefits.
In the event a Participant accrues additional accredited future service benefits for service after his Normal Retirement Annuity Starting Date, he shall be credited with such service. However, any such additional accredited future service shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the actuarial value of any normal retirement benefits paid to the Participant subsequent to his Normal Retirement Date. Notwithstanding the reduction set forth in the previous sentence, a Participant who completes 1,200 or more hours of service in any Plan Year after his Annuity Starting Date, shall accrue at least the benefit set forth in the following table:
— 10 —
Hours Worked in Plan Year	Additional Monthly Benefit Stated in the Normal Form of Benefit
1,200-1,399	$10
1,400- 1,599	$15
1,600-1,799	$20
1,800- 1,999	$25

3,200 or more	$60
Additional accredited future service earned in any benefit accrual year for service after the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date, shall become payable as soon as administratively feasible following the end of that benefit accrual year; the first payment shall include retroactive payments to and including the first payment due July 1. The Participant’s post normal retirement age election as to the form of benefits will apply to the additional accredited service accrued after his Normal Retirement Date.
6.2	Postponed Retirement Date. Subject to the requirements of subsection 9.4, a Participant who has met the requirements for a Normal Retirement Benefit may elect to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date of his choice after his Normal Retirement Date. In such event, the Participant shall notify the Fund Office of his intent to postpone his Annuity Starting Date and, if he knows, of his postponed Annuity Starting Date. The Participant shall, within a reasonable time of said notification, receive the notification described in subsection 8.4. The Participant’s election period for purposes of subsection 8.3, shall be the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the Participant’s elected Postponed Annuity Starting Date. In the event of a Postponed Annuity Starting Date, the amount of Participant’s monthly benefit shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the later commencement date. The actuarial adjustment for any additional accredited service which accrues for service after the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date shall run from the date that the benefits would have first been payable (i.e., September 1 following the end of the benefit accrual year in which the benefits accrued). In no event shall the Participant be permitted to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date after his “Required Beginning Date,” as defined in Section 9.4A.

B.	Effective July 1, 1988, and thereafter, the following provisions shall apply for all Participants except Participants who are employed by Contributing Employers who are signatory to agreements with Sign and Pictorial Painters Local Union 774 (the early retirement eligibility and benefit amount of these excluded Participants are to continue to be determined under subsection 6.3A).
1.	A Participant may elect an Early RetirementBenefit (to be computed in accordance with Section 6.3D) by electing an Annuity Starting Date at any time before his Normal Retirement Date, after meeting the following eligibility requirements:
— 11 —
a.	Attainment of age 60, and
b.	Completion of ten (10) years of vesting credit under the Plan.
2.	A Participant may elect an Early Retirement Benefit (to be computed without the reduction set forth in Section 6.3D) by electing an Annuity Starting Date at any time before his Normal Retirement Date, after meeting the following eligibility requirements:
a.	Attainment of age 60, and
b.	Completion of ten (10) years of vesting service under the Plan, and
c.	Accrual of twenty-five (25) years of credited service, as defined herein. For purpose of this Section 6.3B2, a year of credited service is any year in which the Participant accrued any benefit under the Plan (including a year of past service credit under the Plan). In addition, as to Participants who were Participants in the Plan as of July 1,1988, a year of credited service for purposes of this Section 6.3B2 includes any year of service within the geographic jurisdiction of Painters District Council No. 2, as it was constituted on July 1, 1988, under a collective bargaining agreement to which a union affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Painters was a party.
C.	Except as specified in Section 8.2 below, the Early Retirement Benefit shall be paid in the Normal Form of Benefits under the Plan (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee). The Participant may elect any Annuity Starting Date after the date of his election and after meeting the applicable eligibility requirements.
D.	The amount of Early Retirement Benefit which the Participant will be entitled to receive each month, stated in the form of a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee will be the Participant’s Normal Benefit Amount, computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3, reduced by one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) for each full month that the Participant is younger than age 65 as of his Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date.
For any such additional accredited future service, the Participant is entitled to elect Annuity Starting Date(s), and for each such election, the Participant will receive the notices and election options set forth in Article VUI. Likewise, the spousal consent requirements of Article Vm will continue to apply to any such election. Notwithstanding the above, the first valid election of an Annuity Starting Date and Form of Benefits which the Participant makes after his Normal Retirement Age will govern all additional benefits accrued thereafter.
6.4	Total and Permanent Disability Benefit.
A.	A Participant who becomes totally and permanently disabled, while still a Participant in the Plan, and after the Participant has earned ten (10) years of vesting credit, may elect to receive the Total and Permanent Disability Benefits described in this Section.
For purposes of this Article, participation ceases on the first day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year during which a Participant experiences a one year break in service as defined in Section 7.3A.
For purposes of this Article, effective March 1, 1986, a Participant shall be deemed to be totally and permanently disabled only if he is determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the Social Security Administration.
The Benefit provided by this Article is not available to a former Participant whose participation ceased within the meaning of this Section, prior to his becoming disabled. The Benefit provided by this Article is not available to a Participant who the Trustees determine has become disabled while engaged in the commission of a felony or as a result of willful intention to injure himself or to induce an illness that could result in disability.
— 12 —
B.	Such Participant who shall be so certified as totally and permanently disabled shall be entitled to receive a monthly disability pension based on his accrued benefits (but in no event less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month), commencing with the month in which he is eligible to receive his first disability payment from the Social Security Administration and he shall continue to receive such disability pension until the earliest of death, recovery from his total and permanent disability, the election of an Early Retirement Benefit, or attainment of Normal Retirement Age.
Upon attaining Normal Retirement Age (or at Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date, if elected by the Participant), the Participant’s Benefits shall convert to one of the forms of benefit payable for the Normal Retirement Benefit (or Early Retirement Benefit) and the Total and Permanent Disability Benefit shall cease. At that time the Participant shall receive the notices and elections that a Participant would receive at Normal Retirement Age. The Participant’s monthly benefit after converting to Early or Normal Retirement Benefit will in no event be less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month.
C.	Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of a Participant who is otherwise eligible for any benefit under this Plan. Nor shall the receipt of benefits under this Section cause a reduction in the amount of retirement or other benefits which may be due to the Participant or his beneficiary under other provisions of this Plan. A Participant who receives benefits under this Section shall be entitled to the same retirement benefits (Preretirement Survivor Annuity, Early Retirement Benefit and Normal Retirement Benefit) in the same form, under the same conditions and with the same notification and election procedures as he would otherwise have been entitled to if he had not received the disability benefits.
6.5	Death Benefit. Effective March 1, 1986, in addition to the benefits otherwise provided by this Plan and Trust, the Plan and Trust shall pay a death benefit in the amount of $3,000 to the designated beneficiary of any Participant who has retired under this Plan on July 1, 1982 or thereafter, provided that the Participant was an active Participant at the time of his Annuity Starting Date. For purposes of this paragraph, the term retirement means that the Participant commences receiving a benefit payment under this Plan other than a Total and Permanent Disability Payment. For purposes of this paragraph, the term active Participant means a Participant whose participation has not ceased under Article UI.
Effective with respect to Participants who die September 1, 1989 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the requirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the amount of the death benefit shall be $5,000. This increase shall not apply to any Participant who was employed by an employer which is signatory to an agreement with Sign and Pictorial Painters Local Union 774, during the Plan Year during which the Participant last completed an hour of service.
Effective with respect to Participants who die October 1, 1991 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the requirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the Participant is eligible for Death Benefit only if the Participant was (at the time of his Annuity Starting Date under the Pension Plan), a covered Participant for the Death Benefit under the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or on Waiver of Premium for Disability under the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or the Painters District Council No. 2 Group Insurance Trust.
6.6	Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.
A.	General Rule. A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (as defined in this Section) is payable to the survi ving spouse of any Participant who dies after August 22,1984 but before his Annuity Starting Date, who has been married to the surviving spouse for a period of one year immediately preceding the date of death, and who had met one of the requirements of Article VII and was therefore vested as of the date of his death.
B.	Definition. A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity is an annuity payable to the surviving spouse of a Participant who meets the requirement of Section 6.6A, computed under Section 6.6C.
C.	Computation of Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.
I.	If a Participant dies after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant, the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the day before the Participant’s Death.
— 13 —
2.	If a Participant dies before the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant, the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity, if the Participant had:
a.	Separated from service on the day he last worked in covered employment;
b.	Survived to the earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant.
c.	Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, and
d.	Died on the next day.
3.	Subject to the next succeeding paragraph (6.6C4), the monthly payments to the surviving spouse shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the later of:
a.	The date of the Participant’s death, or
b.	The earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;
and shall continue until and including the payment for the month in which the surviving spouse dies. No survivorship benefits shall be payable if the Participant’s spouse fails to survive to the date on which the annuity payments are to begin. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section 6.7.
4.	Notwithstanding the above, the surviving spouse may defer his or her Annuity Starting Date to any date on or before the later of:
a.	The Participant’s Normal Retirement Date; or
b.	The first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant’s 62nd birthday.
In the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the amount will be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity two days before the deferred Annuity Starting Date and died the next day. If the Participant’s spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting Date, no survivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section 6.7.
5.	The Trustees shall distribute the survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse at any time prior to the annuity starting date, in lump sum form, if the present value of the benefit does not exceed S3.5OO.
For purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan is required to use an interest rate no greater than the rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in valuing a lump sum distribution upon Plan termination.
6.7	Beneficiary Annuity.
A.	A Beneficiary Annuity, as defined in Section 6.7B shall be paid to the beneficiary determined under Section 6.7C of any Participant who meets either of the following eligibility requirements:
1.	A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date but has not met the requirements for a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity; or
2.	A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date while eligible for a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity, but whose surviving spouse dies prior to the surviving spouse’s Annuity Starting Date under the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.
— 14 —
B.	The Beneficiary Annuity is the monthly amount which would have been payable under the Normal Form of Benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date, provided, however, that this amount is payable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries determined under Section 6.7C only for 60 months. Benefit payments to the beneficiary will commence with the first day of the first month following the month in which the Participant would have reached age 60 or if later, the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant dies.
C.	The beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to the Beneficiary Annuity shall be determined in the same manner as the beneficiary is determined under Section 5.2.
D.	This Section shall be effective with regard to an eligible Participant whose death occurs on or after January 19, 1995.
ARTICLE VII

7.2	Year of Vesting Service.
A.	The vesting computation period is the twelve month period commencing July 1 of each year and ending June 30 of the following year.
B.	A Participant whose Participation ceased (within the meaning of Article ID) on or after January 1, 1976, earns a year of vesting service for any vesting computation period up to and including the vesting computation period which ended June 30, 1992, during which the Participant completed one hour of service, as defined in Section 1.19.
C.	For each vesting computation period commencing with the vesting computation period that begins July 1,1992, a Participant earns a year of vesting service for each such vesting computation period during which the Participant completed 400 or more hours of service as defined in Section 1.19.
D.	Years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service (as defined in Section 7.3D) are forfeited and do not count toward years of vesting service.

— 15 —
Participant’s cessation of participation is after the tenth anniversary (orif applicable, the fifth anniversary) of the date that the Participant first participated.
F.	For purposes of computing years of service for vesting only, hours of service with a Contributing Employer for which the Employer is not obligated to contribute to this Trust shall be counted provided that such noncovered service is contiguous with the Participant's service for which contributions were required. Noncovered service shall be considered as contiguous with covered service if there is no intervening quit, discharge or other termination. No benefits are accrued for contiguous noncovered service.
7.3	Break-in-Service
A.	A one year break in service occurs when, during any vesting computation period up to and including the vesting computation period that ended on June 30,1992, a Participant has no hours of service. For vesting computation period beginning with the vesting computation period that begins on July 1, 1992 and thereafter, a one year break in service occurs when, during any such vesting computation period, a Participant or former Participant completes less than 400 hours of service.
B.	A Participant who experiences a one year break in service after he has become vested within the meaning of 7.1, is entitled to have his pre-break service counted for vesting and benefit accrual purposes.
C.	A Participant who experiences a one year break in service prior to becoming vested and who subsequently becomes a Participant in the Plan shall be entitled to have his years of vesting service and his years of accredited service for purposes of benefit computation prior to that one year break in service counted unless the break in service is a “permanent break in service" within the meaning of the following Section 7.3D. Conversely, years of service prior to a permanent break in service will not be counted.
D.	A Permanent Break in Service occurs if a nonvested Participant experiences consecutive one year breaks in service which equal or exceed, the greater of:
1.	five years of service;
2.	the number of the Participant’s years of service before the break in service.
ARTICLE Vm
Forms of Benefit Payments
8.1	Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this Article Vin.
A.	The term “Annuity Starting Date” shall have the meaning set out in Section 1.24.
B.	A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who has been married to his spouse for at least one year immediately prior to his Annuity Starting Date is a form of annuity which pays a lifetime monthly pension payment to the Participant and upon the Participant’s death, pays one-half of that amount in monthly payments to the Participant’s “surviving spouse” for the life of the surviving spouse. The Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for a married Participant will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would receive under the Normal Form of Benefits under this Plan. The monthly amount of the Participant’s pension is reduced in accordance with the actuarial assumptions used by the Plan and the ages of the Participant and his spouse.
A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who has not been married for one year immediately prior to his Annuity Starting Date is a life annuity. This annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit which the Participant would have received under the Normal Form of Benefits under this Plan.
— 16 —
C.	The “surviving spouse" for purposes of this Article is the spouse to whom the Participant was lawfully married as of the Annuity Starting Date. If the “surviving spouse" predeceases the Participant, no survivorship annuity will be payable, even if the Participant remarries, The death of the surviving spouse prior to the Participant’s death will not affect the amount of the monthly payment to the Participant.
8.2	General Rule Concerning Form of Benefits. Effective for any Participant whose Annuity Starting Date is July 1,1976, or thereafter, benefits shall be paid in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity unless the Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3. A Participant who was married as of his Annuity Starting Date, but has been married less than a year, will have his benefits converted to the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for a married Participant on the one year anniversary of his marriage, if his spouse and the Participant are still surviving, unless the Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3.
8.3	Waiver of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.
A.	A Participant who is otherwise required to receive his benefits in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survi vor Annuity may waive said form of benefits by filing with the Fund Office a valid waiver during the election period. The election period is the ninety (90) day period prior to the Annuity Starting Date. Any valid election made during an election period prior to an Annuity Starting Date which is on or after the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age will govern all payments of benefits earned thereafter. Any election may be revoked at any time during the election period.
B.	In order to be valid, an election to wai ve the Qualified Joint and Survi vor Annuity must meet the following requirements:
1.	It must be in writing.
2.	It must be filed no less than thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days after the Participant receives the Notice and Explanation described in Section 8.4. The Notice and Explanation is presumed to be received on the third day after the date it is mailed.
3.	In the case of a Participant who has had one or more hours of service after August 23,1984, the waiver must be consented to in writing by the Participant’s spouse (unless such consent is not required under subsection 8.3B4). Said consent must also acknowledge in writing the effect of the election. The consent and acknowledgment required by this subsection must be witnessed by a notary public or a plan representative.
Effective for any election filed with regard to an Annuity Starting Date on or after July 1, 1987, the waiver and consent must name the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, if any, who will receive survivorship benefits under the Plan and must name the form of benefits to be paid under the Plan, (subject to the following paragraph). If a consent names a designated beneficiary and/or a specific form of benefits, then any subsequent change to said designated beneficiary and/or form of benefits is invalid unless a new consent is obtained from the spouse, which meets the requirements of this Section 8.3.
If the consent does not name a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries or a specific form of benefits, or if the Participant and spouse desire that future changes in the beneficiary and/or form of benefits may be made without spousal consent, the consent must acknowledge that the spouse has the right to limit consent to a specific beneficiary and a specific form of benefits and the consent must voluntarily waive whichever (or both) of said rights, in accordance with the desires of the Participant and his spouse.
4.	The consent described in this Section 8.3 is not required if it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent otherwise required cannot be obtained because:
a.	there is no spouse:
b.	the spouse cannot be located; or
c.	such other circumstances exi st as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury as sufficient
to obviate the requirement of the spousal consent.
8.4	. Notice and Explanation of Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the Right to Waive Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.
A.	Within a reasonable time prior to the Annuity Starting Date, the Plan must provide the Participant with a notice in writing explaining the terms of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the right to waive that Annuity Form of Benefit This Notice will be provided within a reasonable period of time before the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age and a reasonable period of time before any Early Retirement Date or Postponed Retirement Date. A Participant may not elect an Annuity Starting Date at any time before the 31st day after he has received the Notice.
B.	The Notice and Explanation must contain a written explanation of the following:
1.	The terms and conditions of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity;
2.	The Participant’s right to make an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the procedure for making the election;
3.	The effect of an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor form of benefit;
4.	The rights of the Participant’s spouse, including the right to withhold consent; and
5.	The right to revoke an election to waive Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the effect of such or revocation.
8.5	Optional Forms of Retirement Benefits.
A.	In the event a Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, he may elect to receive his benefits in any of the following optional forms:
1.	Life Annuity with a 60 month guarantee (described in Section 5.2 of this Plan).
2.	A Life Annuity with 120 month guarantee, which is the same form of payments as the life annuity with 60 month guarantee as described in Section 5.2, but the number of guaranteed payments is 120. This option may only be selected if the 120 monthly payments will not extend payments beyond the life expectancy of the Participant and his designated beneficiary.
3.	A Life Only Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant for his lifetime with no further payments after the monthly payment for the month in which the Participant dies.
4.	A Joint and Full Survivor Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payments in the same amount to the “surviving spouse”.
5.	A Joint arid Two-Thirds Survivor Annuity, which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payment equal to 66-2/3% of the amount that the Participant was receiving, to the “surviving spouse”.
B.	All optional forms of benefits (including the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity) shall be adjusted so that the actuarial value of the benefit is the actuarial equivalent of the Participant’s accrued benefit stated in the Normal Form of Benefit (Section 5.2). Under this Plan, actuarial equivalent means that whenever it is necessary to convert one form of annuity to another form of annuity or to a lump sum, the result will be benefits substantially equal in value as determined by application of the 1971 Male Group Annuity Monthly tables and a 6-1/2% interest rate.
— 18 —
C.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustees shall distribute the Participant’s benefits or the Beneficiary's benefits in the form of a lump sum payment on or prior to the annuity starting date if the present value of the benefits does not exceed $3,500. For purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan shall use the interest rate established by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as of the beginning of the Plan Year for valuing a lump sum distribution upon plan termination or individual termination. This section shall not apply after the Annuity Starting Date unless the Participant or Beneficiary consents in writing to the single sum distribution.
ARTICLE IX

The following additional rules apply for plan years beginning July 1,1983 to July 1,1986, inclusive: in the case of a Participant whose benefits hereunder commence prior to his attainment of age 62, the limitation set forth in subsection Al of this section shall, in accordance with the regulations issued by the Secretary of Treasury, be adjusted so that it is the equivalent to such a benefit beginning at age 62, provided that such an adjustment shall not reduce such limitation below:
1.	If the benefit commences after the Employee attains age 55, $75,000, or
2.	If the benefit commences before the Employee attains age 55, the amount which is the actuarial equivalent to the $75,000 limitation at age 55.
In the case of an Employee whose benefits hereunder commence after he has attained the age of 65, the limitation set forth in subsection Al of this section shall, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Treasury, be adjusted so that it is the actuarial equivalent to the dollar limitation for a benefit commencing at age 65. For purposes of adjusting any benefit under this subsection, the interest rate assumption shall be 5%.
E.	Notwithstanding the limitations of subsection A of this section, if a Participant was covered by the Plan before the first day of the Limitation Year beginning in 1983, he may receive an annual retirement benefit which is not less than the amount of his current accrued benefit as of the close of the last Limitation Year beginning before 1983, as determined under the terms of the Plan as then in effect disregarding any amendments or cost of living adjustments after July 1, 1982. For purposes of this Section, the term “Limitation Year” shall mean the Plan Credit Year.
F.	The following rules apply for Plan Years beginning July 1,1987 and thereafter. In the case of a participant whose Annuity Starting Date is prior to Social Security Retirement Age, the $90,000 limitation contained in Section 11.1 Al shall be actuarially reduced so that it is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of
— 22 —
$90,000 commencing at the Social Security Retirement Age. In the case of a Participant whose Annuity Starting Date is after Social Security Retirement Age, the $90,000 limitation contained in Section 11.1 Al shall be actuarially increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of $90,000 commencing at the Social Security Retirement Age.
G.	If a Participant covered by this Plan participates in both Defined Benefit and Defined Contributions Plans maintained by the Employer, the sum of 1 and 2 below may not exceed 1.0:
1.	The sum of the projected annual benefit of the Employee under all Defined Benefit pension plans of the Employer determined as of the close of the Limitation Year, divided by the lesser of:
a.	The product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Section 415(b)( 1)(A) of
the Internal Revenue Code for such year, or
b.	The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken into account under Section 415(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to such Employee for such year.
2.	The sum of the annual additions to the Employee’s account under all defined contributions plans of the Employer as of the close of the Limitation Year and for all prior Calendar Years divided by the sum of the lesser of a or b for such year and for each prior year of service with the Employer (regardless of whether any such defined contribution plan was in existence during those years), where;
a.	Is the product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Section 415(c)( 1 )(A) of the Internal Revenue Code for such year (without regard to Section 415 (c)(6) of such Code); and
b.	Is the product of 1.4 multiplied by the same amount which may be taken into account under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Interna] Revenue Code (or Section 415(c)(7) of such Code, if applicable) with respect to such individual under such plan for such year; provided however, that the Board of Trustees may elect that the amount taken into account for each Employee for all years ending before January 1,1983, under a and b above shall be determined pursuant to the special transition rule in such Section 415(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.
If this Plan is aggregated with another Plan that was in existence on July 1, 1982, and the above limitations are not met, each Participant for whom the limits are violated will not receive any annual additions or accruals in this Plan. In the event that at the earlier to occur of each December 31 or the date of an Employee retirement or termination, the sum of 1 and 2 above exceeds 1.0 and the benefit of such Employee under such other Plan or Plans is not reduced to bring such sum to 1.0, then such Employee’s benefits under this Plan shall be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the sum of 1 and 2 above for each Employee to equal 1.0.

A.	Definitions. For purposes of this Article, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning stated below unless a different meaning is clearly required by the context:
1.	Kev Employee.
“Key Employee” means an employee or former employee (and the beneficiary of such employee) meeting the definition of “Key Employee” contained in Section 416(i)( 1) of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 1.416-1 of the Treasury Regulations.
2.	Non-Key Employee.

b.	Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, effective July 1, 1994, the accrued benefit of any Participant whose Compensation exceeded $150,000 in any Plan Credit Year beginning before August 1,1994, shall be the greater of:
the sum of
(1)	TheParticipant’saccniedbenefitasofJune30,1994, determined under Article Vasthough the Participant had terminated employment on that date and without regard to any Plan amendments adopted after that date (but taking into account remedial amendments that apply retroactively before that date under Section 401(b) of the Internal Revenue Code), plus
(2)	the amount of the Participant’s benefit accrued on or after July 1, 1994, under Article V, taking into account only years of service after June 30, 1994, and
the Participant’s accrued benefit, determined under Article V, taking into account all Years of Service before and after July 1, 1994.
4.	Determination Date.
“Determination Date” means, with respect to any Plan Credit Year, the last day of the preceding Plan
— 25 —
Credit Year, or in the case of the first Plan Credit Years of any Plan, the last day of such Plan Credit Year.
B.	Top-Heavy Plan Requirements.
Effective January 1, 1984, for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the Plan shall provide the following:
1.	This Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan for any Plan Credit Year commencing after December 31,1983, in which, as of the Determination Date,
a.	the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees and
b.	the sum of the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an Aggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the present value of accrued benefits and the aggregate accounts of all Key Employees and non-Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an Aggregation Group.
If any participant is a Non-Key Employee for a Plan Credit Year, but such Participant was a Key Employee for any prior Plan Credit Year, such Participant’s present value of accrued benefits and/or aggregate account balance shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation Group which includes this Plan is a Top-Heavy Group). In addition, for Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31, 1984, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for any Employer maintaining the Plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date, the aggregate account and/or present value of accrued benefit for such Participant or former Participant shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan.
2.	A Participant’s aggregate account as of the Determination Date shall be determined under applicable provisions of the defined contribution plan used in determining Top-Heavy Plan status.
3.	“Aggregation Group” means either a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation Group as hereinafter determined.
a.	In determining a Required Aggregation Group hereunder, each plan of an Employer in which a Key Employee is a Participant, and each other plan of an Employer which enables any plan in which a Key Employee participates to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code, will be required to be aggregated. Such group shall be known as a “Required Aggregation Group.”
In the case of a Required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a TopHeavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.
b.	An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required Aggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such group shall be known as a “Permissive Aggregation Group."
In the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group will be considered a TopHeavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.
— 26 —
c.	Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan Credit Year shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy Plans.
4.	In the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant’s present value of accrued benefits shall be determined:
a.	as of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most recent valuation date within a twelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;
b.	for the first Plan Credit Year, as if:
the Participant terminated service as of the Determination Date; or
the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account the estimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.
c.	for any other Plan Credit Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation
date,
d.	the actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit plan minimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan Credit Year.
5.	The calculation of a Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date shall be the sum of the following:
a.	the present value of accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent actuarial valuation;
b.	any Plan distributions made within the Plan Credit Year that includes the Determination Date or within four preceding Plan Credit Years. However, in the case of distributions made after the valuation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as distributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already included in the Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions made prior to July 1,1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been terminated would have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;
c.	any Employee contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory. However, amounts attributable to tax deductible Qualified Voluntary Employee Contributions shall not be considered to be a part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits;
d.	with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by the
Employee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by another Employer), if this Plan provides for rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall always consider such rollover or plan-to-plan transfers as a distribution for purposes of this section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not consider such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted after June 30, 1984, as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted prior to July 1,1984, shall be considered as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits; and
e.	with respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones either not initiated by the Employee or made to a plan maintained by the same Employer), if this Plan provides the rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall not be counted as a distribution for purposes of this section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall consider such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer as part of the Participant ’ s present value of accrued benefits, irrespective of the date on which such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer is accepted.
f.	“Top-Heavy Group" means an Aggregation Group in which, as of the Determination Date, the sum of:
(1)	the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees under all defined benefit plans included in the group; and
(2)	the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined contribution plans included in the group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all Participants.
g.	. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date otherwise provided for herein for the application of Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code to this Plan (Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31,1983) shall be extended in accordance with any federal law or regulatory authority.
C.	Top-Heavy Vesting.
1.	Notwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VH of the Plan for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the vested portion of any Participant’s accrued benefit shall be determined on the basis of the Participant’s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the following schedule:
Service for Vesting
(excluding Years of Service for Vesting prior to effective date of this Plan)	Vested percentage
1 year 2 years 3 years	0% 0% 100%
2.	If, in any subsequent Plan Credit Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may elect to:
a.	continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant’s accrued benefit; or
b.	revert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to Section 411 (a)( 10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The nonforfeitable percentage of the accrued benefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore must not be reduced and any Participant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of remaining under the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a Plan amendment.
3.	The Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the accrued benefit of any Employee who does not have one hour of work after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee’s accrued benefit attributable to Employer contributions will be determined without regard to this Article.
D.	Top-Heavy Benefit Requirement
1.	The minimum accrued benefit derived from Employer contributions to be provided under this section for each Non-Key Employee who is a Participant shall equal the product pf:
a.	one-twelfth (1/12th) of Annua) Compensation averaged over the five consecutive “limitation years” (or actual number of “limitation years” if less) which produces the highest average, and
b.	the lesser of
— 28 —
(1)	two percent (2%) multiplied by Years of Vesting Service; or
(2)	twenty percent {20%).
2.	For purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code, a Non-Key Employee who is not a Participant solely because:
a.	his Annual Compensation is below a stated amount, or
b.	he declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan will be considered to be a Participant.
3.	For purposes of this section. Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Credit Year ending prior to July 1, 1984, or for any Plan Credit Year during which the Plan was not a Top-Heavy Plan shall be disregarded.
4.	For purposes of this section, Annual Compensation for any “limitation year” ending prior to July 1, 1984, or subsequent to the last “limitation year” during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan shall be disregarded. The term “limitation year” means the Plan Credit Year.
5.	If the Plan provides for the normal retirement benefit to be paid in a form other than a single life annuity, the accrued benefit under this section shall be the Actuarial Equivalence of the minimum accrued benefit under Article V.
6.	If payment of the minimum accrued benefit commences at a date other than Normal Retirement Age, the minimum accrued benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with Article VI of the Plan.
7.	If aNon-Key Employee participates in this Plan and adefined contribution plan included in a Required Aggregation Group which is Top-Heavy, the minimum benefits shall be provided under this Plan.
8.	To the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Article VII of the Plan the minimum accrued benefit under this section may not be forfeited under Sections 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.
ARTICLE Xin
Right to Amend
The Trustees shall have the sole right to amend this Plan and Trust without the consent of any Participant, at any time from time to time as may be deemed advisable; provided, however, that no amendment to this Trust shall deprive any Participant of any accrued benefit or vested equitable interest herein, if any, nor shall such amendment be contrary to any laws in existence or enacted by the Federal or State Government directly concerning this Trust, provided that the Trustees may adopt an amendment
A.	If it is necessary to establish or maintain the qualification of the Plan or the Trust Fund under the Internal Revenue Code and to maintain compliance of the Plan with the requirements of ERISA; or
B.	If the amendment meets the requirements of Section 302(c)(8) of ERISA and Section 412(c)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the Secretary of Labor has been notified of such amendment and has either approved of it or, within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, has failed to disapprove.
Either the Trustees representing the Union or the Trustees representing the Employers may propose amendments to this Trust. Such amendment will become effective when it has been approved and executed by a majority of the Trustees. All amendments adopted relevant to the continuing qualification of this Plan and Trust under the Internal Revenue Code shall be submitted to the United States Internal Revenue Service for its determination of the qualification of such amendment.

In the case of the pension of a Participant or Beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the three year period ending on the termination date of the Plan, to each pension, based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five year period ending on such date) under which such pension would be the least The lowest pension in pay status during the three year period shall be considered the pension in pay status for such period.
b.	In the case of a pension of a Participant or Beneficiary which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such three year period if the Participant had retired prior to the beginning of the three year period if his pension had commenced (in the standard form) as of the beginning of such period, to each such pension based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five year period ending on such date) under which the pension would be the least

If an unequal number of Employer and Union Trustees attend a meeting, the voting power of the group with less Trustees present shall be and stand increased to that of the group with more Trustees present so that there shall be equal voting strength between Employer and Union Trustees at all times at such meeting. A deadlock shall be deemed to exist whenever either of following situations arise: (1) whenever a proposal, nomination, motion or resolution or other matter is voted upon and the votes cast are evenly divided and remain evenly divided; and (2) whenever a quorum is lacking at a meeting duly called and there shall be absent from said meeting two (2) or more Trustees of one group, and a majority of the Trustees present declare a deadlock due to the inability to obtain a quorum. In the event of such deadlock in either case arising, the Employer Trustees and the Union Trustees shall meet promptly for the purpose of agreeing upon an impartial umpire to break such deadlock by casting the deciding vote or deciding any dispute in question or matter under consideration. In the event of the inability of the Employer Trustees and Union Trustees to agree upon the selection of such impartial umpire, then such impartial umpire shall, on the petition of either the Employer Trustees or Union Trustees, be appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the district wherein the principal office of the Trust is located. The decision of any such impartial umpire shall be final and binding on the Trustees and all concerned.
Either the Chairman or the Managing Trustee or any two (2) Trustees may call a meeting of the Trustees at any time by giving at least five (5) days’ written notice of the time and place thereof to each Trustee. Any meeting so called may be postponed once for a reasonable period upon the request of any Trustee upon showing of justifiable cause therefor. Any meeting of the Trustees may also be held at any time without notice if all of the Trustees consent thereto in writing or if all attend and act. If all of the Trustees shall concur in writing upon any proposition, no formal meeting thereon need be held by Trustees. The Managing Trustee, in the written notice, shall notify the Trustees of the subjects to be discussed but this shall not be construed to limit any other subjects of discussion properly placed before the meeting.
The Trustees and Fund Office personnel may receive reimbursement for expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of their duties, including but not limited to expenses incurred in attending educational conferences, seminars and meetings, provided that the trustees determine in each case the subject matter of the conference, seminar or meeting is relevant to the administration of this Trust and that the expenses incurred are reasonable. The Trustees may adopt travel expenditure guidelines for such expenses. Reasonable compensation may be paid to the Trustees for services rendered in the performance of their duties as Trustees provided such payments are made in accordance with the Federal and State laws and regulations then in effect governing Trusts.

ARTICLE V
Agcrual of Benefits
5.1	General Rules. This Article sets forth the rules for determining and computing the amount of a Participant’s accrued benefit under the Plan. The accumulation and retention of accrued benefit credits are subject to the requirements concerning Years of Vesting Service and Breaks in Service. The Benefit Amounts are subject to reduction on account of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (Article VUI) and modification if the Participant retires with an annuity starting date other than his normal retirement date, or with a form of benefits other than the normal form of benefits.
Eligibility to receive a benefit based on the Participant’s accrued benefit depends on meeting the conditions for benefit entitlement (Article VI) and/or the rules concerning Years of Vesting Service and Permanent Break in Service (Article VII).
5.2	Normal Form of Benefit. For purposes of this Plan the normal form of benefits is a life annuity, with a 60 month guarantee. This form includes the payment of a monthly amount commencing with the Annuity Starting Date and continuing until the month in which the Participant dies. If the death of the Participant occurs after his Annuity Starting Date, but before all sixty (60) guaranteed monthly payments have been made, the remaining payments shall be made to the named beneficiary, if then surviving, or if such beneficiary is not then surviving, to the contingent beneficiarey, if then surviving. If no designated beneficiary is surviving at the time of the Participant’s death, the remaining payments shall be made to the Participant’s estate. If a beneficiary who is receiving guaranteed payments dies before all guaranteed payments are made, payments will continue to the contingent beneficiary, if one is then surviving. If no contingent beneficiary is then surviving, the remaining payments will be made to the estate of the beneficiary who last received a payment, until all guaranteed payments have been made.
The amount of benefit stated in the Plan (Section 5.3) is the amount which the Participant would receive each month, if the Participant receives a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, commencing at normal retirement date. In the event the Participant receives a form of payment different from the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee, or in the event the Participant begins to receive benefits at a time other than his normal retirement date, the monthly amount which the Participant will be entitled to receive will be different from the amount stated in this section. The amount received will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of benefit stated in Section 5.3; that is, it will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would be entitled to under the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee form of payment, commencing at normal retirement date.
5.3	Amount of Benefit Stated in the Normal Benefit Form. The amount of benefit that a Participant accrues stated in the normal form of benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at Normal Retirement Date, is the sum of the amount determined under subsection 5.3A and the amount determined under Section 5.3B.
A.	The amount determined under this subsection (“accredited past service benefit”) is $2.50 for each year of accredited past service for any Participant who participated on and after July 1, 1964. An eligible Participant receives a year of accredited past service for each continuous year of service prior to July 1, 1964. No Participant who first participated in the Plan after July 1, 1964 shall be entitled to past service credits. The amount determined under this subsection is subject to the rules concerning permanent breaks in service.
B.	The amount determined under this subsection (“accredited future service benefit”) is the sum of the amounts
earned by the Participant under all applicable tables. Accredited future service benefit will be accrued under this subsection for each 12 consecutive month period commencing with July 1, 1964, and subsequent anniversaries thereof (“benefit accrual year”), based on the number of “hours of service” completed by the Participant during the particular benefit accrual year, subject to the following rules:
1.	No accredited future service benefit will be accrued by a Participant for any benefit accrual year during which the Participant fails to complete at least 400 hours of service.
— 6 —
2.	The accrual of accredited future service benefits under this subsection is subject to the rules concerning permanent breaks in service.
3.	The amounts set out in these tables are subject to the rules contained in Subsection 5.3C.
The amount of accredited future service benefit accrued by a Participant during each benefit accrual year is:

The resulting accrued benefit shall be added to the accredited future service benefit, if any, accrued for service on and after July 1, 1985, to arrive at the Participant’s total accrued benefit.
3.	The tables marked “Subject to Subsection 5.3C3” do not apply to Participants who are employed by contributing employers who are signatory to agreements with Sign and Pictorial Painters Local Union 774. The accredited future service benefit accrued by Participants who are employed by contributing employers signatory to agreements with Local 774 shall, for any future service benefit accrual year, be the amount set out in the last most recently effective table which is not marked “Subject to Subsection 5.3C3.” The accrued benefit for such a Participant shall be the total of all amounts accrued under the applicable tables which are not marked “Subject to Subsection 5.3C3”, adjusted by Subsection 5.3C1, if applicable.

ARTICLE VI
Conditions for Benefit Entitlement/Types of Benefits
In order to be entitled to received benefits under this Plan, a Participant or Beneficiary must meet the requirements for one of the types of benefits described in this Article VI.
6.1	Normal Retirement Benefit. If a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date while still an active Participant in the Plan (i.e. pripr to his Participation ceasing within the meaning of Article HI), the Participant shall be entitled to a Normal Retirement Benefit. If a Participant reaches his Normal Retirement Date while not an active Participant, but has met one of the requirements of Article VII such that he has become vested in his accrued benefit, the Participant shall be entitled to a Normal Retirement Benefit upon reaching his Normal Retirement Date.
— 9 —
A Normal Retirement Benefit is paid in the form provided under Article VIH and is based on the Participant’s accrued benefit as computed under Article V, without reduction for early retirement.
A participant who has met the requirements for a Normal Retirement Benefit is entitled to begin to receive benefits as of his Normal Retirement Date without regard to whether he continues to work in covered employment and without regard to whether he is entitled to Social Security Benefits.
In the event a Participant accrues additional accredited future service benefits for service after his Normal Retirement Annuity Starting Date, he shall be credited with such service. However, any such additional accredited future service shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the actuarial value of any normal retirement benefits paid to the Participant subsequent to his Normal Retirement Date. Notwithstanding the reduction set forth in the previous sentence, a Participant who completes 1,200 or more hours of service in any Plan Year after his Annuity Starting Date, commencing with the Plan Year beginning July 1, 1994, shall accrue at least the benefit set forth in the following table:
Hours Worked In Plan Year	Additional Monthly Benefit Stated in the Normal Form of Benefit
1,200- 1,399	$10
1,400- 1,599	$15
1,600- 1,799	$20
1,800-1,999	$25
2,000-2,199	$30
2,200 - 2,399	$35
2,400 - 2,599	$40
2,600 - 2,799	$45
2,800 - 2,999	$50
3,000-3,199	$55
3,200 or more	$60
Additional accredited future service earned in any benefit accrual year for service after the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date, shall become payable as soon as administratively feasible following the end of that benefit accrual year; the first payment shall include retroactive payments to and including the first payment due July 1. The Participant’s post Normal Retirement Age election as to the form of benefits will apply to the additional accredited service accrued after his Normal Retirement Date.
6.2	Postponed Retirement Date. Subject to the requirements of subsection 9.4, a Participant who has met the requirements for a Normal Retirement Benefit may elect to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date of his choice after his Normal Retirement Date. In such event, the Participant shall notify the Fund Office of his intent to postpone his Annuity Starting Date and, if he knows, of his postponed Annuity Starting Date. The Participant shall, within a reasonable time of said notification, receive the notification described in subsection 8.4. The Participant’s election period for purposes of subsection 8.3, shall be the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the Participant’s elected Postponed Annuity Starting Date. In the event of a Postponed Annuity Starting Date, the amount of Participant’s monthly benefit shall be actuarially adjusted to reflect the later commencement date. The actuarial adjustment for any additional accredited service which accrues for service after the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date shall run from the date that the benefits would have first been payable (i.e., September 1 following the end of the benefit accrual year in which the benefits accrued). In no event shall the Participant be permitted to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date after his “Required Beginning Date,” as defined in Section 9.4A.
— 10 —
6.3	Early Retirement Benefit.
A.	A Participant may elect an Early Retirement Benefit (to be computed in accordance with Section 6.3E) by electing an Annuity Starting Date at any time before his Normal Retirement Date, after meeting the following eligibility requirements:
1.	Attainment of age 62, and
2.	Completion of ten (10) years of vesting credit under the Plan.
B.	Effective July 1, 1988, and thereafter, the following provisions shall apply for all Participants except Participants who are employed by Contributing Employers who are signatory to agreements with Sign and Pictorial Painters Local Union 774 (the early retirement eligibility and benefit amount of these excluded Participants are to continue to be determined under subsection 6.3A).
1.	A Participant may elect an Early Retirement Benefit (to be computed in accordance with subsection 6.3E) by electing an Annuity Starting Date at any time before his Normal Retirement Date, after meeting the following requirements:
a.	Attainment of age 60, and
b.	Completion of ten (10) years of vesting credit under the Plan.
2.	A Participant may elect an Early Retirement Benefit (to be computed without the reduction set forth in subsection 6.3E) by electing an Annuity Starting Date before his Normal Retirement Date, after meeting the following eligibility requirements:
a.	Attainment of age 60, and
b.	Completion of ten (10) years of vesting service under the Plan, and
c.	Accrual of twenty-five (25) years of credited service as defined herein. For purposes of this subsection 6.3B2, a year of credited service is any year in which the Participant accrued any benefit under the Plan (including a year of past service credit under the Plan). In addition, as to Participants who were Participants in the Plan as of July 1,1988, a year of credited service for purposes of this subsection 6.3B2 includes any year of service within the geographic jurisdiction of Painters District Council No. 2, as it was constituted on July 1, 1988, under a collective bargaining agreement to which a union affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Painters was a party.
C.	Effective September 1, 1998, and thereafter, the following provisions shall apply for all Participants who are active Participants on or after April 1, 1998 except Participants who are employed by Contributing Employers who are signatory to agreements with Sign and Pictorial Painters Local Union 774 (the early retirement eligibility and benefit amount of these excluded Participants are to continue to be determined under subsection 6.3A). A Participant may elect an Early Retirement Benefit (to be computed without the reduction set forth in subsection 6.3E) by electing an Annuity Starting Date, at any time before his Normal Retirement Date, after meeting the following eligibility requirements:
1.	Attainment of age 58, and
2.	Completion of ten (10) years of vesting service under the Plan, and
3.	Accrual of thirty (30) years of credited service, as defined herein. For purposes of this Section 6.3C3, a year of credited service is any year in which the Participant accrued any benefit under the Plan (including a year of past service credit under the Plan). In addition, as to Participants who were Participants in the Plan as of April 1, 1998, a year of credited service for purposes of this subsection 6.3C.3 includes any year of service within the geographic jurisdiction of Painters District Council No. 2, as it was constituted on September 1, 1998, under a collective bargaining agreement to which a union affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Painters was a party. The eligibility provisions of this section represent alternative eligibility provisions to those set out in subsections 6.3A and 6.3B and do not replace the eligibility provisions set out in those subsections.
—11 —
D.	Except as specified in Section 8.2 below, the Early Retirement Benefit shall be paid in the Normal Form of Benefits under the Plan (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee). The Participant may elect any Annuity Starting Date after the date of his election and after meeting the applicable eligibility requirements.
E.	The amount of Early Retirement Benefit which the Participant will be entitled to receive each month, stated in the form of a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee will be the Participant’s Normal Benefit Amount, computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3, reduced by one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) for each full month that the Participant is younger than age 65 as of his Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date.
For any additional accredited future service which the Participant accrues after his Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date, the Participant is entitled to elect Annuity Starting Date(s), and for each such election, the Participant will receive the notices and election options set forth in Article VIII. Likewise, the spousal consent requirements of Article VIII will continue to apply to any such election. Notwithstanding the above, the first valid election of an Annuity Starting Date and Form of Benefits which the Participant makes on or after his Normal Retirement Date will govern all additional benefits accrued thereafter.
6.4	Total and Permanent Disability Benefit,
A.	A Participant who becomes totally and permanently disabled, while still a Participant in the Plan, and after the Participant has earned ten (10) years of vesting credit, may elect to receive the Total and Permanent Disability Benefits described in this Section.
For purposes of this Article, participation ceases on the first day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year during which a Participant experiences a one year break in service as defined in Section 7.3A.
For purposes of this Article, effective March 1, 1986, a Participant shall be deemed to be totally and permanently disabled only if he is determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the Social Security Administration.
The Benefit provided by this Article is not available to a former Participant whose participation ceased within the meaning of this Section, prior to his becoming disabled. The Benefit provided by this Article is not available to a Participant who the Trustees determine has become disabled while engaged in the commission of a felony or as a result of willful intention to injure himself or to induce an illness that could result in disability.
B.	Such Participant who shall be so certified as totally and permanently disabled shall be entitled to receive a monthly disability pension in the amount of his accrued benefit stated in the Normal Form of Benefits (but in no event less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month), commencing with the month in which he is eligible to receive his first disability payment from the Social Security Administration and he shall continue to receive such disability pension until the earliest of death, recovery from his total and permanent disability, the election of an Early Retirement Benefit, or attainment of Normal Retirement Age.
Upon attaining Normal Retirement Age (or at Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date, if elected by the Participant), the Participant’s Benefits shall convert to one of the forms of benefit payable for the Normal Retirement Benefit (or Early Retirement Benefit) and the Total and Permanent Disability Benefit shall cease. At that time the Participant shall receive the notices and elections that a Participant would receive at Normal Retirement Age. The Participant’s monthly benefit after converting to Early or Normal Retirement Benefit will in no event be less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month.
C.	Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of a Participant who is otherwise eligible for any benefit under this Plan. Nor shall the receipt of benefits under this Section cause a reduction in the amount of retirement or other benefits which may be due to the Participant or his beneficiary under other provisions of this Plan. A Participant who receives benefits under this Section shall be entitled to the same retirement benefits (Preretirement Survivor Annuity, Early Retirement Benefit and Normal Retirement Benefit) in the same form, under the same conditions and with the same notification and election procedures as he would otherwise have been entitled to if he had not received the disability benefits.
6.5	Death Benefit. Effective March 1. 1986, in addition to the benefits otherwise provided by this Plan and Trust, the Plan and Trust shall pay a death benefit in the amount of $3,000 to the designated beneficiary of any Participant who has retired under this Plan on July 1, 1982 or thereafter, provided the Participant was an active Participant at the time of his Annuity Suiting Date. For purposes of this paragraph, the term retirement means that the Participant commences receiving a benefit payment under this Plan other than a Toul and Permanent Disability Payment. For purposes of this paragraph, the term active Participant means a Participant whose participation has not ceased under Article HI.
Effective with respect to Participants who die September 1, 1989 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the requirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the amount of the death benefit shall be $5,000. This increase shall not apply to any Participant who was employed by an employer which is signatory to an agreement with Sign and Pictorial Painters Local Union 774, during the Plan Year during which the Participant last completed an hour of service.
Effective with respect to Participants who die October 1, 1991 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the requirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the Participant is eligible for Death Benefit only if the Participant was (at the time of his Annuity Starting Date under the Pension Plan) a covered Participant for the Death Benefit under the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or on Waiver of Premium for Disability under the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or the Painters District Council No. 2 Group Insurance Trust. For purposes of the death benefit for deaths that occur on or after October 1, 1991, it is no longer required that the Participant shall have been an active Participant in the Painters District Council Pension Plan at the time of his Annuity Starting Date.
6.6	Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity,
A.	General Rule. A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity (as defined in this Section) is payable to the surviving spouse of any Participant who dies after August 22, 1984 but before his Annuity Starting Date, who has been married to the surviving spouse for a period of one year immediately preceding the date of death, and who has met one of the requirements of Article VII and was therefore vested as of the date of his death.
B.	Definition. A Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity is an annuity payable to the surviving spouse of a Participant who meets the requirements of Section 6.6A computed under Section 6.6C.
C.	Compoutation of Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.
1.	If a Participant dies after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant, the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the day before the Participant’s death. If, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date under subsection 6.6C.4, the amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that subsection.
2.	If a Participant dies before the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant, the amount of the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the amount which would be payable to the surviving spouse as a suvivor annuity, if the Participant had:
a.	Separated from service on the day he last worked in covered employment;
b.	Survived to the earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;
c.	Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, and
d.	Died on the next day.
If, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date under subsection 6.6C.4, the amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that subsection.
— 13 —
3.	Subject to the next succeeding paragraph (6.6C4), the monthly payments to the surviving spouse shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the later of:
a.	The date of the Participant’s death, or
b.	The earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;
and shall continue until and including the payment for the month in which the surviving spouse dies. No survivorship benefits shall be payable if the Participant’s spouse fails to survive to the date on which the annuity payments are to begin. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section 6.7.
4.	Notwithstanding the above, the surviving spouse may defer his or her Annuity Starting Date to any date on or before the later of:
a.	The Participant’s Normal Retirement Date; or
b.	The first day of the month coincident with or next following the Participant’s 62nd birthday.
In the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the amount will be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity two days before the deferred Annuity Starting Date and died the next day. If the Participant’s spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting Date, no survivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section 6.7.
5.	The Trustees shall distribute the survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse at any time prior to the annuity starting date, in lump sum form, if the present value of the benefit does not exceed $5,000.
For purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan is required to use an interest rate no greater than the rate used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation in valuing a lump sum distribution upon Plan termination.
6.7	Beneficiary Annuity,
A.	A Beneficiary Annuity, as defined in subsection 6.7B shall be paid to the beneficiary determined under subsection 6.7C of any Participant who meets either of the following eligibility requirements:
1.	A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date but has not met the requirements for a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity; or
2.	A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date while eligible for a Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity, but whose surviving spouse dies prior to the surviving spouse’s Annuity Starting Date under the Qualified Preretirement Survivor Annuity.
B.	The Beneficiary Annuity is the monthly amount which would have been payable under the Normal Form of Benefits (a life annuity with a 60 month guarantee) commencing at the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date, provided, however, that this amount is payable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries determined under Section 6.7C only for 60 months. Benefit payments to the benficiary will commence with the first day of the first month following the month in which the Participant would have reached age 60 or if later, the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant dies or if later, the first day of the month following the death of the surviving spouse.
C.	The beneficiary or beneficiaries entitled to the Beneficiary Annuity shall be determined in the same manner as the beneficiary is determined under Section 5.2, except that if payment is required to be made under that section to the Participant’s estate and if more than one year has passed since the participant’s death, the payments shall be made to the Participant’s legal heirs determined under the laws of intestacy of the State of Missouri as of the date the payments are to commence.
D.	This Section shall be effective with regard to an eligible Participant whose death occurs on or before January 19, 1995.

ARTICLE VII
Vesting Requirements
7.1	General Rule. A Participant meets the requirements of Article VII, and is therefore “vested” for purposes of eligibility for plan benefits, if he meets one of the following requirements:
A.	A Participant who has completed ten years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service) is vested;
B.	A Participant who has completed five years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service) and whose participation ceases within the meaning of Article in after the Participant has reached the age of forty-five (45) is vested.
C.	A Participant whose termination of participation within the meaning of Article III occurs after the Participant has reached the age of sixty (60) is vested.
D.	For any Participant who has one hour of service on or after July 1, 1989 and who is not a Participant as a result of being covered under a collective bargaining agreement, that Participant is vested if he has completed five (5) years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service).
E.	Any Participant who has one hour of service on or after July 1,1998, is vested if he had completed five (5) years of vesting service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding years of service prior to a permanent break in service).
7.2	Year of Vesting Service,
A.	The vesting computation period is the twelve month period commencing July 1 of each year and ending June 30 of the following year.
B.	A Participant whose participation ceased (within the meaning of Article IB) on or after January 1, 1976, earns a year of vesting service for any vesting computation period up to and including the vesting computation period which ended June 30, 1992, during which the Participant completed one hour of service, as defined in Section 1.19.
C.	For each vesting computation period commencing with the vesting computation period that begins July 1, 1992, a Participant earns a year of vesting service for each such vesting computation period during which the Participant completed 400 or more hours of service as defined in Section 1.19.
D.	Years of vesting service prior to a permanent break in service (as defined in Section 7.3D) are forfeited and do not count toward years of vesting service.
E.	A Participant who ceased participation prior to December 1,1974, will be deemed to have completed 10 years of vesting service (or 5 years of vesting service if applicable) only if the Participant completes said years of vesting service in accordance with the rules contained in this Section 7.2 and if the date of the Participant’s cessation of participation is after the tenth anniversary (or if applicable, the fifth anniversary) of the date that the Participant first participated.
F.	For purposes of computing years of service for vesting only, hours of service with a Contributing Employer for which the Employer is not obligated to contribute to this Trust shall be counted provided that such noncovered service is contiguous with the Participant’s service for which contributions were required. Noncovered service shall be considered as contiguous with covered service if there is no intervening quit, discharge or other termination. No benefits are accrued for contiguous noncovered service.
7.3	Break-in-Service.
A.	A one year break in service occurs when, during any vesting computation period up to and including the vesting computation period that ended on June 30, 1992, a Participant has no hours of service, as defined in Section 1.19. For vesting computation periods beginning with the vesting computation period that begins on July 1,1992, and thereafter, a one year break in service occurs when, during any such vesting computation period, a Participant or former Participant completes less than 400 hours of service, as defined in Section 1.19.
B.	A Participant who experiences a one year break in service after he has become vested within the meaning of Section 7.1, is entitled to have his pre-break service counted for vesting and benefit accrual purposes.
— 15 —
C.	A Participant who experiences a one year break in service prior to becoming vested and who subsequently becomes a Participant in the Plan shall be entitled to have his years of vesting service and his years of accredited service for purposes of benefit computation prior to that one year break in service counted unless the break in service is a “permanent break in service" within the meaning of the following Section 7.3B. Conversely, years of service prior to a “permanent break in service" will not be counted.
D.	A Permanent Break in Service occurs if a nonvested Participant experiences consecutive one year breaks in service which equal or exceed, the greater of:
1.	five years of service;
2.	the number of the Participant’s years of service before the break in service.
ARTICLE Vm
Forms of Benefit Payments
8.1	Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this Article Vin.
A.	The term “Annuity Starting Date” shall have the meaning set out in Section 1.24.
B.	A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who is married to his spouse on his Annuity Starting Date is a form of annuity which pays a lifetime monthly pension payment to the Participant and upon the Participant’s death, pays one-half of that amount in monthly payments to the Participant’s “surviving spouse” for the life of the surviving spouse. The Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for a married Participant will be the actuarial equivalent of the amount which the Participant would receive under the Normal Form of Benefits under this Plan. The monthly amount of the Participant’s pension is reduced in accordance with the actuarial assumptions used by the Plan and the ages of the Participant and his spouse.
A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who has not been married for one year immediately prior to his Annuity Starting Date is a life annuity. This annuity shall be the actuarial equivalent of the benefit which the Participant would have received under the Normal Form of Benefits under this Plan.
C.	The “surviving spouse” for purposes of this Article is the spouse to whom the Participant was lawfully married as of the Annuity Starting Date. If the “surviving spouse’ predeceases the Participant, no survivorship annuity will be payable, even if the Participant remarries. The death of the surviving spouse prior to the Participant’s death will not affect the amount of the monthly payment to the Participant.
8.2	General Rule Concerning Form of Benefits, Effective for any Participant whose Annuity Starting Date is July 1,1976, or thereafter, benefits shall be paid in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity unless the Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3.
8.3	Waiver of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.
A.	A participant who is otherwise required to receive his benefits in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity may waive said form of benefits by filing with the Fund Office a valid waiver during the election period. The election period is the ninety (90) day period prior to the Annuity Starting Date. Any valid election made during an election period prior to an Annuity Starting Date which is on or after the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age will govern all payments of benefits earned thereafter. Any election may be revoked at any time during the election period.
B.	In order to be valid, an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity must meet the following requirements:
1.	It must be in writing.
2.	It must be filed no less than thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days after the Participant receives the Notice and Explanation described in Section 8.4. The Notice and Explanation is presumed to be received on the third day after the date it is mailed.
— 16 —
3.	In the case of a Participant who had one or more hours of service after August 23, 1984, the waiver must be consented to in writing by the Participant’s spouse (unless such consent is not required under subsection 8.3B4). Said consent must also acknowledge in writing the effect of the election. The consent and acknowledgement required by this subsection must be witnessed by a notary public or a plan representative.
Effective for an election filed with regard to an Annuity Starting Date on or after July 1,1987, the waiver and consent must name the designated beneficiary or beneficiaries, if any, who will receive survivorship benefits under the Plan and must name the form of benefits to be paid under the Plan, (subject to the following paragraph). If a consent names a designated beneficiary and/or a specific form of benefits, then any subsequent change to said designated beneficiary and/or form of benefits is invalid unless a new consent is obtained from the spouse, which meets the requirements of this Section 8.3.
If the consent does not name a specific beneficiary or beneficiaries or a specific form of benefits, or if the Participant and spouse desire that future changes in the beneficiary and/or form of benefits may be made without spousal consent, the consent must acknowledge that the spouse has the right to limit consent to a specific beneficiary and a specific form of benefits and the consent must voluntarily waive whichever (or both) of said rights, in accordance with the desires of the Participant and his spouse.
4.	The consent described in this Section 8.3 is not required if it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent otherwise required cannot be obtained because:
a.	there is no spouse;
b.	the spouse cannot be located; or
c.	such other circumstances exists as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury as sufficient to obviate the requirement of the spousal consent.
8.4. Notice and Explanation of Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the Right to Waive Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.
A.	Within a reasonable time prior to the Annuity Starting Date, the Plan must provide the Participant with a notice in writing explaining the terms of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the right to waive that Annuity Form of Benefit,. This Notice will be provided within a reasonable period of time before the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age and a reasonable period of time before any Early Retirement Date or Postponed Retirement Date. A Participant may not elect an Annuity Starting Date at any time before the 31st day after he has received the Notice.
B.	The Notice and Explanation must contain a written explanation of the following:
1.	The terms and conditions of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity;
2.	The Participant’s right to make an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the procedure for making the election;
3.	The effect of an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor form of benefit;
4.	The rights of the Participant’s spouse, including the right to withhold consent; and
5.	The right to revoke an election to waive Qualified Joint and Suvivor Annuity and the effect of such revocation.
8.5 Optional Forms of Retirement Benefits.
A.	In the event a Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, he may elect to receive his benefits in any of the following optional forms:
1.	Life Annuity with a 60 month guarantee (described in Section 5.2 of this Plan).
— 17 —
2.	A Life Annuity with 120 month guarantee, which is the same form of payments as the life annuity with a 60 month guarantee as described in Section 5.2, but the number of guaranteed payments is 120. This option may only be selected if the 120 monthly payments will not extend payments beyond the life expectancy of the Participant and his designated beneficiary.
3.	A Life Only Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant for his lifetime with no further payments after the monthly payment for the month in which the Participant dies.
4.	A Joint and Full Survivor Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payments in the same amount to the “surviving spouse”.
5.	A Joint and Two-Thirds Survivor Annuity, which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payments equal to 66-2/3% of the amount that the Participant was receiving, to the “surviving spouse”.
B.	All optional forms of benefits (including the Qualified Joint and Suvivor Annuity) shall be adjusted so that the actuarial value of the benefit is the actuarial eqivalent of the Participant’s accrued benefit stated in the Normal Form of Benefit (Section 5.2). Under this Plan, actuarial equivalent means that whenever it is necessary to convert one form of annuity to another form of annuity or to a lump sum, the result will be benefits substantially equal in value as determined by application of the 1971 Male Group Annuity Mortality tables and a 6-1/2% interest rate.
C.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustees shall distribute the Participant’s benefits or the Beneficiary’s benefits in the form of a lump sum payment on or prior to the annuity starting date if the present value of the benefits does not exceed $5,000. For purposes of determining the present value of an annuity as of the date of distribution, the Plan shall use the interest rate established by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation as of the beginning of the Plan Year for valuing a lump sum distribution upon plan termination or individual termination. This section shall not apply after the Annuity Starting Date unless the Participant or Beneficiary consents in writing to a single lump sum distribution.
ARTICLE IX
Application for and Timing of Benefit Distribution
9.1	Applications. A Participant or Beneficiary must apply in writing for any benefit payable under this Plan in a timely manner, in advance of the Annuity Starting Date. To be timely for this purpose, an application must be sufficient to give notice to the Trustees of the applicant’s request to commence receipt of benefits under this Plan. Every Participant, Beneficiary or Pensioner shall furnish, at the request of the Trustees, any information or proof reasonably required to determine his benefit rights. If a person makes a willfully false statement material to an application or furnishes fraudulent information or proof, benefits not vested under this Plan (as defined in Article VII) may be denied, suspended or discontinued as determined by the Trustees. The Trustees shall have the right to recover any benefit payment made in reliance on any false or fraudulent statement, information or proof submitted by a Participant, Beneficiary or Pensioner.
9.2	Trustees. The Trustees shall, subject the requirements of the law, be the sole judges of the standard of proof required in any case and the application and interpretation of the Plan including decisions concerning the eligibility of a Participant or Beneficiary to participate or his entitlement to benefits, and decisions of the Trustees shall be final and binding on all parties. In the event an application for benefits is denied in whole or in part, the Participant or Beneficiary must follow the Benefit Claim Procedure set forth in Article X. Wherever in the Plan the Trustees are given discretionary powers, the Trustees shall exercise such powers in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner.
9.3	Timing of Benefit Commencement. Payment of benefits may begin sooner but shall begin no later than 60 days after the last of the following dates, unless the Participant elects a later date (see Section 6.2):
A.	The end of the Plan Year in which the Participant attained Normal Retirement Age;
B.	The end of the Plan Year in which the Participant left covered service;
— 18 —
C.	The Annuity Starting Date selected by the participant on an application for benefits filed with the Plan; or
D.	The date the Trustees were first able to ascertain entitlement to, or the amount of, the Participant’s Benefit.
9.4	Limitations on the Timing of Benefit Distribution.
A.	As set forth in Section 6.2, a Participant may elect to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date which is past his Normal Retirement date, provided:
1.	Effective January 1, 1984, no Participant may postpone his Annuity Surfing Date to a date later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70-1/2 or the calendar year in which he ceases working in covered employment. If a Participant owns 5% or more of the stock of a Contributing Employer, the benefit must begin no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attains age 70-1/2.
2.	Effective May 1, 1989, benefit commencement may not be postponed later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant reaches age 70-1/2.
The latest date on which benefit payments may commence as set out in paragraph 9.4A1 and 2 is called the “required beginning date.”
B.	Notwithstanding any provisions in the Plan to the contrary, benefit payment must meet the requirements of either of the following subsections:
1.	Benefits shall be distributed in full prior to the “required beginning date”, set out in subsection 9.4A, or
2.	a. Distribution to a Participant must begin no later than the required beginning date and must be made over the life of the Participant (or lives of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse), or over a period not exceeding the life expectancy of the Participant (or the life expectancies of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse). Distributions (as described in this subsection) may be made to a Participant and a nonspouse Beneficiary provided the period used to determine the “life expectancies” remains as that of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse.
b.	If distribution of benefits has begun in accordance with the provisions of subsection 9.4B2a, and if the Participant dies before his or her entire interest is distributed, the remaining portion of the Participant’s interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the distribution method being used as of the date of his death.
c.	If a Participant dies before the Distribution of the Participant’s interest has begun in accordance with subsection 9.4B2a, then the entire interest of the Employee must be distributed by December 31 of the fifth calendar year following the year of the Participant’s death, subject to the following:
(1)	The five-year payout of the requirement shall not apply if:
(a)	any portion of the Participant’s interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated beneficiary;
(b)	such portion will be distributed (in accordance with regulations) over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such beneficiary); and
(c)	such distributions begin not later than one year after the Particiant’s death or such later date as may be prescribed by regulations.
— 19 —
(2)	If the designated beneficiary referred to in paragraph 9.4B2c(l) is the surviving spouse of the Participant, then:
(a)	the date on which distributions are required to begin under 9.4B2c( 1 )(c) shall not be earlier than the date on which the Participant would have attained age 70-1/2; and
(b)	if the surviving spouse dies before the distribution to such spouse begins, this subparagraph shall be applied as if the surving spouse were the Participant.
ARTICLE X

11.1	Maximum Limitation.
A. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan, the annual retirement benefit to which a Participant shall be entitled hereunder when aggregated with the benefit under all other Defined Benefit Plans maintained by the Employers, shall not exceed the lesser of:
— 20 —
1.	$90,000; or
2.	100% of the Employee’s average annual compensation for the three highest consecutive calendar years during which he participated in the Plan or any other Plan maintained by the Employer.
The $90,000 limit set forth in subparagraph (1) above shall be increased automatically to account for increases in the cost of living. Such cost of living adjustment shall be limited to scheduled increases in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Treasury under Internal Revenue Code § 415(d) and shall be effective no sooner than January 1 of each year.
B.	For purposes of this section “compensation” shall mean the Employee’s earned income, wages, salaries and fees for professional services, and other amounts received for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment with the Employer maintaining the plan (including, but not limited to, commissions paid to salesmen, percentage of profits, commissions on insurance premiums, tips and bonuses), and excluding the following:
1.	Employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation which are not included in the Employee’s gross income for the taxable year in which contributed or Employer contributions under a simplified Employee pension plan to the extent such contributions are deductible by the Employee, or any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation.
2'. Amounts realized from the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, or when restricted stock'(or property) held by the Employer either becomes freely transferable or is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
3.	Amounts realized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of stock acquired under a qualified stock option plan.
4.	Other amounts which received special tax benefits, or contributions made by the Employer (whether or not under a salary reduction agreement) towards the purchase of an annuity described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (whether or not the amounts actually excludable from the gross income of the Employee).
C.	In the case of a Participant who has less than 10 years of accredited service for purposes of benefit accrual, the limitations set forth in subsections Bl and 2 of this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Participant’s such years of service and the denominator of which is 10.
D.	The following additional rules apply for plan years beginning July 1, 1983 to July 1, 1986, inclusive: in the case of a Participant whose benefits hereunder commence prior to his attainment of age 62, the limitations set forth in subsection Al of this section shall, in accordance with the regulations issued by the Secretary of Treasury, be adjusted so that it is the equivalent to such benefit beginning at age 62, provided that such an adjustment shall not reduce such limitation below:
1.	If the benefit commences after the Employee attains age 55, $75,000, or
2.	If the benefit commences before the Employee attains age 55, the amount which the actuarial equivalent to the $75,000 limitation at age 55.
In the case of an Employee whose benefits hereunder commence after he has attained the age of 65, the limitation set forth in subsection Al of this section shall, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of Treasury, be adjusted so that it is the actuarial equivalent to the dollar limitation for a benefit commencing at age 65. For purposes of adjusting any benefit under this subsection, the interest rate assumption shall be 5%.
E.	Notwithstanding the limitations of subsection A of this section, if a Participant was covered by the Plan before the first day of the Limitation Year beginning in 1983, he may receive an annual retirement benefit which is not less than the amount of his current accrued benefit as of the close of the last Limitation Year beginning before 1983, as determined under the terms of the Plan as then in effect disregarding any amendments or cost of living adjustment after July 1,1982. For the purposes of this Section, the term “Limitation Year” shall mean the Plan Credit Year.
— 21 —
F.	The following rules apply for Plan Years beginning July 1, 1987 and thereafter. In the case of a Participant whose Annuity Starting Date is prior to Social Security Retirement Age, the $90,000 limitation contained in Section 11.1A1 shall be actuarially reduced so that it is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of $90,000 commencing at the Social Security Retirement Age. In the case of a Participant whose Annuity Starting Date is after Social Security Retirement Age, the $90,000 limitation contained in Section 11.1 Al shall be actuarially increased so that it is the actuarial equivalent of an annual benefit of $90,000 commencing at the Social Security Retirement Age.
G.	If a Participant covered by this Plan participates in both Defined Benefit and Defined Contributions Plans maintained by the Employer, the sum of 1 and 2 below may not exceed 1.0:
1.	The sum of the projected annual benefit of the Employee under all Defined Benefit pension plans of the Employer determined as of the close of the Limitation Year, divided by the lesser of:
a.	The product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code for such year, or
b.	The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken into account under Section 415(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to such Employee for such year.
2.	The sum of the annual additions to the Employee’s account under all defined contributions plans of the Employer as of the close of the Limitation Year and for all prior Calendar Years divided by the sum of the lesser of a or b for such year and for each prior year of service with the Employer (regardless of whether any such defined contribution plan was in existence during those years), where;
a.	Is the product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Section 415(c)( 1 )(A) of the Internal Revenue Code for such year (without regard to Section 415(c)(6) of such Code); and
b.	Is the product of 1.4 multiplied by the same amount which may be taken into account under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (or Section 415(c)(7) of such Code, if applicable) with respect to such individual under such plan for such year, provided, however, that the Board of Trustees may elect that the amount taken into account for each Employee for all years ending before January 1,1983, under a and b above shall be determined pursuant to the special transition rule in such Section 415(e)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.
If this Plan is aggregated with another Plan that was in existence on July 1,1982, and the above limitations are not met, each Participant for whom the limits are violated will not receive any annual additions or accruals in this Plan. In the event that at the earlier to occur of each December 31 or the date of an Employee retirement or termination, the sum of 1 and 2 above exceeds 1.0 and the benefit of such Employee under such other Plan or Plans is not reduced to bring such sums to 1.0, then such Employee’s benefits under this Plan shall be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the sum of 1 and 2 above for each Employee to equal 1.0.

b.	Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, effective July 1, 1994, the accrued benefit of any Participant whose Compensation exceeded $150,000 in any Plan Credit Year beginning before August 1,1994, shall be the greater of:
the sum of
(1)	The Participant’s accrued benefit as of June 30, 1994, determined under Article V as though the Participant had terminated employment on that date and without regard to any Plan amendments adopted after that date (but taking into account remedial amendments that apply retroactively before that date under Section 401(b) of the Internal Revenue Code), plus

B.	Top-Heavy Plan Requirements.
Effective January 1, 1984, for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the Plan shall provide the following:
1.	This Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan for any Credit Year commencing after December 31,1983, in which, as of the Determination Date,
a.	the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees and
b.	the sum of the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an Aggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the present value of accrued benefits and the aggregate accounts of all Key Employees and Non-Key Employees under this Plan and aU plans of an Aggregation Group.
If any Participant is a Non-Key Employee for a Plan Credit Year, but such Participant was a Key Employee for any prior Plan Credit Year, such Participant’s present value of accrued benefits and/or aggregate account balance shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation Group which includes this Plan is a Top-Heavy Group). In addition, for Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31, 1984, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for any Employer maintaining the Plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date, the aggregate account and/or present value of accrued benefit for such Participant or former Participant shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether this Plan is a TopHeavy Plan.
2.	A Participant’s aggregate account as of the Determination Date shall be determined under applicable provisions of the defined contribution plan used in determining Top-Heavy Plan status.
3.	“Aggregation Group” means either a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation Group as hereinafter determined.
a.	In determining a Required Aggregration Group hereunder, each plan of an Employer in which a Key Employee is a Participant, and each other plan of an Employer which enables any plan in which a Key Employee participates to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code, will be required to be aggregated. Such group shall be known as a “Required Aggregation Group.”
In the case of a required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.
b.	An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required Aggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to satisfy the provisions of Section 401(a)(4) and 410 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such group shall be known as a “Permissive Aggregation Group.”
In the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. tfo plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Plan.
c.	Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan Credit Year shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy Plans.
4.	In the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant’s present value of accrued benefits shall be determined:
a.	as of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most recent valuation date within a twelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;
b.	for the first Plan Credit Year, as if:
— 25 —
the Participant terminated service as of the Determination Date; or
the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account the estimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.
c.	for any other Plan Credit Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date,
d.	the actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit plan minimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan Credit Year.
5.	The calculation of a Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date shall be the sum of the following:
a.	the present value of accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent actuarial valuation;
b.	any Plan distributions made within the Plan Credit Year that includes the Determination Date or within four preceding Plan Credit Years. However, in the case of distributions made after the valuation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as distributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already included in the Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions made prior to July 1,1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been terminated would have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;
c.	any Employer contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory. However, amounts attributable to tax deductible Qualified Voluntary Employee Contributions shall not be considered to be a part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits;
d.	with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by the Employee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by another Employer), if this Plan provides for rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall always consider such rollovers or plah-to-plan transfers as a distribution for purposes of this section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not consider such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted after June 30, 1984, as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted prior to July 1,1984, shall be considered as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits; and
e.	with respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones either not initiated by the Employee or made to a plan maintained by the same Employer), if this Plan provides the rollover or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not be counted as a distribution for purposes of this section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall consider such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer-as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits, irrespective of the date on which such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer is accepted.
f.	“Top-Heavy Group” means an Aggregation Group in which, as of the Determination Date, the sum of:
(1)	the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees under all defined benefit plans included in the group; and
(2)	the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined contribution plans included in the group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all Participants.
— 26 —
g.	Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date otherwise provided for herein for the application of Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code to this Plan (Plan Credit Years beginning after December 31, 1983) shall be extended in accordance with any federal law or regulatory authority.
C.	Top-Heavy Vesting.
1.	Notwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VH of the Plan, for any Top-Heavy Plan Credit Year, the vested portion of any Participant’s accrued benefit shall be determined on the basis of the Participant’s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the following schedule:
Service for Vesting
(excluding Years of
Service for Vesting
prior to effective	Vested
date of this Plan)	percentage
1 Year	0%
2 years	0%
3 years	100%
2.	If, in any subsequent Plan Credit Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may elect to:
a.	continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant’s accrued benefit; or
b.	revert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to Section 41 l(a)( 10) of the Internal Revenue Code. The nonforfeitable percentage of the accrued benefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore must not be reduced and any Participant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of remaining under the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a Plan amendment.
3.	The Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the accrued benefit of any Employee who does not have one hour of work after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee s accrued benefit attributable to Employer contributions will be determined without regard to this Article.
D.	Top-Heavy Benefit Requirement.
1.	The minimum accrued benefit derived from Employer contributions to be provided under this section for each Non-Key Employee who is a Participant shall equal the product of:
a.	one-twelfth (1/12th) of Annual Compensation averaged over the five consecutive “limitation years” (or actual number of “limitation years” if less) which produces the highest average, and
b.	the lesser of
(1)	two percent (2%) multiplied by Years of Vesting Service; or
(2)	twenty percent (20%).
2.	For purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Section 416 of the Internal Revenue Code, a Non-Key Employee who is not a Participant solely because:
a.	his Annual Compensation is below a stated amount, or
b.	he declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan
will be considered to be a Participant.
— 27 —
3.	For purpose of this section, Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Credit Year ending prior to July 1, 1984, or for any Plan Credit Year during which the Plan was not a Top-Heavy Plan shall be disregarded.
4.	For purposes of this section, Annual Compensation for any “limitation year” ending prior to July 1, 1984, or subsequent to the last “limitation year” during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan shall be disregarded. The term “limitation year” means the.Plan Credit Year.
5.	If the Plan provides for the normal retirement to be paid in a form other than a single life annuity, the accrued benefit under this section shall be the Actuarial Equivalence of the minimum accrued benefit under Article V.
6.	If payment of the minimum accrued benefit commences at a date other than Normal Retirement Age, the minimum accrued benefit shall be adjusted in accordance with Article VI of the Plan.
7.	If a Non-Key Employee participates in this Plan and a defined contribution plan included in a Required Aggregation Group which is Top-Heavy, the minimum benefits shall be provided under this Plan.
8.	To the extent required to be nonforfeitable under Article VII of the Plan, the minimum accrued benefit under this section may not be forfeited under Section 411(a)(3)(B) or 411(a)(3)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.
ARTICLE Xin
Right to Amend
The Trustees shall have the sole right to amend this Plan and Trust without the consent of any Participant, at any time from time to time as may be deemed advisable; provided, however, that no amendment to this Trust shall deprive any Participant of any accrued benefit or vested equitable interest herein, if any, nor shall such amendment be contrary to any laws in existence or enacted by the Federal or State Government directly concerning this Trust, provided that the Trustees may adopt an amendment.
A.	If it is necessary to establish or maintain the qualification of the Plam or the Trust Fund under the Internal Revenue Code and to maintain compliance of the Plan with the requirements of ERISA; or
B.	If the amendment meets the requirements of Section 302(c)(8) of ERISA and Section 412(c)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the Secretary of Labor has been notified of such amendment and has either approved of it or, within 90 days after the date on which notice was filed, has failed to disapprove.
Either the Trustees representing the Union or the Trustees representing the Employers may propose amendments to this Trust. Such amendment will become effective when it has been approved and executed by a majority of the Trustees.

ARTICLE XIV
Termination
A.	Right to Terminate. The Trustees shall have the right to discontinue or terminate this Plan in whole or in part.

B.	Priorities of Allocation, In the event of termination, the assets then remaining in the Plan, after providing for any administrative expenses, shall be allocated among the Pensioners, Beneficiaries, and Participants in the following order
— 28 —
1.	First in the case of benefits payable as a pension:
a.	In the case of the pension of a Participant or Beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the three year period ending on the termination date of the Plan, to each pension, based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five year period ending on such date) under which such pension would be the least. The lowest pension in pay status during the three year period shall be considered the pension in pay status for such period.
b.	In the case of a pension of a Participant or Beneficiary which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such three year period if the Participant had retired prior to the beginning of the three year period if his pension had commenced (in the standard form) as of the beginning of such period, to each such pension based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five year period ending on such date) under which the pension would be the least.
2.	Second, to all other benefits (if any) of the individuals under the Plan guaranteed under Title IV of ERISA.
3.	Third, to all other vested benefits under the Plan.
4.	Fourth, to all other benefits under the Plan.
C.	Allocation Procedure, For purposes of subsection B hereof:
1.	The amount allocated under any paragraph of subsection B with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of that subsection.
2.	If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of subsection B (other than Paragraphs 3 and 4) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated pro-rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.
3.	This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph B3 are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.
a.	If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph b below, the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in paragraph B3 on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph B3 under the Plan as in effect at the beginning of the five year period ending on the date of the Plan termination.
b.	If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph a above, are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purpose of subparagraph a, benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the Plan.as amended by the most recent amendment effective during such five year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph a and any assets remaining to be allocated under subparagraph a on the basis of the Plan as amended by the next succeeding Plan Amendment effective during such period.

The term ‘Trustee” as used herein shall mean any natural person designated as a Trustee and selected by the Union or the Employer. The Board of Trustees shall be the plan sponsor, administrator and named fiduciaries of the Plan.
Any Trustee may resign by giving thirty (30) days’ notice in the United States mail to the other Trustees and to the Board of his intent to so resign. The Union may discharge any of the Trustees appointed by it, by giving thirty (30) days’ notice in the United States mail of such intent to discharge. The Employers may discharge any of the Trustees appointed by them, by giving thirty (30) days’ notice in the United States mail of such intent to discharge. The removal of a Trustee shall be automatic at the end of a 30-day period of notification by either the Trustee or the Union or the Employers, as described above, of resignation or removal.
In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Union shall die, be incapable of acting hereunder, resign or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Union duly certified by the Board. In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Employers shall die, become incapable of acting hereunder, resign or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Employers duly certified by the Board. Failure of the Union or the Employers to select a successor Trustee promptly shall not prevent the remaining Trustees from carrying on the affairs of the Trust.
For purposes of this Plan, the Trustees are authorized to perform any of the above functions and shall be the Plan Fiduciaries. As such, the Trustees shall discharge their duties with respect to the Plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to Participants and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims; by diversifying the investments of the Plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so, and in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan (to the extent said documents and instruments are consistent with the law). The Fiduciaries may act in one or more fiduciary capacities with respect to the Plan and may allocate to others certain aspects of the management and operation responsibilities of the Plan including the employment of investment (and other) advisors and investment managers for all or part of the Plan assets and the delegation of any ministerial duties or functions to qualified individuals.

If an unequal number of Employer and Union Trustees attend a meeting, the voting power of the group with less Trustees present shall be and stand increased to that of the group with more Trustees present
— 30 —
so that there shall be equal voting strength between Employer and Union Trustees at all times at such meeting. A deadlock shall be deemed to exist whenever either of the following situations arise: (1) whenever a proposal, nomination motion or resolution or other matter is voted upon and the votes cast are evenly divided and remain evenly divided; and (2) whenever a quorum is lacking at a meeting duly called and there shall be absent from said meeting two (2) or more Trustees of one group, and a majority of the Trustees present declare a deadlock due to the inability to obtain a quorum. In the event of such deadlock in either case arising, the Employer Trustees and the Union Trustees shall meet promptly for the purpose of agreeing upon an impartial umpire to break such deadlock by casting the deciding vote or deciding any dispute in question or matter under consideration. In the event of the inability of the Employer Trustees and the Union Trustees to agree upon the selection of such impartial umpire, then such impartial umpire shall, on the petition of either the Employer Trustees or Union Trustees, be appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the district wherein the principal office of the Trust is located.

Either the Chairman or the Managing Trustee or any two (2) Trustees may call a meeting of the Trustees at any time by giving at least five (5) days’ written notice of the time and place thereof to each Trustee. Any meeting so called may be postponed once for a reasonable period upon the request of any Trustee upon showing of justifiable cause therefor. Any meeting of the Trustees may also be held at any time without notice if all of the Trustees consent thereto in writing or if all attend and act. If all of the Trustees shall concur in writing upon any proposition, no formal meeting thereon need be held by Trustees. The Managing Trustee, in the written notice, shall notify the Trustees of the subjects to be discussed but this shall not be construed to limit any other subjects of discussion properly placed before the meeting.
The Trustees and Fund Office personnel may receive reimbursement for expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of their duties, including but not limited to expenses incurred in attending educational conferences, seminars and meetings, provided that the Trustees determine in each case the subject matter of the conference, seminar or meeting is relevant to the administration of this Trust and that the expenses incurred are reasonable.

The Annuity Starting Date for accredited future service benefits earned after a Participant’s Early Retirement Date shall be his Normal Retirement Date, or his Postponed Retirement Date if he retires after his Normal Retirement Date.

AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE
PAINTERS DISTRICT COUNCIL NO. 2 PENSION PLAN AND TRUST AGREEMENT
The Trustees of the Painters District Council No. 2 Pension Trust hereby adopt the following Amendment No. 1 to the Painters District Council No. 2 Pension Trust and Plan Agreement, which said document is a Restatement of the Plan and Trust effective July 1, 1997.
1.	This Amendment shall supercede the provisions of the Plan to the extent those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment.
2.	Effective July 1,2002, change Section 1.4.C.4 to read as follows:
4.	“Applicable Mortality Table” means the table prescribed in Rev. Rui. 2002-62.
3.	Effective July 1,2002, change Section 11.1 to read as follows:
11.	1 Limitation on Benefits
(a)	Limitation. The annual benefit otherwise payable to a Participant at any time will not exceed the maximum permissible benefit. If the benefit the Participant would otherwise accrue for a Plan Year would produce an annual benefit in excess of the maximum permissible benefit, the rate of accrual will be credited so the annual |	benefit will equal the maximum permissible benefit.
(b)	Defined benefit dollar limitation. The “defined benefit dollar limitation” is $160,000, as adjusted, effective January 1 of each year, under Code § 415(d) in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe and payable in the form of a straight life annuity. A limitation as adjusted under Code § 415(d) will apply to limitation years ending with or within the calendar year for which the adjustment applies.
I
(c)	Maximum permissible benefit. The “maximum permissible benefit” is the defined benefit dollar limitation (as adjusted where required, as provided in (i), (ii) and (iii) below).
(i)	If the Participant has fewer than ten years of participation in the Plan, the defined benefit dollar limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the Plan and (2) the denominator of which is ten. In the case of a Participant who has fewer than ten years of participation in the Plan, the defined benefit compensation limitation shall be multiplied by a fraction, (1) the numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation in the Plan, and (2) the denominator of which is ten.
(ii)	If the benefit of a Participant begins prior to age sixty-two, the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning
at the earlier age that is the Actuarial Equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at age sixty-two (adjusted under (i) above, if required). The defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age prior to age sixty-two is determined as of the lesser of (1) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using the interest rate specified in Section 1.4.A and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in Section 1.4.C.4 and (2) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using a five percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table as defined in Section I.4.C.4. Any decrease in the defined benefit dollar limitation determined in accordance with this paragraph (ii) shall not reflect a mortality decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the Participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account.
(iii)	If the benefit of a Participant begins after the Participant attains age sixty-five, the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at the later age is the annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity beginning at the later age that is Actuarially Equivalent to the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable to the Participant at age sixty-five (adjusted under (i) above, if required). The Actuarial Equivalent of the defined benefit dollar limitation applicable at an age after age sixty-five is determined as (1) the lesser of the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using the interest rate specified in Section 1.4.A and mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in Section 1.4.C.4 and (2) the Actuarial Equivalent (at such age) of the defined benefit dollar limitation computed using a five percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in Section 1.4.C.4. For these purposes, mortality between age 65 and the age at which benefits commence shall be ignored.
(iv)	Except as provided herein, where a benefit is payable in a form other than a straight life annuity, the benefit must be adjusted to an Actuarially Equivalent straight life annuity before applying the limitations of this Section. Where a Participant’s benefit must be adjusted to an Actuarially Equivalent straight life annuity, the Actuarially Equivalent straight life annuity is equal to the greater of (1) the annuity benefit computed using the interest rate specified in Section 1.4.A and the mortality table (or other tabular factor) specified in Section 1.4.C.4 and (2) the annuity benefit computed using a five percent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table defined in Section I.4.C.4. In determining the actuarial equivalent of a single sum payment, the interest rate specified in Section 1.4.C.1 and the applicable mortality table specified in Section 1.4.C.4 shall be used. No actuarial adjustment to the benefit is required for (1) the value of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity under Section 8.1.B, (2) benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a qualified disability benefit, pre-retirement death benefits and postretirement medical benefits), and (3) the value of post-retirement cost-of-
2
living increases made in accordance with Code § 415(d) and Section 1.415-3(c)(2)(iii) of the Treasury Tax Regulations. The benefits do not include any benefits attributable to Employee contributions or rollover contributions, or the assets transferred from a qualified plan that was not maintained by an Employer.
(d)	In the case of an individual who was a participant in one or more defined benefit plans of the Employer on July I, 1982, the application of the limitations of this Section 4.04 shall not cause the maximum permissible amount for such individual under all such defined benefit plans to be less than the individual’s accrued benefit under all such defined benefit plans as of the last day of the limitation year beginning before January 1, 1983. The preceding sentence applies only if all such defined benefit plans met the requirements of Section 415 of the Code, as in effect on July 1, 1982, for all limitation years beginning before January 1, 1983.
4.	Effective July 1, 2002, change Subsection 12.8.A.1 to read as follows:
1.	Key Employee. Any Employee or former Employee (including any deceased
Employee) who at the determination date was:
(i)	An officer of an Employer whose Compensation is greater than $130,000 (as adjusted under Code § 416(i)(l) for Plan Years beginning after March 31,2003).
(ii)	A five percent (5%) owner of an Employer, or
(iii)	A one percent (1%) owner of an Employer having annual Compensation from the Employer of more than $150,000.
For purposes of this Subsection “Compensation” means compensation within the meaning of Code Section 415(c)(3). The determination of who is a Key Employee shall be determined in accordance with Code Section 416(i)( 1) and the applicable Treasury regulations and other guidelines of general applicability issued hereunder.
5.	Effective July 1,2002, change Section 12.8.A.3.a to read as follows:
a. The amount of a Participant’s compensation (as defined in Subsection 12.1 .B above) from any single Employer that may be taken into account for any Plan purpose in any Plan Year is $200,000, as that amount may be adjusted from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury under Code §401(a)(17).
6.	Effective July 1,2002, change the last sentence of Section 12.8.B.1 to read as follows:
In addition, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for any Employer maintaining the Plan during the one year period ending on the Determination Date, the aggregate account and/or present value of Accrued
3
Benefits for such Participant or former Participant shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan.
7.	Effective July 1,2002, delete Section 12.8.B.5.b and remember Sections 12.8.B.5.C, d, e, f and g as Sections 12.8.B.5.b, c, d, e and f, respectively.
8.	Effective July 1,2002, change Section 12.8.B.5.C to read as follows:
c. with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by the Employee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by another Employer), if this Plan provides for rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall always consider such rollover or plan-to-plan transfers as a distribution for purposes of this Section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not consider such rollovers or plan to plan transfers as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits.
9.	Effective July I, 2002, add the following new Section 12.8.B.6:
6.	The present value of accrued benefits and the amounts of account balances of an Employee as of the determination date shall be increased by the distributions made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any plan aggregated with the Plan under Code § 416(g)(2) during the one year period ending on the Determination Date. The preceding sentence shall also apply to distributions under a terminated plan which, had it not been terminated, would have been aggregated with the Plan under Code § 416(g)(2)(A)(i). In the case of a distribution made for a reason other than separation from service, death or disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting “five year period” for “one year period.” The accrued benefits and accounts of any individual who has not performed services for an Employer during the one year period ending on the determination date shall not be taken into account.
10.	Effective July 1,2002, add the following new Section 12.8.D.9:
9.	For purposes of satisfying the minimum benefit requirements of Code § 416(c)(1) and the Plan, in determining Years of Service with the Employer, any service with the Employer shall be disregarded to the extent that such service occurs during a Plan Year when the Plan benefits (within the meaning of Code § 410(b)) no Key Employee or former Key Employee.
11.	Effective July 1,2002, change Subsection 12.7.B.2 to read as follows:
2.	Eligible retirement plan. An individual retirement account described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code § 403(a), a qualified trust described in Code § 410(a) or an eligible plan under Code § 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or
4
12.
9.4
instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that accepts the Distributee’s eligible rollover distribution. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order as defined in Code § 414(p).
Effective July 1,2003, change Section 9.4 to read as follows:
Limitations on the Timing of Benefit Distributions.
A.	General Rules
1.	Requirements of Regulations Incorporated. All distributions required under this Section 9.4 will be determined and made in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Code § 401(a)(9).
B.	Time and Manner of Distribution.
1.	Required Beginning Date. The Participant’s entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant’s Required Beginning Date.
2.	Death of Participant Before Distributions Begin. If the Participant
dies before distributions begin, the Participant’s entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows:
a.	If the Participant’s surviving spouse is the Participant’s sole
designated Beneficiary, distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant dies, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70 '/z, if later.
b.	If the Participant’s surviving spouse is not the Participant’s sole designated Beneficiary, distributions to the designated Beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant dies.
c.	If there is no designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant’s death, the Participant’s entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant’s death.
d.	If the Participant’s surviving spouse is the Participant’s sole
designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving
5
spouse begin, this Section 9.4.B.2, other than Section 9.4.B.2.a, will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
For purposes of this Section 9.4.B.2 and Section 9.4.E, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant’s Required Beginning Date (or, if Section 9.4.B.2.d applies, the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section 9.4.B.2.a). If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant’s Required Beginning Date (or to the Participant’s surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section 9.4.B.2.a), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.
3.	Form of Distribution. Unless the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with Sections 9.4.C, D and E. If the Participant’s interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code § 401(a)(9) and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the Participant’s interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Code § 414(k) will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Code § 401(a)(9) and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts.
C.	Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year.
1.	General Annuity Requirements. If the Participant’s interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements:
a.	the annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year;
b.	the distribution period will be over a life (or lives) or over a period certain not longer than the period described in Section 9.4.D or E.
c.	once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum permitted;
d.	payments will either be non-increasing or increase only as follows:

(i)	by an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics;
(ii)	to the extent of the reduction in the amount of the Participant’s payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period described in Section 9.4.D dies or is no longer the Participant’s Beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Code § 414(p);
(iii)	to provide cash refunds of Employee contributions upon the Participant’s death; or
(iv)	to pay increased benefits that result from a Plan amendment.
2.	Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the Participant’s Required Beginning Date (or, if the Participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section 9.4.B.2.a or b) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semiannually, or annually. All of the Participant’s benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the Participant’s Required Beginning Date.
3.	Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Participant in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.
D.	Requirements For Annuity Distributions That Commence During Participant’s Lifetime.
1.	Joint Life Annuities Where the Beneficiary is Not the Participant’s Spouse. If the Participant’s interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a non-spouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or
7
after the Participant’s Required Beginning Date to the designated Beneficiary after the Participant’s death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the Participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1,401(a)(9)-6T of Treasury Regulations. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the Participant and a nonspouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the designated Beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.
2.	Period Certain Annuities. Unless the Participant’s spouse is the sole designated Beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the Participant’s lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the Participant under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in section 1.401 (a)(9)-9 of Treasury Regulations for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the Participant reaches age 70, the applicable distribution period for the Participant is the distribution period for age seventy under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of Treasury Regulations plus the excess of seventy over the age of the Participant as of the Participant’s birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the Participant’s spouse is the Participant’s sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the Participant’s applicable distribution period, as determined under this Section 9.4.D.2, or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse as determined under the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401 (a)(9)-9 of Treasury Regulations, using the Participant’s and spouse’s attained ages as of the Participant’s and spouse’s birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.
E.	Requirements for Minimum Distributions Where Participant Dies Before Date Distributions Begin.
1.	Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins and there is a designated Beneficiary, the Participant’s entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time described in Section 9.4.B.2.a or b, over the life of the designated Beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding:
a.	unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the
8
Beneficiary determined using the Beneficiary’s age as of the Beneficiary’s birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the Participant’s death; or
b.	if the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated Beneficiary determined using the Beneficiary’s age as of the Beneficiary’s birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.
2.	No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant’s death, distribution of the Participant’s entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant’s death.
3.	Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to Surviving Spouse Begin. If the Participant dies before the date distribution of his or her interest begins, the Participant’s surviving spouse is the Participant’s sole designated beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this Section 9.4.E will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant, except that the time by which distributions must begin will be determined without regard to Section 9.4.B.2.a.
F.	Definitions.
1.	Designated Beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the Beneficiary under Section 1.6 and is the designated beneficiary under Code § 401(a)(9) and Section 1.401(a)(9)-!, Q&A-4, of Treasury Regulations.
2.	Distribution Calendar Year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Participant’s death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Participant’s Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the Participant’s death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to Section 9.4.B.
3.	Life Expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury Regulations.
4.	Required Beginning Date. The date specified in Section 1.33.

AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE
PAINTERS DISTRICT COUNCIL NO. 2
PENSION PLAN AND TRUST AGREEMENT
The Trustees of the Painters District Council No. 2 Pension Trust hereby adopt the following Amendment No. 2 to the Painters District Council No. 2 Pension Trust and Plan Agreement, which said document is a Restatement of the Plan and Trust effective July 1, 1997.
1.	This Amendment shall supercede the provisions of the Plan to the extent those provisions are inconsistent with the provisions of this amendment.
2.	Effective July 1, 1999, change Section 6.6.C.1 to read as follows:
1.	If a Participant dies after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant, the amount of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (except that the survivor portion shall be 75 percent rather than 50 percent) on the day before the Participant’s Death. If, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date under Subsection 6.6.C.4, the amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that subsection.
3.	Effective July 1, 1999, change Section 6.6.C.4 to read as follows:
4.	Notwithstanding the above, the surviving spouse may defer his or her Annuity Starting Date to the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date.
In the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the amount will be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (except that the survivor portion shall be 75 percent rather than 50 percent) two days before the deferred Annuity Starting Date and died the next day. If the Participant’s spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting Date, no survivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section 6.7.
4. Effective July 1, 1999 change Section 6.6.C.4 to read as follows:
6.	Notwithstanding the above, for any Participant whose death occurs before July 1, 1999, the basic computation for the Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 6.6.C.1, 2 or 4, as appropriate, except that the following language shall be deleted in each such subsection for purposes of such calculation: “(except the survivor portion shall be 75 percent rather than 50 percent)”.

1.	No more than four hundred (400) Hours of Service shall be credited under this Subsection 1.18.B to an Employee on account of any single continuous period during which the Employee performs no duties (whether or not such period occurs in a single computation period);
6

An hour for which an Employee is directly or indirectly paid, or entitled to payment, on account of a period during which no duties are performed is not required to be credited to the Employee if such payment is made or due under a plan maintained solely for purpose of complying with applicable workmen’s compensation, or unemployment compensation or disability insurance laws; and

C.	An Hour of Service is each hour for which back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, is either awarded or agreed to by the Employer. The same hours of service shall not be credited both under Subsection 1.18.A or 1.18.B, as the case may be, and under this Subsection 1.18.C.
D.	Effective July 1, 1986, only for purposes of computing Hours of Service for determining whether a One-Year Break in Service has occurred, an Hour of Service includes each hour up to a maximum of four hundred (400) Hours of Service, during a period of absence from covered employment, if the absence from such employment was due to any one of the following:

2.	Birth of a child of the Participant;
3.	Placement of a child with the Participant in connection with the adoption of such child by the Participant; or
4.	Caring for such child by the Participant.

If this amount is not able to be ascertained, the Participant shall be credited with eight Hours of Service for each working day during the leave.
The Hours of Service shall be credited in the vesting computation year in which they occur, if the leave occurs totally within one vesting computation year. If the leave takes place in more than one vesting computation year, the Hours of Service shall be credited in the vesting year during which the absence begins, if the
7
crediting is necessary to prevent a One-Year Break in Service; otherwise the Hours of Service shall be credited in the following vesting computation year.
Hours of Service under this subparagraph shall be computed only for purposes of determining whether a One-Year Break in Service has occurred. Such Hours will not be counted toward accrual of Plan benefits nor will they be counted toward determining whether the Participant has completed a Year of Service for vesting purposes.
The Participant is required to furnish, upon request by the Plan Administrator or an authorized representative thereof such timely information as the Plan may reasonably require to establish that the absence was for one of the reasons stated in this subparagraph and/or to establish the number of days for which there was such an absence.
E.	Effective January 1, 1994, an Hour of Service for purposes of determining whether a Participant has completed a Year of Service for vesting purposes will include Hours of Service the Participant would have earned but for his having taken approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Such hours will not be counted for purposes of accrual of Plan benefits.
F.	An Hour of Service is each hour for which an Employee would have been scheduled for work for an Employer during the period of time he is absent from work because of periods of Qualified Military Service, but only if the Employee returns to the employment of the Employer within the period he retains reemployment rights pursuant to Federal law.
Hours of Service shall be computed and credited in accordance with Department of Labor Regulations Sections 2530.200b-2(b) and (c).
1.19	Non-Bargained Employee. A “Non-Bargained Employee” is an employee who is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and a Contributing Employer, but for whom contributions are made to the Trust. This term includes any employee of the Union, Painters District Council No. 2 Unity Hall Corporation or any employee of the Trustees of Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Plan, Pension Trust, Vacation Fund and/or Apprenticeship and Journeyman Fund, to the extent such employer has agreed to make contributions to the Trust on behalf of said employee. Wherever the context so admits or requires, “Employee” shall also mean “Non-Bargained Employee”.

ARTICLE V
Accrual of Benefits
5.1	General Rules. This Article sets forth the rules for determining and computing the amount of a Participant’s Accrued Benefit under the Plan. The accumulation and retention of Accrued Benefit credits are subject to the requirements concerning Years of Vesting Service and Breaks In Service. The benefit amounts are subject to reduction on account of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and modification if the Participant retires with an Annuity Starting Date other than his Normal Retirement Date, or with a form of benefits other than the normal form of benefits, as described in Section 5.2.
Eligibility to receive a benefit based on the Participant’s Accrued Benefit depends on meeting the conditions for benefit entitlement (Article VI) and/or the rules concerning Years of Vesting Service and Permanent Break in Service.
5.2	Normal Form of Benefit. For purposes of this Plan the normal form of benefits is a life annuity, with a sixty (60) month guarantee. This form includes the payment of a monthly amount commencing with the Annuity Starting Date and continuing until the month in which the Participant dies. If the death of the Participant occurs after his Annuity Starting Date, but before all sixty (60) guaranteed monthly payments have been made, the remaining payments shall be made to the named Beneficiary, if then surviving, or if such Beneficiary is not then surviving, to the contingent Beneficiary, if then surviving. If no Beneficiary is surviving when a payment is to be made to a Beneficiary, payment shall be made to the person or persons in the first surviving class of the following classes of successive Beneficiaries:
A.	The Participant’s widow or widower;
B.	The Participant’s surviving children;
C.	The Participant’s surviving parents;
15
D.	The Participant’s surviving brothers and sisters;
E.	The Participant’s estate.
If a Beneficiary who is receiving guaranteed payments dies before all guaranteed payments are made, payments will continue to the contingent Beneficiary, if one is then surviving. If no contingent Beneficiary is then surviving, the remaining payments will be made to the estate of the Beneficiary who last received a payment, until all guaranteed payments have been made.
The amount of benefit stated in the Plan, under Section 5.3, is the amount which the Participant would receive each month, if the Participant receives a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee, commencing at his Normal Retirement Date. In the event the Participant receives a form of payment different from the life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee, or in the event the Participant begins to receive benefits at a time other than his Normal Retirement Date, the monthly amount received will be the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount of benefit stated in Section 5.3; that is, it will be the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount which the Participant would be entitled to under the life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee form of payment, commencing at Normal Retirement Date.
5.3	Amount of Benefit Stated in the Normal Benefit Form. The amount of monthly benefit that a Participant accrues stated in the normal form of benefits (a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee) commencing at Normal Retirement Date, is the sum of the amount determined under Subsection 5.3.A plus the amount determined under Section 5.3.B.
A.	The amount determined under this Subsection is $2.50 multiplied by number of years of Accredited Past Service for any Participant who participated on and after July 1, 1964. An eligible Participant receives a year of Accredited Past Service for each continuous year of service in Covered Employment prior to July 1, 1964. No Participant who first participated in the Plan after July I, 1964 shall be entitled to Accredited Past Service benefits. The amount determined under this Subsection is subject to the rules concerning Permanent Breaks in Service.
B.	The amount determined under this Subsection is the sum of the Future Service Credits earned by the Participant under all applicable tables specified in this
16
Subsection. Accredited Future Service Benefits will be accrued under this Subsection for each twelve (12) consecutive month period commencing with July 1, 1964, and subsequent anniversaries thereof (“benefit accrual year”), based on the number of Hours of Service completed by the Participant in Covered Employment during the particular benefit accrual year, subject to the following rules:
1.	No Future Service Credits will be accrued by a Participant for any benefit accrual year during which the Participant fails to complete at least 400 Hours of Service.
2.	The accrual of Future Service Credits under this Subsection is subject to the rules concerning Permanent Breaks in Service.
3.	The amounts set out in these tables are subject to the rules contained in Subsection 5.3.C.

c.	Accrual of twenty-five (25) years of credited service, as defined
herein. For purposes of this Subsection 6.3.B.2.C, a year of credited service is any year in which the Participant accrues any benefit under the Plan (including an Accredited Past Service Benefits and Accredited Future Service Benefits under the Plan).
C.	Effective September 1, 1998, and thereafter, the following provisions shall apply for all Participants who are active Participants on or after April 1, 1998, except Participants who are employed by Contributing Employers who are signatory to agreements with Sign and Pictorial Painters Local Union 774 (the early retirement eligibility and benefit amount of these excluded Participants are to continue to be determined under Subsection 6.3.A). A Participant may elect an Early Retirement Benefit (to be computed without the reduction set forth in Subsection 6.3.E) by electing an Annuity Starting Date, at any time before his Normal Retirement Date, after meeting the following eligibility requirements:
1.	Attainment of age 58, and
2.	Completion of 10 Years of Vesting Service under the Plan, and
3.	Accrual of thirty (30) years of credited service, as defined in Subsection
6.3.B.2.C.
The eligibility provisions of this Subsection represent alternative eligibility provisions to those set out in Subsections 6.3.A and 6.3.B and do not replace the eligibility provisions set out in those Subsections.
D.	Except as specified in Section 8.2 below, the Early Retirement Benefit shall be paid in the normal form of a Normal Retirement Benefit under the Plan (a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee). The Participant may elect any Annuity Starting Date after the date of his election and after meeting the applicable eligibility requirements.
E.	The amount of Early Retirement Benefit which the Participant is entitled to receive each month, stated in the form of a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee, is the Participant’s Normal Retirement Benefit amount, computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.3, reduced by one-half of one percent (1/2 of 1%) for each full month that the Participant is younger than age sixty-five (65) as of his Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date.
F.	A Participant shall be credited with additional Accredited Future Service Benefits for service after his Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date. However, effective
26
July I, 2000, any such additional Accredited Future Service Benefits for a Plan Year shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefits paid to the Participant for such Plan Year but before such Participant’s Normal Retirement Date. “Subsidized portion” means the difference between the amount of a Participant’s Early Retirement Benefit which is actually paid to him and the amount which would have been paid to him if the reduction under Subsection 6.3.E applied to the Early Retirement Benefit. Effective July 1, 2000, any such additional Accredited Future Service Benefits accrued for a Plan Year after a Participant’s Normal Retirement Date shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount of a Participant’s retirement benefit which is paid to him for such Plan Year. Notwithstanding the reductions set forth in this Subsection, a Participant who completes 1,200 or more Hours of Service in any Plan Year after his Early Retirement Annuity Starting Date, commencing with the Plan Year beginning July 1, 2000, shall accrue at least the benefits provided in the table set forth in Section 6.1. The Annuity Starting Date for Accredited Future Service Benefits earned on or after a Participant’s Early Retirement Date and before his Normal Retirement Date shall be his Normal Retirement Date. The Annuity Starting Date for Accredited Future Service Benefits earned on and after a Participant’s Normal Retirement Date shall be the first day of the Plan Year immediately following the Plan Year in which such benefits are earned. The Participant will receive the notices and election options set forth in Article VIII with regard to benefits accrued on and after a Participant’s Early Retirement Date and before his Normal Retirement Date. The election a Participant makes with respect to such benefits, the payment of which commences as of his Normal Retirement Date, will govern additional Accredited Future Service Benefits accrued after his Normal Retirement Date.
6.4	Total and Permanent Disability Benefit.
A.	A Participant who becomes totally and permanently disabled, while still a Participant in the Plan, and after the Participant has earned ten (10) Years of Vesting Service, may elect to receive the total and permanent Disability Benefits described in this Section.
For purposes of this Article, participation ceases on the first day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year during which a Participant experiences a One Year Break in Service.
For purposes of this Article, effective March 1, 1986, a Participant shall be deemed to be totally and permanently disabled only if he is determined to be totally and permanently disabled by the Social Security Administration.
The benefit provided by this Article is not available to a former Participant whose participation ceased within the meaning of this Section, prior to his becoming disabled. The benefit provided by this Article is not available to a Participant who the Trustees determine has become disabled while engaged in the commission of a felony or as a result of willful intention to injure himself or to induce an illness that could result in disability.
27
B.	Such Participant who shall be so certified as totally and permanently disabled shall be entitled to receive a monthly disability pension in the amount of his Accrued Benefit stated in the normal form of Benefits as provided under Section 5.2 (but in no event less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month), commencing with the month in which he is eligible to receive his first disability payment from the Social Security Administration and he shall continue to receive such disability pension until the earliest of his death, recovery from total and permanent disability, the election of an Early Retirement Benefit, or attainment of Normal Retirement Age.
Upon attaining Normal Retirement Age (or at an early retirement Annuity Starting Date, if elected by the Participant), the Participant’s Benefits shall convert to one of the forms of benefit payable for the normal retirement Benefit (or early retirement Benefit) and the total and permanent disability benefit shall cease. At that time the Participant shall receive the notices and elections that a Participant would receive at Normal Retirement Age or at the early retirement Annuity Starting Date. The Participant’s monthly benefit after converting to an early or Normal Retirement Benefit will in no event be less than Twenty-five Dollars ($25.00) per month.
C.	Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of a Participant who is otherwise eligible for any benefit under this Plan. Nor shall the receipt of benefits under this Section cause a reduction in the amount of retirement or other benefits which may be due to the Participant or his Beneficiary under other provisions of this Plan. A Participant who receives benefits under this Section shall be entitled to the same retirement benefits (pre-retirement survivor annuity, early retirement Benefit and normal retirement Benefit) in the same form, under the same conditions and with the same notification and election procedures as he would otherwise have been entitled to if he had not received the disability benefits.
6.5	Death Benefit. Effective March 1, 1986, in addition to the benefits otherwise provided by this Plan and Trust, the Plan and Trust shall pay a death benefit in the amount of $3,000 to the designated Beneficiary of any Participant who has retired under this Plan on July 1, 1982 or thereafter, provided that the Participant was an active Participant at the time of his Annuity Starting Date. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “retirement” means that the Participant commences receiving a benefit payment under this Plan other than a Total and Permanent Disability Payment. For purposes of this paragraph, the term active Participant means a Participant whose participation has not ceased under Article Ill.
28
Effective with respect to Participants who die September 1, 1989 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the requirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the amount of the death benefit shall be $5,000. This increase shall not apply to any Participant who was employed by an Employer which is signatory to an agreement with Sign and Pictorial Painters Local Union 774, during the Plan Year during which the Participant last completed an Hour of Service.
Effective with respect to Participants who die October 1, 1991 or thereafter and who otherwise meet the requirements of this Section 6.5 for a death benefit, the Participant is eligible for a death benefit only if the Participant was (at the time of his Annuity Starting Date under the Pension Plan) a covered Participant for the death benefit under the Painters District Council No. 2 Welfare Fund or the Painters District Council No. 2 Group Insurance Trust. For purposes of the death benefit for deaths that occur on or after October I, 1991, it is not required that the Participant shall have been an active Participant in the Plan at the time of his Annuity Starting Date.
6.6	Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity.
A.	General Rule. A Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity (as defined in this Section) is payable to the surviving spouse of any Participant who dies after August 22, 1984 but before his Annuity Starting Date, who has been married to the surviving spouse for a period of one year immediately preceding the date of death, and who had met one of the requirements of Article VI1 and was therefore vested as of the date of his death.
B.	Definition. A Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity is an annuity payable to the surviving spouse of a Participant who meets the requirement of Section 6.6. A, computed under Section 6.6.C.
C.	Computation of Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity.
1.	If a Participant dies after the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant, the amount of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity on the day before the Participant’s Death. If, however, the surviving spouse
29
elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date under Subsection 6.6.C.4, the amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that Subsection.
2.	If a Participant dies before the earliest retirement age under the Plan which applies to that Participant, the amount of the Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity payable to the surviving spouse is the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity, if the Participant had:
a.	Separated from service on the day he last worked in covered employment;
b.	Survived to the earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant.
c.	Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, as defined in Section 8.1 (except that the survivor portion shall be 75 percent rather than 50 percent), and
d.	Died on the next day.
If, however, the surviving spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date under Subsection 6.6.C.4, the amount of the monthly benefit shall be computed under that subsection.
3.	Subject to the next succeeding paragraph (subsection 6.6.C.4), the monthly payments to the surviving spouse shall commence on the first day of the month coinciding with or following the later of:
a.	The date of the Participant’s death, or
b.	The earliest retirement date under the Plan which applies to that Participant;
and shall continue until and including the payment for the month in which the surviving spouse dies. No survivorship benefits shall be payable if the Participant’s spouse fails to survive to the date on which the annuity payments are to begin. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section 6.7.
4.	Notwithstanding the above, the surviving spouse may defer his or her Annuity Starting Date to the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date.
In the event the surviving spouse defers the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefit, the amount will be the amount which would have been payable to the surviving spouse as a survivor annuity if the Participant had retired with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity two days before the deferred Annuity Starting Date and died the next day. If the Participant’s spouse elects to defer the Annuity Starting Date for the survivorship benefits, and fails to survive the Annuity Starting Date, no
30
survivorship benefits will be payable. However, in such event, benefits may be payable under Section 6.7.
5.	The Trustees shall distribute the survivorship benefits to the surviving spouse at any time prior to the Annuity Starting Date, in lump sum form, if the single sum Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit does not exceed $5,000 ($3,500 for distribution prior to August 6, 1997).
6.	Notwithstanding the above, for any Participant whose death occurs before July 1, 1999, the basic computation for the Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity shall be performed in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 6.6.C.2, except that for this computation, Subsection 6.6.C.2.C, shall read
“c. Retired on that date with a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, as defined in Section 8.1, and”
6.7 Beneficiary Annuity.
A.	A Beneficiary Annuity, as defined in Subsection 6.7.B shall be paid to the Beneficiary determined under Subsection 6.7.C of any Participant who meets either of the following eligibility requirements:
1.	A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date but has not met the requirements for a Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity, as defined in Section 6.6; or
2.	A vested Participant who dies before his Annuity Starting Date while eligible for a Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity, but whose surviving spouse dies prior to the surviving spouse’s Annuity Starting Date under the Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity.
B.	The Beneficiary Annuity is the monthly amount which would have been payable as a Normal Retirement Benefit (a life annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee) commencing at the Participant’s Normal Retirement Date, provided, however, that this amount is payable to the Beneficiary or Beneficiaries determined under Section 6.7.C only for sixty (60) months. Benefit payments to the Beneficiary will commence with the first day of the first month following the month in which the Participant would have reached age sixty (60) or if later, the first day of the month following the month in which the Participant dies or if later, the first day of the month following the death of the surviving spouse.
C.	The Beneficiary or Beneficiaries entitled to the Beneficiary Annuity shall be determined in the same manner as the Beneficiary is determined under Section 5.2.
D.	This Section shall be effective with regard to an eligible Participant whose death occurs on or after January 19, 1995.
31
ARTICLE VII
Vesting Requirements
7.1	General Rule. A Participant meets the requirements of Article VII, and is therefore “vested” for purposes of eligibility for Plan benefits, if he meets one of the following requirements:
A.	A Participant who has completed ten (10) Years of Vesting Service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding Years of Vesting Service prior to a Permanent Break in Service) is vested;
B.	A Participant who has completed five Years of Vesting Service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding Years of Vesting Service prior to a Permanent Break in Service) and whose participation ceases within the meaning of Article III after the Participant has reached the age of forty-five (45) is vested.
C.	A Participant whose termination of participation within the meaning of Article III occurs after the Participant has reached the age of sixty (60) is vested.
D.	A Participant, who has one Hour of Service on or after July 1, 1989 and who is not a Participant as a result of being covered under a Collective Bargaining Agreement, is vested if he has completed five (5) Years of Vesting Service (excluding Years of Vesting Service prior to a Permanent Break in Service).
E.	A Participant, who has one Hour of Service on or after July I, 1998, is vested if he had completed five (5) Years of Vesting Service as defined in Section 7.2 (excluding Years of Vesting Service prior to a Permanent Break in Service).
7.2	Year of Vesting Service.
A.	The vesting computation period is the twelve month period commencing July 1 of each year and ending June 30 of the following year.
B.	A Participant whose Participation ceased (within the meaning of Article III) on or after January 1, 1976, earns a Year of Vesting Service for any vesting computation period up to and including the vesting computation period which ended June 30, 1992, during which the Participant completed one Hour of Service.
C.	For each vesting computation period, commencing with the vesting computation period that begins July 1, 1992, a Participant earns a Year of Vesting Service for each such vesting computation period during which the Participant completes four hundred (400) or more Hours of Service.
32
D.	Years of Vesting Service prior to a Permanent Break in Service are forfeited and do not count toward Years of Vesting Service.
E.	A Participant who ceased participation prior to December 1, 1974 will be deemed to have completed ten (10) Years of Vesting Service (or five (5) Years of Vesting Service if applicable) only if the Participant completes said Years of Vesting Service in accordance with the rules contained in this Section 7.2 and if the date of the Participant’s cessation of participation is after the tenth anniversary (or if applicable, the fifth anniversary) of the date that the Participant first participated in the Plan.
F.	For purposes of computing Years of Vesting Service for vesting only. Hours of Service with a Contributing Employer for which the Employer is not obligated to contribute to this Trust shall be counted provided that such noncovered service is contiguous with the Participant’s service for which contributions were required. Noncovered service shall be considered as contiguous with covered service if there is no intervening quit, discharge or other termination. No benefits are accrued for contiguous noncovered service.
G.	Hours of Service shall be credited to a Participant for purposes of this Section 7.2 under the terms of the Reciprocal Agreement for Joint Industry Pension Funds of all District Councils and Local Unions Affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Painters and Allied Trades as adopted by the Trustees.
7.3	Break-in-Service
A.	A One Year Break in Service occurs when, during any vesting computation period up to and including the vesting computation period that ended on June 30, 1992, a Participant has no Hours of Service. For vesting computation periods beginning with the vesting computation period that begins on July 1, 1992 and thereafter, a One Year Break in Service occurs when, during any such vesting computation period, a Participant or former Participant completes less than 400 Hours of Service.
B.	A Participant who experiences a One Year Break in Service after he becomes vested within the meaning of 7.1, is entitled to have his pre-break service counted for vesting and benefit accrual purposes.
C.	A Participant who experiences a One Year Break in Service prior to becoming vested and who subsequently becomes a Participant in the Plan shall be entitled to have his Years of Vesting Service and his years of Accredited Past and Future Service Benefits for purposes of benefit computation prior to that One Year Break in Service counted unless the break in service is a “Permanent Break in Service” within the meaning of the following Section 7.3.D. Conversely, Years of Vesting Service and Accredited Prior and Future Service Benefits earned prior to a “Permanent Break in Service” will not be counted.
D.	A Permanent Break in Service occurs if a nonvested Participant experiences consecutive One Year Breaks in Service which equal or exceed the greater of:
33
1.	five Years of Vesting Service;
2.	the number of the Participant’s Years of Vesting Service before the Break in Service.
34
ARTICLE VIII
Form of Benefit Payments
8.1	Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this Article VIII.
A.	The term “Annuity Starting Date” shall have the meaning set out in Section 1.5.
B.	A “Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity” for a Participant who is married to his
spouse on his Annuity Starting Date is a form of annuity which pays a lifetime monthly pension payment to the Participant and upon the Participant’s death, pays one-half of that amount in monthly payments to the Participant’s “surviving spouse” for the life of the surviving spouse. The Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity for a married Participant will be the Actuarial Equivalent of the amount which the Participant would receive under the Normal Form of Benefits under this Plan. The monthly amount of the Participant’s pension is reduced in accordance with the actuarial assumptions used by the Plan and the ages of the Participant and his spouse.
C.	The “surviving spouse” for purposes of this Article is the spouse to whom the Participant was lawfully married as of the Annuity Starting Date. If the “surviving spouse” predeceases the Participant, no survivorship annuity will be payable, even if the Participant remarries. The death of the surviving spouse prior to the Participant’s death will not affect the amount of the monthly payment to the Participant.
8.2	General Rule Concerning Form of Benefits. Effective for any Participant whose Annuity Starting Date is July 1, 1976 or thereafter, and who is married on his Annuity Starting Date, benefits shall be paid in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity unless the Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.3. In the event (i) the Participant has been married less than one (1) year on his Annuity Starting Date, (ii) his benefits are paid in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity as of his Annuity Starting Date, and (iii) the Participant’s marriage terminates prior to the first anniversary of the marriage for any reason, other than the death of the Participant, benefits shall be paid to the Participant, commencing as of the first day of the month immediately following the month in which his marriage terminates, in the form of the Normal Retirement Benefit, or, if elected by the Participant under Section 8.5, in the form of an optional
35
form of benefit. In the event the marriage terminates on account of the death of the Participant before the first anniversary of marriage, under the circumstances described in the immediately preceding sentence, all benefits payable to the Participant and his spouse shall terminate as of the date of the Participant’s death.
8.3	Waiver of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.
A.	A Participant who is otherwise required to receive his benefits in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity may waive said form of benefits by filing with the Administrator a valid waiver during the election period. The election period is the ninety (90) day period prior to the Annuity Starting Date. Any valid election made during any election period prior to an Annuity Starting Date which is on or after the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age will govern all payments of benefits earned thereafter. Any election may be revoked at any time during the election period.
B.	In order to be valid, an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity must meet the following requirements:
1.	It must be in writing.
2.	Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.4, it must be filed no less than thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days after the Participant receives the Notice and Explanation described in Section 8.4. The Notice and Explanation is presumed to be received on the third day after the date it is mailed.
3.	In the case of a Participant who has had one or more Hours of Service after August 23, 1984, the waiver must be consented to in writing by the Participant’s spouse (unless such consent is not required under Subsection 8.3.B.4). Said consent must also acknowledge in writing the effect of the election. The consent and acknowledgment required by this Subsection must be witnessed by a notary public or a Plan representative.
Effective for any election filed with regard to an Annuity Starting Date on or after July 1, 1987, the waiver and consent must name the designated Beneficiary or Beneficiaries, if any, who will receive survivorship benefits under the Plan and must name the form of benefits to be paid under the Plan (subject to the following paragraph). If a consent names a designated Beneficiary and/or a specific form of benefits, then any subsequent change to said designated Beneficiary and/or form of benefits is invalid unless a new consent is obtained from the spouse, which meets the requirements of this Section.
36
If the consent does not name a specific Beneficiary or Beneficiaries or a specific form of benefits, or if the Participant and spouse desire that future changes in the Beneficiary and/or form of benefits may be made without spousal consent, the consent must acknowledge that the spouse has the right to limit consent to a specific Beneficiary and a specific form of benefits and the consent must voluntarily waive whichever (or both) of said rights, in accordance with the desires of the Participant and his spouse.
4.	The consent described in this Section 8.3 is not required if it is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that the consent otherwise required cannot be obtained because:
a.	there is no spouse;
b.	the spouse cannot be located; or
c.	such other circumstances exist as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury as sufficient to obviate the requirement of the spousal consent.
8.4	Notice and Explanation of Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the Right to Waive Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.
A.	Within a reasonable time of not less than thirty (30) days and no more than ninety (90) days prior to the Annuity Starting Date, the Plan must provide the Participant with a notice in writing explaining the terms of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the right to waive that Annuity Form of Benefit. This Notice will be provided within a reasonable period of time before the Participant’s Normal Retirement Age and a reasonable period of time before any early retirement date or postponed retirement date. A Participant may not elect an Annuity Starting Date at any time before the 31st day after he has received the Notice, provided that the Annuity Starting Date may be less than thirty-one days after receipt of the written explanation provided: (a) the Participant has been provided with information that clearly indicates the Participant has at least thirty days to consider whether to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and elect (with spousal consent) a form of distribution other than a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity; (b) the Participant is permitted to revoke any affirmative distribution election at least until the Annuity Starting Date or, if later, at any time prior to the expiration of the seven day period that begins the day after the explanation of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity is provided to the Participant; and (c) the Annuity Starting Date is a date after the date that the written explanation was provided to the Participant.
B.	The Notice and Explanation must contain a written explanation of the following:
1.	The terms and conditions of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity;
37
2.	The Participant’s right to make an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the procedure for making the election;
3.	The effect of an election to waive the Qualified Joint and Survivor form of benefit;
4.	The rights of the Participant’s spouse, including the right to withhold consent; and
5.	The right to revoke an election to waive Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the effect of such revocation.
8.5	Optional Forms of Retirement Benefits.
A.	In the event a Participant validly waives the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, he may elect to receive his benefits in any of the following optional forms:
1.	Life Annuity with a sixty (60) month guarantee (described in Section 5.2 of this Plan).
2.	A Life Annuity with one hundred and twenty (120) months guarantee, which is the same form of payments as the life annuity with sixty (60) month guarantee as described in Section 5.2, but the number of monthly guaranteed payments is one hundred and twenty (120). This option may only be selected if the one hundred and twenty (120) monthly payments will not extend payments beyond the life expectancy of the Participant and his designated beneficiary.
3.	A Life Only Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant for his lifetime with no further payments after the monthly payment for the month in which the Participant dies.
4.	A Joint and Full Survivor Annuity which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payments in the same amount to the “surviving spouse”.
5.	A Joint and Two-Thirds Survivor Annuity, which provides monthly benefit payments to the Participant throughout his lifetime and, upon his death, continues monthly payments equal to sixty-six and two-thirds (66-2/3) percent of the amount that the Participant was receiving, to the “surviving spouse”.
B.	All optional forms of benefits (including the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity) shall be adjusted so that the actuarial value of the benefit is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Participant’s Accrued Benefit stated in the Normal Form of Benefit (Section 5.2).
38
C.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustees shall distribute the Participant’s benefits or the Beneficiary’s benefits in the form of a lump sum payment on or prior to the Annuity Starting Date if the Actuarial Equivalent value of the benefits does not exceed $5,000 ($3,500 for distributions before August 6, 1997).
39
ARTICLE IX
Application for and Timing of Benefit Distribution
9.1	Applications. A Participant or Beneficiary must apply in writing for any benefit payable under this Plan in a timely manner, in advance of his Annuity Starting Date. To be timely for this purpose, an application must be sufficient to give notice to the Plan Administrator of the applicant’s request to commence receipt of benefits under this Plan. Every Participant, Beneficiary or Pensioner shall furnish, at the request of the Plan Administrator, any information or proof reasonably required to determine his benefit rights. If a person makes a willfully false statement material to an application or furnishes fraudulent information or proof, benefits not vested under this Plan (as defined in Article VII) may be denied, suspended or discontinued as determined by the Trustees. The Trustees shall have the right to recover any benefit payments made in reliance on any false or fraudulent statement, information or proof submitted by a Participant, Beneficiary or Pensioner.
9.2	Trustees. The Trustees shall, subject to the requirements of the law, be the sole judges of the standard of proof required in any case and the application and interpretation of the Plan including decisions concerning the eligibility of a Participant or Beneficiary to participate or his entitlement to benefits, and decisions of the Trustees shall be final and binding on all parties. In the event an application for benefits is denied in whole or in part, the Participant or Beneficiary must follow the Benefit Claim Procedure set forth in Article X. Wherever in the Plan the Trustees are given discretionary powers, the Trustees shall exercise such powers in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner.
40
9.3	Timing of Benefit Commencement. Payment of benefits may begin sooner but shall begin no later than sixty (60) days after the last of the following dates, unless the Participant elects a later date (see Section 6.2).
A.	The end of the Plan Year in which the Participant attained Normal Retirement Age;
B.	The end of the Plan Year in which the Participant left covered service;
C.	The Annuity Starting Date selected by the Participant on an application for
benefits filed with the Plan; or
D.	The date the Trustees were first able to ascertain entitlement to, or the amount of, the Participant’s Benefits.
9.4	Limitations on the Timing of Benefit Distribution.
A.	As set forth in Section 6.2, a Participant may elect to postpone his Annuity Starting Date to a date which is past his Normal Retirement Date, provided that Annuity Starting Date cannot be postponed beyond a Participant’s Required Beginning Date.
B.	Notwithstanding any provisions in the Plan to the contrary, benefit payments must meet the requirements of either of the following subsections:
1.	Benefits shall be distributed in full prior to the “Required Beginning Date”, or
2.	a. Distribution to a Participant must begin no later than the
Required Beginning Date and must be made over the life of the Participant (or lives of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse), or over a period not exceeding the life expectancy of the Participant (or the life expectancies of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse). Distributions (as described in this Subsection) may be made to a Participant and a nonspouse Beneficiary provided the period used to determine the “life expectancies” remains that of the Participant and the Participant’s spouse.
b.	If distribution of benefits has begun in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 9.4.B.2.a, and if the Participant dies before his or her entire interest is distributed, the remaining portion of the Participant’s interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the distribution method being used as of the date of his death.
41
c.	If a Participant dies before the distribution of the Participant’s interest has begun in accordance with Subsection 9.4.B.2.a, then the entire interest of the Employee must be distributed by December 31 of the fifth calendar year following the year of the Participant’s death, subject to the following:
(1)	The five-year payout requirement shall not apply if:
(a)	any portion of the Participant’s interest is payable to (or for the benefit of) a designated Beneficiary;
(b)	such portion will be distributed (in accordance with Treasury Regulations) over the life of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such Beneficiary); and
(c)	such distributions begin not later than one year after the Participant’s death or such later date as may be prescribed by Treasury Regulations.
(2)	If the designated Beneficiary referred to in Subsection 9.4.B.2.c is the surviving spouse of the Participant, then:
(a)	the date on which distributions are required to begin under Subsection 9.4.B.2.c(l)(c) shall not be earlier than the April 1 immediately following the date on which the Participant would have attained age 70-1/2; and
(b)	if the surviving spouse dies before the distribution to such spouse begins, this Subsection shall be applied as if the surviving spouse were the Participant.
3. For purposes of this Subsection 9.4.B with respect to distributions under the Plan made on or after calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2001, the Plan will apply the minimum distribution requirements of Code § 401(a)(9) in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Code § 401(a)(9) that were proposed on January 17, 2001 (the “2001 Proposed Regulations”), notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary. If the total amount of required minimum distributions made to a Participant for 2001 prior to January 1, 2002 are equal to or greater than the amount of required minimum distributions determined under the 2001 Proposed Regulations, then no additional distributions are required for such Participant for 2001 on or after such date. If the total amount of required minimum distributions made to a Participant for 2001 prior to January 1, 2002 are less than the amount determined under the 2001 Proposed Regulations, then the amount of required minimum distributions
42
for 2001 on or after such date will be determined so that the total amount of required minimum distributions for 2001 is the amount determined under the 2001 Proposed Regulations. This amendment shall continue in effect until the last calendar year beginning before the effective date of the final Regulations under Code § 401(a)(9) or such other date as may be published by the Internal Revenue Service.

ARTICLE XI
Limitations on Benefits
11.1	Maximum Limitation.
A.	Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan, the annual retirement benefit to which a Participant shall be entitled hereunder, when aggregated with the benefits under all other defined benefit plans maintained by an Employer, shall not exceed the lesser of:
1.	$90,000 payable as a straight life annuity for the Participant’s life; or
2.	One hundred percent (100%) of the Employee’s average annual compensation for the three highest consecutive calendar years during which he participated in the Plan or any other Plan maintained by the Employer, payable as a straight life annuity for the Participant’s life.
The $90,000 limit set forth in Subsection U.l.A.l above shall be increased automatically to account for increases in the cost of living. Such cost of living adjustment shall be limited to scheduled increases in accordance with Treasury Regulations under Code § 415(d), and shall be effective no sooner than January 1 of each year.
B.	For purposes of this Section “compensation” shall mean the Employee’s earned income, wages, salaries and fees for professional services, elective deferrals described in Code § 402(g)(3), amounts which are contributed or deferred by the Participant and, for Plan Years beginning after December 31,2000, which are not included in gross income of a Participant under Code § 132(f)(4) and other amounts received for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment with Employers maintaining the Plan (including, but not limited to, commissions paid to salesmen, percentage of profits, commissions on insurance premiums, tips and bonuses), and excluding the following:
1.	Employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation which are not included in the Employee’s gross income for the taxable year in which contributed or Employer contributions under a simplified Employee pension plan to the extent such contributions are deductible by an Employee, or any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation.
2.	Amounts realized from the exercise of a non-qualified stock option, or when restricted stock (or property) held by an Employer either becomes freely transferable or is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.
3.	Amounts realized from the sale, exchange or other disposition of stock acquired under a qualified stock option plan.
46
C.	In the case of a Participant who has less than ten (10) years of Accredited Past and Future Service Benefits for purposes of benefit accrual, the limitations set forth in Subsections 11.1.A and B shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Participant’s such years of Accredited Past and Future Service Benefits and the denominator of which is ten (10).
D.	Notwithstanding the limitations of Subsection 11.1 .A, if a Participant was covered by the Plan before July 1, 1987, he may receive an annual retirement benefit which is not less than the amount of his current Accrued Benefit as of the close of the last Plan Year ending July 1, 1987, as determined under the terms of the Plan as then in effect disregarding any amendments or cost of living adjustments after June 30, 1987.
E.	Effective January 1, 1995, if the Participant’s Accrued Benefit is paid in any form other than a straight life annuity or a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, the benefit must be adjusted to its Actuarial Equivalent in the form of a straight life annuity for purposes of applying the limitations in Subsection 11.1.A.	For
purposes of this adjustment, any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits shall be disregarded. The Actuarially Equivalent benefit under this Subsection shall be calculated utilizing an interest rate assumption which is the greater of (a) the rate specified in Subsection 1.4. A or (b) five (5) percent per year. However, in the case of any benefit paid in a single sum, the interest rate assumption shall not be less than the greater of the “Applicable Interest Rate,” as defined in Subsection I.4.C.I. The mortality assumption utilized for purposes of calculating the actuarially equivalent benefit under this Subsection shall be determined using the table specified in Subsection 1.4. A.
F.	If payment of the Accrued Benefit of a Participant commences before the Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age, but on or after age sixty-two (62), the dollar limitation specified in Subsection 11.1.A. 1 shall be determined as follows:
1.	If a Participant’s Social Security Age is sixty-five (65) for benefits commencing on or after age sixty-two (62), the limitation is reduced by 5/9 of one percent for each month by which benefits commence before the month in which the Participant attains age sixty-three (63).
2.	If the Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age is greater than sixty-five (65) for benefits commencing on or after age sixty-two (62), the limitation is reduced by 5/9 of one percent for each of the first thirty-six (36) months and 5/12 of one percent for each of the additional months (up to twenty-four (24) months) by which benefits commence before the month of the Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age.
If the benefits of the Participant commence prior to age sixty-two (62), the defined benefit dollar limitation of Subsection 1 l.l.A.l applicable to the Participant at such earlier age is an annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity that is the Actuarial Equivalent of the limitation for age sixty-two
47
(62), as determined above, reduced for each month by which benefits commence before the month in which the Participant attains age sixty-two (62). Effective for Plan Years beginning after June 30, 1995, the limitation applicable at age prior to sixty-two (62) is determined (i) as the lesser of the Actuarial Equivalent of the limitation for age sixty-two (62) computed using the interest rate and mortality table specified in Subsection 1.4.A, or (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent of the limitation for age sixty-two (62) computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate and the applicable mortality table as defined in Subsection 1.4.A. Any decrease in the limitation determined in accordance with this provision shall not reflect a mortality decrement if benefits are not forfeited upon the death of the Participant. If any benefits are forfeited upon death, the full mortality decrement is taken into account.
G.	If payment of the Participant’s Accrued Benefit commences after the Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age, the limitation specified in Subsection 1 l.l.A.l applicable to the Participant at the later age is the Annual Benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the later age that is Actuarially Equivalent to the limitation applicable to the Participant at the Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age. Effective for Plan Years beginning after June 30, 1995, the Actuarial Equivalent of the limitation at the Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age is determined as (i) the lesser of the Actuarial Equivalent of the limitation at the Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age computed using the interest rate and mortality table specified in Subsection 1.4.A or (ii) the Actuarial Equivalent of the limitation at the Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age computed using a five percent (5%) interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table as defined in Subsection 1.4.A. For these purposes, mortality between a Participant’s Social Security Retirement Age and the age at which benefits commence must be ignored.
H.	Notwithstanding anything else in this Section to the contrary, the benefit otherwise accrued or payable to a Participant under this Plan shall be deemed not to exceed the limits of Subsection 11.1 .A if:
I.	The retirement benefits payable for a Plan year under any form of benefit with respect to such Participant under this Plan and under all other defined benefit plans (regardless of whether terminated) ever maintained by an Employer do not exceed $1,000 multiplied by the Participant’s number of Years of Vesting Service or parts thereof (not to exceed ten (10)) with the Employers, and
2.	Such an Employer has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan, a welfare benefit fund under which amounts attributable to postretirement medical benefits are allocated to separate accounts of key employees (as defined in Code § 419(A)(d)(3)), or an individual medical account in which the Participant participated (for these purposes, Employee contributions, whether voluntary or involuntary, under a defined benefit plan are not treated as a separate defined contribution plan).
48
I.	“Social Security Retirement Age” means age sixty-five (65) in the case of a Participant bom before January 1, 1938; age sixty-six (66) for a Participant bom after December 31, 1937, but before January 1, 1955; and age sixty-seven (67) for a Participant bom after December 31,1954.
J.	If a Participant covered by this Plan participates in both defined benefit and defined contributions plans maintained by the Employer, the sum of 1 and 2 below may not exceed 1.0:
1.	The sum of the projected annual benefit of the Employee under all defined benefit pension plans of the Employer determined as of the close of the Plan Year, divided by the lesser of:
a.	The product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Code § 415(b)( 1)(A) for such year, or
b.	The product of 1.4 multiplied by the amount which may be taken into account under Code § 415(b)(1)(B) with respect to such Employee for such year.
2.	The sum of the annual additions to the Employee’s account under all defined contributions plans of the Employer as of the close of the Plan Year and for all prior calendar years divided by the sum of the lesser of a. or b. for such year and for each prior Year of Vesting Service with the Employer (regardless of whether any such defined contribution plan was in existence during those years), where:
a.	Is the product of 1.25 multiplied by the dollar limitation in effect under Code § 415(c)(1)(A) for such year (without regard to Code § 415(c)(6)); and
b.	Is the product of 1.4 multiplied by the same amount which may be taken into account under Code § 415(c)(1)(B) (or § 415(c)(7), if applicable) with respect to such individual under such plan for such year; provided however, that the Trustees may elect that the amount taken into account for each Employee for all years ending before January 1, 1983, under a and b above shall be determined pursuant to the special transition rule in such Code § 415(e)(6).
49
If this Plan is aggregated with another Plan that was in existence on July 1, 1982, and the above limitations are not met, each Participant for whom the limits are violated will not receive any annual additions or accruals in this Plan. In the event that at the earlier to occur of each December 31 or the date of an Employee’s retirement or termination, the sum of 1 and 2 above exceeds 1.0 and the benefit of such Employee under such other Plan or Plans is not reduced to bring such sum to 1.0, then such Employee’s benefits under this Plan shall be reduced by an amount sufficient to cause the sum of 1 and 2 above for each Employee to equal 1.0.
This Subsection 11.1.J. shall not be applicable for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 1999.
50
ARTICLE XII
Miscellaneous Provisions
12.1	Military Service. Qualified Military Service by a Participant shall, upon his return to employment covered by this Plan, be credited for purposes of participation, benefit accrual and vesting to the extent required by law.
12.2	Spendthrift Trust/Non-Alienation or Assignability of Benefits
A.	No Participant shall, under this Trust, have any legal right, title or interest in the Trust or any contract issued concerning his participation, and any such Participant’s interest, beneficial or otherwise, shall be limited to that provided in this Trust and under any contract on such Participant.
To the extent permitted by law, and except as provided in paragraph (B) and under Code § 401 (a)( 13)(C), the Participant shall not be permitted to anticipate, encumber, alienate or assign any of his rights, claims or interest in his benefits under the Plan, except upon the written authority of the Trustees, nor shall any payments, benefits, or rights arising by reason of this Plan or Trust, be in any way subject to the Participant’s debts, contracts or engagements, nor to any judicial processes to levy upon or attach the same for payment thereof.
B.	All other provisions of this Section and this Plan notwithstanding, the Plan shall pay benefits in accordance with any domestic relations order which is determined to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as defined in Code § 414(p). The Trustees shall adopt a written procedure for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders and for administering distributions under such qualified orders.
12.3	Non Reversion to Employer. It is expressly understood that in no event shall any of the corpus or assets of the Trust revert to the Employers or be subject to any claims of any kind or nature by the Employers.
12.4	Funds in Trustees’ Possession for Benefit of Participant and Beneficiaries. Any funds coming into the hands of the Trustees from any source whatsoever, less reasonable expenses of administering this Trust as may be determined from time to time by the Trustees, shall be used solely to provide the benefits enumerated herein for eligible Participants and
51
Beneficiaries. The sources of these funds shall include contributions from Employers, interest and other earnings on investments and dividends from an insurance company.
12.5	Limitation of Liability. The Plan has been established on the basis of an actuarial calculation which has established, to the extent possible, so that contributions will, if continued, be sufficient to maintain the Plan on a permanent basis, fulfilling the funding requirements of ERISA. Except for liabilities which may result from provisions of ERISA, or other applicable law, nothing in this Plan shall be construed to impose any obligation to contribute beyond the obligation of the Employer to make contributions as stipulated in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, and there shall be no liability upon the Trustees individually, or collectively, or upon the Union to provide benefits established by this Plan, if the Trust does not have assets to make such payments.
12.6	Liability of Employer/Liability of Participants. The liability of any individual Employer to the Fund shall in no event extend to the obligations of another participating Employer or other participating Employers.
The individual Participants shall not be required or permitted to make any payments or contributions to the cost of the operation of the Plan or Trust or in connection with the administration of the Trust hereby established or otherwise. No individual Participant shall be liable or responsible for any debts, liabilities or obligations of the Trust or Trustees.
12.7	Rollover Distributions.
A. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee’s election under this Section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.
52
B.	Definitions.
1.	Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee’s designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code § 401(a)(9); the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), and, effective for distributions after December 31, 1998, any hardship distribution described in Code § 401 (k)(2)(B)(i)(IV).
2.	Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Code § 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code § 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code § 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code § 401(a), that accepts the distributee’s eligible rollover distribution. However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.
3.	Distributee: A distributee includes an Employee or former Employee. In addition, the Employee’s or former Employee’s surviving spouse and the Employee’s or former Employee’s spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code § 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse.
4.	Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.
12.8 Top-Heavy Provisions.
A.	Definitions. For purposes of this Section, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings stated below unless a different meaning is clearly required by the context:
1.	Key Employee.
“Key Employee” means an Employee or former Employee (and the Beneficiary of such Employee) meeting the definition of “Key Employee” contained in Code §416(i)(l) and Section 1.416-1 of Treasury Regulations.
53
2.	Non-Key Employee.
“Non-Key Employee” means any Employee who is not a Key Employee.
3.	Annual Compensation Limitation.
a.	The amount of a Participant’s compensation (as defined in Subsection 11.1 .B above) from any single Employer that may be taken into account for any Plan purpose in any Plan Year is $150,000, as that amount may be adjusted from time to time by the Secretary of the Treasury under Code § 401 (a)( 17).
b.	Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, the Accrued Benefit of any Participant whose compensation exceeded $150,000 in any Plan Year beginning before August 1, 1994, shall be the greater of:
the sum of
(1)	The Participant’s Accrued Benefit as of June 30, 1994, determined under Article V as though the Participant had terminated employment on that date and without regard to any Plan amendments adopted after that date (but taking into account remedial amendments that apply retroactively before that date under Code § 401(b), plus
(2)	the amount of the Participant’s Accrued Benefit earned on or after July 1, 1994 under Article V, taking into account only Accredited Future Service Benefits earned after June 30,1994, and
the Participant’s Accrued Benefit, determined under Article V, taking into account all Accredited Past and Future Service Benefits earned before and after July 1, 1994.
4.	Determination Date.
“Determination Date” means, with respect to any Plan Year, the last day of the preceding Plan Year, or in the case of the first Plan Year of any Plan, the last day of such Plan Year.
B.	Top-Heavy Plan Requirements.
Effective January 1, 1984, for any Top-Heavy Plan Year, the Plan shall provide the following:
I.	This Plan shall be a Top-Heavy Plan for any Plan Year commencing after December 31,1983, in which, as of the Determination Date,
a.	the present value of Accrued Benefits of Key Employees and
54
b.	the sum of the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an Aggregation Group
exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the present value of Accrued Benefits and the aggregate accounts of all Key Employees and non-Key Employees under this Plan and all plans of an Aggregation Group.
If any Participant is a Non-Key Employee for a Plan Year, but such Participant was a Key Employee for any prior Plan Year, such Participant’s present value of Accrued Benefits and/or aggregate account balance shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan (or whether any Aggregation Group which includes this Plan is a Top-Heavy Group). In addition, for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 1984, if a Participant or former Participant has not performed services for any Employer maintaining the Plan at any time during the five-year period ending on the Determination Date, the aggregate account and/or present value of Accrued Benefits for such Participant or former Participant shall not be taken into account for the purposes of determining whether this Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan.
2.	A Participant’s aggregate account as of the Determination Date shall be determined under applicable provisions of the defined contribution plan used in determining Top-Heavy Plan status.
3.	“Aggregation Group” means either a Required Aggregation Group or a Permissive Aggregation Group as hereinafter determined.
a.	In determining a Required Aggregation Group hereunder, each plan of an Employer in which a Key Employee is a Participant, and each other plan of an Employer which enables any plan in which a Key Employee participates to meet the requirements of Code §§ 401(a)(4) or 410, will be required to be aggregated by Code § 416(g)(2)(A)(i)(lI). Such group shall be known as a “Required Aggregation Group.”
In the case of a Required Aggregation Group, each plan in the group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Required Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan if the Required Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Group.
b.	An Employer may also include any other plan not required to be included in the Required Aggregation Group, provided the resulting group, taken as a whole, would continue to satisfy the provisions of Code §§ 401(a)(4) and 410. Such group shall be known as a “Permissive Aggregation Group.”
In the case of a Permissive Aggregation Group, only a plan that is part of the Required Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-
55
Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is a Top-Heavy Plan. No plan in the Permissive Aggregation Group will be considered a Top-Heavy Plan if the Permissive Aggregation Group is not a Top-Heavy Group.
c.	Only those plans of an Employer in which the Determination Dates fall within the same Plan Year shall be aggregated in order to determine whether such plans are Top-Heavy Plans.
4.	In the case of a defined benefit plan, a Participant’s present value of accrued benefits shall be determined:
a.	as of the most recent actuarial valuation date which is the most recent valuation date within a twelve-month period ending on the Determination Date;
b.	for the first Plan Year, as if:
(1)	the Participant terminated service as of the Determination Date; or
(2)	the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date, but taking into account the estimated present value of accrued benefits as of the Determination Date.
c.	for any other Plan Year, as if the Participant terminated service as of the actuarial valuation date.
d.	the actuarial valuation date must be the same date used for computing the defined benefit plan minimum funding costs, regardless of whether a valuation is performed in the Plan Year.
5.	The calculation of a Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of a Determination Date shall be the sum of the following:
a.	the present value of accrued benefit using actuarial assumptions stated in the most recent actuarial valuation;
b.	any Plan distributions made within the Plan Year that includes the Determination Date or within four preceding Plan Years. However, in the case of distributions made after the valuation date and prior to the Determination Date, such distributions are not included as distributions for Top-Heavy purposes to the extent that such distributions are already included in the Participant’s present value of accrued benefit as of the valuation date.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, all distributions, including distributions made prior to July 1, 1984, and distributions under a terminated plan which if it had not been
56
terminated would have been required to be included in an Aggregation Group, will be counted;
c.	any Employee contributions, whether voluntary or mandatory. However, amounts attributable to tax deductible, qualified voluntary employee contributions shall not be considered to be a part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits;
d.	with respect to unrelated rollovers and plan-to-plan transfer (ones which are both initiated by the Employee and made from a plan maintained by one Employer to a plan maintained by another Employer), if this Plan provides for rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall always consider such rollover or plan-to-plan transfers as a distribution for purposes of this Section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, it shall not consider such rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted after June 30, 1984, as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits. However, rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers accepted prior to July 1, 1984, shall be considered as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits; and
e.	with respect to related rollovers and plan-to-plan transfers (ones either not initiated by the Employee or made to a plan maintained by the same Employer), if this Plan provides the rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall not be counted as a distribution for purposes of this Section. If this Plan is the plan accepting such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer, it shall consider such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer as part of the Participant’s present value of accrued benefits, irrespective of the date on which such rollover or plan-to-plan transfer is accepted.
f.	“Top-Heavy Group” means an Aggregation Group in which, as of the Determination Date, the sum of:
(1)	the present value of accrued benefits of Key Employees under all defined benefit plans included in the group; and
(2)	the aggregate accounts of Key Employees under all defined contribution plans included in the group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of a similar sum determined for all Participants.
g.	Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the effective date otherwise provided for herein for the application of Code § 416 to this Plan (Plan Years beginning after December 31, 1983) shall be extended in accordance with any federal law or regulatory authority.
57
C. Top-Heavy Vesting.
1. Notwithstanding the determination of Vested Status in accordance with Article VII of the Plan, for any Top-Heavy Plan Year, the vested portion of any Participant’s Accrued Benefit shall be determined on the basis of the Participant’s number of Years of Vesting Service according to the following schedule:
Service for Vesting
(excluding Years of
Service for Vesting
prior to effective date
of this Plan) Vested Percentage
1	year	0%
2	year	0%
3	years	100%
2.	If, in any subsequent Plan Year, the Plan ceases to be a Top-Heavy Plan, the Trustees may elect to:
a.	continue to apply this vesting schedule in determining the vested portion of any Participant’s Accrued Benefit; or
b.	revert to the vesting schedule in effect before this Plan became a Top-Heavy Plan pursuant to Code § 411 (a)(l 0). The nonforfeitable percentage of the Accrued Benefit before the Plan ceased being Top-Heavy, therefore, must not be reduced and any Participant with three or more Years of Vesting Service must be given the option of remaining under the Top-Heavy vesting schedule. Any such reversion shall be treated as a Plan amendment.
3.	The Top-Heavy vesting schedule does not apply to the Accrued Benefit of any Employee who does not have one Hour of Service after the Plan has initially become a Top-Heavy Plan and such Employee’s Accrued Benefit attributable to Employer contributions will be determined without regard to this Article.
D. Top-Heavy Benefit Requirement.
1.	The minimum monthly Accrued Benefit for a Participant’s period of TopHeavy Employment derived from Employer contributions to be provided under this Section for each Non-Key Employee who is a Participant shall equal the product of:
a.	one-twelfth (I/12th) of compensation, as defined in Subsection 11.1.B, averaged over the five consecutive calendar years (or actual number of calendar years if less) in the Participant’s period of employment in a Top-Heavy Plan Year which produces the highest average, and
58
b.	the lesser of
(3)	two percent (2%) multiplied by Years of Vesting Service during a Participant’s period of employment in a Top-Heavy Plan Year; or
(4)	twenty percent (20%).
A Participant’s Years of Vesting Service during his period of TopHeavy Employment are Years of Vesting Service he earns (or is deemed to earn), excluding periods prior to April 1, 1984 and periods during which the Plan was not in top-heavy status.
2.	For purposes of providing the minimum benefit under Code § 416, a NonKey Employee who is not a Participant solely because:
a.	his annual compensation is below a stated amount, or
b.	he declined to make mandatory contributions to the Plan
will be considered to be a Participant.
3.	For purposes of this Section, Years of Vesting Service for any Plan Year ending prior to July 1, 1984, or for any Plan Year during which the Plan was not a Top-Heavy Plan shall be disregarded.
4.	For purposes of this Section, Annual Compensation for any “limitation year” ending prior to July 1, 1984, or subsequent to the last “limitation year” during which the Plan is a Top-Heavy Plan shall be disregarded. The term “limitation year” means the Plan Year.

ARTICLE XIII
Right to Amend
The Trustees shall have the sole right to amend this Plan and Trust, without the consent of any Participant, at any time from time to time as may be deemed advisable; provided, however, that no amendment to this Trust shall deprive any Participant of any Accrued Benefit or vested equitable interest herein, if any, nor shall such amendment be contrary to any laws in existence or enacted by the Federal or State Government directly concerning this Trust, provided that the Trustees may adopt an amendment.
A.	If it is necessary to establish or maintain the qualification of the Plan or the Trust Fund and to maintain compliance of the Plan with the requirements of ERISA; or
B.	If the amendment meets the requirements of ERISA § 302(c)(8) and Code § 412(c)(8), and the Secretary of Labor has been notified of such amendment and has either approved of it or, within ninety (90) days after the date on which such notice was filed, has failed to disapprove.
Either the Trustees representing the Union or the Trustees representing the Employers may propose amendments to this Trust. Such amendment will become effective when it has been approved and executed by a majority of the Trustees. All amendments adopted relevant to the continuing qualification of this Plan and Trust shall be submitted to the Internal Revenue Service for its determination of the qualification of such amendment.
61
ARTICLE XIV
Termination
A.	Right to Terminate. The Trustees shall have the right to discontinue or terminate this Plan in whole or in part. The rights of all affected Participants to benefits accrued to the date of the termination, partial termination, or discontinuance to the extent funded as of such date shall be nonforfeitable.
B.	Priorities of Allocation. In the event of termination, the assets then remaining in the Plan, after providing for any administrative expenses, shall be allocated among the Pensioners, Beneficiaries, and Participants in the following order:
1.	First in the case of benefits payable as a pension:
a.	In the case of the pension of a Participant or Beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the three year period ending on the termination date of the Plan, to each pension, based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five year period ending on such date) under which such pension would be the least. The lowest pension in pay status during the three year period shall be considered the pension in pay status for such period.
b.	In the case of a pension of a Participant or Beneficiary which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such three year period if the Participant had retired prior to the beginning of the three year period if his pension had commenced (in the standard form) as of the beginning of such period, to each such pension based on the provisions of the Plan (as in effect during the five year period ending on such date) under which the pension would be the least.
2.	Second, to all other benefits (if any) of the individuals under the Plan guaranteed under Title IV of ERISA.
3.	Third, to all other vested benefits under the Plan.
4.	Fourth, to all other benefits under the Plan.
C.	Allocation Procedure. For purposes of Subsection B hereof:
1.	The amount allocated under any paragraph of Subsection B with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of that subsection.
2.	If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of Subsection B (other than paragraphs 3 and 4) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated pro-rata among such individuals on the basis of the
62
present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.
3.	This Subsection applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph B.3 are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.
a.	If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph b below, the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in paragraph B.3 on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph B.3 under the Plan as in effect at the beginning of the five year period ending on the date of the Plan termination.
b.	If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph a above, are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph a, benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the Plan as amended by the most recent amendment effective during such five year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph a and any assets remaining to be allocated under subparagraph a on the basis of the Plan as amended by the next succeeding Plan amendment effective during such period.
63
ARTICLE XV
Merger or Consolidation
The Trustees shall not merge or consolidate this Plan with any other Plan or transfer the assets or liabilities of this Plan to any other Plan, unless each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit said Participant would have been entitled to receive.
64
ARTICLE XVI
Trustees
Trustees herein have been selected as follows: RICHARD BRYAN, RICHARD BROEKER, and ROBERT A. LUCKS have been selected by the Union and H. FRED PHILIPP, JR., PAUL MEYER, and DAN WIENSTROER have been selected by the Employers. The total number of Trustees designated by the Union and the total number of Trustees designated by the Employers shall at all times be equal, regardless of the number of Employers who may be contributing to the Trust. The term ‘Trustee” as used herein shall mean any natural person designated as a Trustee and selected by the Union or the Employers. The Board of Trustees shall be the Plan sponsor, administrator and named fiduciaries of the Plan.
Any Trustee may resign by giving thirty (30) days’ notice in the United States mail to the other Trustees of his intent to so resign. The Union may discharge any of the Trustees appointed by it, by giving thirty (30) days’ notice in the United States mail of such intent to discharge. The Employers may discharge any of the Trustees appointed by them, by giving thirty (30) days notice in the United States mail of such intent to discharge. The removal of a Trustee shall be automatic at the end of a thirty (30) day period of notification by either the Trustee or the Union or the Employers, as described above, of resignation or removal.
In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Union shall die, be incapable of acting hereunder, resign or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Union. In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Employers shall die, become incapable of acting hereunder, resign or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Employers. Failure of the Union or the Employers to select a successor Trustee promptly shall not prevent the remaining Trustees from carrying on the affairs of this Trust.
65
For purposes of this Plan, the Trustees are authorized to perform any of the above functions and shall be the Plan fiduciaries. As such, the Trustees shall discharge their duties with respect to the Plan solely in the interest of the Participants and Beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to Participants and their Beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan, with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims; by diversifying the investments of the Plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so, and in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan (to the extent said documents and instruments are consistent with the law). The Trustees may act in one or more fiduciary capacities with respect to the Plan and may allocate to others certain aspects of the management and operation responsibilities of the Plan including the employment of investment (and other) advisors and investment managers for all or part of the Plan assets and the delegation of any ministerial duties or functions to qualified individuals. The Trustees shall be responsible for determining the Plan’s short and long-run financial needs from time to time and on the basis thereof shall establish a funding policy and method which will carry out the Plan’s objectives and needs. The Trustees shall from time to time adopt appropriate resolutions defining such investment objectives.
The Trustees shall further have the right to audit the books of a participating Employer when such is deemed necessary or desirable for the effective administration of the Trust.
The Trustees shall designate one Trustee as Chairman for purposes of presiding at the meetings of Trustees to serve for a term of one year commencing with the date of election and until a successor Chairman is thereafter selected. The Chairman shall be alternately selected from the Trustees representing the Employers and Trustees representing the Union. The Trustees
66
shall, at the time of designation of the Chairman, designate one Trustee to serve as Managing Trustee for one year contemporaneously with the Chairman’s term. The Managing Trustee shall act as the co-chairman and shall be alternatively selected from the Trustees representing Employers and Trustees representing the Union. The position of Chairman shall annually be rotated between a Trustee representing Employers and a Trustee representing the Union and the position of Managing Trustee shall annually be rotated between a Trustee representing Employers and a Trustee representing the Union. During an annual term of office, the positions of Chairman and Managing Trustee shall not both be held by Trustees representing Employers or Trustees representing the Union.
A quorum for the transaction of business shall consist of the presence at the meeting of at least four (4) Trustees, two (2) of whom represent Employers and two (2) of whom represent the Union. Decisions of the Trustees shall be made by majority vote. If an unequal number of Employer and Union Trustees attend a meeting, the voting power of the group with the fewest Trustees present shall be and stand increased to that of the group with the most Trustees present so that there shall be equal voting strength between Employer and Union Trustees at all times at such meeting. A deadlock shall be deemed to exist whenever either of following situations arise: (i) whenever a proposal, nomination, motion or resolution or other matter is voted upon and the votes cast are evenly divided and remain evenly divided; and (ii) whenever a quorum is lacking at a meeting duly called and there shall be absent from said meeting two (2) or more Trustees of one group, and a majority of the Trustees present declare a deadlock due to the inability to obtain a quorum. In the event of such deadlock in either case arising, the Employer Trustees and the Union Trustees shall meet promptly for the purpose of agreeing upon an impartial umpire to break such deadlock by casting the deciding vote or deciding any dispute in question or matter under consideration. In the event of the inability of the Employer Trustees and Union Trustees to
67
agree upon the selection of such impartial umpire, then such impartial umpire shall, on the petition of either the Employer Trustees or Union Trustees, be appointed by the United States District Court for the district wherein the Fund Office is located. The decision of any such impartial umpire shall be final and binding on the Trustees and all concerned.
Either the Chairman or the Managing Trustee or any two (2) Trustees may call a meeting of the Trustees at any time by giving at least five (5) days’ written notice of the time and place thereof to each Trustee. Any meeting so called may be postponed once for a reasonable period upon the request of any Trustee upon showing of justifiable cause therefor. Any meeting of the Trustees may also be held at any time without notice if all of the Trustees consent thereto in writing or if all attend and act. If all of the Trustees shall concur in writing upon any proposition, no formal meeting thereon need be held by Trustees. The Managing Trustee, in the written notice, shall notify the Trustees of the subjects to be discussed but this shall not be construed to limit any other subjects of discussion properly placed before the meeting.
The Trustees and Plan office personnel may receive reimbursement for expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of their duties, including but not limited to expenses incurred in attending educational conferences, seminars and meetings, provided that the Trustees determine in each case the subject matter of the conference, seminar or meeting is relevant to the administration of this Trust and that the expenses incurred are reasonable. The Trustees may adopt travel expenditure guidelines for such expenses. Reasonable compensation may be paid to the Trustees for services rendered in the performance of their duties as Trustees provided such payments are made in accordance with the Federal and State laws and regulations then in effect governing Trusts.
68

PAINTERS DISTRICT COUNCIL NO. 2 VACATION PLAN AND TRUST AGREEMENT (Restated effective July 1, 2001)
This Agreement, first made and entered into on July 13, 1966, to be effective as of the first day of September, 1966, by and between the Painters District Council No. 2 and the Painters Employers of St. Louis, Missouri and vicinity, who adhere to the area practice and who have a contract with the Painters District Council No. 2, and certain named individuals, as initial trustees, whose successors currently are RICHARD BRYAN, DANIEL WOODS and LEN HART (Union trustees) and RANDY FREESE, DANIEL HANSON and EDWARD SMITH (Management trustees), hereinafter referred to collectively as TRUSTEES, and

WHEREAS, to effectuate the aforesaid purposes, it is desired to continue and maintain a Trust Fund which will conform to the applicable requirements of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and will continue to qualify as an “exempt trust”, pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, and will conform with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and
WHEREAS, to further effectuate the aforesaid purposes, it is desired to continue and maintain a Vacation Plan, pursuant to the Trustees’ authority contained in Article II, Section 7 of the original Trust Agreement to adopt rules and regulations, which Plan will conform to the applicable requirements of the Labor Management
1
Relations Act of 1947, as amended, and will continue to qualify as a plan maintained pursuant to and as part of an “exempt trust” pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code and the rules and regulations issued thereunder, and will conform with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and
WHEREAS, this Vacation Trust Agreement has been amended from time to time in accordance with Article XII entitled RIGHT TO AMEND, and
WHEREAS, it is the desire of the parties thereto to amend and restate in its entirety said Vacation Trust Agreement as heretofore amended and said Vacation Plan, maintained pursuant to and as a part of the Vacation Trust.
NOW, THEREFORE, said Vacation Trust Agreement as amended and said Vacation Plan are hereby continued and restated as of July 1, 2001, for the benefit of such persons as are now or shall hereafter become entitled to the benefits of this Trust pursuant to the terms hereof, as follows to wit:
ARTICLE I - NAME
This Trust is to be known and designated as “Painters District Council No. 2
Vacation Plan and Trust.”
The Trust is accepted in the State of Missouri and all questions pertaining to its validity, construction and administration shall be determined in accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Missouri, except where determined under Federal law.
ARTICLE n - OBJECTIVE
This Trust is designed to provide Vacation benefits for Participants and their beneficiaries who are eligible to receive such benefits as defined in this Agreement, and any rules and regulations issued hereunder.
2
ARTICLE in - DEFINITIONS
The term “Participant” as used herein shall mean any person who is employed by an Employer which is bound by a collective bargaining agreement, or other agreement, to contribute to this Trust, in a position for which such contributions are required.
The term “Beneficiary” as used herein shall mean the person or persons entitled to payment of vacation benefits in the event of death of the Participant, as provided in Article X.
The term “Union” shall mean Painters’ Local Unions which are under the jurisdiction of Painters District Council No. 2, or the Painters’ District Council No. 2 itself.
The term Employer” shall mean any employer who has agreed in a current, existing written collective bargaining agreement to make contributions to this fund on behalf of its employees who are or may become Participants hereof for the purpose of providing and maintaining vacation benefits for its said employees. However, the Union and/or the pension, health and welfare and/or vacation trust funds maintained by Painters’ District Council No. 2 may also be included within the scope of the term “Employer,” as used herein, with regard to the employees for whom such entity has agreed to make contributions to the Trust Fund. In such event, the Union’s and/or the particular fund’s or funds’ status as an Employer shall be solely for the purpose of making the required contributions to the Trust Fund, and neither the Union nor any fund shall participate in the selection of any Employer Trustee.
The term “Trustees” as used herein, shall mean the Trustees as designated by the Parties hereto, together with their Successors.
3
The term “Fund” as used herein, shall mean the Painters’ District Council No. 2 Vacation Fund, which shall consist of all contributions received, together with income therefrom and any other property received or receivable and held by the Trustees for the uses, purposes and trusts set forth in this Vacation Plan and Trust Agreement.
ARTICLE IV	- EMPLOYER PARTICIPATION
When an Employer of one or more eligible Participants signifies his agreement to the Trustees in writing to pay for the benefits as specified herein, then the Trustees shall take the necessary steps to provide all eligible Participants of such Employer with the benefits.
ARTICLE V	- ELIGIBILITY
A Participant shall be eligible to participate herein immediately upon commencement of employment with an Employer who is party to a current, existing agreement in writing to make contributions to this Trust as defined in Article III on that employee’s behalf.
ARTICLE VI	- BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED
The Trustees shall provide vacation benefits, as stated in Article VII.
ARTICLE VP - EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS
Each contributing Employer who agrees in writing to contribute for the purpose of providing vacation benefits and executes an agreement subscribing to and being bound by the terms of this agreement, shall contribute the money per hour as shall be negotiated from time to time by Employers and the Union on behalf of Participants who shall be employed by contributing Employers as evidenced by Agreements from time to time between contributing Employers and the Union. Contributions shall be made for each hour worked by an eligible employee in his employment with Employer.
4
Such Employer payments to the Vacation Fund shall be made after the Employer first withholds from the Participant’s take-home pay all monies required by law to be withheld from wages, considering the payments to the Vacation Fund as part of the Participant’s wages.
Employer payments to the Vacation Fund shall be made weekly, not later than Friday of the week following the Employer’s pay period. Such payments shall be made at or transmitted to the office of the Vacation Fund. At the time of making such weekly payment each such Employer shall also furnish and deliver to the Trustees of the Vacation Fund, in writing, on a form provided for such purposes by the Trustees, a list showing all Participants who are employed by such Employer, and, with respect to those Participants for whose hours of work such Employer owes contributions as aforesaid to the Vacation Fund, such list shall also disclose the number of hours each such Participant has worked during the weekly period for which contributions are being made.
The liability of the Trustees to pay vacation benefits to eligible Participants shall be limited to the amount of hours worked each week as reported by the Employers of such Participants. The Trustees shall be authorized to accept as true, bona fide and accurate the number of hours worked each week by such Participants. It shall be the duty and obligation of each Participant eligible to receive benefits from the Vacation Fund to check and examine at the office of the Vacation Fund the reports, lists and payments made by his respective Employers on account of the number of hours such Participant has worked, in order to determine the accuracy and truthfulness thereof, and to report any mistakes, errors or false reportings of the number of hours he has worked for such Employers during the periods covered by such Employers’ reports and lists. Such Participant, in the event his records do not coincide with the reports
5
and listings of his Employer(s), shall immediately furnish the Trustees of the Vacation Fund with evidence of the actual number of hours he has worked for such Employer(s) during the period involved. If any eligible Participant shall fail to comply with the provisions of this Section, the amount of his earned vacation benefits shall be limited to the number of hours worked as reported by his Employer(s).
Participants eligible to receive Vacation Fund benefits, or their beneficiaries, shall not be entitled to receive nor shall they acquire or have any right, title or interest in or to any interest or dividends which may be received and credited to their accounts by any bank, savings and loan association or other depository of the monies belonging to the Vacation Fund. Such Participants and their beneficiaries shall be entitled only to the amount of contributions paid into the Vacation Fund by their respective Employers.
Employer contributions and the income earned thereon shall be held, deposited and invested for the sole and exclusive benefit of those entitled to the benefits of this Trust and to pay the benefits provided hereunder and the reasonable administrative and operating expenses of this Trust. If the Trustees in their sole and exclusive discretion determine that the assets of the Trust exceed the amount necessary to pay benefits to all eligible Participants and all administrative and operating expenses, then the Trustees in their sole and exclusive discretion may pay to the Participants the amount or a percentage of the amount of contributions which were obligated to be made on their behalf by contributing Employers but which were not remitted. The Trustees shall establish the terms and conditions of any such payment to the Participants employed by delinquent Employers and shall be the sole judges of the sufficiency of the evidence of a particular Participant’s entitlement to participate in such a payment. A Participant who receives a payment as described above shall
6
receive no further benefits for hours worked during the Plan Year unless and until amounts actually contributed on his behalf for that Plan Year exceed the amount of the payment.
ARTICLE Vm - NO REVERSION TO EMPLOYER
No part of the corpus or income of this Plan and Trust shall be (within the taxable year or thereafter) used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of the Participants or their beneficiaries, and no contributing Employers shall be entitled to receive back any part of their contributions to this Trust.
ARTICLE IX	- FISCAL YEAR AND PAYMENT OF BENEFITS
The fiscal year of the Plan and Trust shall be July 1 through June 30.
On December 10 (or the first regular workday thereafter if December 10 is not a regular workday), the Trustees shall pay to each Participant the sum of money which has been credited to his account for the year ending on the October 31 prior to that December 10. No partial withdrawals will be permitted at any time. However, the Trustees may provide for early payment of benefits in the event the Participant becomes permanently and totally disabled.
Prior to December 10, the Fund Office shall send a card in the mail notifying the Participant of his right to a Vacation Benefit and the amount of the contributions accrued to such Participant’s account. On this card, the Participant will indicate whether he would like his Vacation Benefit check mailed to him or whether he would like to pick it up in person at the Vacation Fund Office. The Participant will claim his benefits by signing the card and returning it to the Vacation Fund Office. No payment will be made to a Participant until the signed card has been received by the Fund Office. Payment shall be deemed delivered when deposited by the Trustees in the
7
United States Mail, First Class Mail Postage Prepaid, and addressed to the requesting Participant (or beneficiary, if applicable) at the address given by such Participant or beneficiary on the form described herein.
In the event a Participant or beneficiary fails to make a claim for benefits under this Trust within three years of the date on which such benefits first become payable, the Participant or beneficiary shall forfeit all rights to receive those benefits.
ARTICLE X	- PAYMENT TO BENEFICIARIES OF DECEASED EMPLOYEES
In the event of the death of any eligible Participant, the Trustees shall, immediately upon being notified of such death, demand from the Employer(s) of such Participant payment of all then unpaid Vacation Fund contributions earned by and due to such Participant’s Vacation Benefit Account, and such Employer(s) shall immediately, upon receipt of such demand, pay such unpaid contribution to the Trustees.
Entitlement to Vacation Benefits in the event of the death of the Participant shall be determined as follows: first, to the same beneficiary designated by such Participant and which designation is on file in the records of the Painters’ District Council No. 2 Welfare Plan, if any; and if no designation of beneficiary is contained in such file, then, second, to the spouse of such Participant, if living; and if such spouse has predeceased such Participant, then, third, to the child or children of such Participant, in equal shares; and if there is no child of such Participant living, then, fourth, to the legal representatives of such deceased Participant.
The person or persons entitled to receive such vacation benefits remaining unpaid to the Participant at the time of such Participant’s death, shall, as soon as reasonably possible after such death, make a written claim for the payment of the same on a form provided for that purpose by the Trustees (which such forms shall be
8
available at the office of the Vacation Fund), and shall accompany the same with a certified or photostatic copy of the death certificate of such Participant. After the expiration of seven (7) days following receipt of such form and death certificate at the office of the Vacation Fund, the Trustees shall pay such remaining vacation benefits to the person or persons entitled thereto in accordance with the above and foregoing priority schedule. Any person or persons entitled to the payment of the vacation benefits credited to or earned by an eligible Participant up to the time of his death shall be entitled immediately after such death to payment thereof by the Trustees, and shall not be required to wait until the 10th of December following such death before making such demand for payment or receiving the payment thereof. It is the intent and purpose of the next preceding sentence to provide, in cases of death of an eligible Participant, for as early closing of his Vacation Benefits Account as is reasonably possible.
ARTICLE XI	- FUNDS IN TRUSTEES* POSSESSION

10
surplus remains after payment of all expenses and all benefits due to Participants and beneficiaries, said surplus shall be paid by the Trustees equally to the then Participants of the fund.

Painters District Council No. 2 shall have the right to designate three (3) Trustees, and the Employers shall have the right to designate three (3) Trustees. However, irrespective of the number of Trustees designated or voting on a particular question, the voting power of the Union Trustees and Employer Trustees shall at all times be equal.
Any Trustee may resign by giving thirty (30) days’ notice in the United States Mail to the other Trustees and to the Board of intent to so resign. The Union may discharge any of the Trustees appointed by it, by giving thirty (30) days’ notice in the United States Mail of such intent to discharge.

The removal of a Trustee shall be automatic at the end of a thirty-day period of notification by either the Trustee or the Union or the Employers as described above of resignation or removal.
11
In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Union shall die, be incapable of acting hereunder, resign or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Union. In the event any of the Trustees selected by the Employers shall die, be incapable of acting hereunder, resign or be removed, a successor Trustee shall immediately be appointed by the Employers. Failure of the Union or the Employers to select a successor Trustee promptly shall not prevent the remaining Trustees from carrying on the affairs of this Trust.
A Fiduciary is the person who exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control representing the management or disposition of plan assets, renders any investment advice for a fee or other compensation, or exercises any discretionary authority or responsibility for plan administration. For purposes of this Plan, the Trustees are authorized to perform any of the above functions and shall be the Plan Fiduciaries. The Fiduciaries may act in one or more fiduciary capacity with respect to the Plan and may allocate to others certain aspects of the management and operation responsibilities of the Plan including the employment of investment (and other) advisors and investment managers and the delegation of any ministerial duties or functions to qualified individuals. Any delegation of duties, general investment powers, or other powers shall be evidenced by a document in writing that shall be filed with the records of the Plan.
The Trustees shall select one (1) of their number who will serve as Chairman, and one (1) to serve as Co-Chairman, and one (1) to serve as Secretary and one (1) to serve as Treasurer. The term of office for each office shall be one (1) year, or until an election is duly held, although the incumbent of any office may be re-elected. If the Chairman is an Employer Trustee, the Co-Chairman shall be a Union Trustee, and
12
vice versa. The Chairman, or in his absence the Co-Chairman, shall preside at meetings.
The Trustees may designate one (or more) Trustee as Managing Trustee, and may, from time to time thereafter, change such designation. In the event a Managing Trustee is designated, he may be delegated any of the following rights and powers, in the name of and in behalf of, all of the Trustees with full and binding obligation and effect upon all the Trustees, to-wit: to receive contributions, to open bank accounts, to sign checks, to pay insurance premiums, to keep records of receipts, disbursements and monies on hand and held in the Trust Fund, to keep records of all benefits provided Participants in the Vacation Fund, to hire such corporation or persons as may be required for the efficient administration of the Trust Fund, to purchase all supplies needed for the proper bookkeeping and proper administration of the Trust Fund and to expend from the Funds available, any money necessary for these purposes, to have the books of the Trust Fund audited annually, to have the books and auditor’s report available for inspection at all times by the other Trustees, Participants, officers of the Union and Employers, and to perform such other functions and duties of a purely ministerial nature as may be determined from time to time by the Trustees in the interest of the proper and efficient administration of the Trust. The Trustees shall further have the right to audit the books of a participating Employer when such is deemed necessary or desirable for the effective administration of the Trust. If no designation of a Managing Trustee is made, then all actions are to be taken in the manner provided herein unless otherwise properly delegated.
A quorum for the transaction of business shall consist of the presence at the meeting of at least four (4) Trustees, two (2) of whom represent Employers and two (2) of whom represent the Union. Decisions of the Trustees shall be made by majority
13
vote. If an unequal number of Employer and Union Trustees attend a meeting, the voting power of the group with fewer Trustees present shall be and stand increased to that of the group with more Trustees present so that there shall be equal voting strength between Employer and Union Trustees at all times at such meeting. A deadlock shall be deemed to exist whenever either of the following situations arise: (1) whenever a proposal, nomination, motion or resolution or other matter is voted upon and the votes cast are evenly divided and remain evenly divided; and (2) whenever a quorum is lacking at a meeting duly called and there shall be absent from said meeting two (2) or more Trustees of one group, and a majority of the Trustees present declare a deadlock due to the inability to obtain a quorum. In the event of such deadlock in either case arising, the Employer Trustees and the Union Trustees shall meet promptly for the purpose of agreeing upon an impartial umpire to break such deadlock by casting the deciding vote or deciding any dispute in question or matter under consideration. In the event of the inability of the Employer Trustees and Union Trustees to agree upon the selection of such impartial umpire, then such impartial umpire shall, on the petition of either the Employer Trustees or Union Trustees, be appointed by the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the district wherein the principal office of the Trust is located. The decision of any such impartial umpire shall be final and binding on the Trustees and all concerned.
The Trustees shall meet at least quarterly unless a quorum thereof shall agree in advance that there is no business to come before the meeting. Any two (2) Trustees may call a meeting of the Trustees at any time by giving at least five (5) days’ written notice of the time and place thereof to each Trustee; provided, however, that such notice need not be given to any member of the Board of Trustees who has expressly waived the service of such written notice upon him. Any meeting so called may be
14
postponed once for a reasonable period upon the request of any Trustee upon showing of justifiable cause therefor. Any meeting of the Trustees may also be held at any time without notice if all of the Trustees consent thereto in writing or if all attend and act. If all of the Trustees shall concur in writing upon any proposition, no formal meeting thereon need be held by Trustees. The Managing Trustee in the written notice shall notify the Trustees of the subjects to be discussed but this shall not be construed to limit any other subjects of discussion properly placed before the meeting.
The Trustees and Fund Office personnel may receive reimbursement for expenses properly and actually incurred in the performance of their duties with respect to this Trust, including but not limited to expenses incurred in attending educational conferences, seminars and meetings, provided that the Trustees determine in each case the subject matter of the conference, seminar or meeting is relevant to the administration of this Trust and that the expenses incurred are reasonable.
