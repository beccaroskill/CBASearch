ARTICLE 1 ACCESS
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	The parties acknowledge that it is in the union's interest that it be granted access to University facilities for the purposes of ascertaining whether the terms of this Agreement are being met; engaging in the investigation, preparation, and adjustment of grievances; conducting union meetings; explaining to bargaining unit members their rights and responsibilities under the Agreement; and informing bargaining unit employees of union activities. In the interest of facilitating these purposes, and in accordance with local campus/Laboratory/hospital procedures, the parties agree to this Article.
2.	The University has the right to enforce reasonable access rules and regulations as promulgated at each campus/Laboratory/hospital.
B.	ACCESS BY THE UNION/UNION REPRESENTATIVES - GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	Designated union representatives who are not University employees, or who are not employed at the facility visited, may visit the facility at reasonable times and upon notice to discuss with the University or bargaining unit members’ matters pertaining to this Agreement. In the case of visits for the purpose of conducting unscheduled meetings with bargaining unit members, the union representative shall give notice upon arrival in accordance with local campus/Laboratory/hospital procedures.
2.	UPTE will furnish the University with a written list of all UPTE representatives, UPTE-designated employee representatives and officers who are authorized by the union to conduct union business. This list shall be maintained in a timely manner by UPTE and any changes, additions or deletions to the list must be made in writing to the University.
3.	Such internal union business as membership recruitment, campaigning for union office, hand billing or other distribution of literature, and all other union activities shall take place during non-work time. Employee rest and meal periods are non-work time for the purposes of this Article.
C.	EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES
1.	The University shall recognize UPTE-designated employee representatives who are members of the bargaining unit. The function of the UPTE-designated employee representative shall be to inform employees of their rights under this Agreement, to ascertain that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are being observed, and to investigate and assist in the processing of grievances.
2.	For the purposes of receiving paid release time as provided in this section, UPTE may designate four (4) unit employees as “UPTE-designated employee representatives" at each campus/Laboratory/hospital. Additionally, in the event a campus/hospital/laboratory has more than 200 employees, UPTE may designate one additional UPTE-designated employee representative for each additional 100 bargaining unit members thereafter, up to a maximum of seven UPTE-designated employee representatives. UPTE shall not designate more than one UPTE-designated employee representative per department. For each additional 100 employees, or fraction thereof, in a department UPTE shall be allowed one (1) additional representative in that department.
- 1 -
a.	The total cumulative use of paid release time for the UPTE-designated employee representative shall be limited to ten (10) hours in any one (1) month. University-convened meetings pursuant to Article 10, Grievance Procedure, shall not be deducted from this block of time.
b.	The use of the maximum of ten (10) hours shall be for grievance-related activity such as:
1)	the initial hand-delivered filing of a grievance and the retrieval of University documents provided pursuant to a written request for information related to a grievance;
2)	one-on-one meetings with a grievant concerning a filed grievance, or an alleged violation of this Agreement which is at the Informal Review stage of ArticlelO - Grievance Procedure;
3)	meetings with the University representative to whom written grievances are presented or to whom documents related to filed grievances are presented/signed or with whom time limit agreements are achieved;
4)	Informal Review meetings held pursuant to §E. of Article 10 -Grievance Procedure.

d.	At its sole discretion, the University may authorize use of release time for more than ten (10) hours in a month per department. The exercise of this discretion and/or the enforcement by the University of the 10-hour maximum shall under no circumstances establish a precedent for the UPTE-designated employee representative or department involved nor shall the allowance of greater than ten (10) hours in a month for a UPTE-designated employee representative have any effect or bearing on the ability of the University to enforce the 10-hour maximum on any other UPTE-designated employee representative.
e.	Should a question of possible abuse of these release time provisions arise, the University will so notify UPTE, and the parties will attempt to resolve the matter. If a question remains, the University may take corrective action when warranted.
f.	In the event that release time granted under Section C.2.a above is not sufficient for the representative’s duties and additional time is not granted under Section C.2.d above, the employee representative may elect to use vacation time in accordance with Article 43, Vacation, or leave without pay in accordance with Article 17, Leaves for Union Business.
D.	MEETING ROOMS AND BULLETIN BOARDS

E.	MAIL DELIVERY
United States mail which is received by the University bearing an employee name and accurate address will be placed in the employee mailboxes in the normal manner. In departments where employee mailboxes exist, the union shall have reasonable use of them. In departments where individual mailboxes are in a restricted work area, UPTE may make arrangements with the responsible University official in the restricted work area to have the UPTE mail placed in the employee mailboxes.

The Union agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the University of California (including its subdivisions and employees) from any claim, suit or liability of any nature arising from (a) a challenge to this Section; or (b) any action of the Union taken pursuant to, or in violation of, this Section. The
- 3 -
Regents will give the Union prompt written notice of any claim, suit or liability which it contends is subject to this provision.

8.	LBNL
The Laboratory shall continue to provide its monthly list and change list on a weekly basis.
G.	PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION OF AGREEMENT

Failure to select the arbitrator within forty-five (45) calendar days, or to achieve a written extension of the time period, will render the appeal to arbitration ineligible for further processing and the University's Step 3 answer will be considered final.
6.	If UPTE initiates the selection process in writing to the University with a preferred arbitrator from the arbitration panel and there is no written University response by the deadline for selection of the arbitrator (45 days from UPTE’s appeal to arbitration), then the UPTE choice shall be final unless UPTE initiates the selection process within 15 business days of the deadline for selection of the arbitrator. In such case, the University shall have 15 business days to respond to UPTE’s choice of an arbitrator and
- 9 -
the period for scheduling the arbitration hearing shall be extended by 10 business days.
7.	All arbitrability disputes, substantive or procedural, shall be subject to arbitration under this Article including disputes arising from University claims that UPTE has lost the right to pursue arbitration of a pending grievance because of untimely processing or that the grievance is ineligible for further processing.
8.	The process set forth herein to pursue an arbitrability hearing when the University claims that UPTE has failed to select an arbitrator in a timely manner shall be the exclusive process for such purpose, superceding and/or replacing any other claimed process.
9.	When the University refuses to proceed to arbitration on a grievance on the grounds that UPTE has failed to participate in the selection of arbitrators in a timely manner as required by Article 3, Section D.5., of the contract, only UPTE will make a demand for arbitration of that issue in writing to the Office of the President within 30 days of the postmark of the campus notification to the union that the case is ineligible for further processing.
E.	SCOPE OF ARBITRATION
1.	Unless there is an agreement by both parties to modify the scope of the hearing, the issue(s) to be heard by the arbitrator shall solely and in its entirety be restricted to the issue(s) stated by Step 3. Issues or allegations which were known or should have been known to either party but not introduced by the Step 3 process shall not be introduced by either party at the arbitration hearing, except as provided in Section E.2., below.
2.	When practicable, the University shall inform UPTE in writing of its intent to assert the issue of arbitrability prior to the selection of the arbitrator in its Acknowledgement of Receipt, according to A.8.b above. The issue(s) of arbitrability shall be resolved in a hearing prior to and separate from the hearing (if any) about the substantive facts and/or allegations in dispute, except as provided in Section E.3., below. In such case the parties shall use the selection process described in Section D. above to select two arbitrators. The first arbitrator will be selected to hear the issues of arbitrability and the second arbitrator will be selected to decide the merits of the case if the issues are determined to be arbitrable. Unless either party requests a full and complete arbitration proceeding on the arbitrability issue, the first arbitrator shall issue either a bench decision, or upon either party’s request, a written decision with 7 calendar days of the completion of the arbitrability hearing. In the event that the first arbitrator, as a result of the hearing referenced above determines a matter to be arbitrable, the first arbitrator shall have no authority to decide the issues pursuant to the merits of the case. A hearing on the merits of the case will be scheduled with the second arbitrator, unless the parties agree otherwise.
3.	If, following the University's acknowledgement of UPTE's appeal to arbitration in A.8.b, the University raises for the first time issue(s) of arbitrability a single hearing on the issue of arbitrability and the substantive facts will be held, unless the parties agree otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the grievance to be not arbitrable, the substantive facts of the case need not be heard and the grievance shall be denied. If the arbitrator finds in favor of arbitrability, the hearing shall proceed to the substantive issues raised.
4.	Section E.1. and Section E.2. above, shall not prevent the parties from agreeing in writing to combine the arbitrability hearing with the hearing on the merits of the case.
- 10 -
5.	If the union requests a postponement of the scheduled arbitration hearing following the University's raising issue(s) of arbitrability, the hearings on arbitrability and facts, if any, shall be separate, and the provisions of Section E.3. above, shall apply.
F.	ARBITRATION PROCEEDING
1.	The parties will attempt to agree on a location for the arbitration hearing.
2.	The arbitration hearing shall be closed to anyone other than the
participants in the arbitration hearing, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing.
3.	The arbitration hearing shall provide an opportunity for UPTE and the University to examine and cross-examine witnesses under oath or affirmation, and to submit relevant evidence.
4.	Settlement offers made any time during the Grievance and/or Arbitration Procedure shall not be introduced as evidence in the arbitration hearing.
5.	Either or both parties may, at their discretion, file briefs with the arbitrator. The order and time limits of briefing shall, on a case by case basis, be as agreed upon by the parties or as specified by the arbitrator. Briefing time limits shall be extended by the Arbitrator upon the agreement of both parties.
6.	The arbitrator shall consider the evidence presented and render a written decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the close of the record of the hearing.
7.	In all cases appealed to arbitration pursuant to the terms of this Article and this Agreement, UPTE has the burden of initiating the steps in the procedure. With the exception of those cases in which the issue is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article 7 - Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal, UPTE shall have the burden of proof. The burden of proof in cases in which the issue is that of actions taken by the University pursuant to Article 7 - Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal, shall be the University's.
8.	Prior to the hearing, the parties may endeavor to exchange the names of known witnesses and relevant materials to be introduced at the hearing.
G.	AUTHORITY OF THE ARBITRATOR
1.	The arbitrator's authority shall be limited to determining whether the University has violated the provision(s) of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, amend, modify, nullify or ignore in any way the provisions of this Agreement and shall not make any award which would, in effect, grant UPTE or the employee(s) any terms which were not obtained in the negotiation process.
2.	The arbitrator shall have the authority to subpoena documents and to require the attendance of witnesses upon the reasonable request of either party but not upon his/her own motion.
3.	The expense of service and appearance fees, if any, shall be borne entirely by the party requesting the subpoena of witnesses and each party shall, in advance of the hearing date, inform the other party of the identity of witnesses it subpoenaed.
4.	The arbitrator shall have the obligation of assuring that all necessary facts and considerations are brought before her or him by the representatives of
- 11 -
the parties at the hearing. In all respects s/he shall assure that the hearing is a fair one. The arbitrator shall be the sole judge of the relevancy and materiality of the evidence and testimony offered. The arbitrator may receive and consider evidence but shall give appropriate weight to any objections made. All documents to be considered by the arbitrator shall be filed at the hearing, or within the post-hearing time lines agreed to by the parties during the hearing.
H.	ARBITRATION REMEDIES
1.	No remedy by an arbitrator with respect to any grievance which shall be submitted to her/him shall in any case be made retroactive to a date earlier than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the filing of the Step 1 grievance, except for the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment of wages. For grievances involving the correction of mathematical, calculation, recording or accounting errors relating to the payment of wages, an award of an arbitrator shall not in any case be made retroactive to a date earlier than three (3) years prior to the initiation of the written grievance in Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure. Additionally, no remedy shall be provided for any period of time during the grievance and/or arbitration procedure for which an extension of time limits has been granted at the request of UPTE; any period of time between the date a hearing was originally scheduled to be held, and due to a request from UPTE to postpone or change the scheduled hearing, the rescheduled date of the hearing; or any time an employee was on strike.
2.	In any decision of a grievance appealed to arbitration involving retroactive payments, the appropriate University and UPTE representatives shall expeditiously determine the identity of the payees and the specific amount owed each payee. Such amount of payment shall be final and no employee or group of employees may subsequently grieve the amounts owed.
3.	Remedies involving monetary payment and/or credit shall be limited in their calculation to the utilization of the employee's actual and appropriate wage or benefit amount at the time of the violation and shall not include the awarding of interest or any other payment/credit unrelated to a University benefit amount or the employee's hourly wage.
4.	Upon the motion of either party, or at his or her own discretion, an arbitrator may retain jurisdiction in cases involving an award of retroactive monetary payment and/or credit.
5.	If the grievance is sustained in whole or in part, the remedy shall not exceed restoring to the employee the pay, benefits or rights lost less any compensation from any source, including but not limited to Workers' Compensation, Unemployment Compensation or other employment.
I.	COST OF ARBITRATION
1.	The cost of the arbitrator and expenses of the hearing will be shared equally by the University and UPTE. If either party requests that a stenographic record of the hearing be made and/or transcripts of the stenographic record or a taped record be provided, the parties shall equally share the entire cost of such service and the cost of the provision of a transcript to each party and the arbitrator.
2.	In the event either party requests the cancellation or postponement of a scheduled arbitration proceeding which causes an arbitrator to impose a cancellation or postponement fee, the party requesting such cancellation or postponement shall bear the full cost of the cancellation/postponement fee. In the event the parties agree to settle or postpone the arbitration during
- 12 -
the period of time in which the arbitrator will charge a cancellation/postponement fee, the parties will equally bear the cost of the fee, unless the parties agree otherwise.
J.	PAY STATUS
1.	The grievant, as defined in Article 10, Grievance Procedure, Section A.5.a., (one [1] grievant in a group grievance) shall be in a without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status at the arbitration hearing.
2.	The University and UPTE shall establish a reasonable schedule for witness(es)' testimony at the arbitration proceeding. Employee witnesses who appear at the arbitration hearing at the request of UPTE shall be in a without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status for the time spent actually giving testimony or waiting to testify in accordance with the established schedule. Every effort shall be made by UPTE to avoid the presentation of repetitive witnesses.
3.	Total release time for the grievant, employee representative and witness(es) for travel to/from the hearing and for participation in the hearing shall not exceed either their normally scheduled hours of work for the day(s) of the hearing or their actual participation in the hearing. Participants shall travel to/from the hearing via the most expeditious method of transportation available.
4.	Not more than one employee representative will be released in without-loss-of-straight- time-pay status for attendance at any one (1) arbitration hearing.
5.	The University shall not be responsible for any lodging, travel expenses or other expenses incurred by grievants, witnesses, employee or UPTE representatives with regard to the union's presentation in the arbitration hearing.
K.	EXPEDITED ARBITRATION
The parties may agree to use an expedited form of arbitration, to be agreed to by the parties and the arbitrator.
L.	ARBITRATION PANEL
1.	The parties will make an attempt to agree on the panel of thirty (30) arbitrators, with fifteen (15) on a Northern Panel, and fifteen (15) on a Southern Panel. Nothing shall preclude the parties from including an arbitrator on both the northern and southern lists. If agreement cannot be reached on the names of the arbitrators on each list, the remaining number of arbitrators needed to complete a panel will be selected alternately by the parties. The party selecting first shall be determined by a flip of a coin.
2.	After one (1) year from the date the panel members were initially selected, and annually thereafter, each party shall have the right to eliminate up to one (1) arbitrator from the panel. A party exercising this right shall notify the other party in writing of the name of the arbitrator to be stricken from the panel.
3.	In replacing arbitrators who were eliminated from the panel, the procedure in Section L.1. shall be used again but any arbitrator eliminated in Section L.2. above, may not be placed back on the panel until at least one (1) year from the date on which such arbitrator was stricken.
4.	In the event one (1) vacancy in the panel of arbitrators occurs, other than the elimination of an Arbitrator by the parties pursuant to Section L.3., above, such vacancy may be filled by the parties within thirty (30) calendar
- 13 -
days, using the procedures in Section L.1. and 2. above, if the parties agree that a replacement is necessary. In the event more than one vacancy in the panel of arbitrators occurs, such vacancy shall be filled by the parties within thirty (30) calendar days by using the procedures in Section L.1. and 2. above, unless both parties agree that no replacement is necessary prior to the annual panel review.
5.	The northern list of arbitrators shall be used for arbitrations arising at the Davis, the Office of the President, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, San Francisco, and Santa Cruz locations, unless the parties agree to use an arbitrator from the southern panel. The southern list of arbitrators shall be used for arbitrations arising at the Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, Irvine, Riverside, and San Diego locations, unless the parties agree to use an arbitrator from the northern panel.

ARTICLE 4 UNIVERSITY BENEFITS
A.	GENERAL CONDITIONS
1.	Eligible employees may participate in a number of retirement, medical, dental and other benefits generally available to other eligible staff employees of the University. The University may, at its option during the term of this Agreement, alter its health and welfare benefit programs and/or retirement system benefit plans. Such alterations include, but are not limited to altering eligibility criteria, establishing new coverage, altering or deleting current coverage, altering employee and University rates of contribution, or changing the carrier for established benefits. In the event the University makes such alterations, the changes will apply to employees eligible for benefits within the unit in the same manner as they apply to other eligible staff employees at the same campus/laboratory. The sole exceptions to the above shall be 1) any alterations proposed by the University which affect only bargaining unit employees, and 2) any alterations proposed by the University which reduce retirement benefits of bargaining unit employees. In such cases, the University agrees to meet and confer with respect to the proposed change.
2.	For the life of this Agreement, the University's maximum monthly rates of contribution for bargaining unit employees who are eligible for and elect to enroll in a health plan shall be the same as the contribution rates for such benefits for other staff employees.
3.	Costs that exceed current University contributions, and employee costs for benefits to which the University does not contribute, are to be paid by unit employees, normally through payroll deduction.
- 15 -
B.	EFFECT OF ABSENCES FROM WORK ON BENEFITS
1.	Temporary Layoff/Temporary Reduction In Time/Furlough
Health plan contributions by the University will be provided for unit employees, in accordance with Section A.3, above, when the employee is affected by the following conditions lasting up to 4 months: a temporary layoff; a temporary reduction in time below the hours required to be eligible for health benefits; or a furlough. For health benefits to remain in force, employees on temporary layoff or furlough must comply with the terms of the applicable benefit documents, rules and/or regulations.
2.	Military Leave
An eligible employee on military leave with pay for emergency National Guard duty or Military Reserve Training Leave shall receive those benefits related to employment that are granted in the University’s Military Leave policy and its related documents.
3.	Leaves Of Absence Without Pay
a.	Approved leave without pay shall not be considered a break in service and, except as provided in Section 3.c., below, shall not determine eligibility for benefits except that the regulations of the retirement systems determine the effects of such leave without pay on retirement benefits.
b.	Except as provided in Section 3.c., below, an eligible employee on approved leave without pay may, in accordance with the benefit documents, rules and regulations, elect to continue University-sponsored benefits for the period of time specified in the benefit documents, rules and regulations.
c.	An employee on an approved Family Care and/or Medical Leave shall be entitled, if eligible, to continue participation in health benefit coverage (medical, dental, and vision) as if on pay status for a period of up to twelve (12) workweeks in any 12-month period. However, an employee who exhausts her entitlement to health benefit coverage while on an approved Pregnancy Disability Leave that runs concurrently with federal Family and Medical Leave, shall not be entitled to an additional 12 workweeks of health benefit coverage under the State Family Care and Medical Leave Act. Other group insurance coverage and retirement benefits shall be continued in accordance with the provisions of the applicable group insurance and retirement system regulations.
C.	ENUMERATION OF UNIVERSITY BENEFITS
1.	For informational purposes only, a brief outline of benefits in effect on the date the Agreement is signed is found in Appendix C. UPTE understands and agrees that the descriptions contained in Appendix C do not completely describe the coverage or eligibility requirements for each plan, the details of which have been independently communicated to UPTE.
2.	Specific eligibility and benefits under each of the various plans are governed entirely by the terms of the applicable Plan Documents, custodial agreements, University of California Group Insurance Regulations, group insurance contracts, and state and federal laws. Employees in an ineligible classification are excluded from coverage, regardless of appointment percent and average regular paid time. For details on specific eligibility for each program, see the applicable documents, agreements, regulations, or contracts.
- 16 -
D.	JOINT BENEFITS COMMITTEE
The University and UPTE will establish a Joint Benefits Committee that will meet at least four times annually to discuss employee benefits. The Joint Benefits Committee will review benefits plans prior to their finalization with benefits providers.
1.	The University will provide information on specifications, cost, usage, surveys and evaluations of benefits plans.
2.	UPTE will provide responses, identify problems and issues and any union evaluations or surveys of benefits plans.
3.	The University will grant release time for up to four career employees, not more than one per campus/lab/hospital to participate in this committee. Release time is without loss of straight time pay and will allow for reasonable travel time.
E.	REDUCED FEE ENROLLMENTS

2.	For an employee on the semester system, the reduced fee limit is six units or two regular session University courses, whichever is greater.
ARTICLE 5
CAMPUS/LABORATORY CLOSURE
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
Consistent with the University's management rights, including its right to determine the orderly, effective and efficient operation of the University, the University may elect at one (1) or more of its locations including the Laboratory, to curtail or shut down some or all of its activities, on a location-by-location basis, for periods of specific duration. By way of example and not limitation, such periods may represent: opportunities for energy/cost savings; adjustments to reduce levels of work activity due to transition periods in the academic calendar; "seasonal" or "holiday" influences on scheduled work activities; the occurrence at or on University facilities of major public events; and/or the occurrence of emergency or "forces of nature" situations adversely affecting normal University operations. When feasible, the University shall provide UPTE and affected members of the bargaining unit with forty-five (45) calendar days advance notice of a closure. In the event an alleged violation of the notice is grieved/arbitrated, any remedy or arbitrator's award or decision acknowledging improper notice shall be limited to an amount of back pay and/or reinstatement of benefits which would make the employee whole for the number of days the notice was deficient.
- 17 -
B.	PAY STATUS
During a total or partial closure or curtailment of operations described in Section A., above, whether or not the University is able to anticipate such event, one or a combination of the following pay-status options may apply to affected employees.
1.	Employees may elect to use accumulated vacation leave during the closure period. Newly-employed unit members will be allowed to use accrued vacation even if the required six (6) continuous months or quadriweekly cycles on pay status have not been completed. Employees without sufficient accrued vacation time will be allowed to use up to three (3) days vacation leave prior to actual accrual.
2.	Employees may elect to use accrued compensatory time to cover the scheduled time off or to offset the use of vacation time.
3.	Employees who do not use vacation or compensatory time off may elect to take a leave without pay during the closure. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 43, Vacation, and Article 39, Sick Leave, if an employee is in leave-without-pay status due to a location closure which is three (3) consecutive days or less in duration, such a full-time or part-time employee shall continue to accrue vacation and sick leave at her/his normal rate.
C.	UNPAID STATUS
Employees who do not select from Section B1., 2., or 3., above or who do not qualify for Section B1., 2., or 3., above, shall, for the period of time necessary, be placed in a leave-without-pay status. The hourly accrual provisions in Section B.3. above, related to location closure(s) shall also apply to employees who are placed in leave-without-pay status.

1.	Range Structure Adjustment
Following receipt of written notification from UPTE of its ratification of the Agreement with the University of California, the University will increase by 1.5% the salary ranges for classifications in open ranges and by .50 % the salary ranges in step based ranges in the Research Support Professionals Unit effective October 1, 2002 as follows. The salary range or rate adjustments, if any, for each classification will vary slightly due to rounding.
Employees at the minimum of the salary range for their classification will receive an adjustment to the extent that the new range minimum exceeds their present rate.

a.	Step-based Employees
1)	Each eligible step-based employee shall receive a .50% salary increase.
2)	The University will provide step-based employees a within-range one-half step merit increase, effective October 1, 2002 or the closest bi-weekly pay period. Eligible employees are career employees who have at least six months of service in a career appointment as of October 1, 2002, who are not at
- 18 -
the maximum step or higher, and whose performance is satisfactory or better.
b.	Open-range Employees
1)	Effective October 1, 2002 or the closest bi-weekly pay period, eligible career employees and limited appointment employees will receive a 1.5% within range increase.
B.	2003-04 SALARY INCREASES (EXCEPT LBNL):
If the University proposes salary changes to affect the entire bargaining unit for 2003-04, it shall provide notice to UPTE and meet and confer the proposed changes.
C.	2004-05 SALARY INCREASE (EXCEPT LBNL)
1.	The University will implement a step structure of 2% steps for all openrange employees in the unit, effective July 1, 2004. Placement on steps will be to the amount equal to then-current salary or the next highest step.
2.	The new step-based structure will be calculated at 2% intervals within the ranges. The parties recognize that the actual salary range for each classification will vary slightly due to rounding.
D.	CAMPUS INDIVIDUAL / TITLE-SPECIFIC RESEARCH UNIT INCREASES
SAN FRANCISCO SRA I
Increase the salary range by 1% effective 1/1/04.
RIVERSIDE SRA I
Increase the salary range by 1% effective 1/1/04.
E.	ELIGIBILITY
1.	To be eligible for increases as specified in this Article employees must be in the bargaining unit, or on approved leave, on the effective date of the salary increase.
2.	An employee must have been in the unit for at least six months and remain in the unit on the effective date of a merit increase to be eligible to receive a merit increase as described by this Article.
F.	ORDER OF INCREASES
If more than one salary adjustment takes place on the same date, actions occur in the following order:
1.	Salary range adjustment;
2.	Merit Increases
3.	Increases resulting from promotion or reclassification.
G.	Within 90 days of implementation of the salary increase for each year of increases, the University will report to UPTE the results of contracted pay distribution on a campus-by-campus basis. The parties agree to the following mechanism to ensure that this is accomplished:
1.	The University will provide to UPTE a location-by-location roster of all employees for the pay period immediately following each year’s base wage adjustments. The roster will show the name, classification, department, percentage of time, date of hire, and regular monthly pay for each
- 19 -
employee on pay status for the effective pay period and the aggregate regular pay for all employees for the month or pay period.
2.	The University will provide to UPTE an additional roster, showing the same information, for the month or pay period preceding each year’s salary increases and the total aggregate regular monthly pay for the roster in Section G.1 above.
3.	Both rosters shall be supplied to UPTE within 60 days of the date that the contract year’s increases are paid at each campus.
4.	The difference between the total aggregate regular pay in the two rosters at each campus shall be calculated. If the first roster indicates a total pay increase of less than the salary allocation percentage for the pay period, the amount underspent shall be distributed across-the-board to the base of non-step based career employees up to the top of their ranges. This distribution shall take place no later than 90 days following the provision of the rosters to UPTE. However, if the amount of resulting back pay as a result of the distribution at any campus is less than $7.00 per merit-eligible employee, the University shall notify UPTE and the parties shall attempt to agree on any further distribution.
5.	The University will provide notice to UPTE in October of each contract year its determination of the total increases spent on wages for employees in the unit during the previous contract year.

1.	Fiscal Year 2003 (October 1, 2002) individual increases for Research Professional Unit employees will be from a merit pool of 3.5% of the July 31, 2002 payroll base. The salary ranges will be increased by 3.5%. 1.0% will be made available for promotions and reclassifications. This 3.5% will be distributed in the Lab’s normal merit-based manner using the attached FY03 matrix. In order to be eligible for the FY 2003 salary increase of October 1, 2002, an employee must be in the RX bargaining unit on July 31, 2002, eligible for a performance evaluation, and continue to be in the bargaining unit on the date payroll for the distribution is run.
Up to 1.5% of the July 31, 2002 payroll base for Sequencing Specialists and Sequencing Leads will be made available for equity increases for employees in those job titles. These increases will be effective October 1, 2002. In order to be eligible for an equity increase, an employee must be in the affected job titles on July 31, 2002, eligible for a performance evaluation, and continue to be in the affected job titles on the date payroll for the distribution is run.
Retroactive pay increases for Fiscal Year 2003 will be implemented within ninety (90) days of contract ratification. No separate paychecks will be issued.
The Laboratory will provide to UPTE information concerning the promotion and reclassification allocation within thirty (30) days following the payroll distribution. Such information will include employee name and wage increase amount. Any undistributed portion of this allocation will be
- 20 -
distributed, as a non-base building lump sum payment, in a merit-based manner within ninety (90) days following the end of the fiscal year. No separate paychecks will be issued. The methodology for effecting this merit-based distribution will be determined by the Lab. Upon UPTE’s request, the Laboratory agrees to meet and discuss this merit-based distribution methodology.
2.	Fiscal Year 2004 (October 1, 2003) individual increases for Research Professional Unit employees will be from a merit pool of 3.0% of the July 31, 2003 payroll base. The salary ranges will be increased by 3.0%. 1.0% will be made available for promotions and reclassifications.

In order to be eligible for the FY 2004 salary increase of October 1, 2003, an employee must be in the RX bargaining unit on July 31, 2003, eligible for a performance evaluation, and continue to be in the bargaining unit on the date payroll for the distribution is run.
The Laboratory will provide to UPTE information concerning the promotion and reclassification allocation within thirty (30) days following the payroll distribution. Such information will include employee name and wage increase amount. Any undistributed portion of this allocation will be distributed as a base-building increase in a merit-based manner within ninety (90) days following the end of the fiscal year. The methodology for effecting this merit-based distribution will be determined by the Lab. Upon UPTE’s request, the Laboratory agrees to meet and discuss this meritbased distribution methodology.
3.	Disputes arising from Research Professional employees receiving increases less than the matrix minimum for the appropriate quartile and performance rating are subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions of the agreement between the University of California and University Professional and Technical Employees, effective August 20, 1999, with the following exceptions:
a.	Employees who have received increases within the preceding six months.

Employees who have reached the maximum of their ranges or who are “red-circled” will be eligible to receive increases in the form of a non basebuilding lump sum payment.
5.	The Laboratory will provide to UPTE information concerning the normal distribution method. Such information will include employee name and wage increase amount. In the same manner as in previous fiscal years, any undistributed amount of the above merit increases will then be distributed across the board to all employees who received a wage increase based on the above eligibility requirements.

ARTICLE 13
HOURS OF WORK
A.	EXEMPT EMPLOYEES
1.	A workweek for full-time exempt employees is normally considered to be 40 hours, and for part-time employees the proportion of 40 hours equivalent to the appointment percentage; however, greater emphasis is placed on meeting the responsibilities assigned to the position rather than on working a specified number of hours. Exempt employees do not receive overtime compensation or compensatory time off. After extended periods of additional time worked or an unusually heavy workload, supervisors may approve employees' requests for a temporary reduction in work schedule with no loss in pay.
B.	NON-EXEMPT EMPLOYEES
1.	Standard Workweek
A workweek is a period of time consisting of seven consecutive days. A standard workweek is from Monday morning (12:01 a.m.) to midnight the
- 38 -
following Sunday. Alternate workweeks (beginning and ending on a day other than the above) may be scheduled by the University.
2.	Standard Work Schedule
A work schedule is the normal hours of work for an employee within a workweek. The standard work schedule for full-time employees shall be eight hours per day on five consecutive days excluding meal periods.
3.	Schedules
Employees will be made aware of their work schedule in the following manner:
a.	When practicable, the University will provide an employee with at least five-work days’ notice prior to changing the employee’s work schedule for a period of less than four workweeks duration.
b.	When practicable, the University will provide an employee with at least 15-work days’ notice prior to changing the employee’s work schedule for a period of at least four workweeks duration.
c.	Employees who do not have fixed work schedules will be made aware of their work schedule when feasible.
d.	Employees may request and the University may, at its sole non-grievable discretion, grant employee requests for flexible working hours.
4.	Alternate Work Schedules may be established by the University to ensure adequate staffing and coverage to meet operational requirements. An employee may request an alternate work schedule. In the event the University decides to abolish, establish or change alternate work schedules in work areas, the University shall inform affected employees and UPTE at least 30 calendar days prior to taking such action.
5.	Meal Periods
A meal period of at least one-half hour is provided for any work period of six continuous hours or more. Meal periods are neither time worked nor time on pay status. Whenever an employee is required to perform work or is not substantially relieved of work-related duties during a meal period, the meal period shall be considered time worked. The University may reschedule an employee's meal period during the work day when operational needs preclude relieving the employee of work-related duties during the originally scheduled meal period; however, regularly scheduled meal periods shall normally be provided.
6.	Rest Periods
a.	Two rest periods of 15 minutes shall normally be granted during an eight-hour or a 10-hour work period. Three rest periods of 15 minutes shall normally be granted during a 12-hour shift. A part-time employee shall normally be granted one 15-minute rest period for each work period of three continuous hours or more, not to exceed two rest periods per day.
b.	Operational requirements may restrict the granting of rest breaks.
c.	Rest periods shall not be taken at the beginning or end of a work
period or accumulated for use at a later time. The combining of rest
- 39 -
periods with meal periods for some, any or all employees of a department/division shall be at the discretion of the University.
7.	Changing And Clean-Up Time
The University shall determine when clean-up time is required. When the University requires that the employees must change into or out of protective clothing, or must engage in special washing or cleaning procedures, the time spent in such activities shall be considered as time worked.
8.	Assignment Of Overtime
a.	The University shall decide when overtime is needed. Overtime must be approved in advance by the University. As soon as practicable after the need for overtime is determined, the University shall notify the employee that overtime must be worked. Employees are expected to work overtime when such work is assigned.
b.	The University will assign overtime work by rotation based on departmental seniority of those employees on the same shift who normally perform the work involved. For purposes of this Article, rotation means that the last employee to work overtime will be the last considered for new overtime assignments. For the purposes of this Article, departmental seniority may be defined by each department at the campus/hospital/laboratory. Such seniority is applied in the following manner:
1)	When there are employees volunteering to work the overtime, assignment of that overtime shall be based on greatest seniority, provided the employee(s) have the required skills, knowledge and ability to do the job.
2)	When no employee volunteers to work the overtime, assignment of that overtime shall be based on inverse order of seniority, provided the least senior employee has the skills, knowledge and ability necessary to perform the job.
c.	The University shall assign overtime to employees irrespective of their place on the seniority or rotation list(s) when the necessary skills, knowledge or abilities are not possessed by the employee who would otherwise be assigned in accordance with the above provisions.
9.	Overtime Definition
Overtime is time actually worked that exceeds 40 hours in a workweek. For the purposes of calculating overtime, actual work does not include time in non-work status such as sick leave pay, vacation pay, holiday pay, military leave, compensatory time off and administrative leave with pay. Overtime hours do not count toward accumulation of sick leave, vacation, holiday or retirement system credit. Overtime hours are not compensated at one and one-half times the straight time rate unless the conditions described in §B.10. below, are met.
10.	Overtime Compensation
At the option of the University, overtime shall be compensated at the appropriate rate either by pay or by compensatory time off, if the department offers a compensatory time program, in accordance with this section.
- 40 -
a.	Unless the employee and the University agree otherwise, overtime will be paid. An employee may, upon hire and thereafter during the month of June, file a written indication of preference for either compensatory time off or pay with his or her immediate supervisor. The University shall grant the preference indicated.
b.	Compensatory time shall be paid or scheduled by the University in accordance with departmental needs. Accumulation of compensatory time is limited to a maximum of 240 hours. An employee shall be paid for hours of overtime which exceed this limit in accordance with location practice. An employee may request to schedule the use of compensatory time. An employee's request for the scheduling of compensatory time shall be granted subject to the needs of the University and shall not be unreasonably denied.
c.	Employees in classes designated as non-exempt in Appendices A. and B. of this Agreement are eligible for overtime at one and one-half times the straight-time rate (OT(P)) Code (N) shall be compensated at the straight-time rate for hours of overtime not exceeding 40 hours of actual work in a workweek and shall be compensated at one and one-half times the straight-time rate only for those overtime hours which exceed 40 hours of actual work in a workweek.
d.	When an employee is employed at more than one rate of pay, overtime earned at the time-and-one-half rate may be calculated based on the employee's average hourly rate or based on the rate in effect when the overtime is worked, at the option of the University.
11.	Call-Back
When an employee is called back to work after completing a work day and leaving the premises, the employee shall be paid for the time actually worked upon return or a minimum of three hours, whichever is greater. Call-back time, whether worked or not, is considered time worked for the purpose of calculating hours of overtime.
12.	On-Call
The University retains the right to determine the need for, and the assignment of, on-call time. An employee is not considered in on-call status unless assigned on-call by the University. Employees in on-call status are required to inform the employer how they can be reached or to carry a pager in order to receive a call to work. An employee in on-call status is not eligible for minimum call-back payments. An employee in on-call status who is called to perform work or to return to the work site will be paid at the regular rate of pay for the time worked. Payment for on-call time paid at the on-call rate is included as part of compensation in calculating the regular rate when determining premium overtime pay.
a.	Unrestricted on-call is time during which an employee is free to engage in activities for their own purposes but is required to be available for work or timely return to the work site when called to work. Time in unrestricted on-call status is not counted as hours worked or time on regular pay status when employees are not required to be at the work location or to actually perform work from a location other than the work location. Unrestricted on-call will be compensated at the on-call rate, as listed in Appendix A.
b.	Restricted on-call is time during which the employee is required to restrict personal activities so that time cannot be effectively used for their own purposes. Restricted on-call will be considered hours
- 41 -
worked and will be paid at the employee's normal pay rate (or overtime if appropriate).
c.	If the University proposes to establish an on-call rate for a title in the unit at a location where no rate is listed, the University shall meet and confer with UPTE. When employees in this unit at the location are assigned to work on-call, they shall be paid according to Appendix A. Current on-call rates where established will remain the same for the duration of this contract.
13.	Travel Time
Travel between an employee's home and the workplace is not considered time worked. Travel on University business during an employee's normal working hours (including travel during those hours on the employee's day off) is considered time worked. Travel outside normal working hours is considered time worked when it occurs on a scheduled day of work and is to or from a work location outside the normal commuting area of the assigned workplace.
C.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	This Article shall not be construed as a guarantee of or limitation on the number of hours per workday or workweek.
2.	There shall be no duplication, pyramiding, or compounding of any premium wage payments in this Agreement.
3.	The University will provide notice to UPTE (at UCSD) after the research ships return if any bargaining unit members were required to work more than 12 hours consecutively in a 24-hour period.
D.	LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY
Policies and procedures, definitions, qualifications, calculations, covered hours and rates relative to Hours of Work at the Laboratory shall remain in effect for employees at the Laboratory and shall supersede the provisions of this Article in §A. through §B., above. In addition, Appendix B. for employees at LBNL applies to Shift Assignments and associated pay and is incorporated into this Agreement and Article by reference.
ARTICLE 14 INDEMNIFICATION
Pursuant to and as regulated by the terms, limitations and qualifications of California Government Code 995 et seq., the University of California shall provide the defense and indemnification for University employees within the unit covered by this Agreement who are sued on account of acts or omissions arising from the course and scope of their employment with the University. The provisions of and applications of the Indemnification provision are not subject to Article 10 - Grievance Procedure or Article 3 - Arbitration Procedure of this Agreement.

If, due to operational considerations, the University cannot accommodate the employee’s request for an alternate return date, he/she will be considered to have resigned effective on the date provided in the notice in Section C.1., above.
2)	Notice of a change in temporary layoff dates does not invoke the ‘pay in lieu of notice’ provisions of this Article.
2.	Conversion Of Temporary To Indefinite Layoff

D. INDEFINITE LAYOFF
The University shall effectuate indefinite layoffs as follows:
1.	Alternatives To Layoff
a.	In order to avoid a layoff, the University may reassign an employee to a position for which the employee is qualified at the same or greater percentage of time and at the same or higher rate of pay. Such action will nullify the layoff.
b.	The University may institute the State of California Work Sharing Unemployment Insurance Program on each campus/laboratory/hospital where applicable.
- 45 -
2.
Selection For Layoff
a.	The order of indefinite layoff of employees in the same classification within the unit of layoff shall be in inverse order of seniority. In the event all employees in a unit of layoff are equally affected by layoff of ten percent (10%) or less, seniority provisions do not apply.
b.	"Seniority" is calculated by full-time-equivalent months (or hours) of University service. Employment prior to a break in service shall not be counted. When employees have the same number of full-time-equivalent months (or hours), the employee with the most recent date of appointment shall be considered the less senior employee.
c.	The University may retain employees irrespective of seniority who possess special knowledge, skills, or abilities which are not possessed by other employees in the same classification in the layoff unit and which are necessary to perform the ongoing functions of the department. If an employee with less seniority is to be retained, the University shall notify the union in advance of the layoff date and in writing of the special knowledge, skills and abilities which support the retention of the less senior employee.
d.	The department head shall select employees for layoff, but shall minimize indefinite layoffs from career positions by first reviewing the necessity for existing limited appointment and casual/restricted positions within the department.
e.	Where electronic job placement bulletin boards are in use, the University shall provide bargaining unit members access to such placement bulletin boards to the same degree as such bulletin boards are made available to other staff employees. Employees who are laid off will be provided information about other University location’s job placement bulletin boards according to local procedures.
3.	Notice
a.	When the University identifies particular employees to be affected by an indefinite layoff, it shall give individual written notice of the effective date of the layoff to each affected employee and the union. Advance notice will be provided as follows:
1)	For indefinite layoff, the University shall give 60 calendar days’ notice, if feasible. The University may pay up to 30 days of the 60 day notice period in lieu of notice. In no event shall an employee receive less than 30 calendar days’ notice of indefinite layoff or pay in lieu of notice. For conversion from temporary layoff to indefinite layoff, the University shall give 30 calendar days’ notice, if feasible.
b.	An employee shall be provided all rights under Section D.4. and D.5., below, beginning at the time of notification of his/her indefinite layoff.
c.	An employee shall receive at the time of layoff information on how to activate preference and recall rights according to local campus/hospital/Laboratory procedures. Eligible employees must indicate an interest in and eligibility for the specific preference and/or recall rights. If the employee requests information about preference, recall and active, vacant openings, the University will provide the information about how to access related job opening
- 46 -
information. The University will, upon the employee’s employment application, confirm the eligibility for preference or recall and will assess the employee’s qualifications.
4.	Recall
a.	Career employees who are indefinitely laid off shall have a right to be recalled in order of seniority of those employees applying for recall to an active, vacant career position for which the employee is qualified in the same classification and department from which they were laid off. An active career position is a position which the University, in its sole discretion, determines to fill. The eligible employee shall file a timely application for recall and self-identify that they are eligible for recall.
b.	Career employees who are eligible for recall shall retain recall eligibility based on the amount of University service at the time the layoff occurs as follows:
1)	For one year for up to five years’ University service,
2)	For two years for up to 10 years’ University service,
3)	For three years for more than 10 years’ University service.
c.	Employees recalled from layoff status who are not returned to their same job and who fail to perform satisfactorily, as determined by the University, may at any time during the six months following such recall be returned to layoff status with restoration of the unused portion of their recall rights.
d.	The right to recall terminates at the end of the eligibility period.
5.	Preferential Rehire
a.	A non-probationary career employee who is indefinitely laid off shall have preferential rehire status for an active, vacant career position. An active career position is a position which the University, in its sole discretion, determines to fill. The eligible employee shall file a timely application for preference and self-identify that they are eligible for rehire preference according to this section.
b.	Such employees are rehired provided:
1)	the active, vacant career position is in the same bargaining unit and at the same campus/hospital/laboratory as the position from which the employee was laid off; and
2)	the active, vacant career position is in a class with the same or lower salary range maximum as the class from which the employee was laid off; and
3)	the active, vacant career position is at the same or lesser percentage of time as the position from which the employee was laid off, except as provided in Section D.6.
c.	The laid off non-probationary career employee will, along with any other qualified laid off University employees, be given preferential consideration for an active, vacant career position which is being filled by the campus/hospital/laboratory, provided the conditions in Section D.5.a.1-3 above are met. Qualified laid off University employees will be interviewed for the position. In order to be placed in such a position, the employee must be fully qualified to perform the duties of the position.

Employees who are eligible for preferential rehire status with ten (10) years or more seniority shall retain preferential rehire status eligibility for three (3) years. An employee may exercise her/his rights to preferential rehire immediately after the employee receives written notification of layoff and meets with the campus/hospital/laboratory representative designated in the layoff notice.
e.	Employees preferentially rehired from layoff status who fail to perform satisfactorily may, at any time during the six (6) months following such return, be returned to layoff status with restoration of full preferential rehire status. In addition, an employee, at her/his option, may request to be returned to layoff status within sixty (60) calendar days of rehire. The time on job status will not be counted as part of preferential rehire eligibility time.
f.	According to local procedures, employees who are on layoff status and who indicate an interest in University-offered training classes will be offered classes when there are spaces available after the location’s deadline for active employees to sign up.
g.	Preferential Rehire Termination
The preferential consideration described above shall terminate at the end of the period of eligibility described in Section D.5.c. above, or if an employee:
1)	refuses an offer to return, at the same or greater percentage of time, to that department/division and class from which laid off; or
2)	accepts any career position; or
3)	refuses two (2) offers of employment for a career position at the same or higher salary level and the same percentage of time as the position held by the employee at the time of layoff;
6.	If an employee voluntarily reduces her/his time due to budgetary reasons, curtailment of operations, lack of work, reorganization, or redefinition of the University's or department's needs within one (1) year prior to her/his layoff, the employee is entitled to recall/rehire rights to a percentage appointment equal to that from which the employee voluntarily stepped down. In order to be eligible for such increased recall/rehire rights, the employee must submit to her/his supervisor a written statement confirming the offer for the voluntary reduction in time when the voluntary reduction in time occurs and her/his supervisor must approve the voluntary reduction in time.
7.	Severance - Effective July 1, 2003 through the Duration of the Agreement, but in any case, no later than June 30, 2005.
Career employees who receive their notice of indefinite layoff may elect either a) or b) below within 14 calendar days. If the employee does not timely elect either a) or b), and notify the University according to local procedures, the employee will be determined to have elected b.
- 48 -
a.	A career employee who has received her/his notice of indefinite layoff may elect, in writing, to receive severance pay in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights with reduced severance, within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt of the notice of layoff. Election is irrevocable. Each campus department shall, in each instance of layoff, not reduction in time, offer severance in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights with reduced severance to all employees in the department affected by the layoff. Beginning April 1, 2004, employees who are reduced in time may elect only severance pay (proportional to their reduction in time) in lieu of preferential rehire and recall rights. Severance pay shall be in accordance with the following:
1)	Employees who elect severance pay in lieu of preference/recall with reduced severance shall be paid a lump sum amount of one week (5 workdays, based on 8-hour days) of salary for each full year of service from the most recent break in service, up to a maximum of 16 weeks of base pay.
2)	Employees who are laid off following a reduction in time that occurred within 60 calendar days of the layoff notice shall be eligible for severance, or reduced severance, on the basis of their percentage of appointment just prior to their reduction in time.

c.	UPTE will be notified if an employee has been provided severance or reduced severance. Should, as a result of a grievance, arbitration, or settlement agreement an employee be returned to work, related to the layoff, the severance or reduced severance received will be deducted from the back pay award, if any, or credited as an advance on earnings, if proportional severance is to be returned. An employee cannot be returned to work without first repaying the severance or reduced severance or signing a severance repayment agreement. The employee's failure to complete her/his severance repayment obligation shall not increase the University's back pay liability, if applicable.
d.	When an employee is rehired to a career position before the expiration of the number of weeks for which the employee has received severance payments, he or she will be required to pay back the remaining severance amounts as a condition of employment. The repayment will be on a proportional basis if the rehired position is a different percentage than the original appointment.
If a career employee is rehired after previous layoff and severance payment and then subsequently laid off again, he/she may be eligible for additional severance based on employee’s election in Section D.7 for the severance-eligible layoff. The employee’s previous layoff election of severance or preference and recall with reduced severance will remain the same for any additional layoff action that occurs and the employee may be eligible for an additional severance based on the following:
1)	Option 1 (break in service upon original layoff) - employee is eligible only for severance based on service credit earned after break in service.
2)	Option 2 (no break in service) - employee is eligible for severance repaid by employee plus severance based on additional service credit.
E.	CONTINUITY OF SERVICE UPON REEMPLOYMENT
1.	A layoff of one-hundred twenty (120) calendar days or less does not create a break in service.
2.	Reemployment in a career position within the period of right to recall or preferential rehire does not create a break in service.
3.	Seniority accrues, and benefit accruals are accumulated, only when an employee is on pay status.

This does not prevent the Laboratory from disciplining an employee whose violation of this policy rises to the level of misconduct under the terms of Article 7, Corrective Action/Discipline and Dismissal.
Records of parking violations and any related parking sanctions that may be imposed shall not be included in the employee's personnel file. However, copies of disciplinary actions for violations of this policy that rise to the level of misconduct will be placed in the employee's personnel file as in the case of any other disciplinary action.

A.	DEFINITION
Performance Evaluation is a constructive process to acknowledge the performance of a non-probationary career employee.

The employee shall receive the written request and the document(s) back.
d.	Upon the employee's written request, counseling memoranda and/or written records of discussions will be removed from the employee's personnel file if there have been no other such memoranda relating to, or disciplinary action on, the same or similar issue(s) for a two-year period.

ARTICLE 34
RELEASE TIME FOR BARGAINING
A.	UPTE shall designate as a bargaining team member for the unit not more than one active status bargaining unit employee per campus, for a total of 11 bargaining team members from the bargaining unit. UPTE shall provide in writing the names of the designated permanent members of its bargaining team to the Office of Labor Relations at least 30 calendar days prior to the first scheduled bargaining session. In the event any designated member is to be permanently replaced, the name of the permanent replacement shall be communicated in writing to the Office of Labor Relations. The Office of Labor Relations shall acknowledge in writing the newly designated permanent replacement, and inform the appropriate work location. Such notification of a permanent replacement shall be made to the Office of Labor Relations two workweeks prior to the first scheduled bargaining session to be attended by the replacement employee. Designated team members who are members of the bargaining unit may be released from their work assignments without loss of straight-time pay to attend scheduled bargaining sessions. Alternates or substitutes for any of the designated team members may be permitted when UPTE has provided the University with the name and work location of the replacement at least two weeks in advance of the date of the change, unless the parties agree to a shorter notice period.
B.	No more than a total of nine bargaining unit employees shall be in without-loss-of-straight-time pay and benefits status for attendance at scheduled bargaining sessions for the unit, including reasonable travel time to attend bargaining sessions. Without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status shall be provided only for bargaining sessions, and only for the days which the unit member would have
- 85 -
been scheduled to work had the unit member not been released from his or her work assignments to attend scheduled bargaining sessions. The hours for which any of the designated union bargaining team members are in without-loss-of-straight-time-pay status shall not exceed the bargaining team member's actual scheduled work hours for any one day of a scheduled bargaining session and shall not exceed 40 hours per week. Time in without-loss-of-straight-time status for the purpose of bargaining shall not count in the calculation of overtime, and will not result in any double payment for the hours in such status. Deviation from this paragraph may be made only by mutual agreement of the parties on a case-by-case basis.
C.	Bargaining sessions are defined as the pre-scheduled face-to-face meetings and related caucuses during meeting days, for the purpose of negotiating terms and conditions of an Agreement. If no meeting actually takes place during the scheduled meeting day as the result of the University's unavailability to appear at the bargaining table, or the University agrees that a full-day union bargaining team caucus is necessary to the bargaining process, the University may designate a day without a face-to-face meeting as a "bargaining session."
D.	An employee designated as a bargaining team member for the unit shall provide his or her supervisor with written notice of their intent to attend scheduled bargaining sessions as soon as practicable following the scheduling of bargaining sessions. A bargaining team representative may be denied release time for bargaining, either in paid or unpaid status, if the supervisor is not provided at least 14 calendar days prior notice of the team member’s need for release time, unless the parties agree to a shorter notice period.
E.	UPTE shall provide an attendance roster at the end of each bargaining session.
F.	Reasonable travel time means actual travel, via the most expeditious method of transportation available, to and from scheduled bargaining sessions for the designated employees.
G.	Attendance by a bargaining team member at scheduled bargaining sessions shall constitute fulfillment of the employee’s work obligation for that day.
H.	The University shall make a good faith effort to modify a bargaining team member's work schedule in order to accommodate his or her participation in bargaining sessions.

employee in a timely manner normally within 72 hours and in conformance with appropriate sections of the Labor Code. Retirement compensation shall be provided pursuant to retirement plan regulations.
B.	JOB ABANDONMENT
Failure to report to work as scheduled for five (5) consecutive work days may be treated by the University as an employee's job abandonment resulting in her/his resignation:
1.	In the case of job abandonment, the University shall provide the employee with written notification of its intent to separate her/him. This notification shall include the reasons for the separation, the employee's right to respond to the University within fourteen (14) calendar days, and a Proof of Service. The notification shall be sent to the employee's last known mailing address.
2.	The employee shall have fourteen (14) calendar days from the mailing of such notice to respond to the University prior to her/his separation.

The official must have the authority to effectively recommend reinstatement of the employee.
3.	Following the employee's timely response, or if no response was provided within fourteen (14) calendar days, the decision of the designated University official is not subject to the grievance and/or arbitration provisions of this Agreement.

In addition, members of the bargaining unit shall treat officers of the University with dignity and respect in all interactions.
B.	Nothing in this Article shall be construed to change established University policies and practices about political expression and/or freedom of speech; nor shall anything in this Article impede normal expression in labor-management communications. A University wide Labor/Management meeting shall develop an understanding of application of the above stated limitations for purposes of this Article, in addition to developing the meaning of "dignity and respect" for purposes of this Article.
C.	Any complaints arising from this Article Sections A. and B. above, shall be grievable only through step two of the grievance process.
ARTICLE 37 SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this Agreement is found to be contrary to law by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be of no force or effect; but the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

A.	ACCUMULATION OF SICK LEAVE CREDIT
1.	If a campus implements the Factor Accrual System, an eligible employee shall earn sick leave credit at the rate of .046154 hours per hour on pay status, including paid holiday hours but excluding all paid overtime hours.
2.	If a campus uses the Table Accrual System, an eligible employee shall earn sick leave credit at the rate of eight hours per month for full-time employment.

4.	An employee must be on pay status for at least one-half of the working hours of a month or quadri-weekly cycle to earn sick leave credit for that month or quadri-weekly cycle. Time on pay status in excess of a full-time work schedule does not earn sick leave credit. Sick leave is earned during leave with pay. For the purposes of this Agreement, a quadri-weekly cycle is defined as two bi-weekly pay periods designated by the University to be considered as one unit for the purpose of leave accrual.
5.	For employees on either system, earned sick leave for each month or quadri-weekly cycle is credited on the first day of the following month or quadri-weekly cycle, except that proportionate sick leave credit for an eligible employee who is separating from employment shall be credited at the completion of the last day on pay status.

d.	Exempt employees - Except as provided in Article 18, Leaves of Absence, records of sick leave used shall be recorded in one day increments only or in increments of not less than that portion of a day during which an employee on less than full-time status is normally scheduled to work.

1.	No sick leave pay shall be payable to an employee unless the employee's immediate supervisor or designee is notified of the illness/disability and the probable duration thereof as soon as possible, but in no event later than the beginning of the employee's work day except when the University determines that the employee's failure to notify is due to extreme circumstances beyond the control of the employee. Subsequent to an employee's notice of illness/disability, no time for which the employee has requested and/or received sick leave authorization may be charged to accumulated/anticipated compensatory time, leave with pay, vacation, or holiday time, except as provided in Article 18 - Leaves of Absence.
2.	Any employee who anticipates a series of three or more medical appointments which will require a repeated use of sick leave, or who knows in advance the date and/or time of scheduled appointments, shall inform his or her immediate supervisor of the anticipated or known schedule of treatment.

- 90 -
c.
the employee has been given advance written notice that documentation will be required.
4.	Employees who have unscheduled absences due to illness on a scheduled work day preceding or following a holiday may be required to bring a medical verification of illness to the employee's supervisor on the employee's return to work in order for the absence to be authorized.

In the event no RFP is issued and the subcontract will result in bargaining unit employee layoffs, the University will give at least sixty (60) calendar days notice prior to the commencement of work by the contractor.
2.	Prior to the commencement of the work that has been subcontracted and following receipt of a timely request from UPTE, the University shall meet with UPTE to discuss the effects of subcontracting upon bargaining unit employees who may be laid off. Failure to conclude such discussions, if any, prior to the date on which the subcontracted work begins, shall not preclude the University from implementing the subcontracting on the date agreed upon by the University and the subcontractor or the layoff of employees pursuant to Article 16, Layoff and Reduction in Time.
B.	DISPLACEMENT OF EMPLOYEES
1.	Except as provided below, the University of California will not contract out services that result in the layoff of non-probationary career bargaining unit employees.

- 92 -
b.	The need to obtain special expertise or efficiencies that are better provided through an outside contractor than by the University; and

The office of the President shall make the final determination as to whether the contract meets the conditions in Section B. The Office of the President decision is not grievable or arbitrable.
C.	EFFECT OF CONTRACT ON EMPLOYEES
To minimize the effects of layoff, when a non-probationary career bargaining unit employee is notified of layoff because the University entered into a contract for services that the employee performed, the University will make available another bargaining unit position for which the employee is qualified. The position will be at the same campus/hospital/Laboratory from which the employee was laid of. Where the provisions in this article are inconsistent with the provisions of Article 16, Layoff and Reduction in Time, the provisions of this Article and Section shall control.

- 93 -
E.	Nothing in this article shall be interpreted as prohibiting action, which must be taken to establish or maintain eligibility for any federal program, contract or grant - including the contract requirements contained in the agreement between the University and the Department of Energy - where ineligibility would result in a loss of federal funds to the University of California.
ARTICLE 41 TRANSFER/PROMOTION/RECLASSIFICATION

1.	If a campus implements the following Factor Accrual System, an eligible employee shall earn vacation credit each month or quadri-weekly cycle based on the number of hours on pay status for that month or quadriweekly cycle at the following rates:
Years of Qualifying Service	Per Hour on Pay Status*	Approximate Yearly Earning**	Maximum Accumulated Balance
Less than 10	0.057692	15 days	240 hours
10 but less than 15	0.069231	18 days	288 hours
15 but less than 20	0.080769	21 days	336 hours
20 or more	0.092308	24 days	384 hours
* Hours on pay status, including paid holidays, but excluding all paid overtime hours.
** Full time rate.
2.	For campuses retaining the Table Accrual System, an eligible employee shall earn vacation credit each month based on the number of hours on pay status for that month at the following rates:
a.	10 hours per month for a full-time employee with less than 10 years of qualifying service;
b.	12 hours per month for a full-time employee with at least 10 but less than 15 years of qualifying service;
c.	14 hours per month for a full-time employee with at least 15 but less than 20 years of qualifying service; and
d.	16 hours per month for a full-time employee with 20 years or more of qualifying service.
3.	Earned vacation for each month or quadri-weekly cycle is credited on the first day of the following month or quadri-weekly cycle, except that proportionate vacation credit for an eligible employee who is separating from employment shall be credited at the completion of the last day on pay status.
4.	Employees in titles formerly covered by the Administrative & Professional Staff Program (A&PS) as of November 1, 1997, shall continue to accrue vacation under the A&PS schedule until whichever event occurs first: a break in service of four or more months, or transfer out of the unit. Upon return to University service after a break in service of four or more months, or to the unit from a position outside the unit, such an employee shall earn vacation in accordance with §A.1. or 2., above.
5.	Should the University adopt a vacation accrual schedule for nonrepresented staff employees that provides for higher accrual rates at an earlier date in the employee’s University career than stated in this Article, members of the RX bargaining unit identified in §A.4., above, except for those employed at LBNL, will also be eligible for the revised vacation accrual rates on the same effective date to the same extent as the revised policy for non-represented staff employees.
- 97 -
B.	ELIGIBILITY
1.	An employee is eligible to earn vacation credit from the date of hire, prorated in accordance with §A., above, if appointed at 50% or more of fulltime for a period of six months or more. An employee who is not eligible to earn vacation because of a part-time or short term appointment becomes eligible to earn vacation after six continuous months or quadri-weekly cycles on pay status at 50% time or more. For the purposes of this Article, a month of qualifying service is a month of service at one-half time or more and a quadri-weekly cycle is defined as two bi-weekly pay periods designated by the University.
2.	An employee does not earn vacation credit for time on pay status in excess of a full-time work schedule.
C.	VACATION SCHEDULING
1.	An employee may request vacation.
2.	The University has the sole discretion to approve or disapprove vacation requests. Vacation requests shall not be unreasonably denied. An approved vacation request shall not be unreasonably canceled.
3.	Vacation leave requested by an employee will be scheduled in accordance with the University's operational needs and departmental procedures. Departmental procedures which restrict an employee's ability to schedule vacation shall be based on operational needs.
D.	VACATION LEAVE RECORDS
1.	Exempt employees - Except as provided in Article 18, Leaves of Absence, records of vacation used shall be recorded in one day increments only or in increments of not less than that portion of a day during which an employee on less than full-time status is normally scheduled to work. When an exempt employee has exhausted all accrued vacation, salary shall not be reduced for absences of less than one full day or less than that portion of a day during which an employee on less than full-time pay status is normally scheduled to work.
2.	Non-exempt employees - Records of accrued vacation usage shall be maintained to the nearest quarter (1/4) hour.
E.	VACATION CREDIT USE
An employee may use accrued vacation upon completion of his or her probationary period. No vacation shall be used prior to the time it has accrued, except as provided in Article 5 - Campus/Laboratory Closure.
F.	VACATION MAXIMUMS
1.	A full time employee shall not accrue vacation in excess of the maximum of two times the employee's annual accumulation. A part-time employee shall accrue vacation to a pro-rated maximum number of hours as a full-time employee with comparable years of service.
2.	Sixty days prior to an employee accruing the maximum amount of vacation, the employee shall be given notice that the maximum accrual will be reached. The employee must request the scheduling of vacation prior to the employee reaching the maximum accrual. If the employee's request to use such accrued vacation is denied due to operational considerations, that employee shall have an additional four months within which the employee must take the vacation to bring his or her vacation accruals
- 98 -
below the maximum. Normal vacation shall continue to accrue during the additional four-month period.
G.	VACATION PAY
1.	Pay for accumulated vacation shall be at the employee's straight-time rate, including any shift differential paid to employees permanently assigned to a shift which provides a differential.
2.	An employee who separates from employment or who is granted extended military leave shall be paid for any accumulated vacation through the employee's last day of work, except that an employee who is retiring may use accumulated vacation up to the effective date of retirement.
3.	An employee released during his or her probationary period shall be paid for accrued vacation time.
H.	TRANSFER OF VACATION CREDIT
An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted to another position at a University campus in which vacation credit can be accumulated shall have any accumulated vacation credit transferred, unless such transfer is in conflict with the terms covering the new position. An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted to a position at a campus in which vacation credit does not accumulate shall be paid for any accumulated vacation at the time of transfer. An employee who is transferred, promoted, or demoted to or from a Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory position shall be paid for any accumulated vacation at the time of transfer.
I.	DONATIONS FOR CATASTROPHIC LEAVE
Any Research Support Professionals Unit employee may participate in a campus/hospital/laboratory's Catastrophic Illness/Injury Leave program, if any, in accordance with the provisions of that location's program.
ARTICLE 44 WAIVER
A.	The University and UPTE acknowledge that:
1.	During the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each party had the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any subject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining;
2.	This Agreement constitutes the entire contract arrived at by the parties after the exercise of that right and opportunity;
3.	This Agreement supersedes and replaces the specific rights and/or procedures set forth under the various personnel programs and policies, which previously applied to employees covered by this Agreement.
B.	As a result of the acknowledgments in Section A, above, the University and UPTE agree that, for the term of this Agreement, each voluntarily and unqualifiedly waives the right, and each agrees that the other shall not be obligated to bargain collectively with respect to any subject or matter referred to, or covered within this Agreement, or with respect to any subject or matter not specifically referred to or covered by this Agreement, even though such subject or matter may not have been within the knowledge or contemplation of either or both of the parties at the time they negotiated or signed this Agreement.
- 99 -
C.	Notwithstanding Section B above, the articles in this contract may be reopened for negotiation at any time by mutual agreement of the parties.
ARTICLE 45
WORK-INCURRED INJURY OR ILLNESS
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
This Article defines the application of sick leave and vacation for employees who are unable to work due to a work-incurred injury or illness compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act, and provides extended sick leave benefits for such employees when sick leave is exhausted and employees are still unable to work because of such injury or illness.
1.	An employee unable to perform the normal duties of her/his job due to a work-incurred illness or injury compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act may be granted leave for the duration of a verified disability but not to exceed twelve (12) months or a predetermined date of separation, whichever comes earlier.
2.	Work-Incurred Injury or Illness Leave runs concurrently with Family Medical Leave.
3.	An approved leave of absence for work-incurred illnesses or injuries shall not be considered a break in service.
4.	Employees who are unable to work due to a work-incurred injury or illness compensable under the California Workers' Compensation Act are eligible to use accrued sick leave and vacation as provided below. When sick leave is exhausted and when employees are still unable to work because of such illness or injury, employees may use extended sick leave or leave without pay as provided below.
5.	An employee shall notify her/his supervisor of the need for leave for a work-incurred injury or illness, or any extension of such leave, as soon as practicable after the need for such leave or extension is known. This notification shall include written medical certification of the need for such leave or extension, and the anticipated return to work date.
B.	EXTENSIONS OF WORK-INCURRED INJURY OR ILLNESS LEAVE
In the event an employee requires an extension to her/his work-incurred injury or illness leave, s/he shall provide the University with a statement from her/his licensed health care practitioner of the need for the extension and the anticipated return to work date.
1.	Such a statement must be provided ten (10) calendar days prior to the date the employee was previously scheduled to return to work.
2.	In the event prior notice is not provided, the University will not pay extended sick leave to the employee for the period between the previously scheduled return date and the date the statement is received.
C.	RETURN FROM WORK-INCURRED INJURY OR ILLNESS LEAVE
1.	Prior to returning to work, an employee granted a work-incurred injury or illness leave must provide the University with a statement from her/his licensed health care practitioner of the employee's ability to return to work. When possible, an employee granted a work-incurred injury or illness leave must provide the University with ten (10) calendar days notice of her/his ability to return to work. If a return to work specifies restrictions, the
- 100 -
University will consider what accommodation, if any, will reasonably be made.
2.	If the position held has been abolished during the leave, the employee shall be afforded the same considerations which would have been afforded had that employee been on pay status when the position was abolished.
D.	SUPPLEMENTAL SICK LEAVE AND VACATION
1.	An employee who accrues sick leave and vacation shall be permitted to use accrued sick leave and vacation to supplement temporary disability payments received under the California Workers' Compensation Act.
2.	Sick leave and vacation payments shall be the difference between the amount payable to the employee under the Workers' Compensation Act and the employee's regular salary. The additional payment made to an employee to provide the employee with full salary prior to receipt of disability payments shall be deemed an advance temporary disability payment within the Workers' Compensation Act.
3.	An employee who receives advance temporary disability payment shall reimburse the University for such payment. The reimbursement is used to restore proportionate sick leave and vacation credit as appropriate.
E.	EXTENDED SICK LEAVE
1.	An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and who has exhausted all accrued sick leave shall receive extended sick leave payments from the University in an amount equal to the difference between the payments from Workers' Compensation and eighty percent (80%) of the basic salary plus any shift differential which the employee would have received. If such an employee returns to part-time University duties, the earnings plus any temporary disability payments, if less than eighty percent (80%) of basic salary plus shift differential, shall be supplemented to eighty percent (80%) by extended sick leave payments, provided the employee continues to be medically authorized for Workers' Compensation temporary disability. Total extended sick leave payments shall not exceed twenty-six (26) weeks for any one injury or illness.
2.	An eligible employee who does not have sufficient accrued sick leave to cover the three (3) calendar days waiting period for receiving Workers' Compensation payments shall receive extended sick leave payment to cover any part of the waiting period not covered by sick leave. Payment shall be made only after determination that the injury or illness is compensable under Workers' Compensation.
3.	An employee who elects not to use all sick leave is not eligible for extended sick leave benefits.
F.	EFFECT ON PAY STATUS
1.	Supplemental Leave
An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and supplemental sick leave or vacation as described in Section D. above is considered on regular pay status for purposes of application of provisions of this Agreement, except completion of the probationary period. Sick leave and vacation accrued during this period may be used as soon as they accrue.
- 101 -
2.
Extended Sick Leave
An employee who is receiving temporary disability payments and extended sick leave benefits as described in Section E. above is considered to be on regular pay status for purposes of application of provisions of this Agreement, except completion of the probationary period. Sick leave and vacation accrued during this period is credited to the employee only upon return to work. However, if an employee separates without returning to work, the employee shall be paid for vacation accrued during the period the employee received extended sick leave payment.
3.	Leave Without Pay
An employee on leave without pay and receiving temporary disability payments accrues sick leave and vacation on the same basis as if regularly employed, but such accrual is credited to the employee only upon return to work. If an employee separates without returning to work, no payment shall be made for such vacation credit.
G.	SEPARATION
An employee shall not use vacation, sick leave, or extended sick leave to supplement Workers' Compensation payments beyond a predetermined date of separation or leave without pay. Any vacation credit remaining on the date of separation shall be paid on a lump-sum basis.
H.
LIGHT DUTY
Subject to operational considerations and budgetary constraints, the University will endeavor, on a case by case basis, to modify duties consistent with documented medical restrictions, for employees who have experienced work related injuries. This section shall not be construed as a guarantee of a specific form of accommodation nor shall accommodation in one case establish a precedent for similar or dissimilar circumstances.
ARTICLE 46 WORK RULES
A.	GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.	The University has the sole right to promulgate, supplement, alter, modify, amend, and rescind, work rules. For the purposes of this Article, work rules are defined as rules promulgated by the University which regulate employees relative to and affecting their employment. Work rules may be implemented only for reasons of bona-fide business and/or health and safety necessity.
2.	For the purpose of general definition under this article, work rules shall be understood to mean rules governing work determined by the University to be required for the purpose of ensuring the orderly and efficient operation of the University and for ensuring the health and safety of employees and others.

B.	NOTICE
At least forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the implementation of new or changed work rules, the University shall inform UPTE. Upon receipt of a written request from UPTE received within thirty (30) calendar days of notice, the campus/hospital/laboratory shall meet and discuss the proposed work rules with UPTE prior to the proposed implementation date. The University shall provide
- 102 -
responses to alternatives suggested by UPTE. Such responses shall be in writing if requested by UPTE.
C.	APPLICATION AND GRIEVABILITY
1.	The University will reasonably enforce its work rules for employees during working hours and/or when they are on University premises. The University may implement work rules governing employees during nonworking hours only for reasons of health and safety necessity.
2.	In the event the University's enforcement/application of its work rules is inconsistent with any portion of this article, a grievance may be filed in accordance with the provisions of Article 10, Grievance Procedure, and appealed to Arbitration in accordance with the provisions of Article 3, Arbitration Procedure of this Agreement.
3.	In the event the application of a work rule is appealed to arbitration, the Arbitrator shall have no authority to newly fashion or to modify the work rule, although s/he may consider the reasonableness of the grieved work rule when rendering her/his decision and related remedy.

APPENDIX E
LBNL DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING
A. Position-related programs are directly related to the work assignments or conditions of the employee’s current position. In improving performance or mastering responsibilities in the present job, the supervisor takes the lead by identifying development objectives along with corresponding action plans. This is done in conjunction with the employee performance evaluation process. All career employees are eligible for position-related programs. Employees in non-career appointments are eligible for position-related programs only when such training is specifically necessary for such employees to perform their respective assignments.
B.	Career-related programs are related to the development of skills, knowledge, and other qualifications that prepare an employee for other positions within the Laboratory for] which an employee (as evaluated by the supervisor, department head, and Human Resources Operations Manager or designee) might be an effective competitor. In career planning and development, the employee takes the lead by self-assessing skills, values, career interests, and choices. After completion of the self-assessment, the employee discusses with the supervisor areas of interest to be developed. The supervisor is encouraged to act as the coach and advisor to the employee, helping to map out agreed-on developmental objectives along with corresponding action plans. All career employees are eligible for career-related programs. Employees in non-career appointments are not eligible for career-related programs.
C.	Educational enrichment programs are related to an employee’s personal or career interests outside the Laboratory that are not related to Laboratory positions for which an employee might be an effective competitor. For example, a course such as music would be considered an educational enrichment program. Educational enrichment programs are the employee’s responsibility and are not eligible for benefits under this policy.
D.	Attendance at all courses, seminars, and conferences of an instructional nature given by accredited universities and colleges, institutes, professional associations, and commercial training organizations is considered part of the Laboratory’s education and training activities and may be part of a formal employee development plan. For administrative purposes, attendance at scientific meetings, professional society meetings, research conferences, and industrial conventions and shows is considered a work assignment and is not necessarily part of a development plan.
E.	Every career employee is eligible to request a formal development plan. A formal development plan is developed by the employee and his/her supervisor and should be realistic and state job or career goals that are attainable within the Laboratory’s job classification structure. Plans should be structured so that completion of the development program should result in greater employee capability. Formal plans often include a time frame longer than one year. When an employee takes three or more Laboratory-supported courses or training programs in a fiscal year, the development plan must be formalized by using the Employee Development Plan form. At a minimum, the plan should include developmental objectives and corresponding action plans for improving or mastering performance in the current position, qualifying for other Laboratory positions, or obtaining a specific degree or specialty certificate of value to the Laboratory's mission.
F.	On-Site Training:
A division director or department head is responsible for arranging specialized training with a department or division. Assistance or advice in any phase of a desired program may be obtained from the Training Administrator in the
- 126 -
	Human Resources Department. Various organizational units within the Laboratory, including the Environment, Health and Safety Division, Computing Sciences Directorate, and Human Resources Department, are responsible for developing and/or providing training programs to Laboratory employees in their areas of expertise and that are required by law or will enhance employee performance. Procedures for attending interdepartmental training may be found on the Employee Self Service Web site. The Workforce Diversity Office is responsible for administering apprenticeship training programs, other special skills training, and internships.
G.	Off-Site Training: With the approval of his or her supervisor and department head or division director, an employee may attend off-site training (e.g., outside seminars and workshops) that will be of direct benefit to the employee's assignment. The division director or department head will approve attendance at off-site training only when the benefits to the Laboratory will, in his or her judgment, more than offset the costs involved, when the required skill or knowledge is not readily available through Laboratory training resources, and when the employee's time away from the Laboratory will not adversely impact current work demands. The division will pay course fees, travel, and all other expenses as necessary.
H.	College Degrees, Specialty Certificates, and College Level Courses: Career employees who have passed probation may take college-level, specialty certificate, and continuing education courses as described below. Satisfactory job performance is a prerequisite to participation in these Tier 1 and Tier 2 programs. The employee must have an Employee Development Plan approved by his or her supervisor, division director, or the Operations Department Head, and the Human Resources Operations Manager or designee. Approval is based on: •	Relevance to the Laboratory’s mission •	Mutual benefit to the employee's career and the long-term interests of the Laboratory •	Whether there is a reasonable expectation that the employee shall remain in the employ of the Laboratory for a sufficient period of time to provide a fair return for the training costs •	Whether the proposed curriculum and timetable are realistic •	Whether the department/division’s work needs can be met during any employee absences due to attending class Employees may be reimbursed as noted below for tuition, laboratory fees, educational fees, and other fees required for registration when the employee submits proof of successful course completion and receipts for payment of fees to the Training Administrator in the Human Resources Department. Nonresident tuition is not reimbursable. Successful completion is receipt of a grade of at least a “C” for undergraduate work or “B” for graduate work if the institution uses the “A-F” system of grading. If there is a choice between receiving a letter grade or a “Pass/Fail” evaluation, the employee must take the letter grade. Reimbursement is also allowed when an employee is forced to withdraw from a course because of work requirements, provided he/she submits evidence from the instructor that the employee’s work in the course was satisfactory at the time of forced withdrawal. When necessary, the Human Resources Operations Manager or designee may advance payment of the costs provided the employee agrees to return the payment if the employee is unable to provide evidence of satisfactory completion. Employees who are eligible for the University of California Reduced-Fee Enrollment Benefit must take advantage of that benefit. Employees who terminate employment before the end of the quarter or semester are not eligible for reimbursement of fees unless the termination is due to an
- 127 -
involuntary layoff and when the employee was notified of layoff after the beginning of the class. Employees whose fees have been paid through an advance agreement must repay the advance at termination.
Time off with pay may be granted when the employee’s absence will not adversely affect progress of work, in accordance with the following provisions:
•	The employee must remain in career status during the entire quarter or semester.
•	The course or courses must be listed on the Employee Development Plan and approved before registration for each academic quarter or semester.
•	Time off to attend and register for approved courses may be allowed only when such courses cannot reasonably be taken outside the employee's scheduled working hours.
•	Time off with pay may not exceed six hours per week, including time for travel and registration. Time off with pay is not allowed for study, library, or faculty consultation time. Additional time required must be accounted for by an adjusted work schedule or by use of vacation credit.
•	Time off with pay to take Web/Internet based courses is not allowed.
1.	Tier 1:
College-level courses leading to an academic degree (A.A., B.S., Ph.D., etc.) or a specialty certificate (Certified Compensation Professional, Certified Cisco Network Technician, Integrated Circuit Engineering, etc.). Degree courses must be offered by an accredited college or university. Specialty certificate courses must be offered by an accredited college or university, university extension program, or recognized professional society. Continuing education units (CEUs) may be reimbursed under Tier 1 when they are part of an approved degree or specialty certificate program. These may be either position-or career-related programs. The employee must exhibit satisfactory progress towards attainment of the degree or certificate for continued eligibility under Tier 1, with the understanding that unanticipated department/division work needs may affect that progress. Employees may be reimbursed 100% for tuition, laboratory fees, educational fees, and other fees required for registration when the employee submits proof of successful course completion and receipts for payment of fees to the Training Administrator in the Human Resources Department.
2.	Tier 2:
Career-related academic programs not leading to an academic degree or a specialty certificate. Courses must be offered by an accredited college or university. Continuing education units (CEUs) may be reimbursed under Tier 2 only when offered by a university or college continuing education program. Employees may be reimbursed two-thirds for tuition, laboratory fees, educational fees, and other fees required for registration when the employee submits proof of successful course completion and receipts for payment of fees to the Training Administrator in the Human Resources Department.
I.	Government Licensing and/or Professional Certification:
For the purposes of this section, government licenses and/or professional certifications are those licenses and certifications required by the employee to hold his or her current position as documented in the position description. Continuing education credit (CEU) courses required for the maintenance of a professional license or certification as noted above are considered position-related courses. The course must be approved by the licensing or certifying agency. The request for course fee reimbursement is the same as for all other position-related training. Fees for license or certifications renewals as defined
- 128 -
above are an allowable expenditure. The request is made in writing to the Financial Services Department and must include:
•	Request for Issuance of Check form with valid project ID and approval;
•	Endorsement by the cognizant division director that the cost is allowable as cited; and
•	Copy of the license renewal or issuance documentation.
J.	Professional Research or Teaching Leave
1.

APPENDIX F
LBNL LAYOFF AND REDUCTION IN TIME
A.	Career employees who are eligible for vacation and sick-leave credits and are laid off from employment for an indefinite period due to lack of work or lack of funds are eligible for severance payments in accordance with the following provisions.
B.	The following definitions apply for purposes of severance payments:
1.	Service is continuous if an employee is on pay status each month without a break in service. A break in service occurs when there is a separation from Laboratory employment status.
a.	Periods on an approved leave without pay for military service; illness or injury compensable by workers' compensation; assignment to another research organization at the direction of the Laboratory; or an approved leave without pay for any period of 30 days or less are counted as periods of continuous service for the purposes of severance pay, as are periods on pay status before and after any other approved leave without pay.
b.	Periods of employment before a break in service are not counted as periods of continuous service for purposes of severance pay, nor are periods on pay status as a University of California graduate student research assistant or employee working indeterminate time (except that, for an employee working an indeterminate-time schedule who has attained career status, the period on pay status that qualified the employee for career status and subsequent periods will be counted).
c.	Continuous service is reestablished when an employee is rehired from preferential rehire status.
2.	An equivalent job is any career position with the Laboratory or the University at a beginning salary at least equal to the salary paid the employee in the job from which that employee was laid off, regardless of salary range.
3.	One week's pay for nonexempt hourly rated employees is defined as the basic hourly rate (excluding shift differential and overtime) times 40 hours. One week’s pay for exempt employees is defined as the hourly equivalent of the monthly rate times 40 hours.
C.	Severance Payment Calculations and Methods of Payment
1.	The severance payment will be made in an amount equal to one week's pay for each year of continuous full-time-equivalent Laboratory service (including LLNL and LANL). A fractional year of full-time service of six months or more is counted as one year of service. The severance payment is not to exceed a total of 26 weeks' pay.
2.	An employee will have the option of selecting a lump-sum payment at time of termination or payment in biweekly installments.
D.	Limitations
1.	Severance payments will not extend the period of employment beyond the date of termination due to layoff.
- 130 -
2.	Severance payments made to an employee will not include payment for any period of service for which the employee has previously received such payment.
3.	Severance payments will not be made to any employee who terminates for any reason other than layoff, with the following exceptions:
a.	An employee who resigns after receiving formal notification of layoff but before the effective date of layoff may be provided severance payments with the approval of the Deputy Director for Operations or designee.
b.	An employee who resigns in lieu of another employee who would have been laid off may be provided severance payments with the approval of the Deputy Director for Operations or designee. Normally, such approval will be given only if the resignation will not have a detrimental effect on work in progress and if the employee concerned had not announced plans to resign or retire before the announcement of a layoff within the employee's division.
4.	Severance payments will not be provided to an employee who transfers to another Laboratory position or University career position or to an employee who refuses a transfer to an equivalent job with the Laboratory or the University.
E.	Should an individual who has received severance payments be rehired at the Laboratory before the expiration of the number of weeks for which the employee has received severance payments, the amount of the balance will be credited as an advance on earnings.
F.	Policies, procedures, definitions and qualifications in effect on June 1, 2003 (as detailed in the Laboratory’s Regulations and Procedures Manual) relative to rights to recall and preference for reemployment that are in conflict with the Agreement shall remain in effect for employees at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
G.	If an employee voluntarily reduces his or her time within one year prior to layoff because of budgetary or operational considerations that, in the judgment of the Laboratory, make it necessary to reduce the hours of the workforce, the employee is entitled to recall/rehire rights at a percentage of time equal to that from which the employee voluntarily reduced his or her time. The request for the voluntary reduction must be submitted by the employee in writing and approved by the supervisor and must state the effective date and the percentage of the reduction in time.

SIDELETTER
CAMPUS GRIEVANCE RESOLUTION COMMITTEE (CRC) PROGRAM GUIDELINES
1.	General
The parties agree that a Campus Grievance Resolution Committee Program (“CRC”) may be implemented at campuses, where they do not already exist. Except for the general guidelines set forth in this sideletter, the particular elements governing the CRC will be negotiated at each participating campus.
The procedures to be used by each campus CRC shall be determined by agreement between the local parties. While the CRC is intended to be an informal process, individual campuses may agree to use a formal process of testimony including, but not limited to, examination of witnesses.
2.	Obligations Of Parties
The parties at each campus may meet and confer separately over the specific terms of the CRC.
3.	Subject Matter Excluded From CRC Review
The parties agree that the subject matter of the grievances suitable for the CRC shall be determined by the parties at each location. CRC is not suited for grievances involving complex contractual interpretations.
4.	Composition Of The CRC
Upon submission of a written grievance to the CRC, a panel composed of four members, two chosen by each side, shall be convened. To foster an impartial panel, the parties shall not select panel members from the same control unit or individuals who are involved with or have a vested interest in the outcome of the grievance. The union may only select bargaining unit employees to serve on the CRC.
5.	Decisions Of CRC
The CRC has final and binding authority to adjudicate a grievance only if it reaches a unanimous decision. Such unanimous decisions by the CRC will only address the specific issues and remedies stated on the grievance form. The CRC shall issue either a unanimous decision in a written statement that sets forth the reasoning behind their decision or a written decision that the CRC failed to reach unanimous consensus. The record and findings from the CRC may not be introduced as evidence in any other proceeding.
6.	Limitations On CRC's Authority And Remedy
The CRC's authority and ability to fashion a remedy shall be subject to the same limits placed on an Arbitrator authority as set forth in Article 3, sections G(1) and (4) and H (1)(2)(3) and (5).
7.	Return To Grievance Procedures
The CRC shall lose jurisdiction over any grievance following the issuance of its decision but no later than ten (10) days after the close of the CRC meeting.

SIDE LETTER
Removal of Term “non-Grievable, non-Arbitrable” from Contract Language
The University and UPTE agree that the removal of the terms “non-grievable, non-arbitrable” in Section A.2., of the Layoff and Reduction in Time article, Section B.1. in the Probationary Period Article and B.2.b.2 in the Health and Safety Article, and Transfer/Promotion/Reclassification Section D.2., does not change or reduce the University’s exclusive right to make the determinations specified in these Articles. Therefore, there is no right to grieve or arbitrate the University’s determinations in those referenced sections of the named Articles.

SIDE LETTER
LBNL ADVANCED LIGHT SOURCE
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and University Professional and Technical Employees (UPTE) are parties to a collective bargaining relationship. LBNL and UPTE agree that unless and until changed pursuant to the terms of this Side Letter Agreement or the overall UPTE-UC contract covering the employees covered by this Side Letter, LBNL's Advance Light Source will continue to schedule and compensate covered employees in accordance with its current (i.e., effective on June 20, 1997) work schedules, which provide for employee work 24-hours per day, seven days per week, consecutive days off, and no rotation involving the owl shift.
A.	Changes in Work Shifts
During the life of this Agreement, the Employer may institute new work shifts, which include elimination of one or more shifts and/or changes in work weeks. Any changed work shift will be first offered to employees in order of their classification seniority. If an insufficient number of employees select the new shifts/weeks, the Employer will assign employees to it in inverse order of classification seniority. However, in all cases, all employees going to the new shift/week must, in the Employer's judgment, currently have the requisite knowledge, skill, and efficiency to perform the work. The employer's judgment must be exercised in good faith and is subject to the grievance-arbitration procedures.
B.	Changes in Shift Assignments
Changes in regular shifts must be posted at least 30 calendar days in advance except in cases of emergency or except where the employee involved agrees in writing to waive the period of notice. In this event, a copy of the written waiver shall be furnished to the Union. No employee shall be compelled to enter into any such waiver.
Where the proper 30 days notification is not given, except in bona fide emergency situations, the first day of the shift change shall be paid for at the overtime rate of time and one-half.
The Employer may make temporary shift changes for business reasons, which do not include discipline. The affected employees shall be notified of the expected duration of the shift change.
Temporary shift changes must be posted at least 30 calendar days in advance except in cases of emergency or except where the employee involved agrees tin writing to waive the period of notice. In this event, a copy of the written waiver shall be furnished to the union. No employee shall be compelled to enter into any such waiver.
Where the proper 30 days notification is not given, except in bona fide emergency situations, the first day of the shift change shall be paid for at the overtime rate of time and one-half.
Pairs of employees can request shift exchanges which shall be granted, if in the Employer's judgment the employees currently have the requisite knowledge, skill and efficiency to perform the work. The Employer's judgment must be exercised in good faith and is subject to the Grievance and Arbitration procedures.
This Side Letter agreement supersedes any conflicting or different LBNL RPM provisions. However, the RPM's "Hours of Work" and "Reduction in Force" provisions shall remain in effect, except to the extent, if any, to which they are changed by the "Big Table" negotiations for the overall UPTE-UC contract. This Side Letter does not change any RPM provisions
- 134 -
other than those addressed herein.
This Side Letter Agreement shall be in effect for two years or the life of the overall UPTE-UC contract covering LBNL ALS employees, whichever is longer.

SIDE LETTER LAWRENCE BERKELEY NATIONAL LABORATORY
The following items are offered as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s resolution to all outstanding issues as related to Research Associate Salary and Genomic Shift Operation (LSD) Negotiations:
A.	The parties shall be guided by principles mutually established in the “ALS Shift Assignment” side letter dated June 20, 1997 and shall be applicable to Genomic operations with the following supplemental notations:
1.	Workweek
The workweek shall commence at 12:01 a.m. Sunday to and including 12 midnight the following Saturday. The workweek shall be five consecutive eight hour days or four consecutive 10 hour days excluding the meal period.
2.	Shifts
a.	Initial Shift Assignments:
Any newly available work shift will be first offered to employees in the appropriate classification in order of seniority. If an insufficient number of employees select the new shifts/weeks/starting times, the employer will assign employees to it in the inverse order of seniority. However, in all cases, all employees going to the new shift/week/start time must, in the employer’s judgment, currently have the requisite knowledge, skill and efficiency to perform the work. The employer’s judgment must be exercised in good faith and is subject to the Grievance and Arbitration procedures.
b.	For those employees on shifts or when operational needs require the efficient use of resources, within a work week, an employee shall have the same start time each day of the week.
c.	Day Shift:
Shall correspond to work hours and flex time allowance hours as set forth in the RPM at §2.22 D.1 - §2.22 D.4 (as it existed on April 15, 1996).
d.	Evening Shift:
Shift start times shall commence between the hours from 3:00 p.m. to and including 6:00 p.m. Shifts may start on the hour, or any quarter hour or half-hour. Shift premium under these circumstances shall be paid biweekly or monthly at the rate of seven and one-half percent of the base pay calculated on a weekly basis.
e.	Owl Shift:
Shift start times shall commence between the hours from 10:00 p.m. to and including 12:00 midnight. Shifts may start on the hour and any quarter hour or half-hour. Shift premium under these circumstances shall be paid biweekly or monthly at the rate of 15% of the base pay calculated on a weekly basis.
- 136 -
f.	Meal Periods:
Meal periods shall be one hour in length, except that the employer may, upon request, grant a one-half hour meal period. Meal periods shall generally be scheduled at the midpoint of the employee’s workday.
g.	Rest Periods:
Employees shall be granted two 15 minute rest periods during the regular work day. Rest times shall not be taken at the start or end of the workday or be combined with each other or the meal period.
h.	If less than 30 days notice of a shift change is given to an exempt employee, the employee shall be paid the equivalent of one-half of one day’s pay.
3.	Overtime:
a.	Overtime is applicable to employees classified as non-exempt.
b.	When computing premium pay for time worked over the normal 40-hour workweek, paid holiday leave is considered as time worked. Sick leave, vacation, military leave, court leave, and any other leave with or without pay is not considered as time worked.
c.	Employees must receive prior authorization for overtime.
d.	Compensatory time off with pay, as such, is not granted to any employee. However, an employee who consistently works more than a standard 40-hour workweek may request Authorized Leave with Pay in recognition of their extra effort. Management shall endeavor to grant such request. Authorized Leave with Pay shall not be used to balance extra work above an employee’s basic work period on an hour-for-hour basis.
B.	POSITIONS:
The status of current employees classified as “Term” appointees shall be changed to “Career” effective January 1, 1999. No new “Term” appointments shall be made unless provided under the system-wide agreement.
C.	SEQUENCING SPECIALIST:
The Laboratory will create a new classification of Sequencing Specialist at the rate set forth in Appendix B of this Agreement. This classification shall be eligible for all merit salary increases under normal distribution set forth below, but not for any of the equity adjustments set forth below. Current Research Associates that are reclassified to a sequencing specialist are eligible to receive the equity adjustment for fiscal year 1999. The pay of any such employee will not be reduced as a result of this reclassification. The position shall be nonexempt.
D.	SEQUENCING LEAD:
The Laboratory will create a new classification of Sequencing Lead at the rate set forth in Appendix B of this Agreement for the purpose of giving work direction and leading a group of employees. This classification shall be eligible for all merit (under normal distribution) and equity pool percentage increases as set forth below. The position shall be exempt. The Laboratory anticipates that some employees currently classified as sequencing supervisors will be reclassified to sequencing leads. The pay of any such employee will not be reduced as a result of this reclassification.

10.	If more than one salary action takes place on the same date, the order of salary actions will be as follows: Merit (normal distribution) adjustments, Equity adjustments, and Promotion/Reclassification. If an employee’s salary is still below their new range minimum, it will be increased to the range minimum.
11.	Upon demand from the Laboratory, the union shall meet and confer over other supplemental salary increases the Laboratory deems appropriate for recruitment and retention.
12.	The Laboratory shall provide the union the following information. Name, employee identification number, work location, work phone number, division, department, job code, date of hire, start date for current classification, monthly rate of pay, appointment type, full/part time status, and standard hours of work.

F.	INTERIM GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE:
In the event a dispute arises over the interpretation and/or implementation of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the interim procedure below shall be utilized to grieve and arbitrate the matter. It is specifically understood and agreed that performance evaluations and resulting merit distribution moneys are not grievable under this interim procedure; those disputes shall continue to- be subject to the provisions of RPM 2.05 D (as it existed on April 15, 1996). The RPM procedures at §2.05 C and D (as it existed on April 15, 1996) fully apply as to all matters not directly or specifically set out in this agreement until such time as the systemwide collective bargaining agreement is ratified.
G.	INTERIM GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION:
Provisions of this Side Letter shall be enforceable through this grievance procedure, and through final and binding arbitration. When a comprehensive system-wide agreement for members of the entire bargaining unit is ratified, the grievance and arbitration procedures in that agreement shall be used for enforcement, and this interim grievance procedure expires on the effective date of the system-wide agreement. Until that time, the provisions of this article shall be used.
1.	The parties agree to employ a modified version of the RPM grievance procedure, RPM 205 C, §4 and §5 (as it existed on April 15, 1996). Where the RPM specifies the “employee”, it means, for purposes of this agreement, “the employee and/or the union.” The union may file grievances on behalf of itself, an individual employee, or a group of employees. The appeal to arbitration shall be submitted to the head of Human Resources. The Lab will proceed to the selection of the arbitrator within 15 days of the receipt of an appeal to arbitration.
2.	The parties will attempt to mutually agree to the selection of an arbitrator. In the event that the parties are unable to agree, they shall request a panel from the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and shall use the AAA
- 139 -
selection by mail process. The request for the AAA panel shall be sent to AAA not later than 15 days following the union’s notice to the Lab that it will arbitrate the case.
3.	In place of RPM 205 C §6 and §7, the parties shall use the AAA rules for the hearing.
4.	In place of RPM 205 C §8, the parties agree as follows:
Similar grievances, involving the same issues or actions, can be combined by agreement of the parties. All grievances from one employee that relate to a single incident or issue shall be included in one hearing. Fees shall be borne equally by the parties.
5.	An employee may be self represented, or may be represented by another person, at any stage of the grievance procedure. The union or its designee shall represent employees in the Arbitration procedure.
6.	No employees shall be subject to reprisal for using or participating in the grievance process.
7.	Time limits can be extended only by mutual written agreement of the parties. Any time limit that expires on a Saturday, Sunday, administrative holiday or other day off observed by the Laboratory shall be extended to the next normal working day.
8.	Pay status for Time Spent in Grievance Resolution. The parties agree to use RMP 205 C, §8.f. (as it existed on April 15, 1996).
9.	The Laboratory’s only procedural defense shall be timeliness.
It is understood that the terms set forth above constitute the only locally negotiated agreed upon terms and conditions in the Laboratory Research Associate Bargaining unit. The terms of this side letter shall be effective when the union notifies the Laboratory that it has been ratified. It is understood, however, that the Laboratory must be informed of ratification no later than close of business, Monday, November 16, 1998, in order to meet the above payment schedule.
This Agreement shall continue until October 1, 2001 or until the system agreement terminates, whichever is longer.
The above terms and conditions are hereby agreed to by and between the University of California’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and UPTE-CWA 9119.

Except as provided in the Leaves of Absence article, records of sick leave used shall be recorded in half-day increments only by exempt employees on full-time status. For exempt employees on less than full-time status, records of sick leave used shall be recorded in increments of not less than one hour. When an exempt employee has exhausted all accrued sick leave, salary shall not be reduced for absences of less than one full day or less than that portion of a day during which an employee on less than fulltime pay status is normally scheduled to work.
Vacation (supercedes section D.1 of the Vacation article in the RX contract for exempt employees at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory only):
Except as provided in the Leaves of Absence article, records of vacation used shall be recorded in half-day increments only by exempt employees on full-time status. For exempt employees on less than full-time status, records of vacation used shall be recorded in increments of not less than one hour. When an exempt employee has exhausted all accrued vacation, salary shall not be reduced for absences of less than one full day or less than that portion of a day during which an employee on less than full-time pay status is normally scheduled to work.
This agreement is non-precedent setting, and will remain in effect for the life of the UPTE-UC contract covering LBNL RX employees.
