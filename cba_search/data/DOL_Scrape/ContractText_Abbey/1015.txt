SECTION 2.	Should an employer not have established a regular practice of performing the work stated in Section 1 (e) and (f) above then the employer shall not be required to use employees to perform that work.
ARTICLE II
SECTION 1.	No Employer shall subcontract or assign any of the work described herein which is to be performed at a Jobsite to any
1
contractor, subcontractor or other person or party who fails to agree in writing to comply with the conditions of employment contained herein including, without limitations, those relating to union security, rates of pay and working conditions, hiring and other matters covered hereby for the duration of the project.
SECTION 2.	Subject to other applicable provisions of this Agreement, the Employer agrees that when subcontracting for prefabrication of materials covered herein, such prefabrication shall be subcontracted to fabricators who pay their employees engaged in such fabrication not less than the prevailing wage for comparable sheet metal fabrication, as established under provisions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE III
SECTION 1. The Employer agrees that none but journeymen, apprentice, and probationary apprentice sheet metal workers shall be employed on any work described in Article I and further, for the purpose of proving jurisdiction, agrees to provide the Union with written evidence of assignment on the Employer’s letterhead for certain specified items of work to be performed at a jobsite prior to commencement of work at the site. List of such specific items, which may be revised from time to time, as agreed to by and between SMACNA and SMWIA, shall be provided to the Employer. For purposes of clarification throughout the Standard Form of Union Agreement and all Addendums, the terms “Journeyman”, “Journeymen”, “Foreman”, and “Foremen” refer to job classifications and are non-gender specific. Any reference to he or his shall mean “he/she” or his/her.”

2
the effective date of this Agreement, whichever is the later, provided the Employer has reasonable grounds for believing that membership is available to such employees on the same terms and conditions generally applicable to other members and that membership is not denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and initiation fee uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.
SECTION 2.	If during the term of this Agreement the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 shall be amended by Congress in such manner as to reduce the time within which an employee may be required to acquire union membership, such reduced time limit shall become immediately effective instead of and without regard to the time limit specified in Section I of this Article.

The Arbitrator shall be authorized to impose any remedial order he deems appropriate for violation of this Section, including termination of the Employer’s obligation to contribute to the IFUS. The authority of the Arbitrator is expressly limited to a determination of a deadlocked issue under this Section, (Section 12, Article VIII), and no other.
SECTION 13 (a). Contributions provided for in Section 13 (b) of this Article will be used to promote programs of industry education, training, negotiation and administration of collective bargaining agreements, research and promotion, such programs serving to expand the market for the services of the Sheet Metal Industry, improve the technical and business skills of Employers, stabilize and improve Employer-Union relations, and promote, support and improve the employment opportunities for employees.

SECTION 14. The Employer and the Union recognize that, during the term of this Agreement, The Sheet Metal Workers’ National Pension Fund (NPF) will notify the parties of the NPF’s status under the Pension Protection Plan of 2006. It is anticipated that the NPF will be in critical status. Consequently, the Employer and the Union further recognize that a surcharge may be imposed upon contributions to the NPF, and that the NPF may adopt a rehabilitation plan, incorporating alternative schedules of benefits and contributions, during the term of this Agreement.
The Parties agree that a schedule described above will be deemed to be adopted automatically if, in accordance with this Agreement, the Union allocates or re-allocates a portion of the wage and fringe benefit package, or where the Agreement provides for an automatic allocation or re-allocation of the wage and fringe benefit package, that is sufficient to cover fully any increases in contribution rates to the NPF under that schedule.
It is undesirable to pay a surcharge upon pension contributions, with no resulting improvement in pension benefits. Accordingly, in the absence of a re-allocation as provided above, at such time as the Trustees of the NPF furnish the Employer and the Union with alternative schedules as provided above, either party may reopen this Agreement upon thirty days written notice to the other, for the purpose of reaching agreement upon the adoption of one of those schedules. During the negotiations, the parties shall give due recognition to the desirability of maintaining pension benefits in light of economic conditions in the local area.
The parties agree further that the schedule described above will
10
become part of this Agreement, and will be incorporated by references herein, on the date the schedule is adopted or is deemed to have been adopted automatically in accordance with the terms above. The parties will not take any action or actions inconsistent with the NPF’s Rehabilitation Plan or Funding Improvement Plan of which the schedule is a part, as modified or amended from time to time.
Effective as of the date of this Agreement the Employers will contribute to the International Training Institute for the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Industry (ITI) twelve cents ($0.12) per hour for each hour worked by each employee of the Employer covered by this Agreement. Payment shall be made on or before the 20th day of the succeeding month and shall be remitted as designated by the Trustees of the ITI, or for purposes of collection and transmittal through Northwest Sheet Metal Workers Health Trust.
Effective as of the date of this Agreement the Employers will contribute to the National Energy Management Institute Committee (NEMIC), a jointly administered trust fund, three cents ($0.03) per hour for each hour worked by each employee of the Employer covered by this Agreement. Payment shall be made on or before the 20th day of the succeeding month and shall be remitted as designated by the Trustees of the NEMIC, or for the purposes of collection and transmittal through Northwest Sheet Metal Workers Health Trust. If during the term of this agreement the SMWIA Constitution is amended to provide that participation in the National Energy Management Institute is no longer mandatory for Local 66, the parties agree to meet for the specific purpose of deciding how to reallocate the three cent ($.03) per hour contribution presently set forth in this agreement.
Effective as of the date of this Agreement the Employers will contribute to the Sheet Metal Occupational Health Institute Trust (Institute) two cents ($0.02) per hour for each hour worked by each employee of the Employer covered by this Agreement until the Institute Trustees determine that the Trust is financially self-sufficient. Payment shall be made on or before the 20th day of the succeeding month and shall be remitted as designated by the Trustees of the Institute, or for purposes of collection and transmittal through Northwest Sheet Metal Workers Health Trust.
The parties agree to be bound by the separate Agreements and Declarations of Trusts establishing the National Training Fund for the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Industry, the National Energy
11
Management Institute Committee, the Sheet Metal Occupational Health Institute Trust, and the Industry Fund of the United States and the separate agreements and declarations of trusts of all other local or national programs to which it has been agreed that contributions will be made. In addition, the parties agree to be bound by any amendments to said trust agreements as may be made from time to time and hereby designate as their representatives on the Board of Trustees such trustees as are named together with any successors who may be appointed pursuant to said agreements.
The parties authorize the trustees of all national funds to cooperatively establish uniform collection procedures to provide for efficient and effective operation of the various national trusts.
ARTICLE IX
SECTION 1.	Journeymen, apprentices, and probationary apprentices and residential inductees covered by this Agreement shall provide for themselves all necessary hand tools, not to include any power tools or cell phones.
SECTION 2.

14
(a)	Should the negotiations for a renewal of this Agreement or negotiations regarding a wage/fringe re-opener become deadlocked in the opinion of the Union representative(s) or of the Employer(‘s) representative(s), or both, notice to that effect shall be given to the National Joint Adjustment Board.
If the Co-Chairmen of the National Joint Adjustment Board believe the dispute might be adjusted without going to final hearing before the National Joint Adjustment Board, each will then designate a Panel representative who shall proceed to the locale where the dispute exists as soon as convenient, attempt to conciliate the differences between the parties and bring about a mutually acceptable agreement. If such Panel representatives or either of them conclude that they cannot resolve the dispute, the parties thereto and the Co-Chairmen of the National Joint Adjustment Board shall be promptly so notified without recommendation from the Panel representatives.

In addition to the mediation procedure set forth above or as an alternate thereto, the Co-Chairmen of the National Joint Adjustment Board may each designate a member to serve as a Subcommittee and hear the dispute in the local area. Such Subcommittees shall function as arbitrators and are authorized to resolve all or part of the issues. They are not, however, authorized to deadlock and the matter shall be heard by the National Joint Adjustment Board in the event a Subcommittee is unable to direct an entire resolution of the dispute.
The dispute shall be submitted to the National Joint Adjustment Board pursuant to the rules as established and modified from time to time by the National Joint Adjustment Board. The unanimous decision of said Board shall be final and binding upon the parties, reduced to writing, signed and mailed to the parties as soon as possible after the decision has been reached.

15
changes which may be decided by the Board from time to time. The representatives of the parties who appear at the hearing will be given the opportunity to present oral argument and to answer any questions raised by members of the Board.
