"Length of Service" shall be defined to include the hire date of that employee as a regular probationary or permanent employee in the class, equal classes in a related series, plus any service in higher classes, with deductions for any unpaid time as defined in Section 15.5.2.

If Class Hire Date seniority is equal, then the preference-shall be given to.the employee with the earliest Regular Hire Date seniority.
