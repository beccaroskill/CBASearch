ARTICLE 1	- RECOGNITION
A.	This Memorandum of Understanding, hereinafter "MOU" or "Agreement", is entered into by the State of California, hereinafter the "State" or the "State employer", and the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE, Craft Maintenance Division, State of California Locals 3, 12, 39 and 501, AFL-CIO), hereinafter "IUOE", pursuant to the Dills Act, Government Code Section 3517. The term "MOU" or "Agreement" as used herein means a written agreement provided under Section 3517.5 of the Government Code.
B.	Pursuant to the Dills Act and PERB certification S-D-133-S, the State recognizes IUOE (Locals 3, 12, 39 and 501) as the exclusive representative of all employees in the Crafts and Maintenance Unit, Unit 12 (hereinafter "Unit" or "bargaining unit"). Pursuant to the Dills Act, IUOE (Locals 3, 12, 39 and 501) recognizes the Director of the Department of Personnel Administration, hereinafter "DPA", or his/her designee, as the negotiating representative for the State. IUOE shall negotiate exclusively with the Director or his/her designee within DPA where the matter involves more than one department, except as otherwise agreed upon by the DPA and IUOE.
Nothing herein precludes the DPA from delegating negotiations to an individual department when an issue affects an individual department. When negotiations are delegated, DPA will delegate authority consistent with DPA’s usual and customary practice, to the Department’s Labor Relations Office. The delegated negotiations will be conducted at a single bargaining table.
DPA will not delegate negotiations to an individual department where the issue has statewide impact in the department unless DPA and IUOE agree otherwise.
ARTICLE 2	- SALARIES
2.1	Classification Pay Plan
For purposes of this agreement, the classification pay plan shall be administered in accordance with DPA regulations 599.666.2 through 599.795.1.
2.2	Salaries
Effective July 1, 2003, all Unit 12 classifications shall receive a general salary increase of five percent (5%). The increase shall be calculated by multiplying the base salary by 1.05. The parties recognize that the actual salary increase for each classification may vary slightly due to rounding.
This management proposal shall be deemed withdrawn if not accepted by both parties and ratified before the current legislative session adjourns.

2.4	Merit Salary Adjustments
Employees shall receive annual merit salary adjustments in accordance with Government Code Section 19832 and applicable Department of Personnel Administration rules.
2.5	Pay Periods
A.	All employees in Unit 12 shall be paid once per month, except employees in classes or locations which are paid on a semi-monthly or bi-weekly basis in accordance with current practice.
B.	The Department of Water Resources' employees who are currently being compensated on a biweekly basis shall be compensated at two-week intervals no later than the second Thursday after the close of the pay period. Both IUOE and DWR recognize that, due to circumstances beyond the Department's control, paychecks for these employees may be occasionally delayed. When such a delay becomes apparent, DWR shall notify IUOE and the affected employee(s) in a reasonable amount of time prior to the scheduled payday. DWR employees compensated on a biweekly basis shall normally receive one paycheck for the pay period, which shall include all regular pay, overtime, night shift differential or rotating shift premium.
C.	The parties agree to establish a committee to meet with the State Controller's Office to discuss changes to the State's payroll system. The committee will meet at times mutually agreed upon by the parties. Topics may include, but not be limited to, moving to a bi-weekly or semi-monthly payroll system, accuracy and timelines of overtime warrants. The goal of the committee would be to implement agreed upon changes.
The committee will be comprised of an equal number of management representatives and IUOE representatives. Employee representatives, if any, shall serve without loss of compensation. The size of the committee shall not exceed four members each from management and IUOE.
2.6	Timely Payment of Wages
A.	The State agrees to provide for all active employees, timely payment of regular wages due on pay day. In addition, following an employee’s discharge, layoff, or resignation the employee shall be compensated for wages due consistent with applicable department and Controller’s Office policies.
B.	Effective upon ratification of this Agreement by the Legislature, when a permanent full time employee receives no pay warrant on payday, the State agrees to issue a salary advance, consistent with departmental policy and under the following conditions:
1.	When there are errors or delays in processing the payroll documents and the employee does not receive a check on pay day, a salary advance will normally be issued within three (3) work days after pay day for an amount close to the actual net pay (gross salary less deductions) in accordance with departmental policy.
10
BU 12
01-04
2.	In the event that a revolving fund check is not issued within three (3) workdays as specified above, the employer will pay to the employee 5% of the employee’s base pay for that pay period, for each work day beyond the three-day grace period described in (1) above.
3.	The differences between the employee’s net pay and the salary advance shall not be reconciled until after the Department receives the Controller’s warrant for the pay period.
C.	Those employees on voluntary payroll deduction who experience extended problems receiving payroll warrants may request that an explanation be provided to payroll deduction creditor(s) by their departmental personnel office.
D.	This provision does not apply to those employees who are on non-industrial disability insurance leave, industrial disability leave, or who are receiving worker’s compensation payments.
E.	Upon specific request of IUOE, the State will meet with IUOE regarding specific departmental issues of timely issuance of overtime payments, shift differentials, premium pay, or allowances.
F.	Upon request of the Union, any State agency shall meet with IUOE to evaluate its distribution of regular salary warrants. Any alternative method of distribution shall be in accordance with State Administrative Manual sections 8580.1 and 8580.2. Any lawful alternative method of salary distribution may be discussed with IUOE.
2.7	Recovery of Overpayments
For purposes of overpayment, this agreement supersedes Government Code Section 19838.
A.	Late Dock
1.	This section applies to employees on a negative pay system and only regular pay issued through the negative pay process. It does not apply to permanent intermittent employees. It does not apply to any positive pay, such as, but not limited to: overtime, shift differential, skill pay, etc.
2.	Whenever an employee is charged with late dock as defined by the State Controller’s Office (SCO) for the purpose of issuing salary through the negative payroll system, the State will issue the employee’s paycheck for that pay period as if no late dock occurred. This means that:
a.	the employee will receive a regular pay check on pay day.
b.	the employee will be overpaid, since the dock time will not have been deducted from the pay check; and
c.	the employee’s pay will be adjusted for any dock time occurring before the cut off date (late dock occurs on or after the cut off date established by SCO).
11
BU 12
01-04
3.	Employees who are overpaid because of operation of paragraph 2 above, will repay the State for their overpayment by an automatic payroll deduction from the first feasible pay check following the late dock procedure as detailed in paragraph 2 above. State agencies will make a good faith effort to notify each employee of overpayment and automatic payroll deduction via a standardized written notification to be attached to the employee’s paycheck in which the overpayment occurs. Notwithstanding this provision, departments shall not be precluded from making the automatic payroll deduction for repayment purposes if the required notification is not received at the time of the overpayment.
4.	By implementing the provisions of this agreement, departments will discontinue their practice of issuing a salary advance in lieu of a regular paycheck in order to avoid an overpayment due to a late dock.
5.	Employees who separate from State service after receiving an overpayment because of operation of paragraph 2 above, will have their separation pay adjusted to repay the overpayment to the State.
B.	Payroll/Time Keeping Errors
1.	When the State determines an overpayment has been made to an employee, other than the late dock provision in section a above, it shall notify the employee of the overpayment and afford the employee an opportunity to respond prior to commencing recoupment actions. The notification to the employee shall contain the following:
a.	detailed explanation of how the overpayment occurred;
b.	the date(s)/pay period(s) in which the overpayment occurred;
c.	a calculation showing the amount of the overpayment and adjustments for social security, medicare, and retirement;
d.	a proposed repayment plan; and
e.	timeframe in which the employee must respond to the notification (15 days).
2.	Reimbursement shall be made to the State through one of the following methods mutually agreed to by the employee and the State:
a.	Installments through payroll deduction to cover at least the same number of pay periods in which the error occurred. When overpayments have continued for more than one year, full payment may be required by the State through payroll deductions over the period of one year. Nothing precludes the employer and the employee agreeing to a longer/shorter payment plan. When an overpayment is recovered from an employee’s subsequent pay check(s), the federal and state taxes of the impacted pay check(s) will be calculated after the gross payroll deduction amount is deducted from that pay check(s).
12
BU 12
01-04
b.	The adjustment of appropriate leave credits or compensating time off, provided that the overpayment involves the accrual or crediting of leave credits (e.g., vacation, annual leave, excess, or holiday) or compensating time off. Any errors in sick leave balances may only be adjusted with sick leave credits.
c.	Cash payment or payments through agency collection process (only at the employee’s request).
d.	Absent mutual agreement on a method of reimbursement, the State shall proceed with recoupment in the manner set forth in Paragraph B2a of this section.
3.	An employee who is separated from employment prior to full repayment of the amount owed shall have withheld from any money owing the employee upon separation an amount sufficient to provide full repayment. If the amount of money owing upon separation is insufficient to provide full reimbursement to the State, the State shall have the right to exercise any and all other legal means to recover the additional amount owed.
4.	Amounts deducted from payment of salary or wages pursuant to the above provisions, except as provided in section b3 above, shall in no event exceed 25 percent of the employee’s net disposable earnings.
5.	No administrative action shall be taken by the State pursuant to this section to recover an overpayment unless the action is initiated within three years from the date of overpayment.
6.	In the event that a recovery action is taken to collect an overpayment that is not in compliance with 2.8B, the employer shall pay to the employee 5% of the employee’s base pay for each pay period that the employer collects money from the employee in violation of this section.
2.8	Night Shift Differential
Unit 12 employees who regularly work shifts shall receive a night shift differential as set forth below:
A.	Employees shall qualify for the first night shift pay differential of forty (40) cents per hour where four (4) or more hours of the regularly scheduled work shift falls between 6 p.m. and 12 midnight.
B.	Employees shall qualify for the second night shift pay differential of fifty (50) cents per hour where four (4) or more hours of the regularly scheduled work shift fall between 12 midnight and 6 a.m.
C.	A "regularly scheduled work shift" are those regularly assigned work hours established by the department director or designee.
13
BU 12
01-04
2.9	Special Duty Pay
A.	Incumbents in Unit 12 classifications currently eligible to receive Diving Pay shall continue to receive such a differential at the rate of $10.00 per diving hour.
B.	CalTrans employees assigned to avalanche control duties shall receive Avalanche Control Pay at the rate of $6.00 per hour for the hours during which they actually operate artillery or avalaunchers for the purpose of causing controlled snow slides.
2.10	Alternate Range 40
A.	The State will continue to provide Alternate Range 40 (AR-40) compensation to classes currently eligible using the following criteria:
Range B. This range shall apply to incumbents in positions approved by the Department of Personnel Administration staff as having regular, direct responsibility for work supervision, on-the-job training, and work performance evaluation of at least two inmates, wards, or resident workers who substantially replace civil service employees for a total of at least 173 allocated hours of inmates', wards' or resident workers' time per pay period.
Other classes may be added during the term of this Agreement only upon concurrence of the State.
B.	Effective January 1, 1991, the State agrees to eliminate the AR-40 provision of this Agreement for Unit 12 employees who work at institutions for the Departments of Corrections and Youth Authority. The salary of Unit 12 employees in the Departments of Corrections and Youth Authority who are at Range A and who are eligible by classification and work location to receive Range B will be changed to Range B effective January 1, 1991.
It is understood by the parties that Unit 12 employees in the institutions of the Departments of Corrections and Youth Authority who receive Range B pay will continue to be expected to supervise inmate/ward workers.
2.11	Bilingual Differential Pay
Bilingual Differential Pay applies to those positions designated by the Department of Personnel Administration as eligible to receive Bilingual Differential Pay according to the following standards:
A.	Definition of Bilingual Position for Bilingual Differential Pay:
1.	A bilingual position for salary differential purposes requires the use of a bilingual skill on a continuing basis averaging 10% of the time. Anyone using his/her bilingual skills 10% or more of the time will be eligible whether he/she is using them in a conversational, interpretation, or translation setting. In order to receive Bilingual Differential Pay, the position/employee must be certified by the using department and approved by the Department of Personnel Administration. (Time should be an average of the time spent on bilingual activities during a given fiscal year.)
14
BU 12
01-04
2.	The position must be in a work setting that requires the use of bilingual skills to meet the needs of the public in either:
a.	A direct public contact position;
b.	A hospital or institutional setting dealing with patient or inmate needs;
c.	A position utilized to perform interpretation, translation or specialized bilingual activities for the department and its clients.
3.	Position(s) must be in a setting where there is a demonstrated client or correspondence flow where bilingual skills are clearly needed.
4.	Where organizationally feasible, departments should ensure that positions clearly meet the standards by centralizing the bilingual responsibility in as few positions as possible.
5.	Actual time spent conversing or interpreting in a second language and closely related activities performed directly in conjunction with the specific bilingual transaction will count toward the 10% standard.
B.	Rate:
1.	An employee meeting the Bilingual Differential Pay criteria during the entire monthly pay period would receive a maximum $100.00 per monthly pay period, including holidays.
2.	A monthly employee meeting the Bilingual Differential Pay criteria less than the entire monthly pay period will receive the differential on a pro rata basis.
3.	A fractional-month employee meeting the Bilingual Differential Pay criteria will receive the differential on pro rata basis.
4.	An employee paid by the hour, meeting the Bilingual Differential Pay criteria will receive a differential of $.58 per hour.

When such an employee is called back under these conditions within four hours of the beginning of a previous call or an additional call is received while still working on an earlier call back, the employee shall not receive an additional four hours credit for the new call back. When an employee is called back to work, the employee, with the permission of the appointing authority, or his or her designee when required, will be permitted to leave when the situation(s) that he/she was called in for has been completed. It is not the intent to have the employee perform additional work that represents routine maintenance that can or should be accomplished during the normal workday.
When such an employee is called back within four hours of the beginning of the employee's next shift, call back credit shall be received only for the hours remaining before the beginning of the employee's next shift.

E.	When a Caltrans employee receives a call to work while not on duty (i.e., neither during a regular work shift nor an overtime assignment), compensable time starts when the employee leaves home enroute directly for the call back and ends when the employee has returned home by the most direct route. Travel time for a call to work will not be paid when the employee is ordered to report early for a scheduled workshift even though the order to report early is made while the employee is not at work.
When a Caltrans employee receives a call to work which results in an additional commute during the workweek, the employee shall be reimbursed for travel mileage, to and from the report location, in accordance with applicable contract provisions and/or rules. Such mileage reimbursement shall not exceed a total of fifty (50) miles for each call back.

5.	When an employee takes paid leave, i.e., vacation, sick leave, etc., their leave balance will be charged the number of hours that they were scheduled to work.
6.	Once each 28 day rotation there is a string of four consecutive night shifts. The work week shall begin four hours into the fourth consecutive night shift in the schedule.
7.	The Department of Water Resources reserves the right to revert back to the 8-hour shift in 8.2 if in its judgment such action is necessary to maintain the operation of the State Water Project. This includes success in obtaining shift coverage. The department agrees to give affected employees and IUOE notice of its intent to cancel the program and give IUOE the opportunity to discuss this matter. If the issue is not resolved, DWR may cancel the program upon 30 days notice at conclusion of discussions.
8.	Upon IUOE request a blind election shall be held to determine if 85 percent of rotating shift workers in a field division wish to revert back to the 8-hour shift in 8.2 A. If so, the field division will revert back to the 8-hour shift in 8.2 A.

"Mentoring leave" does not have to be requested in the same week or month as the personal time was used. It does, however, have to be requested and used before the end of the calendar year.
C.	Prior to requesting mentoring leave and in accordance with departmental policy, an employee shall provide his or her supervisor with verification of personal time spent mentoring from the mentoring organization.
D.	Requests for approval of vacation, CTO, and/or annual leave for mentoring activities are subject to approval requirements in this agreement and in existing departmental policies. Requests for approval of mentoring leave are subject to operational needs of the State, budgetary limits, and any limitations imposed by law.
E.	In order to be eligible for "mentoring leave," an employee must:
1.	Have a permanent appointment (“permanent” means an employee who has successfully passed probation in the current class or any prior appointment);
2.	Have committed to mentor a child or youth through a mentoring organization that meets the quality assurance standards, for a minimum of one school year. (Most programs are aligned with the child's normal school year; however, there may be some that are less or more. Department management may make exceptions to the one school year commitment based on the mentor program that is selected.)
F.	In addition, an employee is not eligible to receive mentoring leave if;
1.	He or she is assigned to a “post” position in the Department of Corrections, Youth Authority; or
2.	He or she works in a level of care position in the Departments of Developmental Services, Mental Health, Education, and Veterans’ Affairs.
G.	Permanent part-time and permanent intermittent employees may receive a prorated amount of mentoring leave based upon their timebase. For example, a halftime employee is eligible for twenty (20) hours of “mentoring leave” per calendar year, whereas an intermittent employee must work a monthly equivalent of 160 hours to earn 3.33 hours of mentoring leave.
H.	Any appeals and/or disputes regarding this section shall be handled in accordance with the grievance procedure specified in Article 14 of this Contract.

2.	the examination is scheduled during the employee's scheduled work hours;
3.	the examination does not interfere with operational needs of the department; and
4.	the employee has a valid current medical certification, acceptable to DMV.
If medical certification provided by a department designated contractor physician or clinic is rejected by DMV on the date scheduled for examination that requires an employee to schedule an additional medical examination date, the employee shall be granted reasonable release time for the subsequent date, in accordance with the requirements specified above.
B.	Upon ten (10) work days notice, the department will allow the employee to use a State vehicle or equipment appropriate for the license examination. It is understood by the parties, that use of the equipment or vehicle may be delayed for operational reasons.
10.14	Unpaid Leave of Absence
A.	A department head or designee may grant an unpaid leave of absence for a period not to exceed one (1) year. The employee shall provide substantiation to support the employee's request for an unpaid leave of absence.
B.	Except as otherwise provided in Subsection C below, an unpaid leave of absence shall not be granted to any employee who is accepting some other position in State employment; or who is leaving State employment to enter other outside employment; or does not intend to, nor can reasonably be expected to, return to State employment on or before the expiration of the unpaid leave of absence. A leave, so granted, shall assure an employee the right to his/her former position upon termination of the leave. The term "former position" is defined in Government Code Section 18522.

B.	Upon permanent separation from State employment, an employee shall be paid for unused personal leave credits in the same manner as vacation or annual leave.
C.	Nothing in this section precludes the employer from offering a cash out program for all or a portion of unused personal leave. Personal leave credit shall be cashed out at the employee’s salary rate at the time the personal leave payment is made. Cash out programs, if offered, may differ from department to department and employee to employee.

If an employee has exhausted available leave credits, the employee may request unpaid leave, unless he/she is currently subject to attendance restrictions.
However, use of such leave shall not diminish an employee’s entitlement under the Family School Partnership Act to, upon reasonable notice to the employer, use up to eight (8) hours per month but not to exceed forty (40) hours per calendar year of accrued leave credits (annual leave, vacation, personal leave, holiday credits, CTO) for the purpose of attending school or pre-school related activities in which the employee’s child is participating.

If the employee has exhausted available leave credits, the employee may request unpaid leave.
Family is defined as the parent, stepparent, spouse, domestic partner that has been defined and certified with the Secretary of State’s office in accordance with Family Code Section 297, child, grandchild, grandparent, brother, sister, stepchild, or any person residing in the immediate household.

A.	The Union and the State (parties) to enhance the current age benefit factors on which service retirement benefits are based for Miscellaneous and Industrial members of the First Tier plan under the Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). The parties further agree that the provisions of this article will be effective only upon the CalPERS board adopting a Resolution that will employ, for the June 30, 1998 valuation and thereafter, 95% of the market value of CalPERS’ assets as the actuarial value of the assets, and to amortize the June 30, 1998 excess assets over a 20 year period, beginning July 1, 1999. The parties agree to jointly request the CalPERS board to extend the 20 year amortization period in the event the cost of these benefits or unfavorable returns on investments results in an increased employer contribution by the State.
B.	The legislative language provides the enhanced benefit factors to State employees who retire directly from State employment on and after January 1, 2000.
72
BU 12 01-04
C.	The table below compares the current First Tier age benefit factors to the improved factors that the proposed legislation would place in the part of the Government Code administered by CalPERS.

11.2	First Tier Eligibility for Employees in Second Tier
A.	The Union and the State (parties) agree that the legislation implementing this agreement shall contain language to allow employees who are currently in the Second Tier retirement plan to elect to be covered under the First Tier, as described in this article. The parties further agree that the provisions of this article will be effective only upon the CalPERS board adopting a Resolution that will employ, for the June 30, 1998 valuation and thereafter, 95% of the market value of CalPERS’ assets as the actuarial value of the assets, and to amortize the June 30, 1998 excess assets over a 20 year period beginning July 1, 1999. The parties agree to jointly request the CalPERS board to extend the 20 year amortization period in the event the cost of these benefits or unfavorable returns on investments results in an increased employer contribution by the State.
B.	The legislative language would allow an employee in the Second Tier to exercise the Tier 1 right of election at any time after the effective date of this legislation. An employee who makes this election would then be eligible to purchase past Second Tier service. The parties will work with CalPERS to establish more flexible purchase provisions for employees. These include, but are not limited to, increasing the installment period from 96 months (8 years) to 144 months (12 years) or up to 180 months (15 years), and allowing employees to purchase partial amounts of service.
C.	New employees who meet the criteria for CalPERS membership would be enrolled in the First Tier plan and have the right to be covered under the Second Tier plan within 180 days of the date of their appointment. If a new employee does not make an election for Second Tier coverage during this period, he or she would remain in the First Tier plan.
D.	Employees who purchase their past service would be required to pay the amount of contributions they would have paid had they been First Tier members during the period of service that they are purchasing. As required by CalPERS law, the amount will then include interest at 6 percent, annually compounded.

The parties agree to jointly request the CalPERS board to extend the 20 year amortization period in the event the cost of these benefits or unfavorable returns on investments results in an increased employer contribution by the State.
B.	The age benefit factor at age 55 for members of this Union will be 2.5% of compensation for each year of service. These improved benefit factors will apply to employees who retire directly from State service on and after January 1, 2000, and for service rendered as a Safety member prior to and after that date.

H.	IUOE agrees to notify any State employee who pays a Fair Share fee of his/her right to demand and receive from IUOE a return of any part of that fee paid by him/her which represents the employee’s traditional pro rata share of expenditures by IUOE that is either in aid of activities or causes of a partisan political or ideological nature only incidentally related to the employee’s terms and conditions of employment, or applied toward the cost of any other benefits available only to members of IUOE.
I.	A Fair Share form of organizational security enacted pursuant to this Article may be rescinded by a majority of employees in Unit 12, provided that (a) a request for such vote is supported by a petition containing the signature of at least thirty percent (30%) of the permanent full-time employees in the unit; (b) the vote is by secret ballot; (c) the vote may be taken at any time during the term of this Agreement.

Once an individual has been assigned to fill an unanticipated vacancy, his/her name shall be moved to the top of the seniority list and any subsequent vacancy shall continue to be filled by use of the list. If an employee has pre-approved vacation, the employer will assign the next least senior technician on the seniority list to fill the unanticipated vacancy and his/her name will move to the top of the list.
