Section B.	- Application.
Layoffs will be implemented according to the procedures described below. The provisions of this Article apply to all AFSCME Local 2818 Skilled Maintenance employees.
Section C.	- Definitions.
1.	Affected Employee: A regular full-time or regular part-time seniority employee.
2.	Seniority Employee: A regular full-time or regular part-time employee in a bargaining unit position who has completed their probationary period.
3.	Bargaining Unit Seniority: The length of continuous service in the bargaining unit regardless of the classification in which served. Bargaining unit seniority is based on the hire/transfer date into a position covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement.

7.	Business Unit: The specific company of the Employer, either McLaren Lapeer Region, McLaren Flint, or MMG.
Section D.	- Procedure.
1.	Whenever the Employer determines a layoff or scheduled hours reduction is necessary for a specific business unit, the number of hours and/or positions and the specific classifications to be eliminated or affected in a business unit and whether to implement a layoff, hours reduction, or combination of both will be determined by the Employer.
2.	The Employer will maintain lists for seniority regular full-time, seniority regular part-time
13
and casual employees based upon the individual’s bargaining unit seniority which will be applied between employees at the affected business unit.
3.	The determination of which employees will be affected will be made by the Employer in accordance with the provisions of this article. Affected employees will be identified from the employees in the affected positions and classifications in that department.
a.	The Employer will first reduce the scheduled hours of and/or terminate the employment of temporary employees in the identified classification(s) in that business unit.
b.	If there is further need to reduce staffing levels, the Employer will then reduce the scheduled hours of and/or terminate the employment of casual employees in the identified classification (s) in that business unit.
c.	If there is further need to reduce staffing levels, the Employer will seek volunteers for layoff or reduction in hours, whichever is applicable, within the affected business unit and job classification. A seniority volunteer accepts the layoff or reduction of hours until recalled per the provisions of this Article. If there is an excess of volunteers then selection will be by seniority (high to low). An employee who volunteers for layoff or reduction in hours does so for the balance of the layoff or reduction in hours.
d.	If there is further need to reduce staffing levels, the Employer will then reduce the hours of or terminate the employment, as the Employer deems appropriate, of those full-time and part-time employees in the identified classification(s) in that business unit who have not completed their new hire probationary period. Part-time employees will be laid off or have hours reduced before full-time employees are so impacted.
e.	If there is further need to reduce staffing levels, the Employer will then reduce the hours of or layoff those full-time and part-time employees in the identified classification (s) in that business unit who have completed their new hire probationary period and who are able to perform the available work without necessity of additional training. Selection will be made in inverse (lowest to highest) order of bargaining unit seniority in the identified job classification in the business unit (refer to Section C - Definitions). In cases of employees with the same bargaining unit seniority the employee with the lowest numerical value of the last four digits of
14
his/her social security number shall be deemed the most senior. Part-time employees will be laid off or have hours reduced before full-time employees are so impacted. Affected seniority employees (non-volunteers) will be assigned to an open position, if any, first in their business unit, then, if none are available, any available position in the bargaining unit, if the employee possesses the qualification required by the job and can perform the full scope of the new position with minimal orientation as defined by the Employer. If the employee chooses to not accept a comparable open position within the bargaining unit, he/she will be deemed a voluntary quit. If the employee refuses an open position which is not a comparable to the employee’s formerly held position, the employee shall remain of layoff status. Employees who cannot accommodate required shift or schedule changes will be laid off.
f.	If no such assignment is available, the'following procedure will be used:
1)	Affected non-volunteer seniority employees can displace a lower seniority employee in the same business unit, provided the displacing employee has sufficient seniority if the employee possesses the qualifications required by the job and can perform the full scope of the position with minimal orientation as defined by the Employer. All displacements will occur within the same business unit in which the affected employee is employed.
2)	If the affected non-volunteer seniority employee displaces another employee, as outlined above, she/he will assume the shift, schedule, and pay rate of the displaced employee.
3)	If the employee does not displace, the employee will be laid off for the duration of the reduction.
4)	A part-time employee cannot displace a full-time employee.
g.	During the term of this Agreement, the Union President and duly appointed stewards (not alternates) are granted super seniority status in their positions including shift within their business unit, during their term in office only in the event of a layoff. If the elected official must be designated for layoff, the official can replace a lower senior employee (bargaining unit seniority) in the business unit in an equal or lower job grouping provided he/she is qualified and capable of performing the work within a minimum orientation period. The official must assume the shift, hours and wage rate, if lower, of the employee replaced.
15
Section E.	- Notification of Layoff or Scheduled Hours Reduction.
1.	Each affected employee will be informed by the Employer of her/his scheduled hours reduction or layoff. It is understood and agreed that remaining seniority full-time and regular part-time employees can have their work hours/schedules adjusted by the Employer to fulfill its patient care and business obligations. Whenever possible, the Employer will provide to the Union President and all employees a minimum notice of seven (7) calendar days of the layoff, or of required regular schedule, shift or hours changes when applying this contract Article. Upon the request of the Union, a meeting shall be scheduled, within seventy-two (72) hours of the request, between the Union and the Employer representatives regarding the layoff or scheduled hours reduction. Employees affected by the layoff/reduction shall be notified following the meeting, but at least fourteen (14) calendar days before the layoff/reduction takes effect.
2.	All affected employees are eligible to apply for other available positions for which they qualify in accordance with the provision of the Job Posting Article. Employees who are laid off for ninety (90) days or more are required to apply for other available positions for which they qualify, or the Employer will dispute any related claims for unemployment compensation.
3.	Laid off employees who are unable to obtain other employment with the Employer will receive information regarding unemployment compensation and continuation of insurance coverages through COBRA (if applicable).
Section F.	- Pay At Termination.

2.	The seniority employee will be given a copy of the discipline.
Section H.

Section I. In taking disciplinary action, the Employer shall not take into account any incidents
20
which occurred more than two (2) years previously from the date of the current incident but can review an employee’s entire work history to assist in assessing the potential mitigation of penalty at the termination step. Any period in which the employee is on an approved leave of absence or other similar break in service does not count as service time for purposes of defining the time period during which corrective actions remain active.

ARTICLE 29	- LEAVES OF ABSENCE
Section A.	- Purpose:
To enable an employee to receive unpaid time off from work when it is necessary due to medical, family, personal, military, or educational reasons.
Section B.	- Eligibility:
FMLA:	Must have at least twelve (12) consecutive months of service, and also must
have worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the twelve (12)
36
months prior to the start of the leave, or as prescribed by applicable federal law or otherwise in accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA") and the regulations there under, as amended.
Military:	In accordance with applicable law.
Non-FMLA Health Leave: Full-time regular and part-time regular employees with at least one thousand forty (1,040) service hours during the twelve (12) months prior to the start of the leave who experience a work-related illness or injury.
Personal and Educational: Full-time regular and part-time regular employees with at least two thousand eighty (2,080) service hours.
Section C.	- Types of Leaves of Absence.
1.	FMLA
Employees who have twelve (12) months of consecutive employment and have worked at least one thousand two hundred fifty (1,250) hours during the twelve (12) months prior to commencement of leave are eligible for FMLA, in accordance with federal regulations. FMLA leaves may be requested for one of the following reasons:
a.	The birth and care of the newborn child of the employee**
b.	The placement with the employee of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care**
c.	To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition
d.	To take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition
e.	Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on active duty (or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in support of a contingency operation; and
f.	To care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the employee is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of the service member.
Under some circumstances, employees may take FMLA leave intermittently - which means taking leave in blocks of time, or by reducing their normal weekly daily work schedule.
37
**	An approved leave for birth and care, or placement for adoption or foster child must conclude within twelve (12) months of the birth or placement.
If an eligible employee requests a leave of absence for any of the above reasons, the approved leave of absence will be applied toward FMLA entitlements.
Available Leave Time
Eligible employees are entitled to a total of twelve (12) work weeks of unpaid leave during any twelve (12) month period for one or more of the reasons above.
Spouses employed by the same employer are jointly entitled to a combined total of twelve (12) work weeks of family leave for the birth and care of the newborn child, for placement of a child for adoption or foster care, and to care for a parent who has a serious health condition.
The Employer uses a rolling twelve (12) month period. A rolling twelve (12) month period means that twelve (12) month period is measured back from the date the employee uses any FMLA time.
FMLA Return to Work
If the employee returns to work within twelve (12) weeks from the commencement of the FMLA leave, the Employer will return the employee to an equivalent job classification.
If the employee does not return within twelve (12) weeks from the commencement of the FMLA leave, the employee’s shift and job classification will not be guaranteed.
Intermittent Leave
If FMLA leave is for birth and care or placement for adoption or foster care, use of intermittent leave is subject to approval.
If FMLA time is required on an intermittent basis, the Employer may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternate position with the equivalent pay and benefits that better accommodates recurring periods of absence, or a reduced work schedule.
Exhausting Maximum FMLA Leave Time
Once an employee exhausts their FMLA entitlement, they may extend their leave by requesting a personal leave. Please review “Requesting a Leave of Absence” in Section E of this Article.
38
2.	Personal Leave
Part-time regular and full-time regular employees who have at least two thousand eighty (2,080) service hours are eligible to request an unpaid Personal Leave for personal situations at the sole discretion of the supervisor when business conditions will allow. A personal leave will not be granted for purposes of seeking or trying out employment elsewhere.
Available Leave Time
There is a twelve (12) week maximum per rolling twelve (12) month period.
3.	Health Leave (non-FMLA)
Part-time regular and full-time regular employees who have at least one thousand forty (1,040) service hours during the twelve (12) months prior to the start of the leave, and who experience a work-related illness or injury, are eligible to request a Health Leave for absences due to the employee’s serious illness.
Available Leave Time
The first twelve (12) weeks of a leave due to work-related illness or injury will be considered a non-FMLA Health Leave and will not count toward the exhaustion of FMLA time. After twelve (12) weeks of non-FMLA Health Leave due to work-related illness or injury, FMLA will begin.
4.	Educational Leave
Part-time regular and full-time regular employees who have at least two thousand eighty (2,080) service hours are eligible to request an unpaid Education Leave for educational purposes providing the continued education relates to the employee’s current position, or a position within the Employer. Requests must be submitted no less than thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the leave.

This schedule is subject to the approval of the health care provider.
4.	Completed Health and FMLA leave requests and Health Certification forms must be returned directly to Human Resources or designee - not the employee’s supervisor or department. Completed requests for Personal or Educational leave must be submitted directly to the employee’s Department Director/Manager. After the Department
