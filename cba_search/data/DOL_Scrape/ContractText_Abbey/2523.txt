ARTICLE II	- RECOGNITION
The Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent for all covered employees described in Article I hereinabove.
ARTICLE III	- UNION SHOP
It shall be a condition of employment that all employees of the Company covered by this Agreement who are members of the Union in good standing on the effective date of this Agreement shall remain members in good standing, and those who are not members on the effective date of this Agreement shall, on or after the 90th day following the effective date of this Agreement, become and remain members in good standing in the Union. It shall also be a condition of employment that all employees covered by this Agreement and hired on or after its effective date, shall on or after the 90th day following the beginning of such employment, become and remain members in good standing in the Union.
ARTICLE IV	- CHECK-OFF
The Company agrees to deduct membership dues, initiation fees and any other obligations an employee may have with the Union from the pay checks of all covered employees on a monthly basis, the first pay period of each month, provided that the Company has received from each employee, on whose account such deductions are made, an authorization check-off form, as required by law, and it will transmit the total amount of such deductions to the Union Office on or before the tenth (10th) day of each month, accompanied by forms provided by the Union. Whenever an employee quits, is discharged, laid off, or his employment is otherwise terminated, any of the foregoing amounts will be deducted from the last pay to be made. A new check-off form is required for any change in status of employee, such as name change, social security number change or change of beneficiary for life insurance.
4
ARTICLE V	- HOURS OF WORK
Section 1:	Overtime Work
This article is intended only to be construed as a basis for overtime and shall not be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week. Overtime shall not be paid more than once for the same hours worked.
Section 2:	Overtime Pay
An employee shall be paid one and one-half (172) times his regular hourly rate of pay for all hours worked by him in excess of eight (8) hours [for all employees on 8-hours shifts] in any workday or forty (40) hours in his workweek.

Section 5:	Reporting Pay
An employee who is scheduled or notified to report to work and who does report for work shall be provided with and assigned to at least a minimum of four (4) hours of work. If production is canceled or work is not otherwise available, the employee who reports to work shall be guaranteed four (4) hours work or four (4) hours pay in lieu thereof unless the employee has been advised by the Company not to report to work at least two (2) hours prior to the scheduled shift. In the event such work is not available, the employee shall be released from duty and credited with a reporting allowance of four (4) times his regular hourly rate of pay. The foregoing Section does not apply if employees are released because of circumstances beyond the control of the Company or because of acts of God. An employee who is scheduled to report for work and who does report for work without notice not to do so shall be guaranteed at least four (4) hours work or four (4) hours pay at his regular hourly rate of pay in lieu thereof. The Company shall not be liable under this provision in the event of an act of God, such as fire, flood, power failure, snowstorm, or in the event of other emergency situations, which are beyond the control of the Company, such as machinery breakdown. However, if the Company instructs employees to remain pending possible resumption of operations, the employee shall receive his regular rate for the period of time that he was required to stay. Employees shall advise the Company of a working telephone number where they can be contacted. The Company will be considered to have notified an employee if it calls that number, regardless of whether it speaks to the employee, or leaves a message, a least two (2) hours prior to the employee's shift. It is the responsibility of the employee to provide the Company with a working number and check for messages.
5

In addition, each employee shall be allowed a five (5) minute personal wash-up period at the end of his work day, but no wash-up period shall be allowed preceding lunch or rest periods. The rest or wash-up periods allowed by this Section shall not be deducted in computing the time worked by an employee.
