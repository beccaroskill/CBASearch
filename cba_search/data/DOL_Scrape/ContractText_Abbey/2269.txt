To qualify for “Regular Employee” status an employee must have a valid A CDL, and must be D.O.T. qualified to drive
(d)	Casual Employees may be called to work in any order.
(e)	Probationary Employees will be called to work in order of their seniority out of the employees in the probationary status.

Within thirty (30) days after signing this Agreement and at least annually thereafter the Employer shall post in a place at the employee’s home terminal, and shall mail to the Union, a list of the regular employees covered by this Agreement arranged according to their seniority. Protests to any employee’s seniority date or position on such list must be made, in writing, to the Employer within thirty (30) calendar days after such seniority date or position first appears, and if no protests are timely made, the dates and positions posted shall be deemed correct. Any such protest which is timely filed may be submitted to the Grievance Procedure.
(c)	Any employee on the seniority list who is absent because of illness or injury shall continue to accrue seniority during such absence for the purpose of determining his place on the seniority list.

In the event the employee fails to comply with the above, he shall lose all seniority rights under this Agreement.
21
For use under this section (d) only, a lay-off shall be defined as five (5) consecutive work days during which an employee has not been afforded work opportunity. An employee so affected may request a written lay-off notice, with copies to the shop steward and Union, and further, require the Employer to implement the recall procedure as provided herein. This is not intended to relieve the Employer of his obligation to offer the employee, consistent with his seniority standing, such daily employment as may occur during periods of layoff, prior to formal recall, nor shall it change current practices relative to an employee’s opportunity to bump as provided in Article 21, Section 4(f) & (g).
(e)	If requested by the Local Union in writing within sixty (60) days after the effective date of this agreement, one steward shall be granted super-seniority for lay-off and recall. Any additional application of super-seniority for stewards must be justified as being directly related to the proper performance of the steward’s duties as steward and permitted by applicable law.
(f)	The Local Union and the Employer shall agree, on circumstances under which persons who leave the classification of work covered by this Agreement, but remain in the employ of the Employer in some other capacity, may retain seniority rights upon their return to their original unit. In the absence of such agreement, such employee shall lose all seniority rights upon leaving.
Section 4
(a)	Seniority shall prevail in that the Employer recognizes the general principle that senior employees shall have preference to choose on a permanent basis the job where the rate is highest, and have the choice of day or night shift, provided such employee is qualified for such work. Loads, runs, positions, starting times, classifications and shifts, are subject to seniority and shall be posted for bids. The Employer will not post starting times which are less than fifteen (15) minutes apart. Posting shall be in a conspicuous place so that all eligible employees will receive notice of the run, load or position open for bid, and such posting of bids shall be made not more than once each calendar year, except for loads, runs, or positions which shall be bid daily as provided in Section 4(e).

(d)	An employee who is temporarily laid-off from his bid starting time (either daily lay-off or letter of lay-off) may be called in if work develops. If such work is available at his regular starting time he
22
must be paid from his regular bid starting time. If such work becomes available on another shift at a different starting time, the employee accepting such work, shall be paid from the commencement of the other shift or starting time. Provided, however, the starting time for an employee called in for work on any given shift as a daily replacement for an employee reporting off, shall commence upon the employee reporting for work. A maximum of one (1) hour reporting time shall be allowed to report for work unless otherwise mutually agreed to.
(e)	Runs, loads, or positions are subject to seniority and shall be bid daily. The bid posting shall include a general description of the territory covered, whether the truck is loaded or not, total number of cases, half kegs and quarter kegs, number of stops, truck number, the commission value of the load and the weight of the load
(f)	Runs, loads, or positions will be made available a minimum of fifteen (15) minutes prior to the earliest starting time each day and will be bid each day in seniority order. The employees, in seniority order, shall be awarded the runs or loads of their choice. Runs, loads, or positions will begin at the starting time of the employee choosing the run, load, or position. Provided, however, special or party runs or loads will be dispatched at the Employer’s discretion.
Runs, loads, or positions must be covered by at least one seniority employee, unless mutually agreed to. If on any given day the number of loads, runs, or positions to be dispatched exceeds the number of available seniority employees, the Employer reserves the right to set aside, prior to the commencement of bidding, a number of loads, runs, or positions equal to the total number of loads, runs or positions exceeding the total number of seniority employees available that day. Those set aside loads, runs, or positions may then be assigned and dispatched at the discretion of the Employer.
Provided, however, any employee desiring a set aside load, run, or position but deprived of same, shall be compensated for any monetary difference between his load, run or position for that day and the desired load, run, or position set aside. Further provided that the employee has chosen the highest paying load available at the time of their pick in the bid process.
The bidding process must be completed within fifteen (15) minutes subsequent to each shift starting time, unless the Employer fails to post bids in a timely fashion as provided above. Should the employees, on any given day, cause the bidding process to exceed the fifteen (15) minutes subsequent to each shift, the Employer may, on the day following, void for that one day the daily bid process and make run or load assignments.
23
Any employee who is tardy (a minimum of one click of the clock beyond the employee’s scheduled starting time) shall be passed over in the bid process and fall to the bottom seniority position within that starting time for bid purposes on that particular day.
All non-seniority employees shall be subject to assignment at the Employer’s discretion, in accordance with the set aside load, run, or position language above.
(g)	When it becomes necessary to reduce the working force, the last man hired in a job classification shall be laid off first, and when the force is again increased, the men are to return to work in the reverse order in which they were laid off according to their seniority roster. If still not scheduled for work on a Monday following five (5) consecutive days of lay-off, as defined elsewhere in this Agreement, employees with greater terminal seniority, if qualified, may bump employees with lesser terminal seniority.
(h)	Once an employee exercises his right to bump, that employee must remain in that position for the duration of the annual bid, unless he is again unscheduled for work on a Monday following five (5) consecutive days of lay-off, seniority permitting he would then be able to bump again.
Employees wishing to bump in accordance with this provision must notify the Employer on a Friday, so the changes can be made for the following Monday. Employees who are affected by a bump may themselves bump the day they are notified and all terms of this provision shall apply.
(i)	“EXTRA WAREHOUSE”
On any given regular work day when “EXTRA. WAREHOUSE” position(s) are bid during the morning daily bid process the following shall apply;
•	Daily bid “EXTRA WAREHOUSE” personnel may be assigned to make “HOT SHOT’ deliveries at management’s discretion.
•	Daily bid “EXTRA WAREHOUSE” personnel have no ability to decline a “HOT SHOT’ delivery assignment.
•	When there is more than one (1) “EXTRA WAREHOUSE” position bid on any given day the employee’s in these positions may exercise their seniority position to defer a “HOT SHOT’ delivery assignment to a lessor seniority employee working in the same “EXTRA WAREHOUSE” position.
Section 5

24
facility(s) is transferred, in whole or in part, to another facility(s) of the same employer, or when a product handled by the employer is transferred to another facility of the same employer, the employees at the closed or partially closed facility(s), or at the facility from which the product is being transferred (“The losing facility”), shall have the right to bid into a master seniority roster comprised of bidders from the seniority rosters of closed or partially closed facility(s) in seniority order of their continuous seniority. Employees shall bid from the combined master seniority roster into openings at the facility into which the work is transferred. Employees transferring shall be “dovetailed” into the appropriate seniority roster at the new facility in the order of their continuous company seniority.
If any of the above shall take place the company will provide the union the necessary case volume information to determine the number of employees affected, before such change takes place. When the company and the union agree as to the number of men affected, that number of men will be permitted to exercise their seniority rights as specified above.
