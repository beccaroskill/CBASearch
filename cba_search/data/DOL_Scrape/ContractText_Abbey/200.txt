PREAMBLE
The parties to this Agreement recognize and appreciate the unique challenge and opportunity inherent in an ESOP Company. We - all employees - must work together to achieve the ultimate goal of a strong successful Weirton Steel Corporation.
We have defined a strong, successful Weirton Steel Corporation as a fully integrated steel mill which will offer secure, necessary jobs and secure pensions for our employees and which will offer a strong economic base for our communities and valley.
To achieve our ultimate goal we recognize that initially employees must make a financial sacrifice. Through this Agreement - imperfect as it may be - we have attempted to make the sacrifice as equal and equitable as possible among all employees.
The necessity of our sacrifice is clear. It is our sacrifice which will yield the profit to purchase and rebuild the mill.
We believe that the sacrifice will not have to continue for a long period of time. When the Weirton Steel Corporation is successful and profitable our sacrifice will be replaced by reward. As shareholders and employees we will reap the full benefit of working at and owning Weirton Steel Corporation.
Let us start our New Beginning!
1

AGREEMENT
A.l
This agreement entered into this 26th day of October, 2001, is between Weirton Steel Corporation, (hereinafter referred to as the “Company”), and INDEPENDENT STEELWORKERS UNION, existing under and by virtue of the laws of West Virginia (hereinafter referred to as the “Union”).

LI
I.	Definition of “Employee.” The term “employee” when and as used in this Agreement shall include all production, maintenance and hourly-rated plant clerical employees of the company’s Weirton, West Virginia, and Steubenville, Ohio, plants and the Company recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all such employees; excluding, however, office clerical, salaried, professional and technical employees, and also guards and supervisors, as defined
2
ARTICLE I
in the National Labor Relations Act. The provisions of this Agreement constitute the sole procedure for the processing and settlement of any claim by any employee or the Union of violation by the Company of this Agreement. As the representative of the employees, the Union may process grievances through the grievance procedure, including arbitration, in accordance with this Agreement or adjust or settle the same.
1.2
2.	Exclusion of Supervisors. A list of the plant supervisors to be excluded from the bargaining unit as defined in Section A. of this Article together with their present titles shall be prepared by the Company and shall be submitted to the Union within thirty (30) days after the date this Agreement is signed. Any dispute as to the inclusion or exclusion of any employee of or from such list may be considered a grievance and may be disposed of under this grievance procedure, Article IX hereof.
1.3
3.	Performance of Work by Supervisors. A supervisory employee shall perform no work of the type customarily performed by employees within the bargaining unit, except when necessary due to emergencies or to other causes beyond the control of the Company, or for the purposes of instructing and training employees.
3
ARTICLE I
Section B.	Purpose
1.4 The purpose of this Agreement is to set forth the basic principles which, during the term of this Agreement, shall govern wages, rates of pay, hours of work and conditions of employment of all employees included within the recognized bargaining unit.
Section C.	No Discrimination
1.5 It is the continuing policy of the Company and the Union that the provisions of this Agreement shall be applied to all employees without regard to race, color, religious creed, sex, national origin, age or handicap.
Section D.	Scope
1.6 When Management establishes a new or changed job in a plant so that duties involving a significant amount of production or maintenance work, or both, which is performed on a job within the bargaining unit (or, in the case of new work, would be performed on such a job) are combined with duties not normally performed on a job within the bargaining unit, the resulting job in the plant shall be considered as within the bargaining unit.
4
ARTICLE I
This provision shall not be construed as enlarging or diminishing whatever rights exist in respect of withdrawal of non-bargain)ng unit duties from a job in the bargaining unit, provided that where non-bargaining unit duties are placed in a job in the bargaining unit under this provision, such duties may be withdrawn at any time. Management shall, on request, furnish to the Union reasonable information to permit determination of questions of compliance with this provision.
Section E.	Temporary Supervisors
1.7
1. A bargaining unit employee who is assigned as a temporary supervisor as of the effective date of this Agreement or who is thereafter so assigned shall not cease to be an employee, although initial assignments to such position and terms and conditions of employment applicable to the position shall continue to be solely as determined by the Company.
1.8 2. Any temporary supervisor may be so assigned for an initial period of up to six months. Non-consecutive periods shall be accumulated. If such an assignment continues for longer than six months, the Union may require the Company to meet and review the circumstances surrounding that assignment. If the Company
5
ARTICLE I
determines that the position must continue to be filled on a temporary basis, the Union may elect whether to (a) have the current temporary supervisor continue to occupy the position, or (b) have the current temporary supervisor returned to the bargaining unit, at which time the Company may assign the position to a different employee. A temporary supervisor who has served in such capacity for six months or longer, upon his or her return to the bargaining unit in accordance with (b) above, shall not work as a temporary supervisor during the six-month period following his return to the unit. Extensions awarded in accordance with (a) above shall continue for as long as six months, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
1.9
3.	An employee assigned as a temporary supervisor on a weekly basis will not work in the bargaining unit during the week in which he or she is assigned as a temporary supervisor unless bargaining unit employees are not available to perform the work. An employee will not be assigned as a temporary supervisor merely as a means of retaining him or her in employment or of recalling him or her from layoff at a time when the application of his or her bargaining unit seniority would not otherwise result in his or her retention in employment.
6
ARTICLE I
1.10
4.	An employee assigned as a temporary supervisor will not issue discipline to employees, provided that this provision will not prevent a temporary supervisor from relieving an employee from work for the balance of the turn for alleged misconduct.
1.11
5.	The Company shall notify the Chairman of the concerned Union Divisional Committee of any temporary supervisor assignment as soon as is practicable, but no later than two (2) calendar weeks after that bargaining unit employee’s first turn worked as a temporary supervisor.

This addition was identified as a Trade or Craft convention and was recorded as a separate item in Factor 7 of the agreed upon classification.
Section D.	Repair and Maintenance Jobs
2.14
1.	Trade or Craft Jobs
Due to the nature of services to be performed in construction, rehabilitation of facilities, and in repair and maintenance work, the job content requirements of trade or craft jobs vary from time to time. Also, the varying qualifications and abilities of the individual trade or craft employees involved. Therefore, the job description of a trade or craft job is required to reflect the scope of duties which a fully qualified journeyman may be called upon to perform in the plant, and the job classification is required to reflect the related job con
11
ARTICLE II
tent requirements of the job. For each job classification thus developed for a trade or craft job, as listed below, there shall be established three (3) hourly wage rates, such rates to include:
2.15 A “standard rate” equal to the plant standard hourly wage scale rate for the respective job class of the job.
2.16 An “intermediate rate” at a level two job classes below the standard rate.
2.17 A “starting rate” at a level four job classes below the standard rate.
2.18 a. The trade or craft jobs are as follows:
Bricklayer
Electrician (Armature Winder) Machinist
Roll Turner
Welder

ARTICLE II
2.20 Additional trade or craft jobs may be established by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union.
2.21 b. A schedule of apprentice rates for the respective apprentice training periods of 1,040 hours of actual training experience with the Company in the trade or craft in each training period is established at the level of the standard hourly wage scale rates for the respective job classes.
2.22 c. An employee who satisfactorily completes a Company apprenticeship course in a given trade or craft shall be assigned to the established starting rate of the respective trade or craft and, coincident with this assignment to the starting rate, shall be afforded an opportunity, upon request, to take the craft determination test for the purpose of ascertaining his proficiency for assignment to the intermediate or standard rate. If an employee initially fails to qualify beyond the starting rate of the craft, he shall thereafter, at 1,040-hour intervals of actual work for the Company in the given trade or craft, be given the opportunity to take the craft determi
14
ARTICLE II
nation test for progression to the standard rate. If an employee qualifies for the intermediate rate of the craft, he shall thereafter, at 1,040-hour intervals of actual work for the Company in the given trade or craft, be given the opportunity to take the craft determination test for progression to the standard rate.
2.23 When the craft determination test discloses that an employee has satisfactory qualifications and ability for assignment either to the intermediate or the standard rate of the craft, that employee shall be reclassified accordingly.
2.24 When the craft determination test discloses that an employee does not have satisfactory qualifications and ability for assignment to the standard rate level of that craft, the Company shall make available to him such training (classroom and on-the-job, or both) for such period of time as may reasonably be required to permit him to qualify for the standard rate of the craft.
2.25 d. With the exception of employees described in the preceding paragraph d., each employee in the plant
15
ARTICLE II
regularly performing the described work of a journeyman in a given trade or craft who, as of the date of the Basic Labor Agreement in effect, is assigned to the established starting rate or intermediate rate classification of the respective trade or craft shall, subject to the following provisions of this paragraph d., continue under such assignment during such period of time as the employee continues to perform such work. Each employee subsequently hired as a journeyman shall be assigned either to the starting rate, intermediate rate, or standard rate classification of the respective trade or craft, which assignment shall be on the basis of each individual employee’s qualifications and ability in relation to requirements of the job under consideration. Employees assigned to starting rates or intermediate rates as of the date of the Basic Labor Agreement in effect, and those subsequently hired as journeymen and thus assigned, may thereafter, at regular intervals of 1,040 hours of actual work for the Company in the given trade or craft, request and shall receive a determination of qualifications and ability, and shall be reclassified into the next higher rate classification of the respective trade or craft if such determination discloses that satisfactory qualifications and ability have been developed by the employees during the intervening period of
16
ARTICLE II
time.
2.26 e. The determination of employee qualifications and ability shall be made by the company subject to review in the grievance procedure of the Agreement in effect of any right either party may have under such Agreement.
2.27 f. Employees who possess the requisite qualifications and ability shall be eligible, together with other recruits, for apprentice training in the respective trades or crafts as the need requires.
2.28 g. The number of trade or craft employees shall be determined by the Company. The placement or displacement of such employees on or from such jobs shall be in accordance with the Agreement. Displaced trade or craft employees may be placed on position rated jobs and shall be paid the position rate of the job.

Section F.	New and Adjusted Incentives
2.45
The April 27, 1953 Agreement as amended between the Company and the Union with respect to establishment of incentives shall continue in effect during the term of this Agreement. The procedures set forth herein for the establishment of incentives are:
26
ARTICLE II
2.46 1. The Company may establish new incentives to cover:
2.47 a. new jobs;
2.48 b. jobs not presently covered by incentive applications; or
2.49 c. jobs covered by an existing incentive plan where, during a current three-month period, the straight-time average hourly earnings of employees under the plan are equal to or less than the average of the standard hourly wage rates for such employees.
2.50 d. jobs covered by an existing incentive plan where it is practicable to supplement the production based incentive standards with quality based incentive standards.
Each incentive plan, thus installed will be subject to provisions as follows:
(1)	The plan will be effective for a ninety (90) day trial period during which the Union may reject the plan for
27
ARTICLE II
adverse effect on plan equity.
(2)	The Quality Standards or Quality Index provisions will be established using a 7 pay period base period that is mutually agreed to be representative; the quality standards will not be applicable to substandard product resulting from equipment failure(s), the duration of which is significantly beyond base period experience.
2.51 2. The following shall apply to the adjustments or replacements of incentives:
2.52 a. The Company shall adjust an incentive to preserve its integrity when it requires modifications to reflect new or changed conditions which are not sufficiently extensive to require cancellation and replacement of the incentive and which result from mechanical improvements made by the Company in the interest of improved methods or products, or from changes in equipment, manufacturing processes or methods, materials processed, or quality or manufacturing standards. Such adjustment shall be established in accordance with the procedure set forth in Article II, E. 5.
28
ARTICLE II
2.53 b. The Company shall establish a new incentive to replace an existing incentive when such new or changed conditions as defined in paragraph 2. a. above are of such magnitude that replacement of the incentive is required.
2.54 c. In the event that an incentive is to be replaced pursuant to paragraph 2. b. above, and such replacement incentive is not ready for installation, the Company shall establish an interim period, until such incentive is applied, as follows:
2.55
(I)	The interim period shall continue until the Company installs the new incentive, which shall be at the earliest practicable date following cancellation of the incentive to be replaced, but not later than six (6) months from such cancellation unless such period is extended by mutual agreement between the Company and the Union. In the event the Company is unable to install the new incentive within a six-month period, the Company will so advise the Union’s Incentive and Rate Committee in writing with reasons therefore, not less than fifteen (15) days prior to expiration of such six-month
29
ARTICLE 11
period.
2.56
(2)	Each employee on the respective job during the interim period shall receive, in addition to the applicable standard hourly wage scale rate in appendix I-A and the applicable hourly additive, a special hourly interim allowance equal to the percentage equivalent of the straight-time average hourly earnings (which do not include the applicable hourly additive) above the standard hourly wage rates in Appendix 1-A of all regularly assigned incumbents of the job during the three (3) months immediately proceeding cancellation of the incentive, provided the average performance of such three-month period is maintained. If the job involved is a new job, the interim allowance shall be the average interim allowance of the incumbents to whom such allowance applies expressed as an average of the applicable percentages.
2.57
(3)	Such special hourly interim allowance shall be identified with the job; apply to any employee while on such job; and continue in effect until the replacement of the cancelled incentive becomes effective.
30
ARTICLE II
2.58
(4)	In case an employee receiving a special hourly interim allowance voluntarily maintains a performance appreciably below that of the three (3) months immediately preceding cancellation of the incentive, after notification of such employee and his Union Steward, application of the special hourly interim allowance may be suspended during such further portion of the interim period as the lower rate of performance is voluntarily maintained.
2.59 3. New incentives established pursuant to Article II, F. I. and Article II, F.2.b. above shall be established in accordance with the following procedure:
2.60 a. The Company will develop the proposed incentive;
2.61 b. The proposal will be submitted to the Union’s Incentive and Rate Committee for the purpose of explaining the incentive and arriving at agreement as to its installation. The Company shall, at such time, furnish such explanation with regard to the
31
ARTICLE II
development and determination of the incentive as shall reasonably be required in order to enable the Union Representatives to understand how such incentive was developed and determined and shall afford to such Union Representatives a reasonable opportunity to be heard with regard to the proposed incentive;
2.62 c. If agreement is not reached, the matter shall be reviewed in complete detail by the Union’s Incentive and Rate Committee and the Company for purpose of arriving at mutual agreement as to installation of the incentive;
2.63 d. Should agreement not be reached within five (5) days after the Company proposal is submitted, the proposed new incentive may be installed by the Company and the employee or employees affected may at any time after thirty (30) days, but within sixty (60) days following the installation, file a grievance alleging that the new incentive does not provide equitable incentive compensation. Such grievance shall be processed under the Grievance Procedure of this Agreement. Any such grievance shall be decided upon the basis of whether or not
32
ARTICLE II
the new standard time values accurately reflect the work load of the job and therefore do or do not provide equitable incentive compensation. Any such decision shall be effective as of the date when the new incentive was put into effect;
2.64 e. In the event the Company does not develop an incentive, as provided in Article II, F.2.b. above, the employee or employees affected may, if filed promptly, process a grievance under the Grievance Procedure of this Agreement requesting that an incentive be installed in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If any such grievance is granted it shall be effective as of the date when the grievance was filed.
2.65 4. When an incentive is replaced pursuant to Article II, E.2.b. above, the incentive earnings (which do not include the applicable hourly additive) expressed as a percentage above the Appendix I-A standard hourly wage rate on the replacement incentive for a job covered thereunder shall not be less than the percentage of incentive earnings (which do not include the applicable hourly additive) received as an average by all regularly assigned incumbents of that job under the replacement
33
ARTICLE II
incentive during the three (3) months preceding its cancellation provided that the average performance during such three-month period is maintained. As to any job which did not exist under the replacement incentive, the average percentage calculated for jobs which did exist under the replacement incentive, the average percentage calculated for jobs which did exist shall apply under the same conditions.
2.66
5. Adjusted incentives, established pursuant to Article II, F.2.a. above, shall be established in accordance with the following procedure:
2.67 a. The Company will develop and install the adjustment as soon as practicable;
2.68 b. The adjustment will be submitted to the Union’s Incentive and Rate Committee for the purpose of notification, and the Company shall furnish such explanation of the adjustment as shall reasonably be required to enable the Union’s Incentive and Rate Committee to understand how such adjustment was developed;
34
ARTICLE II
2.69 c. The employees affected may at any time after thirty (30) days, but within sixty (60) days following installation, file a grievance which shall be processed under the Grievance Procedure of this Agreement. Any such grievance shall be decided upon the basis of compliance with the requirements of Article II, F.2.a. above, and if any such grievance is granted it shall be effective as of the date when the adjustment was put into effect;
2.70 d. In the event the Company does not adjust an incentive as provided in Article II, F.2.a. above, the employee or employees affected may, if filed promptly, process a grievance under the Grievance Procedure of this Agreement requesting that an adjustment to the incentive be installed in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

ARTICLE III
HOURS OF WORK
Section A.	Scope
3.1 This Article defines the normal hours of work and shall not be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week. This Article shall not be considered as any basis for the calculation or payment of overtime which is covered solely by Article IV - Overtime.
Section B.	Normal Workday
3.2
The normal workday shall be eight (8) consecutive hours of work in a twenty-four-hour period.
Section C.	Schedules
3.3
1.	Posting and Changes in Weekly Schedules.
a. Schedules showing employees’ workdays shall be posted or otherwise made known to employees in accordance with prevailing practices but not later than Thursday of the week preceding the calendar week in which the schedule becomes effective. Weekly working schedules providing split days off shall not be continued unless a weekly working schedule providing consecutive days off regularly
55
ARTICLE III
would require the payment of overtime and weekly working schedules requiring six (6) consecutive days or more of work will be continued or established only where agreeable to the majority of employees involved. However, all such weekly working schedules which do not provide consecutive days off each week or which provide six (6) consecutive days or more of work as presently in effect shall be deemed to have been agreed to by the employees involved and the Union subject to the right of the Union to seek revision thereof to conform to the five (5) consecutive days of work and two (2) consecutive days off pattern upon sixty (60) days’ notice to the Company. During any such sixty-day period, the existing schedule shall be reviewed, alternate schedules discussed and, if appropriate, employees canvassed as to their desires. It is understood that any transition from present schedules to five (5) and two (2) schedules as contemplated in this paragraph shall be conducted in an orderly manner and where additional time is required to assure an orderly transition, the Company will so notify the Union Steward or Stewards involved.
3.4 b. Schedules may be changed by the Company at any time; provided, however, that any changes made after
56
ARTICLE III
Thursday of the week preceding the calendar week in which the changes are to be effective shall be explained at the earliest practicable time to the Union Steward of the employees affected; and provided further that, with respect to any such schedules, no changes shall be made after Thursday except for breakdowns or other matters beyond the control of the Company. Any claimed violation by the Company of the provisions of this paragraph 1. with respect to weekly work schedules shall be the proper subject of a grievance under the Grievance Procedure. If a schedule is posted after Thursday of the week preceding the calendar week in which the schedule becomes effective in violation of the Company’s obligation set forth in Section C, La. above, or is changed after Thursday of the week preceding the calendar week in which the changes are to be effective, the Company will notify those employees affected by the late or revised posting who are not scheduled to be at work between the time the new or revised schedule is actually posted and the time that the employee is next scheduled to report to work, provided, however, that this obligation will not exist in departments or areas thereof in which an established scheduling pattern exists and in which employees are scheduled in accordance with such pattern for the subsequent week, regardless of when
57
ARTICLE Ill
the schedule is actually posted.
3.5
2.	Division of Overtime. Opportunities for overtime work shall be equally divided among available incumbents performing the same kind of work in the same group or sequence, consistent with rules and regulations to be adopted by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union. However, the Company may hold over Craft employees to complete assigned jobs, regardless of overtime standing/seniority, for the first four (4) hours of overtime, further, all overtime agreements will include the common charging language agreed to during the 1996 negotiations. Effective June 8, 2001, the common charging language may be modified by local agreement. Records showing the distribution of overtime opportunity, together with records of call-outs and attempted call-outs setting forth; all pertinent facts in connection therewith (including date, time, phone number called, person called, person taking the call, etc.) shall be maintained by the Company for at least three (3) months. Where such records are compiled electronically, such recordings will be maintained for such period unless and until transcribed; and such records, or the transcriptions thereof, shall be made available to the Steward involved during normal business hours. In the event such record becomes the sub
58
ARTICLE III
ject of a grievance, it shall be maintained, in original or transcribed form, until such grievance is finally resolved.
3.6
4. Overtime. When employees qualified to perform the work could be recalled from layoff because it is reasonably foreseeable that there will be work for such employees for a period of two (2) or more weeks, then Management will notify the Union if it decides to have such work performed on an overtime basis instead of recalling employees. Upon the request of the appropriate Grievance Committeeman, Management will discuss with him the reason for its decision and any suggested alternative. Such discussion will constitute full compliance with the requirements of this provision.

When such an employee who starts to work is released from duty because work is no longer available to him because of failure of power or other utilities or acts of God, including weather conditions, before he works a minimum of two (2) hours, he shall be paid for the time worked in accordance with Article II - Rates of Pay and credited with a reporting allowance equal to the standard hourly wage rate of the job for which he was scheduled or notified to report multiplied by the unutilized portion of the two-hour minimum.

Vacation time off will be allotted shortly after receipt of the vacation requests by the appropriate supervisor working together with the Union’s Divisional Vacation Scheduling Committee, and once allotted, changes in scheduled vacation time off can be made only for cause and with approval of the supervisor involved and the appropriate Divisional Vacation Scheduling Committee. In addition, the several Divisional Scheduling Committees and their Management counterparts shall meet at least quarterly (on or about February 1, May 1, August 1 and November 1 of each year) to review the then current "star jobs" and vacation allocations in light of the then current economic conditions and production and maintenance levels within the plant and shall make such adjustments as are appropriate to reflect anticipated changes during the succeeding quarter as to which

6.33
5.	Vacation time off will, so far as practicable, be granted at times most desired by employees (with the understanding that longer service employees are given preference as to choice; such preference to be exercised only before the schedule of vacation time off is established) but the final right to allot vacation periods and to change such allotments is exclusively reserved to the Company in order to insure the orderly operation of the plant.

Seniority is defined as the relative status of employees subject to the qualifications set forth in Section B., with respect to length of continuous service on a job or within the Company.
8.2
2.	Where reference is made in this Article to the phrase "as the Company and the Union may mutually agree" or to similar words having substantially the same meaning, it is understood that the Company may rely upon written confirmations of any such agreements by the President and Office Manager of the Union regardless of the requirements arising under the charter, bylaws or otherwise within the Union regarding any such Union agreements.
Section B.	Application of Seniority
8.3
1.	Application Defined. Employees within the bargaining unit in accordance with the rules and regulations hereinafter set forth shall be given consideration in respect to promotional opportunity for positions not excluded from the bargaining unit, transfer requests and
94
ARTICLE Vlll
job security upon a decrease of forces and preference upon reinstatement after layoff in accordance with their seniority status relative to one another provided, with respect to layoff or recalls, the employee with the greater seniority has the ability to perform the available work and provided, with respect to promotions and transfer requests, that the senior employee’s experience, training and performance record with the Company indicate that he has sufficient skill and ability to perform efficiently the work required on the vacant job or in a new department.
8.4 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the parties recognize their obligations under Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (No. 93-12) to make reasonable accommodations for the placement of qualified handicapped employees on the jobs which they are capable of performing and to provide such employees with promotional opportunities which are consistent with their handicaps. Such accommodations will be made by agreement, as individual cases dictate.
Section C.	Description of Seniority Units
8.5
1.	Company Seniority Unit. An employee’s Company Seniority shall be based upon his length of continuous
95
ARTICLE VIII
service with the Company within the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement.
2.	Department Seniority Unit
8.6 a. An employee’s Department Seniority shall be based upon his length of continuous service with the Company. Departments recognized for seniority purposes are:
Dept. No. I Coke and Plant and River Docks
Dept. No. 2 Blast Furnace and Sinter Plant
Dept. No. 3 Open Hearth and Bessemer
Dept. No. 4 Blooming Mill and Structural Mill
Dept. No. 4A Basic Oxygen Process and Continuous Casting
Dept. No. 5 Central Maintenance and Services
Dept. No. 6 Sheet Mill
Dept. No. 7 Steubenville Plant
Dept. No. 8 Weirton Tin Mill

96
ARTICLE VIII
8.7 The Mason and General Labor and Construction Departments shall include all jobs presently included therein, together with all jobs which may become available because of temporary construction work and such other group or groups of jobs as the Company and Union may agree from time to time.
8.8 b. Sub-departments are presently recognized in departments No. 2, No. 5, No. 10, and No. 11 and may be recognized in additional departments as the Company and the Union may mutually agree. The Seniority status and other seniority conditions applicable to employees employed with subdepartments shall be governed by sub-department agreements or practices as presently in effect or as they may be amended or changed by agreement of the Company and the Union except that employees of recognized sub-departments cannot, by reason of such practices or agreements, acquire seniority rights outside such recognized sub-departments which differ from those enjoyed by other employees.
8.8a c. In any department in which sub-departments are
97
ARTICLE VIII
now recognized or are subsequently agreed to by the Company and the Union, an employee’s Subdepartment Seniority shall be based upon his length of continuous service with the Company.
8.9 d. Existing departments may be eliminated or combined under such terms and conditions as the Company and the Union may mutually agree.
8.10 e. In the event new jobs are created by the addition of new facilities, the Company and the Union shall confer as to whether such jobs should be included in an existing department or whether such new jobs should comprise a new department, but in the event of disagreement such jobs shall be placed within an appropriate existing or new department as determined by the Company subject to the Grievance Procedure.
3.	Promotional Sequence Seniority Unit
8.11 a. An employee’s Sequential Seniority shall be based upon his length of continuous service with the Company. Promotional sequences as recognized for seniority purposes may consist of either a
98
ARTICLE VIII
single job or a group of jobs within a recognized department. Group promotional sequences shall reflect, to the extent practicable, lines of promotion in accordance with logical work relationships, supervisory set-ups and geographical location. Jobs which bear no logical work relationships with other jobs shall be set up separately and shall be known as “single job promotional sequences.” Jobs which are grouped in accordance with logical work relationships shall be known as “multiple job promotional sequences.” Promotional sequences shall be set up in diagram form and, insofar as possible, shall be established in such manner that each sequence step will provide opportunity for employees to become acquainted with and to prepare themselves to perform the requirements of the job above. The arrangement of jobs within a multiple job promotional sequence shall be in an ascending order of total average hourly earnings on the jobs included therein and any permanent change in such earnings shall be the basis of realignment of jobs within the sequences. Where job earnings are approximately equal, the job generally regarded as most closely related to the next higher job shall be the higher in the sequence arrangement.
99
ARTICLE VIII
8.12 b. Where a permanent change in the relationships of jobs in a sequence takes place, where new jobs are installed or where either the Company or the Union desires a change, the sequence involved shall be revised under the principles set forth above and in accordance with the following procedure. Either the company or the Union shall notify the other in writing of any change in a sequence which it may desire and the reasons therefore. If no objection is made by the party receiving the notice within five (5) days after receipt thereof, the proposed change shall become effective on the sixth day after the giving of such notice. If objection is made, the proposed change shall be held in abeyance and the notice, together with a written statement of the objections thereto prepared by the party raising such objections, shall be considered as a grievance filed initially in the final step of the Grievance Procedure prior to arbitration. Such grievance shall be considered as promptly as practicable by the parties, and in the event that it is not resolved, shall be submitted to and resolved in regular arbitration; provided however, that such arbitration shall be scheduled and heard within 90 days after the notice referred to above has been given. The determination of the Arbitrator shall be based upon the guide
100
ARTICLE VIII
lines set forth in Article VIII, Section C. 3.a. (m.p. 8.11), above. Where the order of jobs within a sequence is changed through this procedure, neither the Arbitrator nor the parties may change regular job assignments as a result thereof, nor shall any promotional rights of job incumbents established and in effect immediately prior to the change be affected.
8.13 4. Job Seniority Unit. An employee’s Job Seniority shall be based upon his length of continuous service on an established job within a sequence as hereinafter defined. Where job preference assignment exists, it is agreed that job preference means the right of an employee to perform a certain task whenever that task or tasks are being performed.
Section D.	Establishment and Continuation of Seniority within the Various Units
1. How Company Seniority Is Established
8.14 a. An employee shall establish Company Seniority upon completion of his probationary period.
8.15 b. New employees or a former employee rehired
101
ARTICLE VIII
after a break in continuous service shall be considered probationary employees during their respective probationary periods;
8.16
(1)	A probationary employee’s period of probation shall begin with the first day of actual work after hiring or rehiring as the case may be and shall consist of the first 520 hours of actual work thereafter. A probationary employee, for whom work is no longer available because of a reduction of force, shall be terminated and if rehired shall begin a new probationary period. A probationary employee, who because of excused absences from work (normally due to disability), does not complete his 520 hours of actual work within six (6) consecutive calendar months beginning with the first day of his probationary period, shall, if subsequently rehired, be considered to be rehired after a break in continuous service except that;
8.17
(2)	A probationary employee who is absent from-work for a period not to exceed twenty-four (24) hours due to juty duty, military service, or funeral leave as defined in this labor agreement shall have that period of absence credited toward his hours of
102
ARTICLE VIII
probationary service. If a probationary employee receives a compensable lost-time injury as defined by the applicable worker’s compensation statutes, and is unable to complete his probationary period as a result, upon his ability to return to work, that employee’s hire date will be compared to the hire dates of his peers. If his peers are currently working and have completed their probationary periods, he will be returned to work and credited with the hours he had previously worked in order to complete their probationary periods due to termination, he shall be accorded the same status as those peers. If the employee’s peers completed their probationary periods but are not working due to layoff or reduction, the employee shall be recalled in line with his peers and obligated to complete his proba-tionaiy period.
8.18 (3) The Company Seniority of a new or rehired employee upon completion of his probationary period shall be computed from the date of the beginning of his probationary period;
8.19
(4)	A probationary employee acquires no seniority
103
ARTICLE VIII
applicable to any of the recognized seniority units during his probationary period. Probationary employees cannot file applications for entrance into a multiple or single job sequence, but if assigned by Management to a job within a sequence, he shall be entitled to the same rights as if he had applied for entrance, subject to reassignment to another job or sequence as determined by Management. However, an arbitrary refusal by Management to reassign a probationary employee working on a job within a recognized sequence in order to make his job available to a non-probationary employee shall be a proper matter for disposition under the Grievance Procedure. A probationary employee may file and process grievances under the procedures provided in this Agreement but his services may be terminated by discharge or layoff as determined by the Company except that the Company shall not discriminate against any probationary employee for filing or processing a grievance; and provided further that this will not be used for purposes of discrimination because of race, color, religious creed, national origin, age, or sex, or because of membership in the Union.
2.	How Company Seniority May Be Broken
104
ARTICLE VIII
8.20 a. There shall be no deduction from continuous service upon which Company Seniority is based for any time lost which does not constitute a break in such continuous service except as provided in c. and d. below.
8.21 b. Continuous service upon which Company Seniority is based shall be broken in the manner set forth in c. below and by:
8.22 (1) Quit or resignation;
8.23 (2) Discharge for proper cause provided that if such person is reinstated within six (6) months, the break in continuous service shall be removed. Automatic discharges without notice to the employee are deemed to be for proper cause under the following circumstances:
8.24 (a) Where the employee is absent from scheduled work for five (5) consecutive turns without reporting off:
105
ARTICLE VIII
8.25 (b) Where an employee is absent from work for seven (7) consecutive days after the end of an excused absence (such absences due to illness, injury, leave of absence, vacation, personal business, disciplinary layoff, etc., which absence may have been of such duration as to have resulted in the employee not being listed on posted work schedules); or
8.26 (c) Where an employee on layoff fails to report for work within three (3) days after notice to do so is sent, by certified mail, to his latest address shown on the records of the Company. The period of time within which an employee on layoff is required to report to work after notice to do so as above may be extended by the Company. Automatic discharge of such an employee who fails to report for work or to obtain an extension of time within which to report for work shall become final seven (7) days after the Company reports such failure to the Union, unless within such seven-day period, good and sufficient reason is shown for failure to so report.
8.27 (3) Permanent transfer to a position with the
106
ARTICLE VIII
Company excluded from the bargaining unit except as provided in Section F. below.
8.28 (4) Termination in accordance with Article XIV -Severance Pay.
8.29 (5) Absence in excess of the period during which continuous service can be accumulated under paragraph c. below, or failure to give written notice required by paragraph c.
8.30 c. If an employee shall be absent due to a layoff because of reduced operations, he shall continue to accumulate Company Seniority (continuous service) during such absence for two (2) years and for an additional period equal to (1.) three (3) years, or (2.) the excess, if any of his length of continuous service at commencement of such absence over two (2) years, whichever is less, any accumulation in excess of two (2) years during such absence shall be counted, however, only for purposes of this Article VJ11 and shall not be counted for any other purpose under this or any other agreement between the Company and the Union. In order to avoid a
107
ARTICLE VJJJ
break in service after an absence of two years, the employee must give the Company annual written notice that he intends to return to employment when called, if the Company, at least thirty (30) days prior thereto, has mailed him a notice, at the most recent address furnished by him to the Company, that he must file such notice.
8.31 d. If an employee shall be absent due to non-compensable disability, he shall continue to accumulate Company seniority (continuous service) during such absence up to a maximum of two (2) years, and he shall retain his accumulated continuous service for an additional three (3) years. Absences due to a non-compensable disability of a duration that exceeds five (5) years shall result in a forfeiture of Company Seniority.
8.32 e. Absence due to compensable disability incurred during the course of employment shall not break Company Seniority (continuous service), provided such individual applies for and is acceptable for reemployment within thirty (30) days after final payment of statutory compensation for such disability or after the end of the period used in calcu
108
ARTICLE VIII
lating a lump sum payment; provided, however, that in the event such individual’s Workers’ Compensation claim is pending on litigation, such thirty-day period shall not commence until the final adjudication of such claim.
8.33 f. An employee who is transferred or promoted to a position outside of the bargaining unit may return to the bargaining unit with full Company Seniority accumulated at the time of promotion or transfer outside of the bargaining unit restored whenever:
(1)	No bargaining unit employees are on Company layoff.
3.	How Department Seniority is Established.
8.34 a. An employee, other than a probationary employee, shall establish a Department Seniority date equal to his Company Seniority date beginning with the first day of actual work in a recognized department after transfer to that department other than on a temporary basis.
8.35 b. The department in which an employee has estab-
109
ARTICLE Vlll
Iished Department Seniority shall be known as his Home Department, and his seniority status therein shall be referred to as his Home Department Seniority. An employee may carry Home Department Seniority in but one department at a time. An employee laid off from his Home Department due to reduced operations, if transferred to another department in lieu of Company layoff under the provisions hereinafter set forth in Second G. of this Article, may acquire Department Seniority in another department, but such Department Seniority status will be referred to as Temporary Department Seniority. A Temporary Department Seniority date acquired in this fashion shall be equal to the employee’s Company Seniority date.
4.	How Department Seniority May Be Broken
8.36 a. Any conduct or circumstances which constitute a break in or a limitation upon accumulation of Company Seniority as provided in Section D. 2. above shall also constitute a break in or a limitation upon accumulation of Department Seniority and where under the provisions of this Agreement a break in Company Seniority is removed by subsequent reemployment within the recognized bar
110
ARTICLE VIII
gaining unit, a break in Department Seniority is also removed by reemployment in the department provided such reemployment in the department occurs at the same time as the break in Company Seniority is removed.
8.37 b. An employee who requests from his Home Department shall, if and when transferred, forfeit his seniority in his Home Department and shall, as of the first day in which he works in such new department, establish a new home department Seniority date in such new department equal to his Company Seniority date. In the event that such employee possesses Temporary Department Seniority at the time such transfer is effected, such Temporary Department Seniority shall also be forfeited in the same manner.
8.38 c. An employee transferred by the Company for a specified temporary period to a department other than the one in which he is employed shall not acquire Department Seniority in the department to which transferred and shall retain his seniority in the department from which transferred for the period of such temporary transfer.

An employee laid off from his Home Department due to reduced operations who is transferred by the Company to another department in lieu of Company layoff retains and continues to accumulate Department Seniority in his Home Department until forfeited under the provisions of the Layoff and Recall Procedures set forth in Section G and H. and this Article, except that such an employee with less than two (2) years of Company Seniority at the time he is so laid off shall, upon such layoff, forfeit any Department Seniority he may have established.
5.	How Sequential Seniority Is Established
8.40 a. An employee, other than a probationary employee, shall establish a Sequential Seniority date equal to his Company Seniority date beginning with his first day worked on a job within a recognized promotional sequence other than on a fill-in turn basis.
8.41 b. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with respect to a particular situation by the Company and the Union, the term “fill-in turn” as used in this paragraph 5. and elsewhere in this Article, refers to a
112
ARTICLE VIII
turn worked by reason of assignment or schedule where such assignment or schedule is for less turns per week than such job is usually scheduled as well as to turns worked as a replacement for an absent employee.
8.42 c. The sequence in which an employee has established Sequential Seniority shall be known as his Home sequence and his seniority status therein shall be referred to as his Home Sequential Seniority. An employee may carry Home Sequential Seniority in but one (1) sequence at a time.
6.	How Sequential Seniority May Be Broken
8.43 a. Any conduct or circumstances which constitute a break in or a limitation upon accumulation of Department Seniority as provided in Section D. 4. a. above, shall also constitute a break in or a limitation upon accumulation of Sequential Seniority.
8.44 b. An employee who requests a transfer out of a sequence in which he is employed shall, if and when transferred, forfeit his Sequential Seniority in
113
ARTICLE VIII
the sequence from which transferred.
8.45 c. An employee transferred by the Company for a specified temporary period to a sequence other than the one in which he is employed shall retain his seniority in the sequence from which transferred for the period of such temporary transfer.

114
ARTICLE VIII
7.	How Job Seniority Is Established
8.47 a. An employee, other than a probationary employee, shall establish Job Seniority on a job within a single job promotional sequence or on the lowest available job within a multiple job promotional sequence at the same time that he establishes Sequential Seniority in such sequence (as provided in Paragraph 8.42); provided, however, that such employee’s Job Seniority date on this job, and each job above it in the promotional sequence shall be the first day on which such employee was assigned or promoted to such job other than on a fill-in basis.
8.48 b. An employee may carry Job Seniority in but one (1) job at a time, except that if he is promoted to a higher job or to higher jobs within an established multiple job promotional sequence, he shall retain and continue to accumulate Job Seniority on the lower job or jobs within the sequence from which promoted, applicable when demoted by the Company because of reduced forces or inability to perform the job.

ARTICLE VIII
8.49 a. Any conduct or circumstances which constitute a break in or a limitation upon accumulation of Sequential Seniority as provided in Section D.6.a. above, shall also constitute a break in or a limitation upon accumulation of Job Seniority and where under the provisions of this Agreement a break in Sequential Seniority is removed by subsequent reemployment, a break in Job Seniority is also removed by reemployment on the particular job provided such reemployment on the particular job occurs at the same time as the break in Sequential Seniority is removed.
8.50 b. An employee who requests in writing a permanent demotion to a lower job within a sequence shall be entitled to demote if a vacancy exists or if a vacancy can be created by mutual agreement between the employee seeking to demote and the employee occupying the job to which the demoting employee seeks to demote; provided, however, that the Company may defer the implementation of the demoting employee’s request for a reasonable time in order to avoid adversely affecting the operation in question. When the demotion is effected, the demoted employee shall forfeit his or her Job
116
ARTICLE Vil!
Seniority on the job from which demoted and on any intervening jobs in the sequence between the job from which demoted and the job to which demoted. In the event the demoted employee is later promoted from the job to which he or she demotes, he or she will not be permitted to challenge the higher standing on the jobs above of those employees who may have stepped ahead of him or her.
8.51 c. Employees temporarily demoted for cause, temporarily demoted to a lower job at their own request for good cause or inactive because of bonafide disability or disciplined with time off shall, upon return, assume their status in the sequence as if continuously employed on their former jobs during such an absence, provided that such an employee, upon return, is physically capable of performing his former job and provided further than such an employee returns to his former job within three (3) months after he so left such job or within any agreed upon extension thereof. The Company and the Union may, with respect to any individual, extend such three-month period by entering into a written agreement to that effect. If an employee so temporarily demoted is permitted by the Company
117
ARTICLE VIII
to return to his former job after the end of such three-month period or any mutually agreed extension thereof, he shall not be permitted to challenge the permanent status on higher jobs within the sequence of other employees who may have moved ahead of him. Copies of all request for temporary demotion for cause shall be given to the Union and if complaint by the Union is made within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such a copy, the granting or refusal thereof may be the subject of a grievance.
8.52
d. An employee permanently demoted within a sequence for cause may later correct the cause for such action, in which event the employee shall again be considered eligible for promotion, but he shall not be permitted to challenge the higher standing of those who had stepped ahead of him
8.53 e. An employee transferred by the Company for a specified temporary period to a job other than the one on which he has established Job Seniority shall retain his Job Seniority on the job from which transferred for the period of such temporary transfer. Such temporary transfers shall be only for a period sufficient for the permanent bid system
118
ARTICLE VIII
(including break-in where necessary) to fill the vacancy of until another employee who elects to fill the vacancy has had an opportunity to break in unless there is Union agreement for a longer period.
8.54 f. An employee demoted due to reduced operations from a job on which he has established Job Seniority who is assigned to a job in another sequence in the same or another department in lieu of department or Company layoff, retains and continues to accumulate Job Seniority on such former job in his Home Sequence until forfeited under the provisions of the Layoff and Recall Procedures set forth in Sections G and H. of this Article.
Section E.	Seniority Records and Sequence Diagrams
8.55 1. Seniority Record. Current seniority records shall be maintained by the Company, which shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection by an employee or by a Union Steward affected thereby, and which shall set forth each employee’s work record with the Company and his Company, Department, Sequential and Job Seniority. Additionally, the Company will provide the
119
ARTICLE VIII
Office Manager of the Union with a list of bargaining unit employees in order of Company Seniority no less often than once every six (6) months. The seniority rights of individual employees shall in no way be prejudiced by errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in such lists. Any complain concerning an employee’s seniority status which is not resolved by mutual agreement between the Company, the Union and the employee shall be submitted to the Expedited Arbitration Procedure for resolution. The decision reached by the Arbitrator in the Expedited Arbitration Procedure, shall be final and binding upon the Company, the Union and the employee.
8.56 2. Sequence Diagrams. Promotional sequence diagrams shall be prepared by the Company and copies shall be given to the Union Steward or Stewards representing the employees involved and the Office Manager of the Union. The Union may approve any such promotional sequence diagram and if approved, copies which indicate such union approval shall be posted in the areas where the affected employees work. If the Union does not approve any such proposed promotional sequence diagram, representatives of the Company and the Union shall confer regarding any changes therein deemed necessary or desirable and if Union approval is not granted,
120
ARTICLE VIII
copies of any such diagram which indicate it has not been approved by the Union may nevertheless be posted in the areas where the employees involved work. Any; approved promotional sequence diagram shall be final and effective when posted, and any promotional sequence diagram which is not approved when posted shall be effective when posted subject to being revised by a joint committee of six (6) persons, three (3) to be selected by the Union and three (3) to be selected by the Company. A joint committee may be established in each recognized division of the Company and any decision reached by a majority of any such joint committee shall be final and binding upon the Company, the Union and any employees involved. Upon failure of a joint committee to reach a majority decision, the proposed revision may be submitted to arbitration as provided in Article IX, D. of this Agreement.
8.57
a. On or before November 30, 1982, the Company shall prepare and post revised seniority lists of employees at those locations throughout the plant which are presently utilized for the posting of job vacancy notices for employees working in those areas. Copies of such lists will also be provided to the Office Manager of the Union and to the Divisional Grievance Committee of each of the
121
ARTICLE VIII
respective Divisions. Additionally, each employee covered by the bargaining unit will be mailed notice of his individual Company date, his current Home Department (if any) and his Job date (if any).
8.58 b. When employees are hired by the Company after June 1, 1982, they shall establish a Company Seniority date as of the Sunday of the calendar week in which they begin to work for the Company. Ties shall be broken by agreement of the Company and Union in a nondiscriminatory manner.
8.59 c. An employee who wishes to challenge the accuracy of his or her seniority status on such list may do so within thirty (30) calendar days of such posting by making such challenge with his Steward.
8.60 d. Such challenge will be heard by a Joint Committee composed of an equal number of representatives of the Union and the Company. A decision by a majority of the members of the Committee shall be final and binding on the Company, Union and employee(s) involved. If a
122
ARTICLE VI11
majority of the Committee cannot agree, the matter shall be submitted to an impartial Arbitrator under the Expedited Arbitration procedure of this Labor Agreement, The decision of the Arbitrator in such proceedings shall be final and binding on the Company, Union and employee(s) involved.
8.61 e. Within ten (10) days after all challenges have been finally decided pursuant to subparagraph (d) above, the Company shall post revised seniority lists reflecting the resolution of such challenges at those locations throughout the plant which are presently utilized for the posting of job vacancies for employees working in those areas. Copies of the revised lists will also be provided to the Office Manager of the Union and to the Divisional Grievance Committee of each of the respective Divisions. An employee whose relative seniority status has been adversely affected by the revisions to the list and who wishes to challenge the accuracy of those revisions may do so within thirty (30) calendar days of the posting of the revised list by making such challenge with his Steward. Challenges will be processed pursuant to the procedure in d. above.
123
ARTICLE VIII
8.62 f. Pending a determination of such challenge, the Company may unilaterally implement the seniority status of the employee(s) involved. In the event such challenge results in a revision of the seniority status of the employee(s) involved, the Company will not be liable for back pay to the employee so long as the revisions are made effective by the beginning of the second calendar week following the week in which such revision is made.
8.63
Any change in an established promotional sequence brought about under the procedures set forth in Section C.3. of this Article shall be noted on the posted copies of promotional sequence diagrams as promptly as possible.
Section F.	Transfer Requests
8.64
I.	An employee who has achieved permanent seniority with the Company, and who desires to permanently transfer from one department or sub-department to another, may make application for permanent transfer by signing a permanent transfer bid sheet. Such requests shall be given consideration in order of seniority as provided in Section B., above, and before new
124
ARTICLE VIII
employees are hired in such other departments or subdepartments.
8.65
2.	Permanent transfer bid sheets will be posted throughout the Company for entry level jobs in the various departments. The jobs to be posted will be openings in the department labor pool. However, where a given department does not have a labor pool, or where an entry level opening exists in a sequence which cannot be filled through intra-departmental bid, the entry level job in the sequence shall be posted plantwide.
8.66
3.	An employee may elect only two (2) permanent transfers under the provisions of Section F. within any ninemonth period. An employee who refuses a permanent transfer upon award of a bid shall be permitted to sign other Company-wide bids should he so desire, and shall not have such refusals counted among the two transfers he may in fact elect during the aforementioned ninemonth period. The nine month period shall begin from when the employee accepts a permanent transfer (not from when he/she actually moves). The successful bidder whose transfer is awarded must be available for work in the new department within a reasonable period of time unless otherwise mutually agreed by the
125
ARTICLE VIII
Company and the Union.
8.67 4. In the case of an employee who is displaced from his or her Home Department by reason of reduction in forces, or an employee who has not established home department seniority, the following temporary transfer procedure will apply:
8.68 a. For purposes of this subsection f.4.,a “temporary transfer” is defined as a transfer made under the provisions of Section G below, which does not result in a break in Department Seniority of the employee being transferred.
8.69 b. An employee who is being reduced from his or her Home Department and who contacts the Seniority Office in person or by telephone before noon on Friday of the final week of assignment to the Home Department will be permitted, in Company Seniority order, to exercise preferences for assignments among the departments in which there is work available during the week immediately following the week in which the employee is reduced. The affected employee shall exercise this right by indicating the department(s) desired, in
126
ARTICLE VIII
order of preference, on a form to be supplied by the Company. In the event the employee does not receive notice before noon on Friday that he or she is to be reduced, that employee may exercise such preferences prior to noon on Friday of the next succeeding week.
8.70
c.	At the time of reduction or at any time subsequent thereto, any such employee may file one (1) request for temporary transfer (i.e., from one temporary department to another temporary department) on forms available at the Seniority Office.
8.71
d.	An employee who is temporarily transferred under this procedure will not thereafter be eligible to request another temporary transfer until the occurrence of one of the following:
8.72
(1)	Reduction out of the temporary department or
8.73
(2)	The expiration of three (3) months from the effective date of temporary transfer.
8.74
In the event the employee is laid off from the temporary
127
ARTICLE VIII
department, he or she will again be eligible to file a request for temporary transfer under the provisions of subsection c. above.
8.75
e.	An employee who refuses a temporary transfer offered under the provisions of subsection c. above will not thereafter be eligible to file another request for temporary transfer until the expiration of six (6) months from the date of such refusal.
8.76
f.	A request for temporary transfer filed under the provisions of subsection c. above will be voided upon the recall of the employee to his or her Home Department.
8.77
5.	An employee who has achieved permanent seniority in a department may file one (I) request for temporary transfer (i.e., from the employee’s permanent department to a temporary department) on forms available at the Seniority Office. Such a request may be withdrawn in writing at any time prior to it being honored by the Company. An employee whose request for temporary transfer has been honored may refuse the temporary transfer. However, when transferred, the
128
ARTICLE VIII
employee shall forfeit his seniority in his Home Department. It is further understood that an employee transferred under this procedure shall not establish a new home department seniority date in such new department. An employee who is transferred under this procedure will not thereafter be eligible to request another temporary transfer until the occurrence of one of the events set forth in paragraph 4.d. above.
8.78
6.	Requests for transfer under subsection F.4 and 5 above, shall be given consideration in company seniority order before new employees or temporarily displaced employees who have not requested temporary transfer to the department in which the vacancy occurs.
Section G Reduced Operations Procedures
8.79
1.	Exclusions from Procedures. Variations in operations which may occur from day to day under normal operating conditions are not covered by the provisions of this Section and the rules and procedures hereinafter set forth shall not apply to divisions of work and/or reductions of force resulting from such day-to-day variations in the volume of work.
8.80
2.	Determination of Division of Work or Reduction of
129
ARTICLE VIII
Force. In the event reduced operations require a reduction of the working force or a reduction of scheduled working hours among any group of employees, the Company shall decide whether to reduce the force or to divide the work; but if a division of the work results for a continuous period of three (3) consecutive pay periods in a reduction of hours worked by the employees affected to an average of thirty-two (32) hours of work per week, per employee or less, the Company and the Executive Committee of the Union will confer with respect to whether the force should be reduced and the extent of such reduction or whether the available work should be divided and the extent of such division and any agreement reached by the Company and the Union with respect to such matters shall be binding upon the employees who may be affected thereby. Even though reduced operations may not result in a reduction of hours worked by the employees affected to an average of thirty-two (32) hours of work per week or less for a continuous period of three (3) consecutive pay periods, if reduced operations result in such a reduction of hours worked for a majority of the weeks in a continuous period of six (6) continuous pay periods or more, a Company-Union conference will be held as provided above. In the event no agreement is reached, the decision of the Company shall control except that the Company may not thereafter divide the work among the
130
ARTICLE VIII
employees affected on a basis of less than an average of thirty-two (32) hours of work per week, per employee, unless the nature of operations is such that a schedule of less than thirty-two (32) hours per week is required.
3.	Sequence and Department Demotions
8.81
a.	When reduced operations require retrogression of employees from one job level to a lower job level within a recognized sequence, such demotions shall be based upon Job Seniority. However, when an employee with greater Sequential Seniority than other employees entitled by Job Seniority to remain at work in a sequence is subject to reduction out of the sequence, the employee with the least Sequential Seniority then at work in the sequence will be considered for reduction out of the sequence and will be so reduced if the vacancy which would thus be created can be filled by an available more senior employee (based upon Sequential Seniority) with the ability to perform that job.
8.82
b.	When reduced operations require demotions involving jobs not included in a recognized sequence and Group B jobs within sequences when
131
ARTICLE VIII
a Department layoff Pool is operative, such demotions shall be in accordance with Department Seniority.
4.	Departmental Layoffs
8.83
a.	Before any employee is laid off from a department, all of the jobs within the department shall be divided into two (2) groups, which for the purpose of identification, shall be known as Group A and Group B and which shall be determined as follows:
8.84
GROUP A - In this group shall be included all jobs in the department which, because of the skill, training and experience required, can be performed efficiently only by an employee with substantial work experience on that job or on a closely related job requiring practically identical skill, training and experience.
8.85
GROUP B - In this group shall be included all other jobs in the department.
8.86
b.	When it is necessary to reduce the work force in
132
ARTICLE VIII
any department, the following procedure shall govern:
8.87
(1)	Employees of the department not assigned to Group A jobs within the department shall be considered within the Department Layoff Pool whether assigned to Group B jobs or unassigned, and in addition, certain Group A jobs may be included within the Layoff Pool with respect to any particular layoff when the Company and the Union mutually agree that an employee who is scheduled to be laid off from the department with greater Company Seniority than the occupant of such Group A job is qualified to perform efficiently such Group A job. When an employee is scheduled to be laid off from a department and other employees with less Department Seniority are entitled to remain at work in that department solely because of being incumbents of Group A jobs which the employee scheduled to be laid off is not qualified to perform efficiently, such incumbent of a Group A job with the least Department Seniority in the department will be laid off from the department if the vacancy thus created can be filled by a more senior employee of the department who is not scheduled to be laid off, who is not an incumbent of a Group A job,
133
ARTICLE VIII
who the Company and the Union mutually agree is available and qualified to perform efficiently such Group A job, and whose job the more senior employee scheduled to be laid off is qualified to perform efficiently.
8.88
(2)	Layoffs from the Departmental Layoff Pool shall be made in the Department Seniority order.
8.89
(3)	An employee laid off from a department with less than two (2) years of Company Seniority, at the time of layoff, shall forfeit his Department, Sequential and Job Seniority, if any.
8.90
c.	In applying the provisions of this paragraph 4., it is understood and agreed that, in order to maintain efficiency, the Company need not assign employees to jobs under the above procedures in any operating or service unit where such assignment would result in undue dilution of experienced employees in such unit.
5.	Company Layoffs
8.91
a. An employee laid off in any department who has
134
ARTICLE VIII
less than one (1) year of Company Seniority, but more than 520 actual hours worked at the time of layoff, shall be entitled to replace another employee in another department who is in the most junior group of employees based on calendar month of hire.
8.92 b. Probationary employees being reduced to the street shall be entitled to replace other probationary employees working in the same or other departments if such other probationary employees are junior to them. Seniority rankings among probationary employees shall be made on the basis of their hire dates.
8.93 c. With respect to an employee in a. above, or with one (1) or more years of Company Seniority who is laid off from a department or who is scheduled to be laid off from a department, an effort shall be made to assign or transfer him to available work which he has the ability to perform and which work is then being performed by an employee with less Company Seniority. In making assignments or transfers of such more senior employees it is understood and agreed that the Company is not required
135
ARTICLE VIII
to meet any specific time limits, but that such assignments or transfers are to be made with reasonable promptness under such circumstances as may exist at the time. Special circumstances may require special agreements with respect to any such assignments or interdepartment transfer in lieu of Company layoff and any such special agreements between the Company and the Union shall be binding upon any employees affected thereby, but the general rules to be applied in such situations are as follows:
8.94
(1)	The department or departments from which employees are to be laid off in order to create vacancies on jobs to be filled by employees with more than one (1) year of Company Seniority (determined at date of department layoff) who are laid off or scheduled to be laid off shall be selected by the Company and transfers to such numbers and at such times so as not to interfere unduly with efficiency of operations. The department or departments selected by the Company and the jobs to be affected by any such layoff shall include those then being performed by the group of employees with the least Company Seniority, determined from time to time by designating an
136
ARTICLE VIII
appropriate date of employment to define such group.
8.95
(2)	The Company’s selection of “an appropriate date of employment” for the purpose of defining the group of employees with the least Company Seniority who may be subject to layoff under the provisions of (1) above shall be subject to the following limitations: First, with respect to any such group of employees having less than five (5) years of Company Seniority, the “appropriate date of employment” shall not encompass a period of excess of one (1) year between such “appropriate date of employment” and the date of employment of the least senior employee (based upon “Company Seniority”) in such group; and second, with respect to any such group of employees having more than five (5) years of Company Seniority, the “appropriate date of employment” shall not encompass a period in excess of six (6) months between such “appropriate date of employment” and the date of employment of the least senior employee (based upon “Company Seniority”) in such group unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Company and the Union. Not to be considered in making a deter
137
ARTICLE VIII
mination of the employment dates limiting the composition of any such group are employees with lesser Company Seniority who have theretofore been retained at work irrespective of Company Seniority status because of special skills or because of requirements of efficiency in operations.
8.96
(3)	Within the department or departments selected by the Company in which vacancies are to be created as provided in (1) above, layoffs to create such vacancies shall be made as provided in paragraph 4. above.
8.97
(4)	Within the department or departments selected by the Company in which vacancies are to be created as provided in (1) above, the Company may create vacancies in addition to vacancies in Group B jobs as permitted by the provisions of (3) above, where the Company and the Union mutually agree that an employee who is laid off or scheduled to be laid off with greater Company Seniority than the occupant of such Group A job is fully qualified to perform efficiently such Group A job.
138
ARTICLE VIII
8.98
d. An employee laid off due to reduced operations from a department and transferred to another department in lieu of Company layoff or subsequently assigned to another department from the Work Reserve List may, under the provisions of Section D. 3.c. above, establish Temporary Department Seniority, Such Temporary Department Seniority will be established in the same manner as Home Department Seniority and when established it will have the same force and effect and be subject to the same rules with respect to termination as Home Department Seniority except that when recalled to his Home Department, upon layoff from the new department due to reduced operations, or transfer to a department other than the employee’s Home Department, Temporary Department Seniority is cancelled and is of no further force and effect.
8.99 Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, a qualified employee reduced from his Home Department may challenge any employee who, because of his Company Seniority date, would have been otherwise laid off, but because of particular qualifications remains at work.
139
ARTICLE VIII
8.100
6.	The Company and the Union agree that it is in the best interest of labor relations to limit or eliminate out-of-line layoffs.
8.101
a. To avoid or minimize the effect of layoffs which do not reflect seniority, the Company agrees to:
8.102
(1)	Meet with appropriate Union officials to review proposed out-of-line layoffs with the Union, Management who proposes the layoff, and the Director of Industrial Relations.
8.103
(2)	If the Union and Company cannot agree to the necessity for the retention of a junior employee, the dispute shall be heard at arbitration within ten (10) days of meeting at which the parties were unable to agree. The Arbitrator shall be required to render his decision within forty-eight (48) hours.
8.104
(3)	If the company lays off out of line, they shall be required to review the status of such junior
140
ARTICLE VIII
employees each month with the Union. After the passage of three (3) months, the Union shall have the right to resubmit the issue to arbitration.
8.105
(4)	No local agreements between supervision and the Union regarding out-of-line layoffs shall be entered into without being committed to writing and reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Union.
8.106
(5)	For each employee who is retained in the plant while a more senior Company dated employee is laid off, the Company shall extend coverage of the current Program of Insurance Benefits to the senior employee on layoff whose coverage has terminated.
8.107
7.	Work Reserve List. For such period of time as an employee who has been laid off from the company due to reduced operations retains unbroken company Seniority or recall rights under the provisions of Section D. 2. above, his name shall be carried on the Work Reserve List.
141
ARTICLE VIII
Section H.	Recall Procedures
1.	Work Reserve List Recalls
8.108
a.	A laid ofT employee on the Work Reserve List will be recalled to work in accordance with his Company Seniority provided he is capable of performing the available work, he is able to pass the company’s standard physical examination and he is ready to go to work on three (3) days’ notice unless the company agrees with respect to any specific recall, to extend such period.
8.109
b.	The continuous service of a laid off employee who fails to return to work from the Work Reserve List on three (3) days’ notice may be broken only as provided in Section D. 2.b. (2), above, but the Company shall not be liable if a less senior employee is recalled and assigned to work prior to a more senior employee who delays reporting beyond the period of such three-day notice,
8.110
c.	A laid off employee who is assigned to work from the Work Reserve List to a department other than his home Department shall acquire such
142
ARTICLE VIII
Department, Sequence and Job Seniority status as if he had been transferred to another department in lieu of Company layoff.
2.	Department Recalls
8.111 a. As the working force is increased in any department or as vacancies in that department are otherwise created, employees with Home Department Seniority in that department who are laid off from that department will be recalled to that department in accordance with their Home Department Seniority.
8.112 b. An employee who is working outside his Home Department by reason of reduction of force in his Home Department, who is recalled to his Home Department may, at that time, elect to waive such recall rights with the result that his Department, Sequence and/or Job Seniority within his Home Department shall therewith terminate. Upon such waiver, an employee will continue to accrue Temporary Department Seniority, but only will begin to accrue Home Department Seniority when he is the successful bidder on a permanent transfer bid sheet (Section D. above).
143
ARTICLE VIII
8.113
c.	An employee who is working in his Home Department but outside his Sequence by reason of a reduction in force in his Sequence who is recalled to his Sequence may, at that time, elect to waive such recall rights with the result that his Sequence and Job Seniority within his Home Sequence shall terminate.
8.114
d.	An employee who is working in his Home Sequence but, by reason of a reduction in force, is working on a job below the highest level job in that sequence on which he had established Job Seniority shall not be permitted to waive promotion to his former job or to any intervening job, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1. 4. of this Article.
8.115
e.	An employee, who, when recalled, accepts recall to his Home Department shall be entitled to such job in his Home Department as his Home Department, Home Sequence and/or Home Job Seniority entitles him.
Section I.	Filling Vacancies and Promotions
144
ARTICLE VIII
8.116
I.	Filling Vacancies in Labor Pool Jobs. Where it is necessary to fill vacancies in labor pool jobs (jobs not included within a recognized sequence) Management will fill such vacancies by assignment subject, however, to disposition under the Grievance Procedure of claims of unfair and unjustified discrimination in the making of such assignments. Special agreements with respect to such assignments in particular areas shall take precedence over the provisions of this paragraph.
8.117
2.	Determination of Types of Vacancies in Sequence Jobs. Where it is necessary to fill vacancies on jobs within sequences, a determination of the type of vacancies shall first be made in accordance with the following definitions:
8.118 a. Permanent vacancies occur where the previous occupant’s seniority is broken because of the application of other Sections of this Article, where the previous occupant was promoted on a permanent basis, where a new or additional job is created, or where the previous occupant enters the Armed Forces. Notwithstanding the foregoing definition, a vacancy on a job within a sequence (multiple or single job) from which an
145
ARTICLE VIII
employee with Home Sequential Seniority has been laid off due to reduced operations may be considered a permanent vacancy when the number of available jobs in that sequence exceeds the number of employees with Home Sequential Seniority who are laid off from that sequence. Jobs of a seasonal nature, when available, are considered permanent jobs unless the Company and the Union otherwise specifically so agree with respect to any particular seasonal job. The creation of a “new or additional job” for a temporary period shall not result in a permanent vacancy if designated by Management as “temporary” and provided that such a job may be so designated for a period not in excess of three (3) months. At the end of three (3) months, if such job continues to exist, it may continue to be considered “tem-poraiy” only by mutual agreement of the Company and the Union.
8.119 b. All vacancies other than permanent vacancies as defined in a. immediately above shall be considered temporary vacancies, and for the purposes of this Section 1. temporary vacancies shall be divided into two (2) categories which are generally defined as follows:
8.120
(1)	Unknown temporary vacancies are those which
146
ARTICLE VIII
are unknown to Management in time to schedule a replacement under the provisions of Article III, C.l.
8.121
(2)	Known temporary vacancies are those which are known to Management in time to schedule a replacement under the provisions of Article III, C. L By mutual agreement of the appropriate Plant Manager, or his designated representative, and the appropriate Divisional Committee, temporary vacancies within a recognized department which could be considered “known” vacancies under the foregoing definition shall nevertheless be considered in that department as “unknown” vacancies and be filled as provided below with respect to unknown temporary vacancies. Departmental agreements providing variations of the foregoing definitions shall be reduced to writing and be signed by the respective parties.
8.122
3.	Filling Vacancies on Sequence Jobs. Where it is necessary to fill vacancies on jobs within sequences they shall be filled as follows:
a.	Unknown Temporary Vacancies:
147
ARTICLE VIII
8.123
(1)	When an unknown temporary vacancy occurs on a job within a multiple job sequence an effort shall first be made to fill it by promotion in accordance with Job Seniority of a qualified employee working on the turn and on the job immediately subordinate to the job on which the vacancy occurs (except where it is necessary to bypass the immediately subordinate job because a waiver of promotion is recognized) and provided: (a) that each successive move-up in the sequence can be completed job by job in the same manner (except for bypasses because of waivers of promotion) and (b) that the final vacancy thus created can be filled in accordance with Department Seniority by an employee from the department labor pool or from a single job sequence within the department who is available on the turn and is sufficiently qualified to perform the work of the job to which thus assigned. In filling the final vacancy an employee with superior Department Seniority shall be given the option of filling that vacancy, another existing vacancy, or remaining in the labor pool unless the employee’s refusal of the highest paying job for which he is qualified would result in a “call-out” or “double-over”.
148
ARTICLE VIII
This right of assignment shall not be used by the Company so as to deny an employee reduced into a labor pool the right to accept a vacancy on a job on which he retains recall rights regardless of whether his acceptance would result in a “callout” or “double-over”. The right of the Company to assign the qualified, available laborer to the highest paying vacancy in order to avoid overtime shall not be construed as an expansion or contraction of existing rights pertaining to the assignment of laborers. The parties agree that the above new contract language shall not be used by either party in the support of a position on grievances pending or filed in the future involving the issue of incumbents not receiving five (5) days scheduled work when non-incumbents are filling known temporary vacancies. Although the promotion procedure outlined above refers to a single unknown temporary vacancy, it is intended to apply to two (2) or more such vacancies within a multiple job sequence so long as the number of sufficiently qualified employees to fill all vacancies are available on the turn. If the unknown temporary vacancy occurs on a job within a single job sequence an effort shall first be made to fill it by promotion of an employee from the department labor pool or from another single job
149
ARTICLE VIII
sequence within the department in accordance with the Department Seniority who is available on the turn and sufficiently qualified to perform the work of the job to which thus assigned. The foregoing procedure shall not apply on maintenance jobs where helper jobs vacated by promotions to fill top jobs are usually not filled.
8.124
If an unknown temporary vacancy cannot be filled by promotion as outlined in (1) above (i.e., the chain of promotions cannot be completed without the necessity of “calling-out” or “doubling-over”), the vacancy or vacancies at the highest level or levels in the sequence shall be filled by “call-out” or “doubling-over” a regular incumbent or incumbents of such job or jobs where the vacancies occurred. A “regular incumbent” of a job is an employee who is accruing Job Seniority on the job in question who has not been demoted to laid off from the job due to lack of work or other reason. If a “regular incumbent” of the job at such highest level is not available to be “called out” or “doubled-over” such vacancy shall then be filled by promotion from the immediately subordinate level even though the chain of promotions cannot be completed under the proce
150
ARTICLE VIII
dure set forth in (1) above and the vacancy thus created at the next lower level shall then be filled by “calling-out” or “doubling-over” a “regular incumbent” of that job if available and if not available the same procedure shall be followed by promotion at the next lower level until the vacancy is filled unless a different procedure is required under an existing department agreement. Where circumstances would require the replacement by call-out or double-over of employees on labor pool or single job sequence jobs if they would be promoted to fill unknown temporary vacancies as provided in (I) above, promotions shall not be made and the vacancy or vacancies at higher level in the sequence shall be filled by “call-out” or “double-over”.
8.125
(3)	Unknown temporary vacancies shall not be filled by promotion or assignment as above provided in any workweek in which forty (40) hours of work is not available to all regular incumbents of the vacant job within the sequence. An attempt shall first be made to assign regular incumbents of the vacant job at straight-time rates; secondly, an attempt shall be made to assign regular incumbents to the vacancy to whom less than forty (40)
151
ARTICLE VIII
hours work is available regardless of overtime.
8.126
(4)	Where an unknown temporary vacancy is to be filled by “calling-out” and /or “doubling-over”, consideration shall be given to the provisions of Article III, C.2. of this Agreement governing the distribution of overtime.
8.127
(5)	The Company and the Union may agree with respect to particular situations that the phrase “within a multiple job sequence” as used in this sub-paragraph a. refers to a smaller group of jobs than those which are included within the recognized or established multiple job sequence,
8.128
(6)	An unknown temporary vacancy which occurs after the recognized starting time of the job involved which, if it had occurred at the beginning of the turn, would have been filled in accordance with the procedures hereinabove set forth, shall be filled in accordance with said procedures except that the Company need not “call out” a replacement to fill such a vacancy if a replacement cannot be obtained in time to report for
152
ARTICLE VIII
work on the vacant job at least three (3) hours before the end of the turn; and provided, further, that the Company shall attempt, within one (1) hour from the time that the employee reports to the Company’s Medical Department, to determine whether or not the employee will be available to return to work before the end of the turn.
8.129
(7)	Whenever an employee is called in to fill an unknown temporary vacancy or ordered out of an extra turn as the result of an increase in operating or service activities, such employee will be assigned to work in his incumbent occupation only. In such instances and for the purposes of this arrangement only, the provisions of Article IV, C.l. notwithstanding, the called-in or extra turn will be considered as the “premium” turn and such employee will not be barred from filling any temporary vacancy which may develop on any of his regularly scheduled workdays during that workweek for which he may be otherwise eligible by reason of seniority and qualifications.
b.	Known Temporary Vacancies:
8.130
(1)	When a known temporary vacancy occurs on
153
ARTICLE VIII
a job within a multiple job sequence an effort shall first be made to fill it by promotion and scheduling in accordance with Job Seniority of a qualified employee working within the sequence and on the job immediately subordinate to the job on which the vacancy occurs (except where it is necessary to bypass the immediately subordinate job because a waiver of promotion is recognized) and provided: (a) that each successive move-up in the sequence can be completed job-by-job in the same manner (except for bypasses because of waivers of promotion) and (b) that the final vacancy thus created can be filled in accordance with Department Seniority by an employee from the department labor pool or from a single job sequence within the department, who is sufficiently qualified to perform the work of the job to which thus assigned. In filling the final vacancy an employee with superior Department Seniority shall be given the option of filling that vacancy, another existing vacancy, or remaining in the labor pool unless the employee’s refusal of the highest paying job for which he is qualified would result in a “call-out” or “double-over”. The right of assignment shall not be used by the Company so as to deny an employee reduced into a labor pool the right to accept a vacancy on a job
154
ARTICLE VIII
on which he retains recall rights regardless of whether his acceptance would result in a “callout” or “double-over”. The right of the Company to assign the qualified, available laborer to the highest paying vacancy in order to avoid overtime shall not be construed as an expansion or contraction of existing rights pertaining to the assignment of laborers. The parties agree that the above new contract language shall not be used by either party in the support of a position on grievances pending or filed in the future involving the issue of incumbents not receiving five (5) days scheduled work when non-incumbents are filling known temporary vacancies. Although the promotion procedure outlined above refers to a single known temporary vacancy, it is intended to apply to two or more such vacancies within a multiple job sequence so long as the number of sufficiently qualified employees to fill all vacancies is available within the department. If the known temporary vacancy occurs on a job within a single job sequence, an effort shall be made to fill it by promotion of an employee from the department labor pool or from another single job sequence within the department in accordance with Department Seniority who is sufficiently qualified to perform the work of the job to which
155
ARTICLE VIII
thus assigned. The foregoing procedure shall not apply on maintenance jobs where helper jobs vacated by promotions to fill top jobs are usually not filled.
8.131
(2)	If a known temporary vacancy cannot be filled by promotion as outlined in (1) above, (i.e. the chain of promotions cannot be completed without the necessity of “call-out” or “doubling-over”) the vacancy or vacancies at the highest level or levels in the sequence shall be filled by “call-out” or “doubling-over” a regular incumbent or incumbents for such job or jobs where the vacancies occurred. A “regular incumbent” of a job is an employee who is accruing Job Seniority on the job in question who has not been demoted or laid off from the job due to lack of work or other reason. If a “regular incumbent” of the job at such highest level is not available to be “called out” or “doubled-over” such vacancy shall then be filled by promotion from the immediately subordinate level even though the chain of promotions cannot be completed under the procedure set forth in (I) above, and the vacancy thus created at the next lower level shall then be filled by “calling out” or “doubling-over” a “regular
156
ARTICLE VIII
incumbent” of that job if available and if not available the same procedure shall be followed by promotion at the next lower level until the vacancy is filled. Where circumstances would require the replacement by “call-out” or “doubling-over” of employees on labor pool or single job sequence jobs if they would be promoted to fill known temporary vacancies as provided in (1) above, promotions shall not be made and the vacancy or vacancies at the higher levels in the sequence shall be filled by “call-out” or “doubling-over”.
8.132
(3)	Where a known temporary vacancy is to be filled by “call-out” or “double-over”, consideration shall be given to the provisions of Article 111, C.2. of this Agreement governing the distribution of overtime.
8.133
(4)	The Company and the Union may agree with respect to particular situations that the phrase “within a multiple job sequence” as used in subparagraph b. refers to a small group of jobs than those which are included within the recognized or established multiple job sequence.
157
ARTICLE VIII
c.	Permanent Vacancies:
8.134
(1)	Permanent vacancies in jobs more than one (I) step above the labor pool shall be filled by the available and qualified employee working on the job within the sequence immediately subordinate to the vacant job who is entitled to fill such vacancy in accordance with Job Seniority on such immediately subordinate job and if such an employee is neither available nor qualified, the vacancy shall be filled by an available and qualified employee on the succeeding subordinate job or jobs in accordance with Job Seniority on such succeeding subordinate job or jobs. If, however, an employee has not had an opportunity to “break in” on the next higher job in a sequence and consequently such an employee cannot qualify for promotion to the next higher job in the sequence when such a vacancy occurs, the vacancy may be filled temporarily by the Company while the available employee with the greater Job Seniority who is otherwise qualified is given the opportunity to “break in” on such higher job.
8.135
(2)	Permanent vacancies in jobs at the lowest step
158
ARTICLE VIII
within a multiple job promotional sequence (even though a job may be higher in a sequence than the lowest step, it may be considered the lowest step for the purposes of this paragraph if it cannot be filled from within the sequence because of waivers of promotion) shall be filled under the following Job Posting procedures:
8.136
(a)	A notice of such permanent job vacancy shall be posted within the department where such vacancy occurs at one location which shall be agreed to by the Company and the Union (where sub-departments are recognized, posting locations shall be agreed upon at which permanent vacancies within such sub-departments shall be posted). Such notices shall be posted no later than 12:01 p.m. on the Monday following the date it was determined that such a vacancy existed, shall remain posted through the following Sunday and shall contain the following information: (1) Name or description of sequence in which such a vacancy exists, and (2) job title and standard hourly wage rate of the vacant job. Any employee of the department (or sub-department where appropriate) wishing
159
ARTICLE VIII
to be considered to fill such vacancy shall sign the posted notice where indicated and record thereon his badge number and Department Seniority date (or sub-department Seniority date where appropriate). Any employee of the department who is not at the time laid off from the department due to reduced operations, but who is absent from work during the posting period may notify the Superintendent in charge of the operation where the vacancy exists of his desire to apply for such vacancy by a letter to that effect which shall be attached to the posted notice of such vacancy except that a Department No. 5 employee laid off from Department No. 5 who remains at work on the basis of his Company Seniority on a job outside of Department No. 5, may apply to fill such a posted permanent job vacancy and his application shall be considered as if he was not at the time laid off from his Home Department upon the basis of his Department No. 5 Seniority. If the successful applicant, such a Department No. 5 employee shall forfeit his Home Sub-department Seniority upon beginning work on such new job.
160
ARTICLE VIII
8.137
(b)	Upon completion of the posting period, Management shall consider the applications and from among those qualified under the provisions of Section B. of this Article, shall determine the successful applicant in accordance with Department Seniority or Sub-department Seniority where appropriate except that Management need not consider the application of an absent employee who will not be available for assignment to such vacancy within thirty (30) days after the end of the posting period. If no qualified employee applies for such vacancy, Management may fill the vacancy as it sees fit.
8.138
(c)	Upon determination of the successful applicant, he shall be scheduled to work on such job, if it is available, no later than the second workweek following the week in which the posting period was completed, unless otherwise mutually agreed by Management and the employee involved.
8.139
(d)	During any period beginning with the deter
161
ARTICLE VIII
mination that such a vacancy exists and continuing until an employee is scheduled as a permanent incumbent to fill such vacancy, such vacancy shall be considered as a temporary vacancy and may be filled by Management under the provisions for filling temporary vacancies as hereinabove set forth.
8.140
(3)	At the time an employee begins work on a job as the result of being the successful applicant for a permanent vacancy under the provisions of paragraph (2) immediately above, any Job Seniority which he then holds on a job in another sequence, any Sequential Seniority which he then holds in another sequence and any Department Seniority (Home or Temporary) which he then holds in another department shall be cancelled and be of no further force and effect. By mutual agreement of the appropriate Plant Manager, or his designated representative, and the appropriate Divisional Committee, variations of the foregoing rule with respect to cancellation of Job and/or Sequential Seniority within another sequence or other sequences within that department may be established where special circumstances warrant. Departmental agreements providing such variations shall be reduced to writing and be signed by the respective parties.
162
ARTICLE VIII
8.141
(4)	An employee may waive promotion by signifying such intention to his supervisor in writing or shall be considered as waiving if he refuses to step up to fill a known or unknown temporary vacancy. A refusal to step up to fill an unknown vacancy shall not be considered as a waiver if, with respect to any particular sequence, the Company and the Union agree that such a refusal shall not be considered to be a waiver. Such waivers shall be noted in the personnel records and confirmed by the Company in writing, An employee may withdraw his waiver by notice in writing to that effect which shall be effective on the date submitted to his Supervisor, following which he shall again become eligible for promotion, but an employee who has so waived promotion either to a temporary or permanent vacancy and later withdraws it as herein provided shall not be permitted to challenge the future higher Job Seniority standing of those who have stepped ahead of him while such waiver was in effect or those who may be entitled to fill the next permanent vacancy by reason of accepting promotions to known or unknown temporary vacancies while such waiver was in effect. Employees may not enter or withdraw waivers indiscriminately and without good and valid reasons, and where Management believes that a waiver has been
163
ARTICLE VIII
entered or withdrawn indiscriminately and without good and valid reasons, Management may refuse to accept such waiver or withdrawal, subject to the Grievance Procedure if an employee affected believes Management’s action to have been unjustified. In addition, where an appreciable number of temporary vacancies cannot be filled by promotion because of an excessive number of waivers to a job within a particular sequence and as a consequence the Company must, on occasions, incur overtime penalties in order to fill temporary vacancies on the job or suffer serious impairment to efficiency of operations, the Superintendent in charge of the sequence and the Divisional Committee with the Steward involved shall confer in an attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory solution of the problem.
Section J. Leaves of Absence
8.142
1.	Regular Leave of Absence. An employee may request a leave of absence for good and valid reasons and shall make application in writing to the Manager -Industrial Relations, Operations or his Department Manager. The Department Manager and Union representative will review an employee’s request for leave of absence. Final authority as to whether the leave will be granted will vest with the Manager - Industrial Relations, Operations. Except as provided in paragraph
164
ARTICLE VIII
2.	below, no leave of absence shall be granted for more than ninety (90) days; however, if an unusual emergency arises which might prevent the employee on leave from returning at the end of the leave or other good cause for an extension exists, he may apply to the Employment Office for an extension which, if granted, shall guarantee his seniority and continuous service status until expiration of such extension. It is understood that leaves will not be granted to take up employment with another company. The Company desires to be reasonable in its policy in regard to allowing leaves and expects the members of the Union to be reasonable in their requests also. Business activity and the availability of properly trained personnel to handle the occupation will, of necessity, have a bearing on the willingness to grant leaves.
8.143
2.	Leave of Absence for Union Business. The Company will continue to allow employees leave to take up full-time employment with the Union, during which time they shall retain their Job (if any), Sequential (if any), Department, and Company Seniority.
8.144
3.	Seniority Status Upon Return from Leave of Absence. Employees on leave of absence shall, upon
165
ARTICLE VIII
return, assume their status in the Job and Sequence (if any) and Department and Company as if continuously employed during such an absence, and provided such an employee upon return is physically capable of performing this former job.
8.145
4.	Special Leave of Absence During Reduced Operations
8.146
a. An employee who, under the provisions of Section D. supra, is entitled to remain at work but not on his regular job, may elect a special leave of absence and, notwithstanding the provisions of Section H. above, be entitled to such recall rights as are herein provided:
8.147
(1)	An employee who elects a special leave of absence in lieu of assignment to a lower job in his Home Sequence shall be entitled to be recalled only to the job from which he was scheduled to be demoted in accordance with his Job Seniority on the job;
8.148
(2)	An employee who elects a special leave of
166
ARTICLE VIII
Home Department but outside his Home Sequence shall be entitled to be recalled only to his Home Sequence in accordance with his established Sequential Seniority;
8.149
(3)	An employee who elects a special leave of absence in lieu of assignment to a job outside his Home Department shall be entitled to be recalled only to his Home Department in accordance with his established Department Seniority;
8.150
(4)	An employee who has elected a special leave of absence either before or after demotion or transfer as provided above may withdraw such election by notice in writing to that effect to the Company Employment Office. Such a notice may withdraw an election of a special leave of absence in lieu of demotion or transfer under any or all of the circumstances described in (1), (2), or (3) above, and shall reinstate the employee’s right to consideration for assignment from the Work Reserve List or to recall to his Home Department or Home Sequence only with respect to future vacancies in the appropriate seniority unit made
167
ARTICLE VIII
available to him by such withdrawal.
8.151
(5)	Notwithstanding provisions one (1) through four (4) above, an employee on a special leave of absence shall be recalled to employment in accordance with his or her seniority in the event that the Company is hiring new employee(s) or rehiring former employee(s).
8.152 b. An employee demoted or transferred from his regular job in lieu of layoff may subsequently elect a special leave of absence in which event his recall rights shall be the same as if he had elected a special leave of absence before accepting such demotion or transfer.
8.153 c. An employee who elects a special leave of absence in lieu of demotion or transfer because of reduced operations may suffer a break in continuous service the same as an employee laid off because of reduced operations if not recalled within the time limit provided in Section D. of this Article.
168
ARTICLE VIII
8.154
d. All waivers permitted in this paragraph shall be confirmed in writing and be noted in the employee’s service record.
8.155 e. An employee who elects to be laid off in lieu of assignment either before or after demotion or transfer as provided above will be considered to be on a special leave of absence.
Section K..	Union Officers
8.156
A Union Steward involved in a layoff should be retained in his department so long as employees whom he was elected to represent are working in the area and on the jobs which he represents. A Union Steward involved in a layoff should also be retained in his Home Sequence so long as employees whom he was elected to represent are working in that sequence.
Section L.	Consent Decree
8.157
The provisions of the Consent Decree entered in the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia in Charles Williams v. Weirton Steel Division of National Steel Corporation and the
169
ARTICLE VIII
Independent Steelworkers Union (Civil Action No. 69-30-W), Mack Allen, et al. and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Weirton Steel Division of National Steel Corporation, et al., (Civil Action No. 72-5-W), and Willie J. McKenzie v. Weirton Steel Division of National Steel Corporation (Civil Action No. 80-75-W) and any applicable amendment thereto, are herby made a part of this Agreement as though expressly incorporated herein and in any case of conflict with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of such Decree shall have overriding effect so long as such Decree remains in effect.
ARTICLE IX ADJUSTMENT OF GRIEVANCES
Section A.	Purpose
9.1
The purpose of this Article is: (a) to provide opportunity for discussion of any request or complaint, (b) to establish procedures for the processing and settlement of grievances as defined in Section C., and (c) to define the rights and responsibilities of Union representatives.
Section B.	Discussion of Request or Complaint
9.2 Any employee who believes that he has a justifiable
170
ARTICLE IX
request or complaint shall discuss the request or complaint with departmental supervision, with or without the Steward being present, as the employee may elect, in an attempt to settle same. However, any such employee may instead, if he so desires, report the matter directly to his Steward, and in such event the Steward, if he believes the request or complaint merits discussion, shall take it up with the employee’s departmental supervisor in a sincere effort to resolve the problem. The employee involved may be present in such discussion, if he so desires.
Discussions under the provisions of this paragraph shall be held promptly after the date of the event out of which the request or complaint arises.
9.3 References in this Section B. to a “departmental supervisor” refer to a representative or representatives of Management, designated by the Company in each Union Steward’s plant unit, who shall be responsible for receiving and disposing of employee requests or complaints and who may carry the title of “Supervisor”, “General Supervisor” or “Superintendent”.
171
ARTICLE IX
9.4
If the appropriate Departmental Supervisor and the Steward, after full discussion, are unable to resolve the request or complaint and feel the need for aid in arriving at a solution, they may invite such additional Company or Union representatives as may be necessary and available to participate in further discussions and investigations. Additional time in which to conduct such further discussions and investigations (not exceeding thirty (30) days) may be utilized before the grievance, if unsettled, is to be reduced to writing for written answer by the Departmental Supervisor.
9.5
The foregoing procedure, if followed in good faith by both parties, should lead to a fair and speedy solution of most of the complaints arising out of the day-to-day operations of the plant. If the complaint or request concerns only the individual or individuals involved, and its settlement will have no effect upon the rights of other employees, the individual or individuals involved may effectively request that the matter be dropped.
Section C.	Definition of Grievance
9.6 “Grievance” as used in this Agreement is limited to a complaint or request of an employee which involved the
172
ARTICLE IX
interpretation or application of, or compliance with, the provisions of this Agreement.

9.10
(1)	Any grievance involving incentives, job
174
ARTICLE IX
descriptions or job classification shall be sent directly to the Industrial Engineering Department which shall provide the Union with a written response thereto within thirty (30) days together with a copy of their investigation, excluding any cost data contained therein.

9.19 d. Minutes of all Step 2 meetings shall be prepared by the General Supervisor of Industrial Relations, jointly signed by him/her and the Chairman of the Divisional Grievance Committee. If the Chairman of the Grievance Committee shall disagree with the accuracy of the minutes as prepared by the Company, he shall set forth and sign his reasons for such disagreement and the minutes, except for such disagreement, shall be regarded as agreed to. Two (2) copies of such minutes shall be provided to the
178

9.21 f. If the decision in this Step is not appealed to arbitration as above provided, the grievance shall be considered settled on the basis of such decision and shall not be eligible for further appeal.
Section E. Suspension and Discharge Cases
9.22
1.	Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to provide for the disposition of complaints involving suspension or discharge and to establish a special procedure for the prompt review of cases involving discharge or suspension. This procedure shall in no way revoke or interfere with hearings provided in the Company commitment issued on or about October 1, 1965, with respect to discipline for poor workmanship and hearings with respect to time-off penalties under the Company’s Policy on Absenteeism. Complaints concerning suspensions and discharges shall be handled in accordance with the procedure set forth below, including Section D. - Grievance Procedure, Section H. - Regular Arbitration, and/or Section 1. - Expedited Arbitration.
9.23
2.	Procedure. An employee shall not be peremptorily
180
ARTICLE IX
discharged. In all cases in which Management may conclude that an employee’s conduct may justify suspension or discharge, he shall be suspended initially for such time as may be deemed appropriate but for not more than three (3) working days, and given written notice of such action. In all cases of intended discharge, or of suspension for any period of time, a copy of the discharge or suspension notice shall be promptly furnished to such employee’s Steward.
9.24 If such initial suspension is for one (1) or more working days and if the employee affected believes he has been unjustly dealt with, he may request through his I.S.U. Steward and shall be granted, during the period of his suspension or as promptly thereafter as possible, a hearing and a statement of the offense before a representative (status of department head or higher) designated by the Area Manager with or without his Steward present -as the employee may choose. At such hearing, the facts concerning the case shall be made available to both parties. After such hearing, or if no such hearing is requested Management may conclude whether the suspension shall be affirmed, modified, extended, revoked, or converted into a discharge. In the event the suspension is affirmed, modified, extended or converted into a discharge, the employee may, within fourteen (14) cal-
181
ARTICLE IX
endar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and recognized holidays) after notice of such action, file a grievance in the Second Step of the Grievance Procedure. A final decision shall be made by the Company in Step 2 within ten (10) calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and recognized holidays) from the date of the filing thereof.

3.	Revocation of Suspensions or Discharges. Should any initial suspension, or affirmation, modification, or extension thereof, or discharge, be revoked by the Company, the Company shall reinstate and compensate the employee affected on the basis of an equitable lump sum payment mutually agreed to by the parties or, in the absence of agreement, make him whole in the manner set forth in Section E., 4. below.
9.27
The following understandings have been reached for Justice and Dignity on the Job applicable to discharge and suspension cases only.
1.	Management, after converting a disciplinary suspension to discharge, or imposing a suspension, shall not remove the affected employee from active work on the job to which his seniority entitles him upon such conversion or imposition prior to a final determination of the merits of the discharge or suspension in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Basic Labor Agreement should the employee or Union elect to file a complaint or grievance protesting Management’s decision. For purposes of the operation of the option not to be removed from the job pursuant to this procedure, a
183
ARTICLE IX
complaint or grievance protesting a discharge or suspension must be filed within five (5) calendar days after notice of the conversion to discharge or imposition of the suspension, as the case may be. In the event no complaint or grievance is filed within such time limit, the Company will not suspend or remove the affected employee from active work on the job to which his seniority entitles him prior to the day following the expiration of the time limit set forth in this paragraph. For any purpose other than operation of the option set forth above, the time limits for filing a complaint or grievance protesting a discharge or suspension shall continue to be those set forth in the Basic Labor Agreement and those set forth in items No. 5 and 6 below.
2.	The parties recognize that it is essential that a proper balance be maintained between the right of an employee to be retained under this Procedure and the right to Management to manage the plant. Accordingly, to insure the balance, this Procedure will not be applicable to discharges or suspensions involving any offenses which endanger the safety of other employee or members of supervision, or the plant and its equipment. Such offenses shall include, but are not limited to: theft, use and/or distribution on Company property of drugs, narcotics, and/or alcoholic beverages; reporting or attempting to report for work under the influence of
184
ARTICLE IX
alcohol, narcotics, or controlled substances; possession of firearms on Company property; destruction of Company property; threatening bodily harm to, and/or striking a member of supervision; fighting; violation of last chance letter or conditional letters of employment, and such insubordination as endangers the safety of other employees or members of supervision, or the plant and its equipment.
3.	When an employee is retained pursuant to Paragraph 1 and the employee’s discharge or suspension is finally determined in the grievance procedure or in arbitration to be for just cause, the removal of the employee from the active employment rolls shall be effective for all purposes the day following the date of final resolution of the grievance.
4.	Nothing in this procedure shall restrict or expand Management’s right to relieve an employee for the balance of such employee’s shift under the terms of the Basic Labor Agreement.
5.	Any grievance contesting a suspension or discharge filed pursuant to Paragraph 1 above, shall be filed and heard within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date the grievance was written at Step 2 of the grievance procedure. The Union, within the fifteen (15) day time limit,
185
ARTICLE IX
may request in writing and be granted, an extension of not more than ten (10) calendar days. A grievance not scheduled and heard at Step 2 within the aforementioned time limit or any extension thereof, will be withdrawn by the Union.
6.	Any grievance contesting a suspension or discharge pursuant to Paragraph 1 above, appealed to arbitration shall be scheduled to be heard in arbitration within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt by the Company of the Union’s written notice of appeal to arbitration. Unless mutually agreed otherwise, a grievance appealed to arbitration and not scheduled to be heard within the aforementioned thirty (30) days time limit shall be considered settled on the basis of the Step 2 decision.
7.	The parties agree that grievances concerning suspension and discharge shall, whenever possible, be handled in the Expedited Arbitration Procedure as set forth in Article IX, Section 1 of the Agreement, however, either party may elect to submit a particular grievance to Regular Arbitration for resolution.
9.28
8.	Jurisdiction of Arbitrator. Should it be determined by an Arbitrator that an employee has been suspended or discharged without cause, the Company shall reinstate
186
ARTICLE IX
the employee and make him whole for the period of his suspension or discharge, which shall include providing him such earnings and other benefits as he would have received except for such suspension or discharge, and, offsetting such earnings or other amounts as he would not have received except for such suspension or discharge.
9.29 Should it be determined by the Arbitrator that an employee has been suspended or discharged for cause, the Arbitrator shall have jurisdiction to modify the degree of discipline imposed by the Company.
9.30 The provisions of this paragraph apply to all suspensions regardless of the number of days involved.
Section F.	General Provisions Applying to Appeals

9.33
2.

188
ARTICLE IX
the facts of alleged additional violations (including the dates thereof where possible) may be presented in writing in the appropriate Step on a form supplied by the Company. Such additional claims shall be filed promptly and identify each additional grievant where possible.

If any such claim is not settled it shall be considered as a grievance and processed in accordance with the applicable procedure and the applicable time limitations.
9.35
4.	For any grievance settlement involving retroactive payments, the appropriate Union and Company representatives shall expeditiously determine the identity of the payees and the specific amount owed each payee.

9.36
5.	In cases involving large numbers of employees or extended periods of retroactivity, in order to expedite payment the parties shall, whenever possible, agree upon the identity of the payees and the specific procedures for determining the amounts owed or equitable
189
ARTICLE IX
approximations of such amounts. Management will make payment at the earliest date in light of the procedures agreed upon and will, within two (2) weeks following such agreement, notify the Steward of the date when such payment will be made. A copy of such notice will be forwarded to the Office Manager of the Union.
Section G.	Miscellaneous Provisions Applying to Grievance Procedure
9.37
1.	The Grievance Procedure may be utilized by the Union in processing grievances which allege a violation of the obligations of the Company to the Union as such. In processing such grievances, the Union shall observe the specified time limits in appealing and the Company shall observe the specified time limits in answering. In the event an employee dies, the Union may process on behalf of his or her legal heirs any claim he or she would have had relating to any monies due under any provision of this Agreement.
9.38
2.	Notwithstanding the procedure provided, any grievance may be submitted to arbitration at any time by agreement of the parties to this Agreement.
190

9.40

191
ARTICLE IX
Absenteeism Policy until such time as Step 3 of the foregoing policy has been invoiced. Grievances of Step 1 or Step 2 discipline must be filed no later than imposition of Step 3, or the penalties previously imposed shall be considered by the parties to have been proper and for just cause. Any such grievances shall state the reason(s) for the Union’s challenge of said discipline.
Section H.	Regular Arbitration
9.43
1.	Grievances appealed to arbitration as provided in Article IX shall be submitted to an impartial Arbitrator to be selected by mutual agreement of the parties. If such representatives cannot agree within fifteen (15) days of notice of appeal on the designation of an Arbitrator, they shall each prepare a list of three (3) Arbitrators who shall be current members of the National Academy of Arbitrators. The parties shall then rank the Arbitrator in order of preference, from one (1) through six (6). The two (2) rankings shall be added, and the Arbitrator receiving the lowest combined ranking score shall be selected.
9.44
2.	The Arbitrator shall have jurisdiction and authority only to interpret, apply, or determine compliance with
192
ARTICLE IX

198
ARTICLE IX
Section J.	Union Grievance Representation
9.69
1.	Union Stewards shall be selected by the Union to represent designated plant units. Except as provided below, the total number of Stewards shall not exceed sixty-eight (68).
9.70
2.	On or before January 1 of 1997, and of each succeeding year thereafter in which an election of Union officers is scheduled to take place, the parties will meet to determine the appropriate number of Stewards to represent employees during the Steward’s succeeding term of office. In making this determination, the parties shall use as a guideline a ratio of one (1) Steward for each 145 bargaining unit members. The number of bargaining unit members to be used in this application will be the average number of bargaining unit members during the three (3) calendar years immediately preceding the Union election year. However, for the 2003 Union election the number of Stewards will be twenty-four (24).
9.71
3.	Insofar as is practicable, Stewards shall be selected by the Union to represent designated plant units and no more than one (I) Steward shall be designated to represent any one (1) plant unit.
199
ARTICLE IX
9.72
The plant units designated for this purpose will be solely determined by the Union, so long as the ratio referred to in subsection 2. above, is maintained.
9.73
4.	Commencing in 1982, and thereafter, an Executive Committee shall be selected by the Union membership from among the Stewards in accordance with the bylaws of the Union; provided, however, that so long as bargaining unit work continues to be performed in the geographical areas encompassed in each of the six (6) Union divisions as they are presently constituted (i.e. SW-I, SW-2, SS, SM, WTM, Steubenville Plant), there shall be at least one (I) member of such Executive Committee selected from each such division.
9.74
5.	In no event will the Executive Committee which takes office subsequent to the Union election in 1997 be comprised of more than nine (9) members in addition to the President of the Union.
Section K.	Activities of Union Representatives
9.75
1.	Union Stewards may at all times enter the premises of
200
ARTICLE IX
their own departments for the adjustment of grievances or other proper Union business. The Stewards from any division may enter each other’s premises for such proper Union purposes, provided the visiting Steward is properly identified and is accompanied by a Steward from the division being visited.
9.76
2.	The Division Officers may at all times enter the premises of their division for proper Union business.
9.77
3.	Union Stewards in entering the premises of the various divisions must have proper identification, such as Steward’s identification card.
9.78
4.	The President and Office Manager of the Union and the members of the Union’s Executive Committee may at all times enter any premises of the Employer for proper Union business.
9.79
5.	a. Stewards will be afforded time off from scheduled work without loss of time or pay to process grievances under Step 1 of the Grievance Procedure, and to confer with representatives of the Company during working
201
ARTICLE IX
hours under Step 2 of the Grievance Procedure, and on other matters of mutual concern, provided that they comply with the provisions of this Section. The Company will attempt to schedule such meetings in a manner so as to minimize the necessity for Stewards to be absent from scheduled work provided, however, that grievance meetings will not be unilaterally scheduled by the Company outside of the normal hours of the daylight turn of the area which the Steward represents. The Company will authorize payment for Steward’s lost time only for the duration of the meeting with Management, plus a reasonable time [not to exceed thirty (30) minutes before and after the meeting] for the Steward to get to and from the job. In those instances in which a meeting with Management is concluded less than four (4) hours before the end of the Steward’s scheduled turn, the Management representative who conducts the meeting for which the Company Steward has been excused may agree to authorize Company paid lost time for the balance of the Steward’s scheduled turn; provided, however, that the Steward returns to the plant area which he represents for the balance of the turn and conducts Union-Company related business consistent with his representative capacity as a Steward.
9.80
b. (1) A Union Steward (who is not a member of the
202
ARTICLE IX
Executive or Incentive & Rate Committee) shall, if he so request, be paid for one day [a maximum of eight (8) hours per week] in addition to the number of hours per week to which he would otherwise be entitled to work by reason of his seniority, for any week during which he performs any work for the Company. The purpose of this payment is to compensate the Steward for the performance of all business related to Union-Company relations and need not involve meetings with Management as described above. This compensation shall be identified as compensation for a “Steward’s Day”, and the Steward shall spend such time [up to a maximum of eight (8) hours per week] in such activities as investigation of grievances, maintenance of grievance records, consultation with employees or Union officials, etc., either in the plant, at the Union Hall, or in other locations in which Company-Union business is being transacted; provided, however, that a Steward who elects a Saturday or Sunday as a Steward’s Day will be required to spend such hours in the plant.
9.81 b. (2) A Steward will be compensated for hours worked on his Steward’s Day at an hourly rate equal to his average straight-time hourly earnings on the job for which he is scheduled for the majority of his scheduled hours during the week in question. He will not be expected to
203
ARTICLE IX
perform any work on an established job during such period, but will be required to follow established payroll procedures when entering or leaving the plant premises.
9.82
b. (3) A Steward must advise the appropriate Management representative of the day selected for his Steward’s Day no later than noon Thursday of the week preceding the week in question. In no event may a holiday be designated as a Steward’s Day.
9.83
b. (4) In the event that the job for which a Steward is scheduled is “cancelled” on any turn on which a Steward is scheduled to work, and there are other employees working on that turn on jobs which the Steward represents, the Steward will be permitted to work on that scheduled turn on any job to which his is entitled by reason of his seniority, provided that his assignment to such job does not deprive another scheduled employee of work. If no such job exists, but there are laborer or other non-standard crew type jobs among the group of jobs represented by the Steward, he will be permitted to work as an “extra” employee on those turns and will receive for all hours worked thereon his average straight-time hourly earnings as calculated for payment of a Steward’s Day. In the alternative, and
204
ARTICLE IX
notwithstanding the requirement set forth above regarding the election of a Steward’s Day, a Steward may change his election under these circumstances to designate a cancelled turn as a Steward’s Day. Except as they fall within one (1) of the provisions for payment of lost time for Union business, scheduled hours not worked by a Steward on account of a cancelled turn will not be paid for by the Company.
9.84
b.	(5) With the exceptions set forth above, hours worked on a Steward’s Day will be considered as hours worked for all purposes under the provisions of the several agreements between the parties.
9.85
6.	a. Union Stewards who are members of the Executive or Incentive and Rate Committees as of January 1, 1979,
will be available during regular business hours for the transaction of Company-Union business for six (6) days per week during weeks in which they are not on vacation or certified as disabled and unable to work; provided, however, that recognized holidays, whether worked or not, will be considered as days worked for purposes of this paragraph. The practices by which pay for lost
205
ARTICLE IX
time for such individual committee members is determined as of January 1, 1979, will remain in effect with respect to such individual committee members for so long as they continue to be members of the Executive or Incentive and Rate Committees.
9.86
b. With respect to Stewards who become members of the Executive or Incentive and Rate Committees subsequent to January 1, 1979, they will be available during regular business hours for the transaction of Company-Union business for six (6) days per week during weeks in which they are not on vacation or certified as disabled and unable to work. For each full week of availability, they shall be compensated at an hourly rate equal to the average straight-time hourly earnings of the job to which they would have been assigned during that week were it not for their membership on such committee. For any week in which a committeeman is available on some but less than six (6) days, his weekly compensation shall be reduced proportionately at a rate of one and one-half (1 1/2) times his average straight-time hourly rate for the first eight (8) hour of such unavailability and one times his average straight-time hourly rate for unavailable hours in excess of eight (8).
9.87
7.	Any Steward (including a Steward who is a member
206
ARTICLE IX
of the Executive or Incentive and Rate Committees) who enters or leaves the plant premises while on Company paid lost time will be required to “punch” in or out in accordance with established payroll procedures. In addition, the Company and the Union will cooperate in the development and implementation of appropriate control procedures to properly account for Company paid lost time spent by Stewards outside of the plant premises in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The Company reserves the right to establish reasonable procedures for auditing compliance of Stewards with the provisions of this Agreement (with which procedures the Union will cooperate) and to discontinue or restrict lost time payments to Stewards who fail to comply therewith.
Section L. Prohibition Against Strikes and Lockouts
9.88
L There shall be no strikes, work stoppages, or interruptions, or impeding of work. No officer or representative of the Union shall authorize, instigate, aid, or condone any such activities. No employee shall participate in any such activities. There shall be no lockouts.

14.1
When, in the sole judgment of the Company, it decides to close permanently a department, or discontinue permanently a substantial portion thereof and terminate the employment of individuals, an employee whose employment is terminated either directly or indirectly as a result thereof, because he was not entitled to other employment within the same department under the provisions of Article VIII - Seniority, of this Agreement and paragraph 2. of Section B., below, shall be entitled to a severance allowance in accordance with and subject to the following provisions.
Section B.	Eligibility
14.2

The employee shall have the option of either accepting such a new employment or requesting his severance allowance. If an employee accepts such other employment in another department, he shall forfeit his rights to severance pay except that if his employment in such other department is terminated (for any reason except discharge for proper cause) before he has earned the full amount of his severance pay, he shall be entitled, upon such termination, to receive the excess of his severance pay over the earnings which he has received in the department to which he was transferred. Furthermore, if an employee accepts such other employment, the status of his Department Seniority shall be the same as if he were transferred to such new department in lieu of layoff.

However, thegrant-ing of such request shall not at any later date establish eligibility for severance pay unless the Company, in its sole judgement, further decides to close permanently the remainder of the department or a substantial portion thereof. If such job assignment within the department results directly in the permanent displacement of some other employee, the latter shall be eligible for severance allowance provided he otherwise qualifies under the terms of this Article.
Section C.	Scale of Allowance
14.5 An eligible individual shall receive severance allowance based upon the following weeks for the corresponding continuous Company Seniority as of the date of termination:

Section E.	Payment of Allowance
14.7 Payment shall be made in a lump sum at the time of termination. Acceptance of severance allowance shall ter

ARTICLE XIV
minate employment and continuous service for all purposes under this Agreement.
Section F.	Non-duplication of Allowance
14.8 Severance allowance shall not be duplicated for the same severance, whether the other obligation arises by reason of contract, law or otherwise. If an individual is or shall become entitled to any discharge, liquidation, severance, or dismissal allowance, or payment of similar kind by reason of any law of the United States of America or of any of the states, districts, or territories thereof subject to its jurisdiction, the total amount of such payments shall be deducted from the severance allowance to which the individual may be entitled under this Article, or any payment made by the Company under this Article, may be offset against such payments. Statutory unemployment compensation payments shall be excluded from the non-duplication provisions of this Article.
Section G.	Election Concerning Layoff Status
14.9 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, an employee who would have otherwise been terminated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement and under the circumstances specified in

ARTICLE XIX
19.2 La.

19.3 b. If production, service, and day-to-day maintenance and repair work have, in the past, been performed within a plant under some circumstances by employees within a bargaining unit and under some circumstances by employees of contractors, or both, such contracting out shall be permissible under circumstances similar to those under which contracting out has been a practice, unless otherwise mutually agreed pursuant to Paragraph 4.a. below.
19.4 c. Production, service and day-to-day maintenance and repair work within a plant as to which the practice has been to have such work performed by employees of contractors may continue to be contracted out, unless otherwise mutually agreed pursuant to Paragraph 4.a. below. However, in the event reduced operations are anticipated in the seniority unit to which the work
238
ARTICLE XIX
would most appropriately be assigned, Management shall, prior to contracting out the work, give consideration to the assignment of such work to the employees within said unit providing such work will not involve substantial overtime for such employees or alter schedules for the completion of other jobs.

2.	Maintenance and repair work performed within the plant, other than that described in Paragraph 1. above, and installation, replacement and reconstruction of equipment and production facilities, other than that described in Paragraph 3. below, may not be contracted out for performance within the plant unless contracting out under the circumstances existing as of the time the decision to contract out was made can be demonstrated by the Company to have been the more reasonable course than doing the work with bargaining unit employees, taking into consideration the significant factors which are relevant. Whether the decision was made at the particular time to avoid the obligations of this paragraph may be a relevant factor forconsideration.
19.6
3.	New construction including major installation, major replacement, and major reconstruction of equipment and production facilities at any plant may be contracted
239
ARTICLE XIX
out, subject to any rights and obligations of the parties which are applicable.

ARTICLE XIX
of the clause and which is work to be performed within the plant, the Union committee members will be notified. Such notice will be given in advance of the final decision to contract out the work except where emergency requirements prevent such timely notice. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be sufficient to advise the Union members of the committee of the location, type, scope, duration, and timetable of the work to be performed so that the Union members of the committee can adequately form an opinion as to the reasons for such contracting out. Such notices shall generally contain the information specified in the check list set forth in Appendix II-2.

241
ARTICLE XIX

242
ARTICLE XIX
disputes and grievances can be avoided. If either the Company or Union members of the committee feel that this is not being done, they may appeal to the President of the Union and the appropriate representative of the Company for review of the complaint about the failure of the committee to properly function.

This provision should in no way affect the rights of the parties in connection with the processing of any grievance relating to the subject of contracting out.

21.6
3.	A local working condition may be changed or terminated at any time by mutual agreement reduced to writing and signed by the parties specified in Paragraph 2. above. Those Memorandum of Understanding entered into prior to August 1, 1977, which were subject to unilateral termination by either party shall, on the effective date of this Agreement, only be terminated in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
21.7
4.	Should there be any local working conditions in effect which provide benefits that are in excess of or in addition to the benefits established by this Agreement, they shall remain in effect for the term of this Agreement, except as they are changed or eliminated under the term of this Article.
21.8
5.	The Company shall have the right to change or eliminate any local working conditions if, as the result of action taken by Management under Article XII -Management Rights, the basis for the existence of the
246
ARTICLE XXI
local working condition is changed or eliminated, thereby making it unnecessary to continue such local working condition; provided, however, that when such a change or elimination is made by the Company, the Union shall have recourse to the Grievance Procedure and arbitration, if necessary, to have the Company justify its action.
ARTICLE XXII
OBLIGATION TO REOPEN THE AGREEMENT TO DISCUSS THE CORPORATE FINANCIAL POSITION
22.1
If the President of Weirton Steel Corporation, with the approval of the Board of Directors, concludes during the term of this Agreement that the economic viability of the Company is threatened, including the ability of the Company to make the necessary capital expenditures, whether due to market conditions or the Company’s failure to meet its financial targets, or because employees represented by the USWA agree to extend the existing concessions or agree to grant concessions other than those contained in the master Agreement, dated February 28, 1983, then the parties are obligated to meet and to bargain.
247
ARTICLE XXII
22.2
The purpose and the intent of the negotiations shall be to resolve any threat to the Company’s continued viability, preferably by cost-saving measures other than wage reductions, but if necessary, further wage reductions. If the basis of the obligation to meet and to bargain is poor financial performance, then the goal of the bargaining will be to cut costs sufficiently for the Company to survive and to be sufficiently profitable to make the necessary capital expenditures. If the basis is a USWA concession, then the goal shall be to take equivalent concessions, if proven necessary.
22.3
The parties will attempt to reach agreement within sixty (60) days.
22.4 This Article does not create a basis for arbitration or to impose on the ISU any concessions to which it does not agree in accordance with its constitution and by-laws governing contract ratification. The parties are obligated, however, to bargain speedily and in good faith to achieve the objectives set forth in this Article. The Company shall not have the right to institute its position unilaterally. Failure to agree shall not be construed as a
248
ARTICLE XXII
breach of the safety net conditions with National Steel Corporation as recited in the Weirton Retirement Program 056.
22.5 If the President of the Company with the approval of the Board exercises its rights to reopen under this Article, the Company shall have the obligation to demonstrate to the Union the actions taken outside this Agreement to correct such financial difficulties. The Union’s bargaining representatives shall have reasonable access to examine the books and records of the corporation in analyzing the Company’s position in the negotiations including the retention of an independent accounting firm to assist the bargaining representatives.
22.6 Further, if the Agreement is reopened during the term in accordance with this Article, the Union shall have the right to raise non-economic issues in the bargaining, but shall not have the right to strike or compel the Company to arbitrate unresolved issues.
22.7 The parties agree, effective June 8, 2001, that the economic viability and financial condition of the Company has been threatened by the import crisis to
249
APPENDIX I
the extent that the parties obligations herein to meet and bargain to resolve any threat to the Company’s continued viability are activated. Consequently, the parties will immediately commence to bargain speedily and in good faith to achieve the objectives set forth in this Article. Should the parties reach an agreement that requires modifications of the basic Agreement and other supplemental Agreements, the Union will seek timely membership ratification of the same notwithstanding the term of the 2001 basic Agreement.
ARTICLE XXI11
70/80 EARLY RETIREMENT OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH ATTRITION
23.1 An important goal of the Weirton Steel Corporation is the maintenance and creation of necessary jobs for its employees. Tied with the employment goal is the ultimate goal of creating and maintaining a competitive, successful ESOP company for this generation of workers and generations of workers to come in the future. In order to achieve these goals, the parties understand that they must be ever-vigilant in seeking greater efficiencies as a means of controlling and reducing costs and
250
ARTICLE XXIII
generating viable profit levels.
23.2 The parties agree that one means of generating cost savings and realizing greater efficiencies is through the elimination ofjobs. When in fact a job elimination does generate cost savings and the Union agrees to that job elimination, the Company will share these savings with bargaining unit employees in the form of special 70/80 retirements.
23.3 In an effort to implement the above goals and to meet the needs and desires of our long-service employees, the parties agree that when a job is eliminated, special consideration, as follows at paragraphs 23.4 through 23.7, will be offered. For purposes of this Article, a job elimination is the permanent elimination of a recognized job in a sequence or the permanent reduction of the number of employees regularly scheduled and currently working on a recognized job in a sequence when in either case a permanent incumbent or an employee regularly scheduled and currently working the job would be displaced.
23.4 The Company, in writing, will propose a permanent job
251
ARTICLE XXIII
elimination to the Union. Included in the proposal will be all information on which the Company relies.
23.5 The Union will have thirty (30) days to agree to the proposed permanent job elimination.
23.6 If the Union agrees to the permanent job elimination, the Company will offer 70/80 retirements in accordance with 2.6(d) of the Pension Agreement. The number of offered 70/80 retirements will equal the number of incumbents currently working or employees regularly scheduled and currently working the affected job who would be permanently displaced as a result of the job elimination.
23.7 There is no obligation of the Company to offer a "70/80” retirement where a job vacancy is caused by retirement, quit, permanent bid or permanent transfer and the Company chooses not to fill the vacancy or chooses to permanently eliminate the job.
23.8 There is no obligation of the Company to offer a second “70/80” where the initial “70/80” required to be offered
252
ARTICLE XXIII
under Article XXIII is accepted by an employee who is not an incumbent in the sequence (or subdepartment where no sequence is recognized) in which the original job elimination occurred and the Company chooses not to fill the resulting vacancy or chooses to permanently eliminate the job.
23.9 Any and all contentions as to outstanding but unsatisfied obligations of the Company existing prior to the 1996 amendments to Article XXII1 are agreed to be resolved and fully satisfied by providing the opportunity to elect to retire under the early retirement window provisions agreed to during the 1996 labor negotiations.
23.10 Retirements under the 1996 early retirement window provision will not cause, require or obligate the Company to offer “70/80” retirements under Article XXIII.
23.11 Appropriate candidates for the above 70/80 retirements will be chosen by agreement of the Company and Union in accordance with the particular circumstances of that permanent job elimination, but in all cases Company Seniority will control. If there are eligible candidates
253
ARTICLE XXIII
on the job or within the sequence, the initial offer of 70/80 retirements will be made to them. They must accept the offer of 70/80 retirement not later than fourteen (14) days after they receive all relevant information from the Pension Department. If an employee accepts the offer within the above-stated period, said 70/80 retirement shall be effective at the end of the month in which the offer is accepted; provided, however, that retirements shall be scheduled so as to facilitate the break-in training necessary to effect an orderly transition in the efficiency of operations. Where the presence of an incumbent or a regularly scheduled employee of the job is integral to the requisite break-in training, Management shall retain the right to hold said employee on the job for a reasonable period of time. If there are no currently eligible candidates on the job or within the sequence, the 70/80 retirements shall be held in reserve for six months for those employees who will achieve eligibility within that period of time. Upon achieving eligibility, such an employee will be offered the 70/80 retirement and must accept the offer of 70/80 retirement within fourteen (14) days of the offers being extended to him. Further, such employee will agree to effectuate said retirement within thirty (30) days of acceptance of the offer, except in cases where an employee is held for break-in training purposes as provided above. If there are no eligible candidates under
254
ARTICLE XXIII
the above criteria, the 70/80 retirements shall then be offered to eligible candidates within the department (“department” being defined in marginal paragraph 8.6 of the Agreement), division, or company, as the parties mutually agree, pursuant to the procedures outlined above.
23.12
If the Company and Union cannot reach agreement within the thirty-day period set forth above, the parties will revert to their rights under this Agreement (e.g., Article VIII, Article IX, Article X! 1, and Article XXII).
ARTICLE XXIV
JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT COUNCIL
24.1
The parties agree that the knowledge learned by each other during the process of studying the feasibility of an ESOP company has proven invaluable.
24.2
The elected leaders of the Union learned much about elements of running a business, such as, capital planning, product development, employment costs, marketing, and finance.
255
ARTICLE XXIV
24.3
Executive Management learned much about the concerns and needs of Union-represented employees.
24.4
It is clear to the parties that there must be a continuation of the above exchange of ideas and information. In fact, the parties understand and are committed to establishing like communications systems for all employees (see Article XXV).
24.5
As a step toward establishing and maintaining this needed communication system, the Joint Labor Management Council is established under the following guidelines:
24.6
1.	Co-Chairmen of the Joint Labor Management council will be the President of the LS.U. and the Chief Executive Officer of Weirton Steel Corporation.
24.7
2.	Management representatives on the Council will be the Chief Executive Officer, the Director of Industrial Relations, and the Vice President of Operations.
256
ARTICLE XXIV
24.8
3.	Union representatives on the Council will be the President of the I.S.U., the Chairmen of the Divisional Committees, and the President of the LG.U.
24.9
4.	Other members of Labor or Management will be invited to participate by agreement of the Co-Chairmen.
24.10
5.	Meetings of the Council will be held once per month or more frequently as requested by the Chief Executive Officer or the President of either Union.
24.11
6.	Meetings of the Council will be scheduled in a manner that assures the ability of the Chief Executive Officer and the Presidents of the Union to attend.
ARTICLE XXV
SYSTEM TO CREATE EMPLOYEE MEETINGS
25.1
It is clear to the parties that to have a successful ESOP company, a spirit of cooperation and desire to solve problems must exist in all employees. The parties
257
ARTICLE XXV
believe that one way to facilitate the creation of this necessary attitude is to establish a system of meetings to allow interested employees to exchange information and ideas. Therefore, the following system to create such meetings is agreed to.
25.2
The various committees of the LS.U. will meet with appropriate Management to establish local groupings of employees.
25.3
Once the groupings of employees are agreed to, all employees within each group will vote to establish a weekly meeting time which is most convenient to the majority.
25.4
Participation in the weekly meetings will be voluntaiy and without pay for any participants.
25.5
Subjects to be discussed in the meetings are any topics which participants want to discuss and which are related to the work place. Subjects to be discussed in the initial meetings are group leaders, organization of the group, goals of the group, and rules of the group.
258
ARTICLE XXV
However, these meetings shall not serve as a substitute for the contractual Grievance Procedures.
25.6 On at least a monthly basis appropriate members of Management will be available to discuss matters which the group determines are of particular interest. For example, if the group wants an update of the sales situation, an appropriate member of the Sales Department will attend give such information.
25.7 The parties understand that the establishment of the above Participation Groups is only a small step toward our goal of all employees working together to create and maintain a strong, successful ESOP company. Progress of the Participation Groups will be closely monitored by the Union and Company and appropriate changes and improvements (based on information from participants) will be made through the Joint Labor Management Council (Article XXIV).
259
ARTICLE XXVI

1.	It is the intent of the 21 -day provision to encourage prompt notice of claims for sickness and accident benefits so that evaluation of a claim, including any necessary investigation of the medical and other factual aspects of the claim, can be made in an expeditious manner.
2.	It is not the intent of this provision that any claim be denied for failure to comply with the notice requirement if such failure did not interfere with the ability of the Company and/or insurance carrier to establish the
318
APPENDIX IV
medical and other factual aspects of the claim.
3.	No claim will be denied under the 21-day rule unless the Company and/or its carrier has made a reasonable effort to investigate the medical and other factual aspects of the claim. Such investigation will involve contacting the claimant’s physician or physicians or other medical source concerning the nature of the disability, number of treatments and nature of treatments or contacting the claimant concerning the same matters.
4.	The fact that a claim has been filed after the 21 -day deadline will not be the basis for the denial of any claim for benefits with respect to a period of absence subsequent to the date on which such claim was filed.
5.	In the event a claim is filed by mail, it will be considered timely if it is postmarked on or before the twenty-first day of disability.
6.	If the Company’s insurance office is closed on the twenty-first day of disability, a claim will be considered timely if it is presented on the first day thereafter on which the Company’s insurance office is open.
7.	If a claim is denied pursuant to the 21-day rule, the Company and/or the carrier will inform the employee in writing that his claim has been denied because the untimely filing interfered with the Company’s and/or the carrier’s ability to establish the medical and factual aspects of the claim.

This letter will memorialize the decision of the Executive Committee of October 2, 1985, permitting the Company to establish a Salvage Crew to enter various areas of the Mill in order to conduct salvage operations.
However, I would note some Union concerns in this regard. First, the 1SU would request that no certain time limit or trial period be established; rather, the Union’s position is that Company representatives must constantly be available to meet with representatives of the Union should problems arise in this area. Second, it must be clearly established that this program will not result in infringement in the job areas. Third, the salvage program is not to result in a contracting-out situation for areas of the Mill. I would note further that in imple

APPENDIX VI
This letter will confirm the parties entire understanding concerning reductions in manpower which occur during the term of the Labor Agreement due to efficiencies resulting from a capital plan expenditure.
The Company and the Union agree that it is their best interest to utilize layoffs as a last resort in dealing with efficiencies resulting from the capital plan.

To this end the Company will utilize all measures necessary to expedite processing of 70/80 Retirement opportunities for eligible employees so that manpower reductions may be reasonably obtained by attrition.
Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent the Company from achieving the efficiencies resulting from the capital plan or to apply to reductions not caused by efficiencies resulting from the capital plan.

As we discussed, any such amendment which permits or facilitates shares being sold directly from the 1984 ESOP trust, whether publicly or privately, for the benefit of participants’ accounts (instead of being distributed directly to participants, which is now the single method required by the 1984 ESOP) and/or permits diversification of participants’ accounts by allowing the proceeds obtained from selling such shares to be reinvested in the alternative funds for the 1984 ESOP trust, and which amendment, after being adopted by the Company’s Board of Directors, is submitted to a vote of 1984 ESOP participants in accordance with the provisions of the plan, shall be considered to have been adopted properly under our agreements and shall not require any further or separate vote of the union membership.
This letter shall not modify any obligations the Company may have to negotiate changes to the 1984 ESOP with the Union or any other issues such as

In situations where it is identified in paragraph 2 as “optional” for employees on an existing job to progress to an expanded or multicraft job, if such employee elects to progress he will receive a new job date when he qualifies for the expanded or multicrafted job. In the event of layoffs due to business conditions or other reasons, such layoffs will be made under the terms of the Labor Agreement, provided that an employee at a higher level of an expanded or multicraft job shall not be presumed to be more qualified than an employee at a lower level of expanded or multicraft job, and provided that employees who are 55 years of age or older, or who
345
APPENDIX VI
have 33 years of service as of the date of this Agreement, shall be laid off or retained solely on the basis of seniority.
Vl-5.13
5.	No maintenance employee whose job is being expanded or multicrafted will be placed in layoff due to the efficiencies which result from this reorganization, provided that the parties recognize that layoffs may occur due to business conditions or other reasons not caused by the efficiencies created by this reorganization. Maintenance employees who the company determines are not needed to perform work in their regular sequence or department due to the efficiencies which result from this reorganization, may be assigned to fill known weekly temporary vacancies within the scope of the applicable Trade or Craft job anywhere within their respective Division.
VI-5.14
6.	As employees qualify on the expanded or multicrafted jobs, the Company may determine that the number of maintenance positions may be permanently decreased. If that occurs, the Company will declare the number of position reductions to be implemented and will offer the same number of 70/80 Retirements to employees in the affected sequence or sequences in the department. For
346
APPENDIX VI
example, if 70/80 Retirements are offered as a result of efficiencies gained through the Maintenance Mechanic and Maintenance Technician jobs in a department, the 70/80 Retirement opportunities shall not be reduced until all employees, who are eligible for a 70/80 Retirement at the time they were offered by the Company, have been offered a 70/80 Retirement. A 70/80 Retirement will not be offered in the event an employee leaves the sequence through attrition (e.g., death, retirement, job bid) and is not replaced.
Vl-5.15
7.	After one or more groups of permanent reductions have occurred in an assigned maintenance sequence pursuant to paragraph 6 above, the Company agrees to meet with the Union on a local basis to discuss the adoption of a full crew agreement applicable to that sequence. The purpose of any such agreement shall not be to limit the efficiencies which can be achieved through expanded and multicrafted jobs and all such agreements, to be effective, must be signed by the Manager - Industrial Relations.
VI-5.16
8.	This Agreement, which sets forth the entire understanding of the parties, is agreed to effective September 25, 1989.

6. SUMMER HIRING PROGRAM
(Production and Maintenance)
This memorandum, made this 18th day of May, 1987, memorializes the agreement made by the Independent Steelworkers Union and Weirton Steel Corporation concerning the summer hiring program. It is agreed that:
I.	All persons hired between May 17, 1987, and October 3, 1987, will be considered summer hires. Such persons will not accumulate permanent seniority status during the aforementioned time period.
2.	All persons hired for the summer program must be either sons or daughters of active, deceased or retired employees of Weirton Steel.
3.	Hires into the summer program will be selected via a lottery system. Applications will be numbered as they are received, and then drawn and ranked. Seventy-five (75%) percent of the summer hires will be selected from the applications of the sons and daughters of LS.U. hourly employees, whether active, deceased or retired. Ten percent (10%) of the summer hires will be selected
348
APPENDIX VI
from the applications of sons and daughters of the l.S.U. salary non-exempt employees, and fifteen percent (15%) from the applications of exempt and excluded salary employees, whether active, deceased or retired.
4,	The rate of pay for summer hires will equal seventy percent (70%) or the amount a regular employee would have earned, e.g., a summer hire working a Job Class 1 or 2 will earn $6.491 per hour.
5.	Summer hires will be eligible for all contractually recognized pay additives (e.g., overtime, shift differential, etc.). These additives will also be paid at a rate equal to seventy percent (70%) of that to which a regular employee would be entitled.
6.	Summer hires will be covered by the applicable workers’ compensation statutes, but will not be eligible for coverage under any of the Weirton Steel Corporation’s employee benefit plan, (e.g., hospitalization, major medical, life insurance, sickness and accident, pension, profit sharing, employee stock ownership plan, etc.); provided, however, the total amount of wages earned by summer hires performing production and maintenance unit work will be included in determining the portion of the Total Profit Sharing Amount to be allocated to the l.S.U. Hourly Pool.
349
APPENDIX VI
7.	If a continuing need for increased employment level exists at the end of the summer hire period, i.e., October 3, 1987, the regular hiring process will be utilized to fill that need. Summer hires will be given initial consideration in the regular hiring process. Employees hired after October 3, 1987, shall begin their probationary periods on the first day worked after October 3, 1987.
8.	This Agreement will cover summer hiring for an initial term beginning May 17, 1987, and ending October 3, 1987. The Company and Union’s Executive Committee may renew this Agreement from year to year by executing an extension agreement. Any extension agreement shall address the period of summer hiring program for that particular year and any other provision necessary for the implementation of the same.

7.	SOCIAL SECURITY OFFSET PENSION UNDERSTANDING
Vl-7.1
December 6, 1990 Mr. Virgil G Thompson, President Independent Steelworkers Union 2971 West Street
Weirton, WV 26062
Dear Mr. Thompson:
This letter confirms our understanding concerning the calculation of pension benefits pursuant to the terms of the 1989 Collective Bargaining Agreement and the Weirton Steel Corporation Retirement Plan (the “Plan”). It was the understanding of the Company and the Union, during the 1989 labor negotiations, that the proposed regulations then in effect under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 precluded the continuation of the Social Security Offset Pension provided at Section III -3(b) (2) of the Plan beyond December 31,1989. Based on that understanding and not with any desire or intent to otherwise reduce benefits, the parties negotiated a transitional benefit pension formula and an increased percent pension formula. These formulas were designed to provide, to the maximum extent possible, that no participant retiring during the life of the agree
351
APPENDIX VI
ment would experience a decrease to the amount of pension determined under the Plan solely as a result of the elimination of the Social Security Offset Pension formula. Thereafter, additional regulations were proposed which permit a Social Security Offset Pension negotiated under a Collective Bargaining Agreement. As a result of the change in the regulations proposed with respect to collectively bargained plan, the Company and Union agree as follows:
Pursuant to the terms of the 1989 Collective Bargaining Agreement and the Plan, an increased percent pension and a transition pension as set forth in Attachment 31 to the Settlement Agreement, will be computed for any participant who is retiring or otherwise terminating his or her employment during the life of the Agreement. In addition, an increased minimum pension as set forth in Attachment 31 to the Settlement Agreement and a social security offset pension determined under the formula in effect on December 31, 1989, will be computed for any participant who is retiring or otherwise terminating his or her employment on or after January 1, 1990. The participant’s monthly benefit shall be the highest of the four calculations.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS - 1996
1. CONTRACTING OUT
The Company will commit, during the life of the 1996 collective bargaining agreement, to use its current employees to perform trade and craft construction and maintenance work which has a cost of under one million dollars (labor and materials for the entire project) within the plant, provided its employees and the Company have the necessary expertise and equipment to perform such work in a timely and efficient manner, and further provided that agreements can be reached on all subjects:
A.	Dollar Threshold - The cut off point for “contracting in’’ is projects of less than one million dollars, adjusted to $1,250,000 effective September 26, 1999. The performance of projects of this size should provide for the increased utilization of maintenance employees in an effective manner.
376
APPENDIX VIII
B.	The term “contracting in’’ shall mean the assignment of projects to Weirton Steel maintenance employees for performance within the plant which might otherwise be contracted out to other companies or suppliers.
C.	Examples of the types of work to be contracted in: 1. Structural work.
2.	Pipe installations and repairs.
3.	Form work, cement work and general carpentry.
4.	Wiring and conduit work.
5.	Field welding requirements work.
6.	Sheet/Roofing.
7.	Sluiceway Repairs.
8.	Spray Wiring Trays.
9.	Portable Power Washing.
10.	Rubber Installations (Tomahawk) Pickier Tanks.
11.	ShotKrete - Castables Installations (BF) Casthouse T. Bottles.
12.	Stress relief of field welds.
13.	Slurry trucks (subject to a 30-day evaluation following the date of ratification).
14.	Runner covers (2 trial runner covers will be fabricated and in place within six (6) months
377
APPENDIX VIII
following the date of ratification to be followed by an evaluation of in-house fabrication and repair versus purchased disposable cover).
15.	Ice and Snow Removal (to the extent reasonable with existing equipment).
16.	The Company will study its full time intramill trucking within twelve (12) months of ratification. The work will be assigned to bargaining unit employees if the study demonstrates a cost reduction to the Company after consideration of the seven (7) factors set forth in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Joint Review of Outsourcing. This offer is conditioned upon the Union agreeing to exclude refuse collection (BFI) from the Contracting In obligation.
D.	In addition, the Company and the Union agree that certain jobs which are unknown or unanticipated and were not discussed and reviewed during these negotiations may as well be determined to be inappropriate for “contracting in”. The basis on which the contracting in would not occur is that if the Company does not have at the time the need arises the necessary expertise and/or equipment to perform the work in a timely and efficient manner.
378
APPENDIX VIII
Where the unanticipated need for a service occurs on a repetitive basis and would provide business justification for the appropriate training and/or obtaining the equipment, then the Company shall consider developing the expertise and available equipment to include that specific task in the “contracting in” commitment. It is further agreed that any exception advanced on the part of the Company under this analysis of unanticipated construction or maintenance tasks under this provision wold only be approved for contracting out upon the authorized signature of the Executive Vice President of Operations.
E.	The parties further agree that where Weirton Steel craft employees are fully deployed (no employees on reduction from crafts or on layoff from the Company) and the work required to be done, if not done, would likely result in loss of productivity or place any corporate assets at risk, the Company shall have the right to have the work performed on a timely basis from whatever source available, without regard to any commitments herein. In emergency situations, the Company shall arrange to have the work performed in whatever manner necessary. The fact that Weirton Steel craft employees are working a minimum of 40 hours per
379
APPENDIX VIII
week shall not be dispositive with respect to the application of this provision.
F.	Projects which exceed the applicable threshold (labor and materials) shall be considered major work under the current contracting out provision and the Union shall have an opportunity to be heard and participate in an analysis of the specifications in order to competitively bid on the project. However, the fact that no employees in the primary or like craft are on layoff shall be considered but shall not be dispositive with respect to the application of this provision.

APPENDIX VIII
MAINTENANCE FLEXIBILITY AND “CONTRACTING IN” SETTLEMENT
In order to capitalize on the efficiencies and productivity contemplated by the Company’s Universal Demands while at the same time creating the flexible workforce necessary to meet the Company’s obligations contemplated under its Contracting In proposal, it is first necessary to redeploy the Company’s maintenance forces.
1.	Operation Services establishes Area Shops (Tin, Strip Steel, etc.)
•	Relatively stable level of manning. Everyone else in Operation Services will be assigned in accordance with Universal 11 (1).
•	Those people who work in the reduced assigned areas will be flexible in accordance with Universal 1 and II (2) for the specific occasions listed and in accordance with Universal II (3).
2.	Redeployment/Reassignment to Operation Services.
• Incumbents displaced by reassignment will be assigned to the Operation Service Shop which corresponds to their craft or like craft and will be
384
APPENDIX VIII
considered as incumbents for purposes of scheduling, assignment and overtime. However, such displaced incumbents shall retain all bidding rights which they presently enjoy in their home department.
•	Reassignment to Operation Services will initially occur on a volunteer basis. Any reassignment shortfalls from a particular area will be made by reducing the junior incumbent to Operation Services. All incumbents under this provision shall be considered to be reduced from their home department.
•	Permanent vacancies which arise in the assigned areas will be filled by recall of otherwise eligible incumbents displaced from the assigned area.
•	Where work is available for a full week in an assigned area, an attempt will be made to schedule those displaced area incumbents who are qualified to perform such work to the area.
•	Incumbents displaced under this reassignment procedure will continue to be paid their current rate.
•	Laborers may be assigned to perform maintenance support in accordance with the flexibility contem
385
APPENDIX Vlll
plated by Universal Demand 11 to the full extent of their capabilities.
•	Official starting and quitting times for all employees may be established and changed by management.
•	Inasmuch as this proposal contemplates the reassignment of personnel to Operation Services, 70/80 Early Retirement Opportunities shall not be made available for the difference between any “cap” numbers previously established and the number of permanent bids which currently exist. The parties agree that redeployment of assigned maintenance personnel to Operation Services shall be considered to have satisfied any obligation to post bids.
2.	JOINT REVIEW OF OUTSOURCING
To the extent contemplated by this Memorandum, the Company is committed during the term of the 1996 Labor Agreement to the goal of insourcing work which has been previously performed by Bargaining Unit employees, provided that the justification (economic savings for the Company) is verified after full and complete financial analysis. Accordingly, the parties agree to evaluate whether bargaining unit employees can perform, on a competitive basis, items of work which the
386
APPENDIX VIII
Company has traditionally contracted out for performance outside the plant (“outsourcing”). The Committee’s initial work will be to evaluate 21 items of work listed on the Union’s Insourcing Proposal, dated January 7, 1997, within 24 months after the ratification of the 1996 Basic Labor Agreement. To that end, the Committee shall prioritize the work to be evaluated based upon its potential value to the parties and establish timetables for the completion of each evaluation.
In order to accomplish this goal, there shall immediately be established the “Insourcing Committee.” The committee shall consist of three (3) representatives of the Union and three (3) representatives of the Company. The Company representatives shall be three (3) senior members of management including the Vice President -Human Resources and Corporate Law, the Union representatives shall be the Union President, and (2) members of the Executive Committee to be designated by the Union President. Upon agreement of the Committee’s co-chairmen, the Union representative from an affected area being examined by the Committee may attend the Committee’s meeting. However, the representative will not be considered to be a member of the Committee nor shall the representative be entitled to disclosure of confidential information of the Company which is relevant to the Committee’s work.
387
APPENDIX VIII
The Committee’s primary task will be to review the items of work being outsourced for the purpose of determining whether such work can be timely, efficiently, and competitively performed by bargaining unit employees. The Committee shall establish the procedures and time frame for conducting this review. The Committee shall be provided with all information necessary to perform its tasks in a timely fashion. It is understood that where this information includes information considered confidential or proprietary by the Company, such information shall not be disclosed to any person, party or organization outside the Committee except with the written authorization of the Vice President - Human Resources and Corporate Law.
In performing this review, the Committee shall consider the following factors:
1.	The impact on the bargaining unit.
2.	Whether bargaining unit employees who are qualified to perform the work are on layoff.
3.	All proposals made by the bargaining unit to allow the work to be performed as efficiently by employees.
4.	The comparative costs of all alternatives known to the Committee.
388
APPENDIX VIII
5.	The time frame in which the work should be completed.
6.	The availability of required capital or equipment.
7.	Whether the work is covered by a warranty that is necessary to protect the investment.
In the event that the Committee’s analysis determines that work currently being outsourced cannot be competitively performed by bargaining unit employees, the Committee shall examine any restrictive practices, work rules, seniority constraints, or established pay practices, which preclude the competitive utilization of bargaining unit employees and fully consider any Union proposals to relax the same. An additional analysis of work which the Committee determines cannot be competitively performed by bargaining unit employees may occur in the event of a material change in the underlying basis for the initial analysis.
All disputes over whether outsourced work should be insourced, with or without the relaxation of restrictive practices, work rules, seniority constraints, or pay practices, shall be subject to resolution in accordance with Article XIX, Article IX, Section D. - Grievance procedure and Section H. - Regular Arbitration in an expedited manner.
389
APPENDIX VIII
It is understood that the activities of the Insourcing Committee shall not replace or eliminate the parties’ current rights and obligations under Article XIX -Contracting Out. Further, it is also understood that the Company intends to continue to use bargaining unit employees, where it believes to be appropriate, to perform inspection work on jobs that have been contracted out.
3.	WELD SHOP
MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT WELD SHOP
This Agreement, effective the 30th day of May, 1997, is between the Weirton Steel Corporation (hereinafter the “Company”) and the Independent Steelworkers Union (hereinafter the “Union”).
WHEREAS, the Company and the Union desire to maximize the efficiency and productivity of the Weld Shop and the Company’s fabrication facilities;
WHEREAS, the Company and the Union desire to minimize the impact of the transition on Weld Shop employees;
NOW THEREFORE, the Company and the Union
390
APPENDIX VIII
agree as follows:
FIRST. In order to allow for the full implementation of the parties’ intention, the Company and Union agree that all current Weld shop Memorandums of Understanding, verbal agreements, past practices, perceived past practices, customs, work assignments, scheduling overtime practices, preference assignments and/or overtime distribution procedures shall be considered null and void upon the effective date of this Agreement except as to any such memorandums, agreements, practices, customs, or procedures which the Company, in its sole discretion, specifically declares will remain in effect, as represented by Exhibit A.
There shall be no restrictions in assignment, restrictive work rules or practices upon th effective date of this agreement unless and until such are thereafter agreed to by the Parties, reduced to writing, and signed by the Area Manager - Operation Services, the Director of Industrial Relations, the Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Corporate Law, the Union’s Steel Works 2 Division Officers, and the Weld Shop Union Steward, However, turn preferences shall be maintained. The Company will attempt to respect existing job preferences except where management determines that such will detract from the performance of
391
APPENDIX VIII
Weld Shop work in an efficient and competitive manner.
SECOND. All current Operation Services welders (7) will have an opportunity to multicraft as either a riggerwelder, pipefitter-welder or, where applicable, as a Certified Maintenance Technician. A welder who successfully completes multicraft training will receive a six (6) job class pay increase. Certified Welders must mul-ticraft as a Certified Maintenance Technician to receive the six (6) job class pay increase (four (4) class increase for Certified Expanded 1 Welders).
THIRD. The Company agrees to retain a minimum of eight (8) welders, which shall reduce to a minimum of seven (7) when the current incumbents identified in Exhibit B are reduced to seven (7) employees by attrition, to perform fabrication work and all other Weld Shop duties (unless they are performing a “field” installation). All other welders associated with the fabrication shop may be assigned to work inn the “field” or in the fabrication shop, as determined solely by management.
FOURTH. The names of all current incumbents of the Weld Shop are set forth on Exhibit C attached to this Agreement. The Company agrees that these employees, with the exception of ten (10) job eliminations associat
392
APPENDIX VIII
ed with the 1996 Universal negotiations, shall be permanently reduced from the Weld Shop by attrition (retirement, quit, discharge, death, permanent transfer out of the department, loss of recall rights, etc.) to the number of employees determined by the Company to be necessary to perform Weld Shop work in an efficient and competitive manner. In this regard, the parties agree that repair and fabrication work which is being outsourced will be closely examined by the Insourcing Committee for the purpose of determining whether such work can be timely, efficiently, and competitively performed by Weld Shop employees. This agreement shall not be construed to prohibit a reduction in force at the Weld Shop due to business conditions or other reasons not caused by the efficiencies set forth in Paragraph FIRST of this Agreement. In addition, this Agreement shall not be construed as a full crew agreement.
FIFTH. In consideration of the promises and benefits provided in SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH above, the Union agrees that it shall not file, cause to be filed, aid, encourage, support, or condone any grievance which contests the outsourcing of repair and fabrication work under any provision of the basic labor agreement except as such may be allowable under the terms of the parties’ 1996 agreement on the Insourcing Committee or the terms and conditions contained in this
393
APPENDIX V1H
Memorandum.
SIXTH. This Agreement constitutes the final written expression of the parties’ agreement, and any statement, oral or written, that differ from the terms of this Agreement shall have no effect.

398
APPENDIX VIU
Mark Glyptis, President Independent Steelworkers Union 2971 West Street
Weirton, West Virginia 26062
Dear Mr. Glyptis:
This letter confirms our understanding that the Company and Union reached agreement on various matters during the 1996 negotiations which are reflected below:
A.	The Company agrees to enter into negotiations with Blue Cross/Blue Shield with the goal of establishing standards for the following: (a) claims accuracy percentage, (b) member satisfaction, (c) incurred claim costs, (d) medical management, and (e) member education.
B.	The current POS in-network deductible only ($150 individual/$300 family) will be reduced to $0, effective January 1, 1998.
C.	Cardiac rehabilitation provided in a hospital setting will be covered under the POS plan subject to any applicable deductible, effective upon the later of the date of ratification or June 1, 1997,
399
APPENDIX VIII
D.	Psychiatric Care will be revised to pay 100% for up to 40 annual outpatient visits (in-network) and $25 per outpatient visit up to 20 annual visits (out-ofnetwork) after payment of the applicable deductibles, effective upon the later of the date of ratification or June 1, 1997. The Company will apply these coverage limits to any referrals from the EAP.
E.	A POS plan participant can go to the OB/GYN without a PCP referral for OB/GYN services only, effective upon the later of the date of ratification or June I, 1997. The $15 co-payment for an annual OB/GYN physical is unchanged. With respect to treatment by a network OB/GYN for OB/GYN services without a PCP referral, a $10 co-payment will be payable for each initial diagnostic evaluation. Until January I, 1998, this co-payment will be in addition to the applicable deductible. Followup visits for the same diagnosis will not require an additional co-payment. DRG codes will be used to make co-payment determinations. Referrals to specialists must still be made by the PCP.
F.	The December 16, 1993 letter on POS Plan Maximum Benefit will be continued for the life of
400
APPENDIX VIII
the 1996 Agreement.
G The chiropractic co-pay will be increased from $12 to $20, effective upon the later of the date of ratification or June 1, 1997.
H.	The co-pay for prescriptions written by non-net-work PCP’s will be increased to 40% in addition to the standard co-pay, effective upon the later of the date of ratification or June 1, 1997.
I.	The total and permanent disability payout provision under the active employee life insurance program will be eliminated for applications made on or subsequent to the date of ratification.
J.	Loan provisions will be added to the 40IK Plan, subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors. All costs associated with a loan will be the responsibility of the employee-applicant. The 40IK Administrative Committee is authorized to determine the Plan’s loan features.
K.	The 401K Plan will be amended to provide for optional monthly distributions at retirement, subject to approval by the Company’s Board of Directors and subject to working out the details
401
APPENDIX VIII
with the vendor.
L.	Participants in the 401K Plan will be permitted to request up to twelve (12) transfers per Plan year.
M.	When an Over 65 Risk contract (Medicare HMO) product becomes available, the Company and Union agree to refer the issue to the Joint Health Care Committee for review and a recommendation on implementation. Nothing herein prohibits the Company from offering the product to retirees on an optional basis.
N.	Employee benefit plans which provide ;for subrogation will be revised to reflect the parties agreement concerning “incurred fees and expenses” and “less than full recovery” as set forth in the 1996 Settlement Agreement.
O.	An in-house, full service optical program will be implemented allowing employees an option to choose the current level of vision care plan benefits versus 100% coverage for exams, frames and lenses from the in-house service. Employees choosing the in-house service will have no out-of-pocket expense. However, restrictions on frequency of service will follow current guidelines. The
402
APPENDIX VIII
Company will provide an opportunity for local vendors to respond to the RFP.
P.	All advances of pay and early pays to employees will be discontinued, effective January 1, 1998,
Very truly yours,
David L. Robertson

A formal job description will be prepared to reflect these duties. The Benefits Coordinator and Educator shall not be authorized to interact with the Company’s provider vendors except with consent of the Company’s Director of Benefits and the President of the Independent Steelworkers Union.
8.	MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON JOINT HEALTH CARE COMMITTEE
This Memorandum of Understanding is intended to provide for the formal establishment of a Joint Health Care Committee composed of designated representatives of the Weirton Steel Corporation and the Independent Steelworkers Union.
WHEREAS, the parties have a long history of mutual review and cooperation in resolving issues of health
405
APPENDIX VIII
care and the administration of the various employee benefit plans pertaining to such:
WHEREAS, the parties recognize that the health care system is in a state of continuous change with potentially profound effect on the recipients of health care:
NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree to the following:
1.	There shall be established a Joint Health Care Committee to be composed of six representatives designated by the Independent Steelworkers Union (three of whom shall be the Union’s President, Benefits Coordinator and Educator, and Legal Counsel) and six representatives designated by the Weirton Steel Corporation, The Committee shall be chaired by Company’s Director of Employee Benefits.
2.	The Committee shall meet quarterly, or more frequently where the parties mutually desire,
3.	The Committee shall study and make recommendations concerning health care administration.
4.	The Committee shall consider, on a case by case
406
APPENDIX VIII
basis, any concerns relative to operation of the Employee Assistance Program, provided that the employee involved desires the committee to undertake a review of his or her circumstances. The Committee shall also be empowered to consider questions of a general nature relating to the role and function of the Employee Assistance Program.
5.	The parties agree to continue the commitment previously made that EAP counselors will not be used as witnesses in arbitration cases, except to explain the general operation of the EAP.
9.	JOB ELIMINATIONS
The Company shall have the right to eliminate 165 jobs requiring mutual agreement, inclusive of those job eliminations contemplated by the Universal demands. Job eliminations which occur in the Weld Shop and Machine Shop as a result of attrition will not be credited towards the 165 mutual job eliminations. No credit will be given towards the 165 mutual job eliminations in the event that the Short Line RR is successfully created. In the event that a Short Line is not created, the Union agrees to the elimination of 28 railroad related jobs and such number will be credited towards the 165 mutual job eliminations. In the event that a job requir
407
APPENDIX VIII
ing mutual agreement for elimination becomes vacant due to attrition, and 165 mutual job eliminations have already occurred, unless the Union agrees to eliminate the job, the Company will post the vacancy for bid. If the bid is not filled, the Company may, in its discretion, declare the job permanently eliminated.
The 165 mutual job eliminations contemplated in this Appendix VII1-9 of the parties* 1996 Agreement are deemed to have occurred. Any and all contentions as to outstanding but unsatisfied obligations of the Company or the Union related to the mutual job elimination provision of the 1996 Agreement are hereby agreed to be withdrawn and resolved. In the future, when a job becomes vacant due to attrition, including death, retirement, quit, bid to another job, etc., the Company may determine whether to fill the job or eliminate the job subject to the terms of the Job Security Agreement.
10.	EARLY RETIREMENT WINDOW
A.	P&M **70/80” Early Retirement Window
1.	The Retirement Plan will be amended to provide an early retirement window benefit for P&M employees. The amendment will not be applicable to SNE employees. The proposed retirement win
408
APPENDIX VIII
dow, as described herein, is subject to satisfying ERISA requirements as to a retirement window, including both the IRC and labor regulations applicable to retirement windows. In the event the retirement window, as contemplated by this agreement, would not conform to ERISA requirements, the parties agree to renegotiate understandings as to both a retirement window and the $7,500 retirement bonus.
2.	Age and service criteria for eligibility for the retirement window will be the same as the “70/80” retirement. The amount of the retirement window monthly benefit will be calculated the same as the “70/80” retirement benefit.
3.	The availability to elect the early retirement window benefit will be limited to sixty (60) calendar days from the date of ratification of the CB A. P&M employees electing to retire under the early window retirement benefit provision must file a window application for such retirement by the end of the window period. Retirements under the early retirement window provision will occur separately in groups of employees each from the Operating and Maintenance areas, the priority of employees to be included in such group being determined by
409
APPENDIX VIII

4.	The number of window retirements shall not exceed 350, with a minimum of 150 window retirements allocated to Operations and a minimum of 150 allocated to Maintenance. The remaining 50 window retirements may come from either Operations or Maintenance. In the event the number of applications for the window retirements exceed such limits, the applications will be granted on the basis of the longer Company service up to the 150 limit.
5.	Retirement offers made pursuant to Article XXIH which are accepted during the 60 day window period will count towards and reduce the maximum number of available window retirements.
B.	Retirement Bonus
1.	A $7,500 lump sum retirement bonus will be paid to P&M retirees who:
410
APPENDIX VIII
a.	retire pursuant to the early retirement window; or

RE: Short Line Railroad Dear Mr. Glyptis:
This is to confirm the parties’ agreement to continue their joint exploration of the establishment of a Short Line Railroad which would maintain responsive and high quality service, preserving the jobs, wages, benefits and seniority rights of its transportation division employees and, eliminate the need for further transportation-related capital expenditures by Weirton Steel. This agreement is necessitated by the parties recogni
412
APPENDIX VIII
tion that the Short Line Railroad project will not be completed prior to the close of the parties’ negotiations for a successor agreement to the 1993 basic labor agreement.
The Company agrees that it will delay any job eliminations or combinations proposed for Weirton Steel railroad related jobs for such time as it necessary to complete the exploration of the Short Line Railroad concept. In the event that the Short Line Railroad is successfully established, the Union agrees that no credit shall be given towards the mutual job elimination number agreed to during the negotiations for a successor basic labor agreement. The Union further agrees that in the event the Short Line Railroad is not established, it agrees to the elimination of 28 railroad related jobs. Such eliminations shall be credited towards the mutual job elimination number.

12.	MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT
CENTRAL MACHINE SHOP
This Agreement, effective the 30th day of May, 1997, is between the Weirton Steel Corporation (hereinafter the “Company”) and the Independent Steelworkers Union (hereafter the “Union”).
WHEREAS, the Company and the Union desire to maximize the efficiency and productivity of the Central Machine Shop (hereinafter the “CMS”) by allowing the CMS to be managed as if it were a “green field site”;
WHEREAS, the Company and the Union desire to minimize the impact of the transition to a “green field site” on CMS employees by providing for a gradual reduction of personnel assigned to the CMS by attrition;
NOW THEREFORE, the Company and the Union agree as follows:
FIRST. In order to allow for the full implementation of the parties’ intention, the Company and Union agree that all current CMS Memorandum of Understanding, verbal agreements, past practices, perceived past practices, customs, work assignments, scheduling overtime practices, preference assignments and/or overtime dis
414
APPENDIX VIII
tribution procedures shall be considered null and void upon the effective date of this Agreement except as to any such memorandums, agreements, practices, customs, or procedures which the Company, in its sole discretion, specifically declares will remain in effect.
There shall be no restrictions in assignment, restrictive work rules or practices upon the effective date of this agreement unless and until such are thereafter agreed to by the Parties, reduced to writing, and signed by the Area Manager - Operation Services, the Director of Industrial Relations, the Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Corporate Law, the Union’s Steel Works 2 Division Officers, and the CMS Union Steward. However, turn preferences shall be maintained. The Company will attempt to respect existing job preferences except where management determines that such will detract from the performance of CMS work in an efficient and competitive manner.
SECOND. The Parties agree that the hourly occupation of “Router” (Master Inspector Planner-Rate Control No. 10-150-124) will be eliminated. The Parties further agree that the elimination of the Router occupation will not incur any liability for a 70/80 Early Retirement Opportunity in accordance with Article XXIII of the 1993 Labor Agreement or any successor agreement
415
APPENDIX VIII
thereto.
THIRD. The Parties agree that any job functions previously performed by the Router shall, as solely determined by management, be performed by management and/or hourly maintenance planners.
FOURTH. The Parties agree that all hourly bargaining unit jobs and sequences in CMS will be combined for purposes of assignment.
FIFTH. The names of all current incumbents of the CMS are set forth on Exhibit A attached to this Agreement. The Company agrees that these employees shall be permanently reduced from CMS by attrition (retirement, quit, discharge, death, permanent transfer out of the department, loss of recall rights, etc.) to the number of employees determined by the Company to be necessary to perform CMS work in an efficient and competitive manner. In this regard, the parties agree that machining which is being outsourced will be closely examined by the Insourcing Committee for the purpose of determining whether such work can be timely, efficiently, and competitively performed by CMS. This agreement shall not be construed to prohibit a reduction in force at the CMS due to business conditions or other
416
APPENDIX VIII
reasons not caused by the efficiencies set forth in Paragraph FIRST of this Agreement. In addition, this Agreement shall not be construed as a full crew agreement.
Incumbents of the CMS may be assigned to work outside of the CMS in accordance with the flexibility and efficiencies contemplated by Universal Demands I and II of the parties 1996 basic labor negotiations. CMS employees who are reduced due to business conditions or other reasons not caused by the efficiencies set forth in Paragraph FIRST of this Agreement may be assigned, as determined by management, to work as craft support personnel.
SIXTH. In consideration of the promises and benefits provided in FIFTH above, the Union agrees that it shall not file, cause to be filed, aid, encourage, support, or condone any grievance which contests the outsourcing of machining work under any provision of the basic labor agreement except as such may be allowable under the terms of the parties’ 1996 Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Joint Review of Outsourcing or the terms and conditions contained in this Memorandum.
SEVENTH. This Agreement constitutes the final writ
417

Weirton, WV 26062
RE:	Effective Date of Labor Settlement
Dear Mr. Glyptis:
This is to confirm the parties discussions and agreement concerning the proposed effective date of the parties tentative labor settlement.
As we have discussed, there are a number of compo
450
APPENDIX X
nents that must fall in line in order to accomplish the Company’s restructuring objective. One of the required components is the initial closing of a new senior secured revolving credit facility as described in the attached summary of the September 2001 Fleet - Foothill Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. The initial closing is specifically conditioned, in part, upon the existence of satisfactory labor and vendor agreements. Accordingly, it is understood and agreed that the tentative labor settlement will not be effective until the initial closing on the new credit facility described above.
Very truly yours,
John H. Walker

CONFIRMATION
Mark Glyptis, President
2.	UNDERSTANDING ON WAGE EARNER SAVINGS X-1.2
The Union agrees to provide represented wage earner savings of $25.7 million. The savings will be achieved in the following manner:
451
APPENDIX X
1.	The parties have identified internal cost savings unrelated to employment costs in the estimated amount of $10 million. These savings will be used to reduce the wage earner savings objective described above and must be realized within six (6) months of the closing of the Company's new credit facility.
2.	The Union agrees to obtain the balance of the necessary savings through:
a.	A reduction in employment of a minimum of 372 by attrition and targeted early retirement opportunities by March 31, 2002. The Union will receive credit for the number of employees who are reduced through attrition or 70/80 Early Retirement Opportunities during the period beginning May 31, 2001 through March 31, 2002. However, the number of 70/80 early retirement opportunities that will be available as a result of the job reductions agreed to in this restructuring agreement will be limited in number as follows: the number of 70/80 early retirement opportunities will be the lesser of 372 (or a higher number if the minimum number of reductions is exceeded) or a number that does not reduce the hourly
452
APPENDIX X
workforce below the "new job security number.” The ’’new job security number” is the number of employees who would have been entitled to the protections of the Job Security Agreement as of May 31, 2001 minus 372 (or a higher number if the minimum number of reductions is exceeded).
b.	The parties recognize and agree that the wage earner savings objective will not be achieved if the Company is required to replace employees who leave by attrition and early retirement. Consequently, the Union agrees to work rule changes in areas targeted for reduction that permit the ongoing operation of the Company at full levels of operations without necessitating the hiring of additional employees or any increase in outsourcing of bargaining unit work. The work rule changes, to be implemented in whole or in part as determined necessary to effectuate the reductions, are as follow:
Operator maintainer. Any individual or group of individuals associated with their operating unit may do repair and maintenance work necessary for the continued operation of the unit to the fullest, safe extent of their skill, training, experience, and capability.
453
APPENDIX X
•	This includes elimination of barriers on the use of former maintenance personnel to permit performance of repair and maintenance work to fullest, safe extent of skill, training, experience, and capability.
•	The parties agree to expand the current exclusive assist and Basic maintenance list.
Craft emnloyees performing non-craft work,
•	The parties agree to expand the current maintenance assist operations list.
•	Turn maintenance personnel may assist/work with any individual(s) associated with any operating unit as required. This may include filling unknown temporary vacancies that occur after the start of a turn, provided that the same does not result in backfilling of maintenance vacancies.
Self Directed Work Teams
•	The Team Leader will be compensated at 15% above the highest classification which the Team Leader directs. In the the event that more than one employee is affected, this compensation shall be allocated accordingly.
This list shall not preclude the parties from
454
APPENDIX X
agreeing to additional work rule changes necessary to effectuate the reductions. The Union may make such agreements without returning to the membership for additional ratification(s).
c. The parties will meet and attempt to reach agreement on necessary work rule changes with the objective of identifying 300 of the 372 job reductions described in 3.b.i. above by November 20, 2001 and the remaining 72 job reductions by December 20, 2001. In the event that the parties do not reach agreement in whole or in part to the necessary work rule changes and reductions, the Company shall have the right to unilaterally implement work rule changes necessary for the required job reductions that are not necessarily the same but that are consistent with the nature of the changes implemented or to be implemented in the other areas. Any unilateral implementation(s) will occur in the least restrictive manner necessary and in equitable proportions from affected departments recognizing those that have already occurred.
3.	The parties recognize that reasonable compensation adjustments will be in order for employees who
455
APPENDIX X
assume additional job responsibilities as a result of the restructuring contemplated by the reduction in employment with necessary, associated work rule changes. The total compensation that will be available for such adjustments, exclusive of the creep factor (hereinafter "the compensation pool") will be equal to 15% of the job elimination savings (using $50,000 as the base), or the actual cost savings realized from the elimination of the affected job, whichever is greater. The compensation pool will be distributed as determined by the Union.
4.	The parties agree to continue the present contractual 70/80 Early Retirement process but will meet and attempt to streamline the administration of such to expedite the job reductions contemplated by this restructuring.
5.	The parties agree to continue to identify internal cost savings. To the extent that additional savings are identified, such may be used to offset any shortfall that is not realized in the $10 million identified and referred to above.
6.	The parties agree to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a supplemental workforce concept at Weirton Steel Corporation. Any employees hired as
456
APPENDIX X
a result of the implementation of a supplemental workforce concept will not be considered to be replacements for the job reductions that occur in this restructuring agreement.
3.	UNDERSTANDING ON PENSION MULTIPLIER
X-L3
The following is a summary description of amendments to the Weirton Steel Corporation Retirement Plan. The amendment language that has been approved by the Weirton Steel Corporation Board of Directors is controlling.
The parties agree that the 5% multiplier in the ’’Percent Pension” and "Social Security Offset Pension" formulas will be increased to 15% as described below.
The increased pension multiplier described above will be applicable to retirements which occur on or after March 31, 2001. The increased pension multiplier will expire March 31, 2004. The 5% multiplier will be applicable to the "Percent Pension" and "Social Security Offset Pension" for retirements occurring after March 31, 2004. If this provision violates applicable qualification rules, it will be
457
APPENDIX X
amended in a manner necessary to preserve the benefit provided herein and the qualification of the Plan.
4.	UNDERSTANDING ON 50% SURVIVOR ANNUITY OPTION AND PRSA
X-1.4 The following is a summary description of amendments to the Weirton Steel Corporation Retirement Plan. The amendment language that has been approved by the Weirton Steel Corporation Board of Directors is controlling.
The Company agrees that in cases where a spouse dies prior to a retiree, the retiree's pension will be recalculated to equal the amount the retiree would have received had the retiree not elected the 50% Survivor Annuity Option and/or PRSA coverage, where applicable. Any such pop-up in the retiree's pension will be effective beginning in the month following the spouse's death. This agreement will only be effective for retirements occurring on or after March 31,2001.
5.	UNDERSTANDING ON MULTICRAFT TRAINING
X-1.5
The Company agrees that any journeyman who has
458
APPENDIX X
not been afforded the opportunity to attend multicraft school or obtain sufficient training to progress to the multicraft level which they are required to attain will receive such training within a one year period commencing on March 31, 2002. If such training is not provided within the one year period specified above, the affected individual will then be paid the multicraft rate he would have achieved effective April 1, 2003. Apprentices who achieve top rate status after March 31, 2002 will receive such "training or pay" within a one year period commencing on the date they achieve top rate status.
6.	UNDERSTANDING ON MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS
X-L6
1.	The parties agree to establish a committee to examine alternative training systems to the current apprenticeship system.
2.	The Company agrees to amend the current Joint Apprenticeship Program so that apprentices who progress every 520 hours will receive the extra job class without first being required to finish their classroom instruction.
459
APPENDIX X
3.	The parties agree to work cooperatively in an effort to reduce contracting out.
7.	UNDERSTANDING ON CONTRACTOR DUES REPLACEMENT
X-1.7
Subject to the conditions set forth below, the Company will agree to require outside contractors who have craft employees performing the same craft functions and duties in the plant that WSC craft employees are qualified to perform to pay $16 per month to the Union for each contractor employee who works in the plant in that month. The total amount of dues replacement is subject to a limit of no more than $100,000 per year. The Company's agreement is conditioned on all of the following:
a.	That the Union provide the Company with copies of similar dues replacement protections found in current collective bargaining agreements elsewhere, and
b.	That the Union provide the Company with controlling legal precedent holding that such provisions are lawful and enforceable in a manufacturing workplace such as that as
460
APPENDIX X
exists at Weirton Steel or, in the absence of such controlling precedent, that the parties obtain an opinion letter(s) from alt relevant government enforcement agencies that indicates such an arrangement would be specifically lawful at Weirton Steel.
8.	UNDERSTANDING ON WAGE EARNER SAVINGS OBJECTIVE
X-1.8

Mark Glyptis, President
Independent Steelworkers Union
2971 West Street
Weirton, WV 26062
RE:	Wage Earner Savings Objective
Dear Mr. Glyptis:
This is to confirm the parties discussions and agreement concerning necessary measures to ensure that the job elimination cost savings of $15.7 million promised from the hourly represented workforce under the terms of the proposed successor labor agreement will be realized.
46 i
APPENDIX X
The parties recognize that the previous method of calculating savings associated with job eliminations for the purpose of adjusting the compensation of employees who assume additional job responsibilities (hereinafter the ’’old savings formula”) will reduce the job elimination cost savings below the $15.7 million hourly wage earner objective when the ’’old savings formula” is applied to the 15% adjustment provided for job eliminations identified in the proposed successor labor agreement. Accordingly, the Union agrees that additional savings necessary to achieve the $15.7 million objective as a result of the use of the "old savings formula" will be achieved by job eliminations beyond the minimum number identified in the proposed successor labor agreement and/or by other mutually agreed to cost savings measures provided such exceed the $10 million in savings unrelated to employment costs that were identified in the proposed successor agreement.

John H. Walker
