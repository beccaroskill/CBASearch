As used hereinafter in this Agreement, the term ’’Chapter" shall mean the Kansas City Division, Kansas City Chapter, National Electrical Contractors Association, Inc., and the term "Union” shall mean Local Union No. 124, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
The term "Employer" shall mean an individual firm who has been recognized by an Assent to this Agreement.
BASIC PRINCIPLES
The Employer and the Union have a common and sympathetic interest in the Electrical Industry. Therefore, a working system and harmonious relations are necessary to improve the relationship between the Employer, the Union and the Public. Progress in industry demands a mutuality of confidence between the Employer and the Union. All will benefit by continuous peace and by adjusting any differences by rational, common sense methods. Now, therefore, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
ARTICLE I
TERM OF AGREEMENT
SECTION 1.01	Effective Date: This Agreement shall take effect September 1, 2003, and shall remain in effect until August 28, 2005 unless otherwise specifically provided for herein.

The Council's decisions shall be final and binding.
SECTION 1.02	(e) Negotiation Committee's Responsibilities Toward Unresolved Issues: When a case has been submitted to the Council, it shall be the responsibility of the negotiating committee to continue to meet weekly in an effort to reach a settlement on the local level prior to the meeting of the Council.

SECTION 1.08	Arbitration by CIR: Should the Labor Management Committee fail to agree or to adjust any matter, such shall then be referred to the Council on Industrial Relations for the Electrical Contracting Industry for adjudication. The Council’s decisions shall be final and binding.

SECTION 2.04 Union Recognition: NECA recognizes the Union as the sole and exclusive representative for all Employees covered by this Agreement, including Lead Foremen, Foremen, General Foremen, Field General Foremen and for whom the Union was certified as a collective bargaining agent by the National Labor Relations Board in Case No. 17-RC-1482, which Certification is adopted by reference and made a part of this Agreement as if fully incorporated herein.
SECTION 2.05 Employer Qualifications, Restrictions and Rights: It is agreed by the parties that the Electrical Contractor occupies a position of great trust and responsibility in the industry and it is, therefore, necessary that an Employer desiring to be a party to this Agreement must sign the Letter of Assent described in the preamble of this Agreement, and have certain qualifications, knowledge, experience and financial responsibility as follows:
a)	The Employer shall maintain a permanent place of business, open to the public during normal business hours.
b)	The Employer shall comply with all the Laws of the States, Counties and Communities in which he operates.

e)	The Union understands the Employer is responsible to perform the work required by the owner. The Employer shall therefore have no restrictions except those specifically provided for in the collective bargaining Agreement in planning, directing and controlling the operation of all his work, in deciding the number and kind of Employees to properly perform the work, in hiring and laying off Employees, in transferring Employees from job to job within the Local Union's geographical jurisdiction, in determining the need and number as well as the person who will act as Foreman, in requiring all Employees to observe the Employer's and/or owner's rules and regulations not inconsistent with this Agreement, in requiring all Employees to observe all safety regulations and in discharging Employees for proper cause.

Proof of the execution of the Bond in the form of an affidavit executed by the Insurance Carrier shall be furnished the Business Manager and/or the Trust Fund Administrator by each Employer.

It is further agreed that the Insurance Carrier may, if it so elects, cancel a Bond by giving thirty (30) days' notice, in writing, to the Business Manager and/or the Trust Fund Administrator, and the Bond shall be deemed canceled at the expiration of said thirty (30) days; provided, however, that such cancellation shall not relieve the Insurance Carrier of any liability which shall have accrued prior to the effective date of the cancellation.
SECTION 2.06(d) Escrow Account/Standby Irrevocable Letter of Credit in Lieu of Bond: If an Employer, is unable to obtain an adequate Bond, the Employer must establish a cash escrow bank account (escrow) or standby irrevocable letter of credit (credit) in a minimum amount equal to six times the weekly benefit including union dues and NEBF per employee. The Escrow account or credit shall provide that upon proof of a delinquency to the escrow or credit agent by the Trust Fund Administrator, the escrow or credit agent shall pay to the Trust Fund Administrator sufficient funds to pay the delinquent contributions, including any other amounts provided for in this Agreement
6
or by law. Any dispute in this regard shall be expeditiously resolved by the Labor Management Committee, which resolution shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Trust Fund Administrator and the escrow or credit agent. The Employer must maintain the applicable amount in an escrow account or letter of credit at all times. The cash so placed in escrow or credit, less any amount due any of the aforementioned Funds, shall be returned to the Employer in the event he ceases to operate under this Agreement, or in the event he obtains a Surety Bond as required in Section 2.06(a).
SECTION 2.06(e) Weekly Fringe Payment Required if Delinquent: In the event an Employer is delinquent two (2) times in one twelve-month period, or for justifiable cause as determined by the Labor Management Committee, or is unable to increase his bond as required in Section 2.06(a), the Employer shall be required to make weekly fringe benefit payments for each Employee, in an amount established by the Labor Management Committee.
SECTION 2.06(f) Labor Management Committee to Review for Compliance: All requirements of this Section shall be reviewed for compliance on a semi-annual basis by the Labor Management Committee.

The parties hereby agree if an employer is declared delinquent by the Labor Management Committee, or the Executive Committee of the Labor Management Committee, then the provisions of Article II, Section 2.07(b) regarding liquidated damages shall be automatic and the Local Union shall be free to act in accordance with Article II, Section 2.07(f).
SECTION 2.06(g) Labor Management Committee to Approve Rules & Regulations: All rules and regulations adopted by the Fund Trustees to implement this Section 2.06 shall be approved by the Labor Management Committee and upon such approval shall become a part of this Agreement and binding on the Union and the Employers.

SECTION 2.13(a) Annulment Sub-contracting Clause: The Local Union is a part of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and any violation or annulment by an individual Employer of the approved Agreement of this or any other Local Union of the IBEW, other than violations of Section 2.13(b), will be sufficient cause for the cancellation of his Agreement by the Local Union, after a finding has been
9
made by the International President of the Union that such a violation or annulment has occurred.
SECTION 2.13(b) Subletting, Assigning or Transfer of Work: The subletting, assigning or transfer by an individual Employer of any work in connection with electrical work to any person, firm or corporation not recognizing the IBEW or one of its Local Unions as the collective bargaining representative of his Employees on any electrical work in the jurisdiction of this or any other Local Union to be performed at the site of the construction, alteration, painting or repair of a building, structure or other work, will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.

The Joint Labor Management Committee is empowered to enter into an agreement that provides a system of compensation benefits and/or insurance in lieu of the compensation and insurance provided under state law. It is understood and agreed that any program of compensation benefits and/or insurance shall be at least as equivalent as the benefits provided under state law.
SECTION 2.16	Equitable Distribution of Work: During periods when unemployment reaches three hundred (300) or more Journeymen who normally work under the terms of this Agreement, the Labor Management Committee shall meet and endeavor to effect a plan for equitable distribution of the work.

10
If, after thirty days, an Employer or person fails to comply with such Decision, the local union and/or the local NECA Chapter may take necessary legal action to obtain the required compliance. All costs involved with taking such action shall ultimately be the responsibility of the non-complying Employer or person.

The parties recognize the Employer's right to adopt and implement a drug and alcohol policy subject to all applicable laws and regulations, procedural safeguards, scientific principles, and legitimate interest of privacy and confidentiality. However, the Union reserves the right to negotiate regarding the terms of the Employer's policy before the policy is implemented by the Employer. When drug and alcohol testing is performed, all testing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures outlined in the aforementioned policy.
SECTION 2.21 Portability Clause: An Employer signatory to a collective bargaining agreement or to a Letter of Assent to an agreement with another IBEW Local Union, who signs an assent to this Agreement, may bring up to four (4) bargaining unit employees employed in that Local Union’s jurisdiction into this Local’s jurisdiction and up to two (2) bargaining unit employees per job from that Local’s jurisdiction to this Local's jurisdiction for specialty or service and maintenance work. All charges of violations of this section shall be considered as a dispute and shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement for the handling of grievances with the exception that any decision of a local Labor Management Committee that may be contrary to the intent of the parties to the National Agreement on Employee Portability, upon recommendation of either or both the appropriate IBEW International Vice President or NECA Regional Executive Director, is subject to review, modification or rescission by the Council on Industrial Relations.
SECTION 2.22 Industry Education: In recognition that the Employer and the Union have a common and sympathetic interest in continuing to improve the quality of those employed in the Electrical Industry, there shall be a commitment to maintaining the high quality of skill and ability upon which the industry has been built.

SECTION 3.01 Supervisory Personnel: Lead Foremen, Foremen, General Foremen and Field General Foremen shall be selected by and at the discretion of the Employer. As duly appointed agents of the Employer, Lead Foremen, Foremen, General Foremen and Field General Foremen shall not be subject to direction by the Union in the performance of their duties.

APPRENTICESHIP AND TRAINING
SECTION 4.01 There shall be a local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (JATC) consisting of a total of six 6 members who shall also serve as trustees to the local apprenticeship and training trust. An equal number of members shall be appointed, in writing, by the local chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) and the local union of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).
The local apprenticeship standards shall be in conformance with national guideline standards and industry policies to ensure that each apprentice has satisfactorily completed the NJATC required hours and course of study. All apprenticeship standards shall be registered with the NJATC before being submitted to the appropriate registration agency.
The JATC shall be responsible for the training of apprentices, journeymen, installers, technicians and all others (unindentured, intermediate journeymen, etc.).
SECTION 4.02 All JATC member appointments, reappointments and acceptance of appointments shall be in writing. Each member shall be appointed for a 3-year term, unless being appointed for a lesser period of time to complete an unexpired term. The terms shall be staggered, with one (1) term from each side expiring each year. JATC members shall complete their appointed term unless removed for cause by the party they represent or they voluntarily resign. All vacancies shall be filled immediately.
The JATC shall select from its membership, but not both from the same party, a
13
Chairman and a Secretary who shall retain voting privileges. The JATC will maintain one (1) set of minutes for JATC committee meetings and a separate set of minutes for trust meetings.
The JATC should meet on a monthly basis, and also upon the call of the Chairman.
SECTION 4.03 Any issue concerning an apprentice or an apprenticeship matter shall be referred to the JATC for its review, evaluation and resolve, as per standards and policies. If the JATC deadlocks on any issue, the matter shall be referred to the Labor Management Committee for resolution as outlined in Article I of this Agreement; except for trust fund matters, which shall be resolved as stipulated in the local trust instrument.
SECTION 4.04 There shall be only one (1) JATC and one (1) local Apprenticeship and Training Trust. The JATC may, however, establish joint subcommittees to meet specific needs, such as residential or telecommunication apprenticeship. The JATC may also* establish a subcommittee to oversee an apprenticeship program within a specified area of the jurisdiction covered by this Agreement.
All subcommittee members shall be appointed, in writing, by the party they represent. A subcommittee member may or may not be a member of the JATC.
SECTION 4.05 The JATC may select and employ a part-time or a full-time Training Director and other support staff, as it deems necessary. In considering the qualifications, duties and responsibilities of the Training Director, the JATC should review the Training Director’s Job Description provided by the NJATC. All employees of the JATC shall serve at the pleasure and discretion of the JATC.
SECTION 4.06 To help ensure diversity of training, provide reasonable continuous employment opportunities and comply with apprenticeship rules and regulations, the JATC, as the program sponsor, shall have full authority for issuing all job training assignments and for transferring apprentices from one employer to another. The employer shall cooperate in providing apprentices with needed work experiences. The local union referral office shall be notified, in writing, of all job-training assignments. If the employer is unable to provide reasonable continuous employment for apprentices, the JATC is to be so notified.
SECTION 4.07 All apprentices shall enter the program through the JATC as provided for in the registered apprenticeship standards and selection procedures.
An apprentice may have their indenture canceled by the JATC at any time prior to completion as stipulated in the registered standards. Time worked and accumulated in apprenticeship shall not be considered for local union referral purposes until the apprentice has satisfied all conditions of apprenticeship. Individuals terminated from
14
apprenticeship shall not be assigned to any job in any classification, or participate in any related training, unless they are reinstated in apprenticeship as per the standards, or they qualify through means other than apprenticeship, at sometime in the future, but no sooner than two (2) years after their class has completed apprenticeship, and they have gained related knowledge and job skills to warrant such classification.
SECTION 4.08 The JATC shall select and indenture a sufficient number of apprentices to meet local manpower needs. The JATC is authorized to indenture the number of apprentices necessary to meet the job site ratio as per Section 4.12.
SECTION 4.09 Though the JATC cannot guarantee any number of apprentices; if a qualified employer requests an apprentice, the JATC shall make every effort to honor the request. If unable to fill the request within ten (10) working days, the JATC shall select and indenture the next available person from the active list of qualified applicants. An active list of qualified applicants shall be maintained by the JATC as per the selection procedures.
SECTION 4.10 To accommodate short-term needs when apprentices are unavailable, the JATC shall assign unindentured workers who meet the basic qualifications for apprenticeship. Unindentured workers shall not remain employed if apprentices become available for OJT assignment. Unindentured workers shall be used to meet job site ratios except on wage-and-hour (prevailing wage) job sites.
Before being employed, the unindentured person must sign a letter of understanding with the JATC and the employer, agreeing that they are not to accumulate more than two thousand (2,000) hours as an unindentured, that they are subject to replacement by indentured apprentices and that they are not to work on wage-and-hour (prevailing wage) job sites.
Should an unindentured worker be selected for apprenticeship, the JATC will determine, as provided for in the apprenticeship standards, if some credit for hours worked as an unindentured, will be applied toward the minimum OJT hours of apprenticeship.
The JATC may elect to offer voluntary related training to unindentured; such as Math Review, English, Safety, Orientation/Awareness, Introduction to OSHA, First-Aid and CPR. Participation shall be voluntary.
SECTION 4.11 The employer shall contribute to the local health and welfare plans and to the National Electrical Benefit Fund (NEBF) on behalf of all apprentices and unindentured. Contributions to other benefit plans may be addressed in other sections of this agreement.
SECTION 4.12 Each job site shall be allowed a ratio of two (2) apprentices for every three (3) Journeyman Wiremen (man). (The local parties will determine the job site ratio, however, the ratio shall not be less than two apprentices for every three
15
journeymen or fraction thereof. Should the parties agree to a ratio higher than the minimum 2 to 3, the following table must be modified to reflect the larger number of allowable apprentices.)
Number of Journeymen
Maximum Number of
Apprentices/Unindentured
1 to 3
4 to 6
etc.
2
4 etc.
The first person assigned to any job site shall be a Journeyman Wireman.
A job site is considered to be the physical location where employees report for their work assignments. The employer's shop (service center) is considered to be a separate, single job site. All other physical locations where workers report for work are each considered to be a single, separate job site.
SECTION 4.13 An apprentice is to be under the supervision of a Journeyman Wireman at all times. This does not imply that the apprentice must always be in-sight-of a Journeyman Wireman. Journeymen are not required to constantly watch the apprentice. Supervision will not be of a nature that prevents the development of responsibility and initiative. Work may be laid out by the employer's designated supervisor or journeyman based on their evaluation of the apprentice’s skills and ability to perform the job tasks. Apprentices shall be permitted to perform job tasks in order to develop job skills and trade competencies. Journeymen are permitted to leave the immediate work area without being accompanied by the apprentice.
Apprentices who have satisfactorily completed the first four years of related classroom training using the NJATC curriculum and accumulated a minimum of 6,500 hours of OJT with satisfactory performance, shall be permitted to work alone on any job site and receive work assignments in the same manner as a Journeyman Wireman. An apprentice shall not be the first person assigned to a job site and apprentices shall not supervise the work of others.
SECTION 4.14 Upon satisfactory completion of apprenticeship, the JATC shall issue all graduating apprentices an appropriate diploma from the NJATC. The JATC shall encourage each graduating apprentice to apply for college credit through the NJATC. The JATC may also require each apprentice to acquire any electrical license required for journeymen to work in the jurisdiction covered by this Agreement.
SECTION 4.15 The parties to this Agreement shall be bound by the Local Joint Apprenticeship and Training Trust Fund Agreement which shall conform to Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 as amended, ERISA and other applicable regulations.
16
The Trustees authorized under this Trust Agreement are hereby empowered to determine the reasonable value of any facilities, materials or services furnished by either party. All funds shall be handled and disbursed in accordance with the Trust Agreement.
SECTION 4.16 All Employers subject to the terms of this Agreement shall contribute the amount of funds specified by the parties signatory to the local Apprenticeship and Training Trust Agreement. The current rate of contribution is:
EFFECTIVE 9/1/03	EFFECTIVE 8/30/04
$0.60 per hour for each hour worked	$0.60 per hour for each hour worked
This sum shall be due the Trust Fund by the same date as is their payment to the NEBF under the terms of the Restated Employees Benefit Agreement and Trust.

30
fund contribution amount is based upon 45 hours times the straight time wage rate [((40+3+2) X straight time wage rate)) X vacation fund contribution rate = vacation fund contribution amount].
