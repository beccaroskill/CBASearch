EXHIBIT “D” INTERPRETATIONS EFFECTIVE JUNE 17,1999
National Pipe Line Agreement Interpretations between the Pipe Line Contractors Association and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada.
The Interpretations set out below have been agreed to by the Pipe Line Contractors Association and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada and are made a part of the National Pipe Line Agreement as if set out therein.
I.	Road Boring
When a welder is assigned and working with the road boring crew on any particular day, he will be entitled to the hours of the road boring crew for that day. For example, if the fuD road boring crew continues to work after regular quitting time and the Welder assigned to that crew that day is sent in before quitting time or at quitting time and not allowed to remain with the crew while it continues working after regular quitting time, he will be entitled to any additional hours worked by that crew that day. If the Welder assigned to the road boring crew is temporarily reassigned to perform other work and the full road boring crew continues to work performing regular road boring crew work that day, the Welder will be entitled to the same hours worked provided he returns to that crew or is relieved by the contractor from returning to the road boring crew.
2.	Welding Rigs
The PLCA and the United Association do not negotiate rig rentals; however, there are certain procedures applicable to rigs when performing work under the National Pipe Line Agreement. These are as follows:
(a)	Rig Pay on Single Qualification Test - The Welder’s rig will be entitled to be paid the same number of hours the man is paid on a single qualification test.
(b)	Rig Pay on Multiple Tests - On multiple tests the Welder's rig will be entitled to be paid the same number of hours the man is paid for multiple tests.
(c)	Gassing Up - All trucks and welding machines will be gassed up during regular working hours unless the contractor has negotiated a rental and fuel rate. Welders are entitled to a full tank of gas for their truck and welding machine on the same day they complete work on that job and they are laid off; this does not include the drag-up tank.
Rev. 9/2000
D-201
3.	Dispatching Employees
The contractor will provide the Union with the same advance notice of starting date for the Union's quota to be dispatched as it provides for its contractor-hired employees.
4.	Drug Testing
The Substance Abuse Policy negotiated by the Association (PLCA) and the United Association (UA) will be applicable on all jobs covered by the National Pipe Line Agreement. The Journeyman shall be paid waiting time for any days lost during the normal scheduled work week in those cases which require completed testing before employment. In such cases, the Journeyman shall receive for any day lost during any one work week the sum of five hours plus fringes, and the Helper will receive a sum of four hours plus fringes. No payment or fringe contributions will be made if a test is positive for a prohibited drug.
5.	Reporting time for Welder Helper
The Agreement provides that the Welder Helper shall receive the equivalent of not less than four hours pay at the straight time rate for any hours he misses during the normal scheduled work week unless he is told the night before that there will be no work the following day. These four hours are cumulative.
6.	Job Steward Hours
Under the National Pipe Line Agreement a Journeyman acting as job steward is entitled to be paid for all hours worked by him or for the number of hours up to a maximum of thirteen (13) worked by any UA journeyman on the job except the UA mechanic and except for journeymen or welders working on testing.
It has been agreed by the PLCA and United Association that the maximum of thirteen (13) hours is based on a 10 hour work day, and that if the work day is set up on or extended to 11 hours or more the steward will be entitled to 3 hours above the number of hours the job is set up or extended, provided some other journeymen, except the UA mechanic, journeyman or welder on testing, works those hours. As an example, if the contractor sets the work week at 6-12’s, and a UA journeyman other than the UA mechanic, journeymen or welder on testing works 16 hours the steward would be entitled to 15 hours.

NATIONAL PIPELINE INDUSTRY JOINT
POLICY COMMITTEE
Decision No. 1
HYDROSTATIC TESTING
Because a controversy has arisen throughout the Pipe Line Construction Industry as to the proper manning of hydrostatic testing of pipe lines, the question was referred to the Policy Committee for decision. Having considered the claims and respective interests of all parties involved, the Policy Committee has decided that on all hydrostatic testing of pipe lines throughout the United States:
1.	The installation of temporary lines other than flexible lines will be handled by the U.A.
2.	The installation of flexible lines will be handled by the Operating Engineer.
3.	The operation of pumps, gauges and dead weights will be handled by the Operating Engineer.
4.	The fabrication and installation of manifolds and valves will be done by the U. A.; the attachment of the flexible lines will be done by the Operating Engineer.
5.	Nothing herein is intended to affect in any way the work ordinarily and customarily done by the Laborers and the Teamsters. July 25,1968 (See Decision #5, as amended)
Decision No. 2
OPERATING ENGINEER'S EQUIPMENT
In view of conflicting claims which have arisen in the Pipe Line Construction Industry, the Policy Committee has made the following decision:
The welding, maintenance and repair of any equipment within the jurisdiction of the International Union of Operating Engineers will be done by Operating Engineers. This decision is not intended to interfere with the practical cooperative attitude among all crafts involved.
July 25, 1968
Decision No. 3
PORTABLE YARD DOUBLE JOINTING RACKS
It is recognized that on yard double jointing racks there is certain repair work to be done which belongs to the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada, and that there is certain repair work which belongs to the International Union of Operating Engineers.
It is the decision of the'Pipeline Industry Policy Committee that one mechanic from each Union be employed on each rack, and all repair and maintenance work necessary will be done by these two mechanics unless additional help is needed, in which caseit shall be drawn from the established crew.
July 22,1969
504
Decision No. 4
PORTABLE YARD DOUBLE JOINTING RACKS
In the operation, of a portable yard double jointing rack, welder helpers from the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry of the United States and Canada are required to be employed by the National Pipe Line Agreement between the U.A. and the PLCA in the rolling of the pipe from the grinders through inspection. Therefore, if employees are needed to roll the pipe from the end of the rack up to the grinding station, such employees need not be U.A. welder helpers, and the contractor may assign the work to the members of the Laborers International Union of North America.
Decision No. 5
HYDROSTATIC TESTING
The pipe line contractor may set up a separate testing crew or use employees performing other duties to also do the testing work without setting up a separate crew for that purpose. In some cases the testing work is performed by another contractor, either by subcontract from the pipe line contractor, or by direct contract with the owner. In any event, during the preparation, fill, discharge and dismantling process connected with the pressurization testing of a new or old section of pipe line:
1.	The provisions of Policy Committee Decision No. 1 dated July 25,1968 concerning hydrostatic testing will apply to those situations when the contractor elects not to set up a separate hydrostatic testing crew in connection with the pressurization testing of the pipe line. These provisions are as follows:
A.	The installation of temporary lines other than flexible lines will be handled by the U_A.
B.	The installation of flexible lines will be handled by the Operating Engineer.
C.	The operation of pumps, gauges and dead weights will be handled by the Operating Engineer.
D.	The fabrication and installation of manifolds and valves will be done by the U. A.; the attachment of the flexible lines will be done by the Operating Engineer.
E.	Nothing herein is intended to affect in any way the work ordinarily and customarily done by the Laborers and Teamsters.
2.	When the contractor elects to set up.a separate hydrostatic testing crew for the pressurization testing of the pipe line, the manning requirements will normally consist of one U.A. Journeyman, one Operating Engineer, one Laborer and one Teamster.
A.	In the event more employees are needed, they will be employed for the work required under the terms of the appropriate National Pipe Line Agreement.
505
B.	Once the manning requirements have been determined, all employees may be used as a composite crew, it being recognized that the nature of the work is such that at ,	times it is impossible to adhere strictly to the craft jurisdic-
tional lines.
C.	It is intended that the composite crew will be used during the preparation, fill, discharge and dismantling process connected with the hydrostatic testing of a new or old pipe line.
D.	When the line is under pressure and “on test”orwhen the contractor has night work to be performed in connection with filling or discharging the line, an Operating Engineer will be employed to monitor the test, watch the pumps, and swing and read the dead weight.
E.	When night work is performed as set out in D above, the U. A. Journeyman assigned to the composite crew during the day will receive two additional hours of pay in lieu of being called out to perform any U.A. work which might be necessary during the night time operation. No additional compensation will be paid to Laborers or Teamsters since there is not work performed at night that would be long to these unions.
3.	When welding is performed by Welders assigned to a seperate hydrostatic testing crew set up by the pipe line contractor, premium pay of 50c per hour above the journeyman rate will be paid to the Welders. This requirement for premium pay will not apply when the pipe line contractor has not set up a separate hydrostatic testing crew or when Welders on the pipe line contractor's payroll are merely used by the testing contractor.
4.	All other provisions concerning hiring, waiting time, travel time, reporting time, and moving time will be applicable as set out in the National Pipe Line Agreements.
Dated January 28, 1970, as amended October 26, 1971.
Decision No. 6
LOCAL INDUSTRY ADVANCEMENT FUNDS
In certain areas of the United States, Local Unions have negotiated Industry Advancement Funds with contractors for the purpose of advancing or promoting the Building, Heavy or Highway Construction Industry. Contributions to such funds are not negotiated in lieu of wage increases such as Welfare, Pension, Vacation and the like.
Since the Pipe Line Construction Industry does not benefit from the contributions to such local funds throughout the United States, it is agreed that there is no requirement under any of the National Pipe Line Agreements for signatories to those Agreements to contribute to such funds.
August 13,1970

Decision No. 7
BUFFING ANO GRINDING
In order to clarify the proper jurisdiction between the Laborers’ International Union of North America and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada over work involving the buffing and grinding of pipe, the folowing decision has been reached:
Buffing, grinding, filing, or brushing of the bevel in preparation for welding, or in connection with making or completing the weld, is in the jurisdiction of United Association.
Buffing, grinding, filing or brushing not done in connection with the preparation or completion of the welding process shall be the jurisdiction of the Laborers International Union of North America.
Dated October 21,1970 and amended October 26,1971.
Decision No, 8
DRESSING THE PIG
"Dressing the Pig” means changing the rubber squeegees or brushes or appurtenances which are attached to the body of the “pig”. The “pig” is inserted and travels inside the pipe for the purpose of cleaning or clearing the pipe line of all rust, scale, foreign objects, liquids and solids, and is normally used in connection with the cleaning and testing process.
The contractor will assign the work of “dressing the pig” to whatever employee is readily available at the time, and all four unions agree to abide by the contractor’s assignment
Dated October 26,1971.
Decision No. 9
HOOKING AND UNHOOKING
“The hooking and unhooking of the pipe under the National Pipe Line Agreements is the work of the Laborer.”
Dated January 29,1975.
Decision No. 10
URETHANE FOAM APPUCATOR
“The urethane foam applicator will be manned with a Group 2 Operating Engineer on the bed or platform handling the valves, mixing the contents and servicing the generators when handled from the bed or platform; a Laborer will be on the ground or in the ditch operating the nozzle of the applicator.”
Dated July 6,1978.
Decision No. 11
REMOVAL OF CONCRETE
"The rough removal of concrete from the pipe will be done by Laborers. However, the balance of the preparation of the pipe for making the cut, bevel or the welding process is Ilie jurisdiction of the United Association.” Dated July 6,1978.
