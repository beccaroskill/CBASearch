Jobsite(s):	Cape Girardeau
This agreement shall be binding upon all parties, their successors and assigns. In the event of a sale or transfer of the business of the employer, or any part thereof, the purchaser or transferee shall be bound by this agreement.
SECTION 1.3	Negotiating Committee
The Company agrees to recognize a Negotiating Committee composed of up to three members and one alternate selected by the Union to represent the employees in collective bargaining negotiations.
SECTION 1.4	Steward System
The Company agrees to recognize a steward system.
The Union agrees that the Union representatives and aggrieved employees will work at their regular jobs at all times except when they are relieved by management to attend to the grievance procedure as outlined in this Agreement.
At an employee's request, the Company will call for a Union representative prior to taking any disciplinary action. The supervisor, at the request of the employee, will release the Union
representative as soon as possible. If no Union representative is available, the employee may proceed without a representative or reschedule the discussion.
Aggrieved employees and Union representatives will be paid their regular rate of pay for time spent in grievance-related meetings with management only during scheduled working hours. The aggrieved employee will not be paid for time spent investigating grievances, preparing grievance documents, or for any time spent outside of meeting with management.
"Management," as used in this Agreement, refers to Site Supervisors, Contract Managers and Corporate representatives; Lead and Senior Lead Court Security Officers are not considered management.
SECTION 1.5	Union Security
An employee who is a member of the Union at the time this agreement becomes effective shall continue membership in the Union for the duration of this Agreement, to the extent of tendering the membership dues uniformly required as a condition of retaining membership in the Union.
An Employee who is not a member of this Union at the time that this Agreement becomes effective shall, within ten (10) days after the 30th day following the effective date of this Agreement either:
1.	Become a member of the Union and remain a member.
2.	Pay the Union a service fee. The amount of this service fee shall be equal to that paid by regular Union members to include regular and usual initiation fees. The service fee will not include any assessments, special or otherwise. Such payments shall commence on the 30th day after the date of hire.
2(a) Employees who are members of, and adhere to the established and traditional tenets of a bona-fide religion, body or sect, which has historically held conscientious objections to joining or financially supporting labor organizations shall, instead of the above, be allowed to make payments in amounts equal to the agency fee required above, to a tax exempt organization (under Section 501(c)(3) of the IRS code. The Union shall have the right to charge any employee exercising this option the reasonable cost of using the arbitration procedure of this Agreement on the employee's individual behalf. Further, any employee who exercises this option shall twice a year submit to the Union proof that the charitable contributions have been made.
Before any termination of employment pursuant to the Section becomes effective, the employee involved shall first be given notice in writing by the Union to pay the prescribed initiation fee and/or delinquent dues. If the employee fails to pay the initiation fee and/or 2
delinquent dues, and if such fee and/or dues are tendered within 48 hours after the employee receives this notification from the Company, his/her dismissal under here shall not be required. If termination is administered under this provision, the reasons will be given in writing. Termination will not occur if there is an ongoing dispute between the effected employee and the Union.
The obligations set forth in this Article shall only be effective to the extent permitted by controlling law, including but not limited to, any Executive Orders permitting or restricting Union security rights. If there is a legal challenge to any provisions of the Article, the Employer may suspend its obligations under this Article for the duration of the dispute after conferring on the matter with the Union.
The Union, including its International, agrees to save and hold the Employer harmless from any and all claims, actions, suits damages, or costs, including any attorneys fees incurred by the Employer, on account of any matter relating to the terms of this Article, including but not limited to any claims by an Employee(s) and compliance with the law.
SECTION 1.6	Dues Check off
The Company agrees to deduct dues as designated by the Union on a monthly basis from the paycheck of each member of the Union. These deductions will be made only upon written authorization from the employee on a form provided by the Union. The employee, upon written notice served upon the Company and the Union, may revoke such authorization. It is understood that such deductions will be made only so long as the Company may legally do so. The Company will be advised in writing, by the Union, as to the dollar amount of the Union membership dues.
The Company will remit all such deductions to the International Financial Secretary/Treasurer within three (3) business days from the date that the deduction was made. The Union agrees to furnish the Company with the current routing number for direct deposit. The Company shall furnish the International Financial Secretary/Treasurer with a deduction list, setting forth the name and amount of dues with each remittance. The Union agrees to hold the Company harmless from any action or actions growing out of these deductions initiated by an employee against the Company, and assumes full responsibility of the dispositions of the funds so deducted, once they are paid over to the Union. Errors made by the Company in the deduction or remittance of monies shall not be considered by the Union as a violation of this provision, providing such errors are unintentional and corrected when brought to the Company's attention.

ARTICLE 2	UNION SENIORITY
SECTION 2.1	Union Seniority Defined
Union seniority shall be based on each employee's service credit date under the federal Service Contract Act. Union seniority shall not accrue until the employee has successfully completed the probationary period. Union seniority shall be applicable in determining the order of layoff and recall, shift bidding, vacation schedules, extra work, transfers, and other matters as provided for in this Agreement.
Any CSO transferring into the bargaining unit from outside the bargaining unit shall be placed at the bottom of the seniority list.
SECTION 2.2	Seniority Lists and Conflicts
The Company shall maintain a seniority list based on Section 2.1. In the event that two or more employees have the same seniority date, seniority conflicts shall be resolved by a game of chance to be conducted on an as-needed basis.
SECTION 2.3	Personal Data
Employees shall notify the Employer in writing, on the company provided form, of their proper mailing address and telephone number or of any change of name, address, or telephone number. The Company shall be entitled to rely on the last known address in the employee's official records.
SECTION 2.4	Probationary Employees
Probationary employees will be considered probationary for a ninety (90) calendar day period after their hire day. The Union will still represent probationary employees for problems concerning wages, hours and working conditions, but the Company reserves the right to decide questions relating to transfers, suspensions, discipline, layoffs, or discharge of probationary employees without recourse to the grievance procedure contained in this Agreement. Probationary employees do not have seniority until the completion of the probationary period, at which time seniority dates back to the date of hire. The probationary period can be extended by mutual written agreement between the Company and the Union.
SECTION 2.5	Termination of Seniority
The seniority of an employee shall be terminated for any of the following reasons:
A.	the employee quits or retires;
B.	the employee is discharged;
4
C.	a settlement with the employee has been made for total disability, or for any other reason if the settlement waives further employment rights with the Employer;
D.	the employee is laid off for a continuous period of twelve (12) months;
E.	the U.S. Government revokes the employee's credentials as a CSO;
F.	the employee is permanently transferred out of the bargaining unit;
G.	full seniority will be reinstated should an employee who has been removed on a nonvoluntary basis be re-credentialed by the USMS.
SECTION 2.6	Temporary Transfer out of Bargaining Unit
A bargaining unit employee who is temporarily promoted by the Company to a non-bargaining position will not lose his/her seniority for a period up to ninety (90) days while in that position. The period of time may be extended by mutual agreement of the Union and the Company.
ARTICLE 3	JOB OPPORTUNITIES
SECTION 3.1	Filling Vacancies
If a vacancy occurs in a regular position covered by this Agreement or a new position is added, and the Company chooses to fill the position, the job will be posted for a period of three (3) working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) within the worksite. All shared position employees who have notified the Site Supervisor, in writing of their intent to apply for a full-time position and who are not scheduled to work during the three (3) day period at the site where an opening occurs, and any employees on vacation or on other approved leave will be notified by the Union. When a vacancy occurs, the Employer will fill the position with the most senior employee who has applied for the position in writing, and who has been trained (if required) to fill any necessary special qualifications for the new position. No more than two (2) shifts will be filled under this procedure as a result of that vacancy.
SECTION 3.2	Shared Position Employees
The Company is obligated under its contract with the USMS, to fill a designated number of shared positions in order to provide full staffing level coverage, increase security levels as needed and avoid unnecessary overtime. A shared position employee may be scheduled to work more than a part time schedule, as necessary, at the Company's discretion. The Company will give the shared position employee the maximum possible notice for the schedule changes. Failure to report to work when so scheduled or called to work may result in disciplinary action.
Shared position employees shall sign the Shared Officer Agreement form.
5
SECTION 3.3	Layoff and Recall
In the event of layoff or recall, when full-time or shared positions are being reduced, probationary employees will be laid off first. Should it be necessary to further reduce the work force, employees will be retained on the basis of seniority within the Local. The Company will notify the Union in writing, of required reduction. The Union will respond, in writing, within three (3) business days (excluding Saturday, Sunday and Holidays) with the name or names of the least senior employee or employees. Recall of employees will be accomplished by recalling the last laid off employee first, and so on.
SECTION 3.4	Temporary Assignments
In the interest of maintaining continuous operations, the Employer may temporarily assign an employee to a vacant or new position until the job is filled in accordance with Articles 2 and 3, or assign an employee to a position that is part of a temporary security assignment directed by the USMS, including temporarily assigning an employee to a work site within or outside of the area defined by this Agreement. To the extent feasible, the assignment shall be a voluntary selection based on seniority and qualifications. In the absence of volunteers, assignments shall be made on a reverse seniority and qualifications basis. Employees so assigned will receive the higher of the base hourly wage available to employees regularly assigned to the site to which they are being transferred, or their hourly wage they receive at their regular site under this agreement whichever is greater.
SECTION 3.5	Appointment of LCSOs
The U.S. Government, in its contract with the Company creates specific guidelines for the job duties and qualifications of Lead CSOs. Based on these guidelines, all appointments of Lead CSOs will be made on the basis of suitability as evaluated by the Company. Suitability shall include an employee's skills, experience, past performance, capabilities and the needs of the operation. If, in the Employer's determination, employees are equally qualified, seniority will prevail. Lead CSOs will not perform supervisory duties as described by the National Labor Relations Act.
ARTICLE 4	GOVERNMENT RIGHTS
The Company and its employees are providing a service to the United States Government, which bears responsibility and authority for providing security to federal judicial facilities. Therefore, express written or verbal instructions of the U.S. Government must be complied with and shall supersede all provisions of this Agreement. Such instructions and any claimed violation of this Agreement which results from those instructions, are not subject to the grievance or arbitration procedure.
6
ARTICLE 5	GOVERNMENT CREDENTIALS REQUIRED
Employment as a Court Security Officer or Lead Court Security Officer requires, as a condition of employment, that the employee maintain a current, valid driver's license issued by his or her state of residence. Employees must be qualified to receive a Special Deputation as a Court Security Officer by the United States Marshals Service. Employees who fail to qualify will be considered to have resigned voluntarily.
ARTICLE 6	NON-DISCRIMINATION
There shall be no discrimination against any employees within the collective bargaining unit covered by this agreement (including, for the purpose of this anti-discrimination provision of the agreement, probationary employees) by reason of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age or any other characteristic protected by any Federal, State, City, County, municipal or other local statute, law, regulation, rule or ordinance, including, but not limited to, claims made pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, Sections 1981 through 1988 of Title 42 of the United States Code; the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ( herein collectively referred to as statutory claims). There shall also be no retaliation against those employees covered by this article for pursuing their rights, statutory and contractual, under this Article.
The Union agrees, on behalf of itself and all the employees covered by this Agreement, that the sole and exclusive forum for the adjudication of all such claims under this Article, statutory and contractual, and the sole and exclusive remedy for violations of the rights set forth in this Agreement, statutory and contractual (including but not limited to those statutes referenced in Article 4), to the preclusion of all other remedies and forums, judicial administrative and otherwise, shall be the grievance and arbitration procedures detailed in Articles 9 & 10 of this Agreement, unless the claim asserted is a challenge to an action taken by the company pursuant to Article 4 of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 7	MANAGEMENT'S RIGHTS
SECTION 7.1 Enumerated Rights
The Company reserves all rights which it heretofore had except to the extent that those rights are expressly limited by the provisions of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing reservations of rights, the parties consider it to be desirable, in order to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding or grievances in the future, to specify by way of illustration and without limitation some of the rights reserved to the Company, which it may exercise in it sole discretion and which might otherwise be a source of potential controversy, these rights being:
a.	Hire;
7
b.	Assign work and schedule;
c.	Promote, Demote;
d.	Discharge, discipline, or suspend;
e.	Determine the size and composition of the workforce, including the number of, if any, employees assigned to any particular shift and the number of full-time and share-time employees;
f.	Make and enforce work rules not inconsistent with the express provisions of this agreement;
g.	Require employees to observe reasonable Employer rules and regulations;
h.	Determine whether an employee may take unpaid leave when all forms of paid leave have been exhausted;
i.	Determine the qualifications of an employee to perform work;
j.	The right to determine, direct, and change the work operations and work force
of the Company;
k.	The right to ensure adherence to performance standards, the type of services to be rendered, and the manner in which such services are to be performed;
I.	The right to determine the type and quantity of machines, equipment, and supplies to be used and the purchase, control, and use of all materials, equipment, and supplies that are purchased, used, or handled by the Company;
m.	The right to sell, lease, shut down, or otherwise dispose of all or part of the Company's assets or business operations;
n.	The right to introduce changes in the methods of operations, jobs or facilities, including the right to automate, totally or partially, any or all of its business operations, even though this operates to eliminate unit jobs;
o.	The right to establish job descriptions and classifications and to require employees covered by this Agreement to perform any job or task deemed necessary by the Company, as long as it is related to his principal duties provided the assignment is lawful and safe and that the employee is qualified to perform it;
p.	The right to hire, promote, transfer, and lay off employees covered by this Agreement and to determine the requirements and criteria prerequisite to being hired, promoted, transferred, or laid off;
q.	The right to schedule all work and hours of work, to determine the need for and amount of overtime, and to assign or require employees to work overtime in compliance with Sections 12.3 and 12.4 of this agreement.
SECTION 7.2 Retained Rights
Any rights, power or authority the Company had prior to the signing of this Agreement are retained by the Company, except those specifically abridged or modified by this Agreement and
8
any supplemental Agreements that may hereafter be made. The Company's failure to exercise any function reserved to it shall not be deemed a waiver of any such rights.
ARTICLES DISCIPLINE
SECTION 8.1	Just Cause
No employee, after completion of his or her probationary period, shall be disciplined or terminated without just cause. It is agreed by the parties that in instances when the employee is removed from working under the USMS Contract by the USMS, or when the employee's authority to work as a Court Security Officer under the USMS Contract is otherwise denied or terminated by the USMS, or the employee no longer satisfies the USMS's qualifications for his or her position, the employee may be terminated without recourse to the procedures under this Agreement and the Company shall be held harmless from any lawsuits resulting by the employee and the Union.
SECTION 8.2	Significant Offenses
Among the actions which may, as deemed appropriate by the Employer, result in and establish cause for discipline (including immediate dismissal) shall include, but shall not be limited to: abuse of authority; neglect of duties; breach of security; breach of the Company's chain of command policy, except to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with the orders or accommodating the needs of the USMS and the Court; conduct which impugns, disparages or reflects negatively upon the USMS, the Court, the Company or any of their agents or employees to the Government or other third parties, except when such conduct is protected under specific law; inappropriate conduct directed at or involving Government employees, members of the public or contractor employees at or near the federal facilities, or while in uniform; Deadly Force standards, dishonesty, misappropriation of funds or government or company resources, theft, assault, intoxication or drinking on duty, being under the influence of or illegal use or possession of drugs or narcotics; immoral or indecent conduct; fighting; threats; breach of building rules or regulation; sleeping or being inattentive while on duty; destruction of property; criminal misconduct or violations of the Company's EEO or harassment policies.
SECTION 8.3	Progressive Discipline
The Employer recognizes the principals of progressive discipline. Accordingly, the Employer will consider utilizing progressive steps (e.g., reprimands or warnings, followed by suspension, followed by termination), as it deems appropriate considering the circumstances. Therefore, nothing herein shall require the Employer to begin the disciplinary process at any particular level, and that the Employer's right to determine that immediate termination is appropriate in certain situations is therefore not limited by this provision.
9
ARTICLE 9 GRIEVANCE
SECTION 9.1	Intent
For purposes of this Agreement, a grievance shall mean a claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of a material provision of this Agreement, except as limited by Articles 2, 3, 4 and 5.
SECTION 9.2	General Provisions
The number of days outlined in Section 9.3 for the processing and presentation of grievances shall establish the maximum time allowed for the presentation and processing of a grievance. When used in this Article, the term "days" shall mean working days, not including Saturdays, Sundays, legal holidays, or days when the local worksite or corporate office of the Company are closed.
Should the Company, the Union and/or grievant fail to comply with the time limits, the opposing party may deem such failure to respond as a denial of the grievance and move the process to the next step in accordance to the provisions of Article 9. The Company shall not be required to arbitrate untimely grievances or grievances not processed in accordance with the time deadlines set forth in the procedure, unless the Company affirmatively waives untimeliness as a defense in writing. Timeliness will be decided by a Court having jurisdiction unless the Company agrees to submit the issue to an arbitrator.
SECTION 9.3	Grievance Procedure
All grievances shall be presented and processed in accordance with the following procedures. A grievance must specifically identify the provision(s) of the Agreement claimed to have been violated and the specific facts supporting the grievance. The grievance and any subsequent proceedings shall be limited to the identified violations and provisions.
1.	Informal Step
The party representatives at the location where the grievance arose shall make their best efforts to resolve any dispute on an informal basis. Both the Company and the Union agree that the aggrieved employee will first discuss the complaint with the immediate supervisor (not in the bargaining unit), within five (5) working days of the incident or action being grieved, to start the informal procedure. If the informal procedure is not invoked within five (5) working days of employee's knowledge of a grievable issue, then it is agreed by both parties that no further action can be taken. If, during the course of this discussion either the employee or the supervisor requests, a Weingarten representative will be called in unless unavailable in which case the employee may proceed without a representative or reschedule the discussion.
10
2.
Local Step
If the matter is not resolved at the informal step, the employee shall, not later than ten (10) days after the informal discussion with the immediate supervisor, set forth the facts in writing on an agreed form, specifying the specific Article(s) and paragraph(s) allegedly violated and the nature of the alleged violation. This form shall be signed by the aggrieved employee and a separate Union representative, and shall be submitted to the Contract Manager or his designee with a copy to the Company's HR Director. The Contract Manager or designee shall have ten (10) days from the date the grievance was presented to return a decision in writing with a copy to the aggrieved employee and the Union representative. If the Contract Manager or designee denies the grievance or does not respond within ten (10) days, the aggrieved employee must timely advance the grievance to the next step.
3. Corporate Step
If the grievance is not settled at the Local Step, the grievance may be appealed in writing to the Company's Vice-President of Human Resources or her designee not later than fifteen (15) days from the denial by the Contract Manager or designee or the expiration of the ten (10) day response period. The Vice-President of Human Resources or designee will have fifteen (15) days from the date the grievance was presented to return a decision, in writing, with a copy to the aggrieved employee and the Union representative. If the Contract Manager or designee denies the grievance or does not respond within fifteen (15) days, the aggrieved employee must timely advance the grievance to the next step (arbitration).
SECTION 9.4	Grievance for Discipline
Any grievance involving discharge or other discipline may be commenced at the Local Step of this procedure. The written grievance shall be presented to the Contract Manager through the Site Supervisor or designee within fifteen (15) days after the occurrence of the facts giving rise to the grievance.
SECTION 9.5	Class Action
The Union shall have the right to file a group grievance (class action) involving more than one (1) employee at the Informal Step of the grievance procedure.
SECTION 9.6	Individual Grievance
No individual may move a grievance to arbitration.
11
SECTION 9.7	Bilateral Right
Grievances may be raised by either the Union or the Company. The Company is required to address a grievance directly with the Union's designated representative one time before advancing an unresolved grievance to Arbitration under Article 10.
ARTICLE 10	ARBITRATION PROCEDURE
Grievances processed in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.3 that remain unsettled may be processed to arbitration by the Union. The Union will give the Company's VicePresident of Human Resources written notice of its desire to proceed to arbitration not later than fifteen (15) days after rejection of the grievance at the Corporate Step or expiration of the fifteen day (15) response period. Grievances which have been processed in accordance with the requirements of Section 9.3 which remain unsettled shall be processed in accordance with the following procedures and limitations. If there is a dispute over whether a grievance is arbitrable, such issue may be resolved by any court of competent jurisdiction. Unless both parties agree, only one grievance may be heard in any arbitration proceeding.
SECTION 10.1	Selection of an Arbitrator
Within fifteen (15) days providing written notice of its desire to proceed to arbitration, the Union will request that the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) to supply a list of seven (7) arbitrators. An arbitrator will be selected from the list supplied by the FMCS by parties alternately striking from the list until one (1) name remains, and this individual shall be the arbitrator to hear the grievance. The party to make the first strike will be the winner of a coin toss.
SECTION 10.2	Decision of the Arbitrator
The arbitrator shall commence the hearing at the earliest possible date. Hearings shall be scheduled such that they will be completed in one continuous session, unless the hearing exceeds five (5) days, or unless mutually agreed by the parties. Any witnesses, excluding the grievant, not located within commuting distance of the hearing may testify by telephone.
The decision of the arbitrator will normally be rendered within thirty (30) days of the latter of the close of the hearing or submission of post-hearing briefs (unless extended by agreement of the parties) and shall be final and binding upon the parties to the Agreement. Any decision shall be complied with, without undue delay after the decision is rendered. Any award of back pay may not commence more than ten (10) days prior to the date of the written grievance. The burden of proving back pay is with the grievant and is limited to the amount of wages the employee would have otherwise earned, less any unemployment compensation, interim employment earnings or other appropriate off-sets. In the case of a discharge, the grievant must
12
demonstrate he or she exercised reasonable diligence to find other employment in order to recover back pay.
It is understood and agreed between the parties that the arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any of the terms of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not have the power to order any remedial relief not contained in the agreement, including but not limited to "front" pay and reinstatement where the employee has been removed by the government or is no longer qualified. The arbitrator may not alter or change wage rates or benefits. The arbitrator's decision must include findings of fact and the legal basis for the decision.
SECTION 10.3	Arbitration Expense
The arbitrator's fees and expenses, including any travel expenses and the cost of any hearing room, shall be borne equally by both parties. In the event that the arbitrator rules partially in favor of the Union and partially in favor of the Company, these costs will be shared equally between the Company and the Union.
SECTION 10.4	Parties' Expenses
Regardless of the arbitrator's decision, each party will bear its own legal fees and costs. Each party is responsible for all other expenses it incurs, including the compensation costs and travel expenses of any witnesses whose attendance said party requires at arbitration.

ARTICLE 12	HOURS OF WORK AND OVERTIME
SECTION 12.1	Workday and Workweek
For the purposes of this Article, a regular workweek of forty (40) hours of work, excluding lunch periods, shall constitute a normal full-time workweek for full-time employees. Shifts shall be designated at the discretion of the Employer to fulfill the needs of the U.S. Government. Nothing contained herein shall guarantee to any employee any number of hours of work per day or week.
SECTION 12.2	Overtime
An overtime rate of time and one-half (1 1Z) of an employee's base rate of pay (exclusive of health and welfare and other fringe additions to pay) shall be paid for all hours actually worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a work week.

If directed to work overtime or extra hours, the employee shall be required to do the work, unless the employee is excused by the Company for good cause.
SECTION 12.4	Overtime Distribution

The parties recognize that lack of notice or needs of the business may in certain cases, preclude, as a practical matter, the even distribution of all overtime assignments. The Company will not have liability for failing to do so as long it makes a reasonable effort to distribute overtime evenly among employees. Any employee, who believes he/she has been deprived of equitable distribution of overtime in violation of this section, must first bring it to the attention of Company management and afford the Company the opportunity to give an overtime assignment, in which case, there is no violation of this section.
Extra work is defined as work paid for by an agency or entity other than the U.S. Marshals Service.
Management cannot be assigned to cover CSO positions or posts except in an emergency situation.

14
and the second rest period shall be in the last half of the shift. On occasion, due to exceptional work requirements, employees may have to work through their unpaid lunch breaks and/or paid rest periods, and, if so, they will be compensated at the appropriate rate of pay or dismissed earlier, at the Company's option. The Company recognizes the requirement to make its best efforts to provide regularly scheduled breaks. It is not the intent of the Company to avoid this requirement.

Any employee not already scheduled to work who is called into work will receive a minimum of four (4) hours of work or pay.

If an error is found, the employee shall be notified in writing prior to any deductions from his/her paycheck.
In case of an undisputed error on the part of the company as to an employee's rate of pay, proper adjustment will be made in the next paycheck after the error has been brought in written form to the Company's attention.

In the event that a closing occurs, employees will be excused and may use personal leave, vacation leave or leave-without-pay.
SECTION 13.5	Shift Bidding
Once each year, full-time employees and shared position employees at each location may bid their shift schedules among designated full-time assignments or shared assignments in the order of seniority.

Additional shift bids may occur upon mutual consent of both parties.
