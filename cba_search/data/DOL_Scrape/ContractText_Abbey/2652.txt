If the Board votes to approve and the Association ratifies the Closure Document, it will be signed and dated by the president of the Board and the president of FHEA.

•	The attached Coordinator Salary Schedule for 2008-2009 represents the compensation plan for coordinators agreed upon by the Administration and the FHEA. A copy of the schedule is attached to and made a part of this closure agreement.
Group Insurance Coverage
•	Certificated employees, working in a contracted position, who regularly work thirty (30) hours or more per week, are eligible to receive District paid employee coverage for medical, dental and vision insurance.
•	Certificated employees, working in a contracted position, who regularly work at least seventeen (17) hours per week, are eligible to receive one-half District paid employee coverage for medical, dental and vision insurance. To receive coverage, certificated employees working between seventeen (17) and thirty (30) hours a week must pay the rest of the premium themselves.
Stipend for Speech Language Pathologists
•	Speech Language Pathologists who hold their Certificate of Clinical Competence from the American Speech and Hearing Association will receive a $3,000 yearly stipend. To be eligible for the stipend, the Speech Language Pathologist must:
o be working as a Speech Language Pathologist;
o maintain a current Certificate of Clinical Competence; and
o provide documentation of the renewal of the Certificate of Clinical Competence to the Human Resources Department by May 15 annually.
Sick Leave
•	Sick Leave accumulation cap in Board policy will be raised to 100 days.
•	Sick Leave day payout in Board policy will be raised to $75 per day up to a maximum of 75 days
upon retirement.
Additional Personal Days
•	There may be special circumstances where an employee desires to use more than two days of personal leave in a year. The employee may make a request to the Superintendent of Schools to approve a request for additional paid personal leave. The Superintendent of Schools has sole discretion to approve said request.
Retiree Discount Insurance Program
•	Teachers who retire from the District with at least fifteen (15) years of experience in the Francis Howell School District are eligible to participate in the District’s Teacher Retiree Discount Insurance Program (RDIP). In order to earn a discount toward purchase of District group health insurance, the teacher must substitute teach in the District. The number of days that a teacher must substitute teach to earn this benefit is calculated by dividing the District group health insurance contribution by the daily amount that a retiree is paid for substitute teaching, then multiplying that amount by the “Employee Contribution Percentage” from the table below, rounded to the nearest whole number.
FHEA Closure Agreement for 2008-2009

Years of Experience	Employee Contribution Percentage	Employee Discount Percentage
26+	55%	45%
20-25	65%	35%
15-19	75%	25%
•	The percentages of employee contribution and employee discount will remain the same each year. The number of days worked to earn the discount will change based on the District group health plan contribution amount and the retiree substitute teaching compensation amount, as calculated by the formula described above.
•	Beginning with the 2008-2009 school year, substitute teaching will be the only method by which retirees may be involved in RDIP and earn a discount toward participation in the District group health plan.
•	Retirees are eligible for the RDIP for the five years immediately following retirement. Retirees do not have to participate in the RDIP for all five years in order to retain eligibility. However, retirees must participate in the District group health plan for all five years of eligibility in order to participate in the RDIP in any one of the five years of RDIP eligibility.
•	Retirees may choose to provide half of the required days of substitute teaching and receive one-half of the applicable discount, based on years of service.
Teacher Plan Time
•	Dr. Schuster and the Executive Cabinet will draft and distribute to all certified staff (including administrators) a statement reinforcing implementation of current Board policy regarding teacher plan time. A copy of the statement is attached to and made a part of this closure agreement.
PLC Leader Compensation
•	Will be addressed by the Extra-Duty Committee who will report back to the Negotiations Teams in written form.
Elementary Department Chairperson Clarification
•	Will be addressed by the Extra-Duty Committee who will report back to the Negotiations Teams in written form.
The above represents the agreements reached by the Administration and FHEA.

MEMORANDUM
Dr. Renee Schuster Superintendent
Date: March 12, 2008 To:	All Principals
From: Dr. Renee Schuster
Re:	Plan Time
District and site administrators fully support Board policy and regulation 4220 (see excerpt below) which states that teachers will be provided with preparation time for the purposes of activities such as lesson planning, grading, and parent communication.
Teachers may work collaboratively with other teachers during individual plan time; however, teachers will not be required to do so.
If trainings or meetings are offered during a teacher’s plan time, the teacher may attend; however, the teacher shall not be required to attend during plan time. Meetings involving special education for a specific student or other meetings related to a specific student could be scheduled during plan time. Evaluation meetings could also be scheduled during plan time.
Administrators reserve the right to call a meeting or speak to a particular teacher(s) during the teacher’s plan time if the situation is of an emergency nature.
PERSONNEL SERVICES	Regulation 4220 CR
Personnel Assignments and Transfers
Instructional Day
Planning Time
During the instructional day, teachers shall be provided with preparation time for the purpose of lesson planning, grading and communicating with parents/guardians and students. In the secondary schools the length of preparation time shall be equivalent to one class period or a minimum of sixty (60) minutes a day, including passing period. In the elementary schools the length of preparation time shall be fifty-five (55) to sixty-five (65) minutes per day, with an expectation to provide a total of 300 minutes planning time per week for all teachers, grades K-5. Elementary teachers will be compensated if their total planning time is less than 275 minutes per week. Teachers whose planning time exceeds 325 minutes per week will have additional academic duties.
It is understood there may be occasions on which the schedule is shortened or rearranged which will cause for a variance in the minimum planning time.
Teachers will be compensated for plan time that cannot be scheduled. Elementary teachers will be compensated for unscheduled plan time minutes below the minimum 275 minutes per week. Calculation of plan time compensation is based on a maximum of 174 student contact days. Secondary teachers will be compensated for plan time when an additional section of instruction is added to their teaching load. A plan period will be calculated as sixty (60) minutes and paid for actual student contact days; i.e. 174 days in middle school and high school.
