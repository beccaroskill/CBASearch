ARTICLE IX
ADJUSTMENT OF GRIEVANCES
Section 1.	Purpose
(a)	The procedural steps for the settlement of grievance set forth represents a general standard which may be modified by agreement between The Employer and the Union to permit a specific procedure best suited for the orderly and expeditious settlement of grievances, provided such modifications are not contrary to the general principles herein established.
(b)	The procedures under this Article are available to the International Union or the Employer for the presentation and settlement of grievances arising under the terms of the Agreement. Such cases shall be presented under Step Two of the Grievance Procedure.
Section 2.	Procedure
(a) Should a difference arise between the Employer and the Union as to the interpretation, application of, or compliance with the provisions of this Agreement, there shall be no interruption or impeding of the work, work stoppages, strikes, or lockouts, on account of such differences. An earnest effort should be made to settle the matter promptly in accordance with the following procedure, except as specific procedure for the handling of specific subjects as provided elsewhere in the Agreement.
STEP ONE
(a) The first step in processing a grievance is for the aggrieved and/or the Unit Representative to take the matter up with the employer. If the matter is not satisfactorily settled, it shall be reduced to writing on the Investigation Report Form, no later than the following workday and handed to the employer. The employer’s answer shall be in writing and returned to the Unit Representative within three (3) days. Failure to do so will resolve the grievance in the favor of the unanswered party. Any extension of these time limits must be by mutual agreement and in writing. Also that the Employer or the Union must then, within five (5) working days from receipt of the Employer’s or Union’s answer, process the grievance in writing to the next step or advise the Employer or Union of its respective position. Failure to do so will resolve the grievance in favor of the unanswered party.
STEP TWO
(a)	Between an International Union representative, Unit Representatives and any such other member or members as they may deem necessary, and representatives of the Employer who have authority to make final decisions on grievances. The meeting in Step Two shall be held within fifteen (15) working days from the date of receipt of request by either party for such meeting or extended by mutual agreement. Failure by either party to meet within the fifteen (15) working day period after receipt of request shall resol ve the grievance against the party who defaults, providing that no more than two second step meetings will be held in any month, except by mutual agreement. If the grievance is not satisfactorily settled at the meeting, the Employer or Union is required to furnish a written answer under this step within five (5) working days after the date of meeting and failure to do so will result in settlement of the grievance in favor of the unanswered party, unless the time is extended by mutual agreement and in writing. Such extension shall not be unreasonably withheld.
(b)	The Employer or Union must then within ten (10) working days from receipt of the Employer’s or Union’s answer, process the grievance in writing to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS) and failure to do so would resolve the grievance in
