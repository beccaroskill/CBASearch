A hearing regarding this arbitration was held on April 22,1993, at 10:00 AM in the offices of the AFUCIO Building and Construction Trades Department, Washington, D.C.

ISSUE
A jurisdictional dispute between Laborers International Union of North America (hereinafter referred to as Laborers) and the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry (hereinafter referred to as UA) over the installation of a metallic piping system for drainage, disposal and all separation of industrial and storm waste inside a property line, Long Island Railroad’s Richmond Hill shop and yards, Atlantic Avenue and 121st Street, Queens, New York, Slattery Associates, Inc. contractor.
FACTUAL FINDINGS
As a matter of clarification, the parties jointly stipulated that the work in dispute does not involve “disposal” or “oil separation” as referenced within the Plan Appeal notice. The work in dispute is limited to the installation of nine drainage lines running parallel to existing railroad tracks within an existing railroad maintenance yard of the Long Island Railroad at Richmond Hill, Queens, New York. Additionally, the disputed work includes the installation of a fifteen inch cast iron main collection drain pipe feeding into the vertical tube coalescing separators.
Both parties offered into submission all exhibits and position statements from the hearing held before the Board of Arbitration of the Building & Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, March 31, 1993, at 44 West 28th Street, New York, New York. In addition to this information the UA offered a copy of the certified transcript of the referenced hearing as recorded by Barrister Reporting Service, Inc., 120 Broadway, New York, New York.
After review of the various arguments of the dispute. It was agreed between the parties that the primary basis for ruling in this case should be the Memorandum of Agreement between the UA and Laborers dated January 23, 194L More specifically, the third paragraph of said Memorandum is material to the instant dispute.
— 39 —
“All the laying of clay, terra cotta, ironstone, vitrified concrete or non-metallic pipe and the making of joints for main and side sewers and drainage only is the work of the Laborers.”
The Laborers conclude from this language that:
“...the making of joints (therefore, the installation of all main and side sewers and drainage, regardless of materials) is the work of the Laborers only. The jurisdiction over sewer and drainage work has nothing to do with whether or not the pipe is metallic...”
The UA argues conversely that:
“...This is a plainly unreasonable reading of the 1941 Agreement, for it simply chooses to ignore what immediately precedes that phrase: an explicit description of the specific types of pipe with which Laborers may work. Local 731 made no effort to explain why the ‘making of joints for main and side sewers and drainage only’ would be exempt from this limiting language. In fact, neither logic nor common sense justifies such as exemption...”
OPINION AND DECISION
Article 5, Section 8, of the Plan For the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes in the Construction Industry references the various criteria which the undersigned is required to consider in rendering a decision. Such criteria is cited in order of precedence. The January 23, 1941, Memorandum of Agreement referenced herein is in fact:
“...an applicable agreement between the crafts governing the case...” (Page 20 of the Plan)
The Memorandum must therefore be the determining consideration for resolution of the instant dispute. In this regard, the language of the third paragraph of the Memorandum, as previously written herein, must be properly construed.
After an arduous contemplation of the language it would seem that the
— 40 —
“laying” of the pipe and the “making” of joints are meant to be separate and distinct work tasks.
It is uncontested that the specifications of Metropolitan Transit Authority/Long Island Railroad Contract No. 5423: Richmond Hill Shop and Yard Improvement, require in Section 02600 that:
“...all pipe in the storm drainage system must be ASTM A-74 cast iron, and all pipe fittings must be ASTM C-384 cast iron of bell and spigot type, extra heavy weight.”
In consideration of the above information it is unequivocal that the pipe at issue is metallic in nature and therefore excluded from the scope of “laying” embraced within paragraph three of the Memorandum.
I hereby find good and sufficient reason to determine that the installation of pipe which is the subject of this hearing is within the jurisdiction of the U A and should be so assigned.

He/She shall come from the union hall and be appointed by the Business Agent in the area, or at the discretion of the Business Agent, the Steward may be selected from among the Employees on the job. In the case of alteration jobs, the Steward shall be selected from among the Employees on the job. A Steward shall be a competent working Journeyman plumber and shall work with his/her tools as a productive Employee. A Steward shall be paid at the same rate as other Journeymen on the job, and shall be subject to the same rules and conditions by the Employer as other Journeymen. A Steward shall not lose time when other Journeymen plumbers are working, excluding the Foreman. A Steward cannot be removed by the Employer unless he/she is in violation of the Agreement or for incompetency.

The replaced Steward shall remain on the job as a “regular” journeyman and is then subject to all obligations, responsibilities and protections as other Employees. If, at the conclusion of the arbitration process, it is determined that the replacement of the Steward was justified, the Business Agent may appoint a
— 55 —
