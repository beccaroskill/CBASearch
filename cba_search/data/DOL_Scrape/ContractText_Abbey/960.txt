EMPLOYER PAYMENTS INTO TRUST FUNDS
81.	Each Individual Employer signatory to, or otherwise bound by, this Agreement shall pay the sums per hour into the Trust Funds for each hour’s work assigned by the Employer to employees upon work covered by this Agreement in accordance

82.	The Funds named in Article VII shall be administered in accordance with the applicable Trust Agreements and/or other documents adopted by and between the parties hereto and/or the UA creating said Funds (hereinafter “Trust Funds” which shall include any other form of business organization such as a non-profit corporation). The Individual Employers agree to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of said Trust Agreements and any amendment or amendments thereto that have been or may hereafter be adopted by the parties thereto.
83.	Each Individual Employer shall file a monthly report with each Fund on the form established by the Fund and such report shall be filed monthly regardless of whether the Individual Employer has employed any employees covered by the report. Each such report shall be signed by the owner, a partner, or an executive officer of the Individual Employer, as the case may be.
84.	Payments to the Funds shall be made at the place designated from time to time by the Funds in accordance with and in the manner provided for by the applicable Trust Agreements, or by the UA Joint Labor-Management Cooperation Committee, Inc. (“JLM”) in the event that the fund or entity is signatory to the Joint Services Agreement (JSA) with the JLM. Absent contrary procedures in the JSA, such payments shall be due and payable monthly on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar month, and will be deemed delinquent if payment is not received on or before the twenty-second (22nd) day of each calendar month for all work performed in the preceding month.
85.	It is agreed that insofar as payments by the Individual Employer are concerned, the parties recognize and acknowledge that the regular and prompt payment of amounts due each Fund by Individual Employers is essential and, based upon prior experience of the parties hereto and in light of the substantial but varied expense incurred in the administration of said Funds and the Plan or entity due to delinquencies, the parties agree that it is extremely difficult, if not impracticable to fix the actual expense and damage to each Fund and the Plan or Program which results from the failure of an Individual Employer to make the payments in full within the time provided (ie. lost investment income). Therefore, it is agreed that the amount of damage resulting from any such failure shall be by way of liquidated damages and not as a penalty to each such Fund, Plan or Program and that the amount of the liquidated damages be as provided in the appropriate Trust Agreement, Plan or duly adopted document, such as the JSA.
86.	If any Individual Employer defaults in the making of such payments and if either the Union or the Funds consults or causes to be consulted legal counsel with respect thereto, or files or causes to be filed any suit or claim with respect thereto, there shall be added to the obligation of the Individual Employer who

88.	Whenever the Union, in its judgment, deems it necessary to protect payments to the Funds or the Plan or to protect the payment of wages to employees working under this Agreement, it may require any Individual Employer to supply the Union, not less often than weekly, with a written record of the names of all employees and their hours (specifying straight time and overtime) worked upon all or any particular job or jobs. The Union shall have the right to withdraw and withhold the employees of any Individual Employer who fails to furnish such information promptly.

-29-
amount of the cash bond in one lump sum, the Employer may post ten percent (10%) of the required amount of the cash bond as a down payment and pay the balance with its monthly reports at the rate of fifty cents ($0.50) per hour for every hour worked by its covered employees until the full amount of the cash bond is reached. No interest shall be posted to the Employer’s cash bond account until the full amount of the cash bond is paid. In the event the Employer disputes a claim made against the cash bond, the claim will be paid upon decision of the Joint Conference Board, in the case of money due employees, or upon the decision of the Trustees of the appropriate Trust Fund or Funds or their agent in the event of a claimed Trust Fund delinquency. The Employer shall be entitled to a refund of any amount remaining in its cash bond account upon a determination that it has legally terminated its Collective Bargaining Agreement with the Union or actually ceased doing business in Northern California, after any obligations due and owing the employees, Union or the Trust Funds have been deducted from the Employer’s cash bond account.
J.	If any Employer who is required to post a bond under this Section 89 fails to do so prior to the commencement of work (in the case of a “New Employer”) or within five (5) days of written demand by the Union (in case of a “Delinquent Employer”), it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Union to withdraw and withhold employees of that Individual Employer until the bond is posted and the Individual Employer shall be liable to any employees withdrawn for that reason for the wages and fringe benefits lost, up to a maximum of sixteen (16) working hours.
90.	CHANGE OF CONTRACTORS — Whenever an Individual Employer has taken over a job that has been only partially completed by another Contractor, he shall notify the Union in writing as soon as he becomes aware of that situation. If the first Contractor owes money on that job to employees or the Trust Funds, and the Individual Employer and the Union are unable to reach agreement upon a method for payment of amounts due, it shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Union to withhold employees from working on said job, or to withdraw employees who are already working thereon, until all such moneys have been paid.
91.	REMOVAL OF EMPLOYEES —The Union may withdraw and withhold the employees of an Individual Employer who defaults in payments of wages or in payments as provided in this Article and the applicable Trust documents.
92.	When employees are removed from an Individual Employer’s shop or job because of delinquency in payment of fringe benefits or wages, the Employer shall pay to all such removed employees sixteen (16) hours including time worked on the date of removal, if any, at their regular rate of pay plus fringe contributions, in the same manner as if they were employed on the job. When the delinquent wages and/or fringe contributions are paid and the account is cleared in full and the men notified to return to work prior to said sixteen (16) hours, then and only
-30-
then shall the Individual Employer be liable only for those hours the employees were off the job because of such violation of Contract, and provided further that if they are not available to return to work within two (2) hours after receipt of such notice by the Union, they shall receive pay for only two (2) hours after receipt of such notice by the Union.
93.

94.	The Trust Funds shall be responsible for sending notices to the Union, shall assume liability for any error in notification that results in employees being removed from the job when the Individual Employer was not delinquent, and shall be responsible for immediate notification to the Union when a delinquency is corrected.

96.	Such payments shall be due and payable on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of each calendar month for all work performed in the preceding month, and shall be considered delinquent if not received by the Trust office prior to midnight of the twenty-second (22nd) day.

Liquidated damages shall become due and payable to the Dues Check-off Account upon the day immediately following the date upon which the Employer becomes delinquent, and together with the Dues Check
-31 -
off contribution shall bear interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum until paid.
B.	In addition to liquidated damages, the Individual Employer shall be liable for all reasonable expenses incurred by the Union of amounts due, including but not limited to, in case suit be brought, reasonable attorney fees and court costs, including cost of attachment bond and expenses of accountants.
C.	Upon written demand from the Union, an Individual Employer who is or has been delinquent in one (1) or more payments shall within ten (10) days post a bond, or deposit cash in a banking institution, to secure the payment of all future contributions to the Dues Check-off Account.

The time limits on posting of such bond, the procedures for appeal, and the right of the Union to withhold employees for failure to post the bond, shall be the same as set forth in this Article XI.
D.	It shall not be a violation of this Agreement for the Union to refuse to man any job or to withdraw employees from the job or jobs of a delinquent Employer, or otherwise take concerted action against such Employer.
97.	Neither any Employer Association nor any Individual Employer shall be liable for the payments due from any other Individual Employer under this Article XI.
