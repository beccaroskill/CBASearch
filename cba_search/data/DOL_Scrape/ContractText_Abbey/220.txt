In order to make use of a direct rollover, the Distributee must sign and submit an election statement (to be provided by the Company) indicating that the distribution is to be made via a direct rollover to an eligible retirement plan within 60 days of notification by the Company of a lump sum distribution.
(1)	An "eligible retirement plan" is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the Distributee's eligible rollover distribution.

In addition, the Distributee must furnish documentation showing that the transferee trust is an approved trust under the respective sections of the Code. Once the election statement has been approved and the documentation accepted, the Company will instruct the Trust (referred to in Article I Section 4) to issue a check to the transferee trust, or to the Distributee in the name of the transferee trust (stipulated by the Distributee on such election statement) for the amount of the present value of the deferred vested pension benefit, or transfer such amount directly to the transferee trust.

C.	Effective 1 January 1997, an employee who continues employment beyond age 70% and whose required distribution beginning date would have been 1 April of the year following attainment of age 70%, will not be required
64
APPENDIX "A" - ARTICLE III
to begin minimum distribution until the employee attains age 70%, or the year the employee retires, whichever is later, as provided by Code Section 401 (a) (9) (C) as amended.
D.	Benefits for employees still working after age 70% will be calculated at retirement to reflect all of the employee's service credit which includes service credit from age 70% to retirement and actuarially increased under Article I, Section 14 to reflect the period after 70% in which the employee was not receiving any benefit.
E.	The last payment will be made on the first day of the month of the retired employee's death.
F.	No benefit shall be payable for any month for which the retired employee is receiving weekly disability payments under any group insurance plan to which the Company shall have contributed.

The amount of the benefit payable on subsequent termination of employment shall be reduced by an amount that is the actuarial equivalent of any benefit previously paid to him under the Plan before age 65 (with such actuarial equivalence based on the factors set out under Section 14 of Article 1). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the benefit payable to an employee on subsequent termination of employment be in an amount less than the amount of benefit he was receiving, or entitled to receive, as of the date preceding his reemployment.
B.	(1) If an employee participating in the Plan remains in employment with the Company or is reemployed by the Company after age 65 and, as a result of such employment or reemployment fails to receive benefit payments pursuant to the Plan, such suspension of benefits shall be made in accordance with Department of Labor Regulation Section 2530.203-3 and shall include the notice described in subparagraph (2).

Section 1.	For Daily Room and Board Expense
A.	Benefits will be paid 100% for in-network covered services or subject to point of service benefits for out-of-network covered services if an insured employee or an insured employee's dependent shall be confined upon the recommendation of a physician as a resident patient in a hospital on account of accidental bodily injury or sickness not hereinafter excepted and such confinement shall begin:
(1)	While such person is covered under this Article, or
(2)	Within three (3) months from the date such person ceases to be covered under this Article provided such person shall have been totally disabled by bodily injury or sickness at the date he shall have ceased to be covered under this Article, and shall have been continuously so disabled to the date of commencement of such confinement.
B.	The benefits will be paid for room and board of such person up to the maximum daily benefit hereinafter specified for each of the first three hundred sixty-five (365) days of such confinement during any one (1) period of disability.
C.	The number of days for which benefits are provided under B above will be reduced by the number of days for which benefits were paid during the same period of disability under Article XIV hereof.
D.	The maximum daily benefit shall be:
(1)	For any day that private accommodations, intensive care unit accommodations, or isolation facilities are not occupied, an amount equal to the hospital's regular daily rate for the accommodations occupied.
132
APPENDIX "B" - ARTICLE VII
(2)	For any day that private accommodations are occupied, an amount equal to the hospital's most frequent charge for semiprivate accommodations. If it is certified in writing by the Admitting Office of the hospital that semiprivate accommodations were not available at the time of admission, then for the day or days that semiprivate accommodations were not available, an amount equal to the hospital's regular daily rate for the lowest priced private accommodation available.
(3)	For any day that intensive care unit accommodations or isolation facilities are required, an amount equal to the hospital's regular daily rate for such accommodations.
The benefits will be paid for isolation facilities when such facilities are required by either the hospital and/or the attending physician.

To illustrate, suppose an employee is hospitalized with a suspected infectious condition and is placed in isolation. The benefits will be paid for the isolation facilities until the end of the day during which the definitive diagnosis is reached that the infectious condition requiring isolation no longer exists.
Another illustration would be the situation where an employee is hospitalized with a broken leg, and during the course of his confinement develops an infectious condition requiring isolation. Again, the benefits will be paid for the isolation facilities beginning at the time they are required and until such time as the definitive diagnosis is made stating that the infectious condition no longer exists.

228
APPENDIX "B" - ARTICLE XXIV
Notwithstanding (i.) and (ii.) above, if there is a court decree which would otherwise establish financial responsibility for the health care expenses with respect to the child, the benefits of a plan which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with such financial responsibility shall be determined before the benefits of any other plan which covers the child as a dependent child.
c. When "a" and "b" above do not establish which plan is primary, the plan which has covered Vie person on whose behalf the expenses were incurred for the longer period of time shall be primary.

B.	Employees will be eligible for Weekly Indemnity Benefits for a period of time equal to their continuous employment at the time the disability commences but in any case for not more than fifty-two (52) weeks.

E.	No change in class which will provide an increase or decrease in amount of insurance shall become effective during any one period of disability.
F.	The amount of Weekly Indemnity Benefits for the first and last day of disability will be determined on the following basis:

J.	When an employee has been totally disabled as the result of accidental bodily injury, returns to work and subsequently experiences any recurrence of total disability within 180 calendar days of that return, there shall be no waiting period for Weekly Indemnity Benefits, provided medical evidence indicates the total disability is due to the same injury.
When such total disability commences after 180 calendar days following the first day of return to work subsequent to the initial period of disability

APPENDIX "C" - ARTICLE IV
(2)	For employees at work on or after 1 April 1971 the amount of any increase in Paragraphs 1-c, d, or f above subsequent to the first day for which Long-Term Disability Benefits are payable (or, if later, the first day on which the amount of such governmental benefits for which reduction is made is initially determined) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of Long-Term Disability Benefit. Such increase shall not be disregarded if it represents an adjustment in the original determination.
(3)	The Company may require each employee eligible for Long-Term Disability Benefits to certify or furnish verification of the amounts of his deductible benefits from the sources listed above. The amount of any Long-Term Disability Benefit payments in excess of the amount that should have been paid after reduction for such benefits will be deducted from future Long-Term Disability Benefits.
(4)	In determining the amount by which Long-Term Disability Benefits shall be reduced, the monthly equivalent of benefits paid on a weekly basis shall be computed by multiplying the weekly benefit rate by 4.33. In the case of lump sum settlements under Workers' Compensation laws the deduction shall be the monthly equivalent of the amount of Workers' Compensation Benefit to which the employee would have been entitled under applicable law had there been no lump sum payment, but not to exceed in total the amount of the settlement.
(5)	Long-Term Disability Benefit computations shall presume eligibility for Social Security disability insurance benefits and if the employee has ten (10) years of service, total and permanent disability pension benefits. Deductions from Long-Term Disability Benefits will be made on this basis unless the person receiving benefits presents satisfactory evidence that these benefits were applied for and
252
APPENDIX "C" - ARTICLE IV
denied; provided, however, that a reduction shall be made in the amount equal to Social Security disability insurance benefits that would have been payable except for refusal to accept vocational rehabilitation services.
(6)	Increases in the Total and Permanent Disability pension benefits provided under Article VI of the John Deere Pension Plan for Wage Employees, which become effective for such benefits payable on or after 1 October 1979 shall be disregarded for purposes of determining the amount of Long-Term Disability Benefit. Such increase shall not be disregarded if it represents an adjustment in the original determination.
D.	Rehabilitation
An employee will not be ineligible for Long-Term Disability Benefits because of work which is determined to be primarily for training under a recognized program of vocational rehabilitation.
E.	Proof of Disability
The Company may require an applicant as a condition of eligibility to submit to examination by a physician designated by it for the purpose of determining his initial or continuing disability. Mental or non-organic disease as a cause for total disability must have a psychiatrist's certification that the employee's infirmity is of major and psychotic degree.
F.	Temporary Disability
A disabled employee who is released to return to work by the attending physician, but is temporarily prevented from returning to his/her regular job because of medical restrictions and there are no vacant jobs the employee is capable of performing, will be continued, if eligible, on Long-Term Disability status.

343
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE IV
B.	Correction of Excess. Amounts in excess of the limitation of subsection A.

344

Section 4.9	Section 401(k) Limit on Wage Deferral Contributions
A.	In General. Contributions for any Plan Year shall be limited to the extent necessary so that the Actual Deferral Percentage (as defined in subsection B.) for that Plan Year for the group of Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan is not more than the greater of—
(1)	the product of 1.25 and the Actual Deferral Percentage for the prior Plan Year for the non-Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan, or
(2)	the lesser of—
a.	the product of two and the Actual Deferral Percentage for the prior Plan Year for the non-Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan, or
b.	the Actual Deferral Percentage for the prior Plan Year for the non-Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan plus two percentage points.
If the limitation of this subsection is exceeded or is expected to be exceeded, the excess (or anticipated excess) may be eliminated pursuant to Subsections C. or D.
B.	Actual Deferral Percentage. The Actual Deferral Percentage for a specified group of Employees for a Plan Year shall be the average of the ratios (calculated separately for each Employee in such group) of—
345
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE IV
(1)	the amount of the Tax Deferred and Profit Sharing Contributions actually paid over to the Trust on behalf of each such Employee for such Plan Year, to
(2)	the Employee's Compensation for such Plan Year.
Such ratios and the Actual Deferral Percentage shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. To the extent allowed by Treasury regulations, the Company may elect to calculate the Actual Deferral Percentages by taking into account Employer contributions. If this Plan is combined with another plan which contains a cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401 (k) of the Code for the purposes of Section 401(a) (4) or 410(b) of the Code, the elective contributions under both plans shall be combined for the purposes of this subsection.
If a Highly Compensated Employee is a participant in two or more plans containing a cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401 (k) of the Code, for purposes of determining the deferral percentage with respect to such Employee, all cash or deferred arrangements shall be treated as one cash or deferred arrangement.
C.	Reductions.During Plan Year. If the Company determines prior to the end of a Plan Year that the limitation of Subsection A. might not be satisfied, the Company may reduce the future Tax Deferred Contributions and Compensation of the Highly Compensated Employees (and the amount of the Compensation reductions) in order of the Actual Deferral Percentages beginning with the highest of such Percentages.
D.	Reductions After End of Plan Year. For a Plan Year that begins after 1996, if the Company determines after the end of a-the Plan Year that the limitation of subsection A has not been satisfied, the Plan shall first determine, in the manner described in paragraph (1), the aggregate Tax Deferred Contributions that must be eliminated to satisfy
346
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE IV
the limitation of Subsection A then shall allocate and distribute the aggregate excess amount and allocable earnings in the manner described in Paragraphs (2) and (3), and forfeit any related Matching Contributions.
(1)	For the sole purpose of determining the amount of the aggregate excess Tax-Deferred Contributions to be distributed under Paragraph (2) (and not the amount to be distributed to a specific Highly Compensated Employee), the aggregate amount of excess Tax-Deferred Contributions is determined by—
a.	computing a reduction in the amount of the Tax-Deferred Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest Actual Deferral Percentage so that such percentage does not exceed the Actual Deferral Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest Actual Deferral Percentage, or if less, the amount necessary so that the limitation of Subsection A, is satisfied; and
b.	if the amount of the reduction pursuant to Subparagraph (A) is insufficient to reduce the average Actual Deferral Percentage for the Highly Compensated Employees so that it does not exceed the limitation of Subsection A., then repeating the process described in Subparagraph (A) in descending order of the Actual Deferral Percentages of the Highly Compensated Employees until the average Actual Deferral Percentage for the group of Highly Compensated Employees satisfies the limitation of Subsection A.
(2)	The aggregate excess Tax-Deferred Contributions determined under Paragraph (1) shall be eliminated by—
347
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE IV
a.	Distributing Tax-Deferred Contributions to the Highly Compensated Employee with the highest dollar amount of Tax-Deferred Contributions until it equals the dollar amount of the Tax-Deferred Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee with the next highest dollar amount Tax-Deferred Contributions, or if less, the aggregate amount of the excess amount determined under Paragraph (1); and
b.	If the distribution described in Subparagraph (A) does not eliminate the excess amount determined under paragraph (1), repeating the foregoing process in descending order of the dollar amounts of the Tax-Deferred Contributions until the aggregate excess amount under paragraph (1) has been distributed.
The amount to be distributed to a Participant shall be reduced by any amounts previously distributed under Section 4.8.
If the distributions required by this paragraph are made, the limitation of Subsection A is satisfied notwithstanding that the average Actual Deferral Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employees recomputed after the distributions may still exceed the limitation of Subsection A.
(3) The Plan shall distribute the amounts determined under Paragraph (2) to the Participants no later than the last day of the Plan Year following the Plan Year in which the limitation of Subsection A is exceeded, or the Plan may distribute the amounts within 2% months after such Plan Year if the Company deems it desirable for tax purposes. All distributions shall be adjusted pursuant to IRS regulations to reflect investment gains and losses.
348
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE IV
E. Additional Contribution. If the Company determines that the limitation of Subsection A. has been or may be exceeded, to the extent permitted by regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, the Employer may make an additional contribution on behalf of non-Highly Compensated Employees to satisfy the limitation of Subsection A. Such contribution shall be fully and immediately nonforfeitable and may not be withdrawn.
Section 4.10 Section 401(m) Limit on Matching Contributions
A.	In General. Matching Contributions for any Plan Year shall be limited to the extent necessary so that the Actual Contribution Percentage (as defined in subsection (b)) for that Plan Year for the group of Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan is not more than the greater of—
(1)	the product of 1.25 and the Actual Contribution Percentage for the prior Plan Year for the Non-Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan, or
(2)	. the lesser of—
a.	the product of two and the Actual Contribution Percentage for the prior Plan Year for the Non-Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan, or
b.	the Actual Contribution Percentage for the prior Plan Year for the Non-Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan plus two percentage points.
If this Plan is combined with another plan for the purposes of Section 410 (b) of the Code, both plans shall be combined for the purposes of this subsection.
349
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE IV
If the limitation of this subsection is exceeded or is expected to be exceeded, the excess (or the anticipated excess) may be eliminated pursuant to Subsections (c) or (d).
B.	Actual Contribution Percentage. The Actual Contribution Percentage for a specified group of Employees for a Plan Year shall be the average of the ratios (calculated separately for each Employee in such group) of—
(1)	the Matching Contributions paid on behalf of each such Employee for such Plan Year, to
(2)	the Employee's Compensation for such Plan Year.
To the extent permitted by Treasury regulations, the Company may elect to take into account Tax Deferred Contributions in calculating the Actual Contribution Percentage.
If a Highly Compensated Employee is a participant in two or more plans containing a cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) of the Code, for purposes of determining the contribution percentage with respect to such Employee, all cash or deferred arrangements shall be treated as one cash or deferred arrangement.
C.	Reduction of Contributions During Plan Year. Subject to Treasury regulations, if the Company determines prior to the end of a Plan Year that the limitation of subsection (a) might not be satisfied, the Company may reduce the future Matching Contributions made on behalf of the Highly Compensated Employees.

Reductions (adjusted for gains and losses) shall be paid to Employees not later than 2% months following the close of the Plan Year with respect to which the limitation of Subsection (a) is exceeded.
E.	Alternative Methods of Correction. If the limitation of Subsection (a) has been or may be exceeded, the Company may elect to either recompute the Actual Contribution Percentage by taking into account Tax Deferred Contributions to the extent permitted by regulations or have the Employer make an additional contribution on behalf of Non-Highly Compensated Employees to satisfy the limitation of Subsection (a). Such contribution shall be credited to the Tax Deferred Account and shall be fully and immediately nonforfeitable and may not be withdrawn.
F.	Multiple_Use_nf Alternative Limitation
(1)	In General. This Subsection shall be applicable only for Plan Years beginning before 1 January 2002 and (for such years) only if the Actual Deferral Percentage for the group of Highly Compensated Employees exceeds the amount specified in Section 4.11(a)(1) and the Actual Contribution Percentage for such group exceeds the amount in Section 4.121(a) (1). The sum of—
a.	the Actual Deferral Percentage for the group of Highly Compensated Employees who are eligible to participate in the Plan, and

A.	Loans may be granted only to those participants who are eligible for a loan. Those eligible participants are (i) Employees on the U.S. payroll who have an account balance that is great enough to qualify ($2,000 vested
373
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE VII
account balance) under Section 7.5(C) and (ii) parties in interest, as defined in Section 3 (14) of ERISA, who have an account balance that is great enough to qualify under Section 7.5(C).
B.	Such loans shall be made available to all Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis and shall not be made available to Highly Compensated Employees in an amount (stated as a percentage of the Participant's Accounts) greater than the amount made available to other Employees.
C.	A loan to any Participant, when added to the outstanding balance of all other loans to him from the Plan, shall not exceed the lesser of (i) $50,000 of the participant's vested balance, as reduced by the highest outstanding loan balance within the preceding one-year period or (ii) 50 percent of the vested balances in his Accounts determined as of the date of the loan. No loan shall be made in an amount less than $1,000.
D.	The rate of interest on any such loan shall be a rate determined from time to time by the Plan Administrator and within requirements of the Department of Labor regulations governing such loans. The Plan Administrator may change the rate of interest at its sole discretion; however, any such change of rate shall apply only to loans granted after any such change. Any rate of interest determined by the Plan Administrator shall be effective for the term of any loan granted.
E.	Effective as soon as practicable, a one-time fee of $5.00 will be charged to Participants' accounts at the end of the quarter in which the Participant requests a new loan. In addition, a loan maintenance fee of $2.50 will be charged to Participants' account each quarter in which the Participant has an outstanding loan balance.
F.	A Participant may not have more than one loan outstanding at any one time. Each loan to a Participant shall provide for repayment over a period not to exceed
374
APPENDIX "L-1” - ARTICLE VII
five years (ten years in the case of a loan for the purchase of a primary residence) in such installments as are determined by the Plan Administrator.
G.	Repayment of loans shall be made through weekly payroll deductions from regular after-tax Compensation, until fully repaid, as long as the Participant is in an active pay status. The loan may be prepaid in full, without penalty, by making a single lump sum payment at any time prior to the end of the term of the loan.
H.	Loan repayments shall be suspended for any period the Participant is in an inactive status such as when drawing Weekly Indemnity (W.I.), Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (S.U.B.) or Long-term Disability (L.T.D.) payments, or when on Leave of Absence. During an inactive pay status, the Participant may make payments by using loan coupons issued by the Recordkeeper at the time his status becomes inactive. Failure to keep loan payments current may result in a deemed distribution. Repayments shall begin again with the first pay period after the Participant returns to an active pay status, or as soon thereafter as practicable.
I.	Each loan to a Participant shall be secured by part of the Vested balances in his Accounts but not to exceed 50 percent of such balances, as determined by the Plan Administrator, together with such additional collateral as the Plan Administrator may require either at the time of the loan or from time to time thereafter. If, at any time when a loan to a Participant is outstanding, any amounts become payable under the Plan to him or his Beneficiary, the Trustee shall on direction of the Plan Administrator apply all or any part of such amounts to the payment of principal and accrued interest on the loan even though neither principal nor interest may then be due.
J.	A loan to a Participant shall, for purposes of Section 5.2, be treated as an investment of his Accounts. The amount of each loan to a Participant shall automatically be transferred to the Loan Fund established pursuant to
375
APPENDIX "L-1"-ARTICLE VII
Section 6.2 from the other Investment Funds in the following order absent specific direction by the Participant: Fidelity Retirement Money Market, Blended Interest Fund, Fidelity intermediate Bond Fund, Fidelity Freedom Income Fund, Fidelity Asset Manager: Income, Fidelity Freedom 2000 Fund, Fidelity Freedom 2010 Fund, Fidelity Asset Manager, Fidelity Puritan Fund, Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund, Fidelity Asset Manager: Growth, Fidelity Freedom 2030 Fund,- Fidelity Freedom 2040 Fund, Fidelity Equity-Income Fund, Fidelity Spartan U.S. Equity Index, Fidelity Magellan Fund, Fidelity Growth Company Fund, Fidelity OTC Portfolio, Fidelity Small Cap Independence Fund, Fidelity Overseas Fund, Deere & Company Common Stock Fund, Fidelity BrokerageLink. Amounts of principal and interest paid by a Participant on any loan shall be automatically transferred from the Loan Fund to the other Investment Funds in which his Accounts are invested. Such transfers shall be charged or credited against the other Investment Funds as of such times and in such proportions as the Plan Administrator determines.
K.	A Participant with an outstanding loan at the time of layoff, unpaid leave of absence, retirement or separation from service or while drawing Supplemental Unemployment Benefits (SUB), Weekly Indemnity (W.L), or Long Term Disability (LTD) will be issued a loan repayment coupon book from the Recordkeeper. The Participant may opt to continue making loan payments by using the coupons and sending the payment to the Recordkeeper, A minimum of one payment must be made each quarter (equal to all payments due for the quarter) in order to keep the loan current. The entire loan must be repaid within five years of the effective date of the loan or the original loan term, whichever is greater. Failure by the Participant to make a quarterly payment or pay the loan off within five years of inception will result in a taxable event. Further, if an eligible Participant elects to take full distribution of his account balance and a loan balance remains, the entire loan balance remaining will be taxable.
376
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE VII
Section 7.6	Distribution to Person Under Legal Disability

Section 7.7	Beneficiaries
A.	Each Participant may designate any legal or natural person or persons to receive any benefits payable under the Plan on account of his death.

B.	Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if a Participant has a surviving spouse, the surviving spouse shall be the Beneficiary unless the spouse consents as provided in Paragraph D to the designation of a Beneficiary other than the surviving spouse, and the designation of a Beneficiary other than the surviving spouse shall be ineffective without such consent.
377
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE VII
C.	If no person has been designated by a Participant (or if all persons so designated die before the Participant or die before complete distribution of his benefits), then the Plan Administrator, shall direct the Trustee to distribute the Participant’s benefits (or the balance thereof) to:
(1)	his surviving spouse; or
(2)	if there is no surviving spouse, one or more of his relatives by blood, adoption or marriage as it decides according to the following hierarchy (a) children or grandchildren; (b) parents; (c) siblings; or
(3)	the estate of the Participant or according to the Participant’s will.
In no event can the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant designate a Beneficiary.
D.	For purposes of this Section 7.7, the consent of a Participant's surviving spouse must be in writing, must acknowledge the effect of the designation and must be witnessed by a notary public. However, such consent shall not be required if the Participant establishes to the satisfaction of the Plan Administrator that such consent cannot be obtained because the spouse cannot be located or because of such other circumstances as the Plan Administrator may prescribe in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Section 7.8 Benefits of Persons Who Cannot Be Located
If the Plan Administrator notifies a Participant or a Beneficiary in writing at his last known address that he is entitled to benefits under the Plan and the Participant or Beneficiary fails to claim his benefits within two years after notification, his benefits shall be distributed to one or more of the Participant’s or Beneficiary's, as the case may be, relatives by blood, adoption or marriage, as the Plan Administrator decides. If the Plan Administrator determines after reasonable effort that
378
APPENDIX "L-1" - ARTICLE VII
no such relatives can be found, the Participant's benefits shall be forfeited and applied against the Employer Contributions for the Plan Year then current (and succeeding Plan Years as necessary). However, if a valid claim is subsequently made by the Participant or his Beneficiary or such a relative, the amount of such forfeited benefits shall be reinstated and distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Plan. Any forfeited benefits so reinstated shall be paid to the Trust Fund by the Employer.

This confirms our understanding that if, during the term of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, any health care legislation is enacted or amended to provide hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug, or dental benefits for employees, retired employees or surviving spouses, or vision care benefits for employees, which duplicate or may be integrated with the benefits under the Health Benefit Plan, then, in such event, the benefits under the Health Benefit Plan will be modified so as to integrate or eliminate the duplication of such benefits with the benefits provided by such legislation.
In the event health care legislation is enacted, the Company will meet with the Union to discuss the changes and their impact on APPENDIX "B" THE HEALTH BENEFIT PLAN FOR WAGE EMPLOYEES ("Plan"). Moreover, the Company commits that if the Plan is revised pursuant to this Letter, employees and their eligible dependents will not experience a reduction in benefits or an increase in deductibles, co-payments or coinsurance as provided under the Plan.

This is to confirm our understanding that the Company has committed itself to pay reasonable and customary charges made by dentists under the Company’s Health Benefit Plan even though such a claim might be initially questioned by the insurance company but later affirmed by a Dental Society or a Court of Law.
It is also our intention to support any employee's resistance to paying a claim which we feel is not reasonable and customary as far as legal costs are concerned in connection with such resistance.
We will not assume any responsibility for a voluntary payment of a charge or for any agreement the employee may have with the dentist concerning his charge if it is in excess of reasonable and customary.

Mr. Calvin T. Rapson Page Two
In order for the Company to be able to effectively carry out this commitment, it will be necessary for employees to handle the payment of these claims by signing the AUTHORIZATION TO PAY portion of the appropriate claim form. Employees will be instructed when they ask for claim forms to sign the AUTHORIZATION TO PAY. In the event of such authorization, payment of the claim will be made directly to the dentist so that it will be possible for us to see that our commitment contained in this letter is properly carried out. The AUTHORIZATION TO PAY does not constitute an "assignment or alienation" and does not transfer to the dentist any enforceable right in, or to, any plan payment or portion thereof (except to the extent of payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the AUTHORIZATION TO PAY).

Candidates for work hardening may be referred through the Company Medical Department for participation in an approved work hardening program paid for by the Company. After evaluation of the employee's condition, the Company Medical Department will determine whether work hardening is appropriate, and if so, the program to be followed and its duration.

Mr. Calvin T. Rapson

8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit Ml 48214
During negotiations for the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Company and Union discussed guidelines for implementing the reduction of Weekly Indemnity (and Longterm Disability) benefits by Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB). The following guidelines will be used by the Company:
1.	As early as the thirteenth week of disability, depending upon the initial prognosis on the claim, an employee will be advised to apply for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB). The employee will be advised that effective with the payment for the twenty-sixth week of disability, Weekly Indemnity (and Long-Term Disability) benefit computations may presume eligibility for DIB. The employee will be advised that if his physician anticipates that the employee’s disability will not extend beyond twelve months, his physician should complete a statement indicating such a prognosis. Where such a statement is provided, a reduction of Weekly Indemnity (or Long-Term Disability) benefits, based on presumed eligibility for DIB,
404
LETTERS
Mr. Calvin T. Rapson

will not be instituted in the twenty-sixth week of disability. If during the ensuing period of disability it becomes apparent that either a) through deterioration of the employee’s condition, or b) a prolongation of the recovery period, that he will not return to work for a prolonged period, he will be requested to file for DIB.
2.	Upon receipt of an initial determination of disallowance of DIB, the employee will be advised to file a request for reconsideration. Failure to request such reconsideration may result in the suspension of an amount of Weekly Indemnity (or Long-Term Disability) benefit payments equal to the presumed amount of DIB until the employee provides satisfactory proof that such request has been filed.
3.	Upon receipt of a reconsideration determination of disallowance, the employee will be encouraged to file for a hearing before an administrative law judge of the Social Security Administration.
4.	In the event of a reconsideration determination denying DIB, and provided any subsequent review does not reverse such decision, the employee will not be required to repay any Weekly Indemnity (or Long-Term Disability) benefits otherwise payable, unless such denial of DIB resulted from the employee's refusal to accept vocational rehabilitation, Where such denial occurs, the employee is obligated to repay Weekly Indemnity (and Long-Term Disability) benefits in an amount equal to the amount of DIB to which he would otherwise have been entitled for the same period or periods of disability.
5.	Upon receipt of a notice of award of DIB, any overpayment of Weekly Indemnity (or Long-Term Disability) benefits caused by the retroactive award of DIB is to be repaid. The amount of overpayment will be based on the actual amount of such award.
405
LETTERS
Mr. Calvin T. Rapson Page Three
6.	In the event of a DIB award resulting from a reconsideration or hearing before an administrative law judge and if the employee was represented by his own attorney, then the amount of Weekly Indemnity (and Long-Term Disability) benefits overpayment will be reduced by an amount equal to any attorney fees associated with the award, provided that a) the employee makes such repayment within 30 days of the date the employee is notified of the amount to be repaid, and b) such reduction applies only to attorney fees associated with a successful appeal of a denial of DIB and includes only that portion of the attorney's fee associated with the period of time the employee was entitled to receive Weekly Indemnity (and Long-Term Disability) benefits, and c) such reduction for such attorney fees may not exceed 25 percent of the overpayment. Attorney fees for services prior to denial of the initial application for DIB will not reduce the amount of overpayment.
The Company may, with the employee's approval, represent the employee in an appeal. In this case the award will be endorsed to the Company to be applied toward the cost of overpayment of benefits and the cost of representing the employee. Any remaining money will be paid to the employee.
7.	In applying the provisions of Paragraph 6 above, benefit overpayments under the John Deere Pension Plan for Wage Employees will be included when determining the credit for attorney fees. However, any allowance against pension benefits will be payable from the assets of the John Deere unit rather than the John Deere Pension Trust.
406
LETTERS
Mr. Calvin T. Rapson Page Four
8.	An employee age 65 or older may be entitled to Old-Age Benefits as early as the first day of total disability. No reduction of Weekly Indemnity benefits shall be made until the employee provides evidence that he is receiving Old-Age Benefits. If requested, such evidence shall be provided by such employee.
9.	In the event an employee receives an initial determination of disallowance of DIB, all amounts of Weekly Indemnity benefits withheld will be paid to the employee unless the employee was denied DIB for failure to accept vocational rehabilitation or for not filing for DIB within the period of time specified by the Social Security Administration as necessary for DIB to commence at Wie first of the sixth month of disability.
10.	As part of the procedures for administering the DIB, the Company may require the employee to complete a reimbursement agreement and authorization form allowing the Social Security Administration to advise the Company of its determination.

During negotiations for the current Agreement, the parties discussed the problem of the lack of any meaningful rehabilitation system in the communities in which Deere operates manufacturing facilities. This is a problem in which both the Company and the Union have a substantial interest. The problem has created social and economic conditions which are not in the best interests of the employee, the Union, or the Company. First, an employee who remains unrehabilitated is not only unable to return to work, but in all likelihood is unable to resume the enjoyment of social pursuits outside his employment. Second, an employee who remains away from work beyond expected normal healing and recovery periods creates an unnecessary financial drain on benefit programs negotiated for the employee group at large; and because of extended absence, creates disruption in efficient factory operations.

In an attempt to address this problem, the Union and the Company agreed to work toward the establishment of a pilot Work Therapy Program in the Quad Cities.

The program would contain the traditional physical and occupational therapy equipment and would also include appropriate rest facilities for those employees who require periodic rest while engaged in work therapy.
The parties also discussed the necessity of involvement of the Quad City medical community in support of the aims of the program including items such as a health education program and physician referrals to the program.
Both the Company and the Union recognize that the establishment of a Work Therapy Program is a unique approach to a common problem. The parties agreed to establish a joint committee to mutually develop the details for the development of a successful Work Therapy Program during the term of this Agreement, and such committee shall be under the jurisdiction of the Joint Committee on Health Care.

6.	The independent formulary committee will meet at least quarterly to update the Formulary and consider provider requests.
The Company committed that after decisions are made to add to, delete from, or otherwise change the Formulary, the Union could raise any concerns in this area for consideration by the Joint Committee on Health Care. Moreover, the Company agreed that, if issues cannot be resolved in that forum, then the matter may be referred by the International Union directly to the APPEAL BOARD PROCEDURE set out in Appendix *1", ARTICLE VII APPEAL BOARD PROCEDURE for resolution by the Board, including, if necessary, the seventh member of the Board.

During the course of negotiations, the parties agreed to pay Supplemental Unemployment Benefits (SUB) from the general assets of the Company rather than through the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Trust Fund (Fund). The Parties recognize and agree that workforce demographics and projected benefit payments will render Fund assets insufficient to provide SUB benefits for the foreseeable future. Moreover, paying SUB directly will eliminate the administrative expenses associated with maintaining the Fund.
In order to implement this Agreement, the parties agree that the Fund will be dissolved and that Company contributions will no longer be made to the Fund. Assets currently in the Fund will be used for the exclusive purpose of paying benefits under the SUB Plan and to defray the reasonable administrative expenses of the Plan. The Company will continue to provide the required monthly report to the Union until Fund assets have been exhausted.
The parties further agree to modify the Trust Agreement consistent with the purpose of this letter.

During the course of negotiations for the 2003-2009 labor agreement, the parties discussed their concern about potential changes in state unemployment compensation laws which affect waiting week eligibility requirements.
The parties agreed that they would jointly support maintenance of the current state unemployment compensation waiting week criteria. Finally, the parties agreed that if changes to state unemployment compensation waiting week eligibility requirements occur, they would meet to discuss the issue and its impact on employees and would design ways to limit that impact.

During the course of negotiations, the parties agreed that workforce demographics and projected Legal Services Plan (Plan) premium payments would exhaust assets in the Legal Services Plan Trust (Trust).
The parties agree that the Plan will continue to provide services through 30 September 2009 and that the cost of providing services will be paid by the Company from assets currently in the Trust or paid by the Company.
The parties further agree to modify the Trust Agreement to provide for the termination of the Trust and the remittance of the assets to the Company for purposes of paying the premiums for legal services benefits as provided for in the Master Agreement.
