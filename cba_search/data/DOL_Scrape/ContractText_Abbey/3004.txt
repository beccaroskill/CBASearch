Working Conditions
10.1	PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT
The physical environment within which instruction occurs should contribute rather than interfere with the educational process. Within the financial limitations of the district and the facility limitations at each school, principals and staff will work together to provide the best possible environment for teaching and learning. The District's goal is to gain recognition from the Association that it often has limited options in resolving facility problems and has and will make good faith efforts to resolve facility issues. The mechanism for dealing with facility issues will be an EGEA advisory committee which will advise the District of problems and work with the District for resolution.
10.2	SAFETY
10.201	School facilities shall be available for safe use at least one week prior to the first day of required student attendance.

10.4	FACILITIES
10.401 The Board shall provide certificated personnel with:

purposes.
10.404 Adequate off-street parking facilities shall be provided and properly maintained

42
11.6

11.9	TRANSFER FOR UNIT MEMBERS DOWNSIZED—PILOT PROGRAM
11.901	Prior to posting the transfers, the process of downsizing will be explained to a school or department where there may be downsizing.

An EGEA Representative and an Human Resources administrator will cooperatively conduct these meetings. If there are more volunteers than needed, 11.307 will be followed.
11.902	If no volunteers are forthcoming, then the least senior person may choose to transfer prior to the completion of the first round or wait until the conclusion of the second transfer round before making his or her choices.

18.14	FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE
18.14.01 LENGTH OF LEAVE ENTITLEMENT: An eligible employee is entitled to a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period. Entitlement to leave for the birth or placement of a child for adoption or foster care expires 12 months after the birth or placement.
The 12-month period is measured backward from the date of leave use. All leave usage which qualified under the terms of the FMLA leave shall be counted towards the available 12 workweeks within a 12-month period, including intermittent and reduced workload leaves.
Reduced workload leave entitlement is calculated on cumulative hours of leave taken, up to the number of hours equivalent to 12 times the number of hours normally worked weekly.
18.14.02 LENGTH OF EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY: Any employee who has been employed for at least 12 months AND who has been in a paid status for at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the commencement of the leave is eligible for Family Medical Leave.
18.14.03 ELIGIBLE PURPOSES: Leaves for any of the following purposes qualify for Family Medical Leave.
1.	The birth of a child of an employee, and to care for a newborn;
2.	The placement of a child with an employee in connection with adoption or foster care of a child by an employee;
3.	Leave to care for a child, parent, or spouse who has a serious health condition; or
4.	Leave because of serious health condition that makes the employee unable to perform the essential functions of his/her position.
Both father and mother may take leave for the birth, or placement for adoption or foster care, of a child. In addition, an expectant mother may be entitled to leave prior to the birth of a child for prenatal care purposes if her condition makes her unable to work. Circumstances may also require leave prior to the actual placement of a child for adoption or foster care. For example, to attend
61
counseling session, appear in court or consult with his/her attorney in connection with the placement of a child.
If both the husband and wife are employed by the District, the aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both are entitled is limited to 12 workweeks during any one fiscal year for the birth or placement for adoption or foster care of the employees' child, or to care for a parent with a serious health condition. This limitation does not apply to leave taken by either spouse to care for the other who is seriously ill and unable to work, to care for a child with a serious health condition, or for his or her own serious illness.
Leave to care for a family member includes both physical and psychological care, including providing comfort and reassurance which would be beneficial to a seriously ill child or parent receiving inpatient care; or making arrangements for third-party care of a family member.
A "serious health condition" includes an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves:
1.	Any period if incapacity or treatment in connection with or in consequent to a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility.
2.	Any period of incapacity requiring absence from work, school or regular daily activities of more than three calendar days, that also involved continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider; or
3.	Continuing treatment by a health care provider for a chronic or long-term health condition that is incurable or so serious that, if not treated, would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three calendar days or for prenatal care.
4.	Continuing supervision by a health care provider when the parent, child, spouse or employee are severely ill but may not be receiving continuing active care or treatment (e.g., when suffering from Alzheimer's, late stages of cancer or a severe stroke).
"Continuing treatments" include:
a.	Two or more visits to a health care provider;
b.	Two or more treatment by a health care practitioner (e.g., physical therapist) on referral from, or under the direction, of a health care provider; or
c.	A single visit to a health care provider that results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider (e.g., medication therapy).
Intermittent leave or reduced work schedule leaves may be allowed when the absence required is not due to a condition that is incapacitating at that point in time (e.g., appointments for cancer treatments, physical therapy, prenatal care). When leave is taken because of the birth or the placement of a child for adoption
62
or foster care, intermittent leave or reduced workload schedule will not be approved if the intermittent leave or reduced workload schedule will adversely impact the office or department of the employee.
If an employee requests intermittent leave or reduced workload leave to care for a spouse, child, or parent or for the employee's own serious health condition, the employee may be required to temporarily transfer to an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that:
a.	has equivalent pay and benefits; and
b.	better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the regular position of the employee.
Voluntary or cosmetic treatments which are not medically necessary are not "serious health conditions," unless inpatient hospital care is required.
Absence because of an employee's substance abuse, without treatment, does not qualify for FMLA leave.
18.14.04 PAID/UNPAID LEAVE: Leave provided by FMLA in excess of available accrued paid leave shall be unpaid. Any available paid accrued leave shall be used prior to unpaid leave (e.g., vacation, comp time or sick leave) for the employee.
18.14.05 HEALTH AND DENTAL INSURANCE BENEFITS: Health care and dental benefits coverage shall be continued during the 12 weeks FMLA leave period under the same terms and conditions as applicable to all other employees. Upon expiration of FMLA leave entitlement, if additional unpaid leave is authorized, continuation of health care and dental benefits coverage shall be allowed with the employee paying all costs of coverage or as may be allowed in other applicable policies.
18.14.06 FAILURE TO RETURN FROM FMLA LEAVE: If an employee indicates his/her intent not to return from leave (including at the start of the leave), or if the employee fails to return from leave, paid health and dental coverage will cease unless the employee does not return because of the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would entitle the employee to FMLA leave, or other circumstances beyond the employee's control, (such as where an employee's spouse is unexpectedly transferred to a new job location, someone other than an immediate family member has a serious health condition which the employee needs to care for, or the employee is laid off while on leave. The employee's desire to stay with a family member even though the family member no longer requires the employee's care, or a mother's decision to stay home with a newborn child and not return to work, do not qualify as "other circumstances beyond the employee's control."
Except as provided above, if an employee fails to return after expiration for eligibility for FMLA leave, the employee shall pay the full cost of coverage for health and dental benefits during the entire period of unpaid FMLA leave. Any amounts due under this section may be deducted from any sums due the employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation pay, etc.). Failure to reimburse the
63
District for the cost of coverage during the period of the unpaid leave shall result in termination of coverage.
If an employee is unable to return to work because of the continuation, recurrence or onset of a serious health condition, the employee shall provide medical certification of such claim. The certification shall be issued by the health care provider of the employee or by health care provider of the employee's child, spouse or parent if the employee is unable to return to work because of the need to take care of one of these individuals. The certification shall indicate that the employee is prevented from performing the functions of the position or is needed to care for the family member on the date the leave expired. If a requested certification is not provided within 30 days, the cost of coverage provided during the period of unpaid FMLA leave shall be due and payable.
18.14.07 EMPLOYEE STATUS WHILE ON LEAVE: FMLA leave does not constitute a break in service for purposes of longevity and/or seniority.
Seniority shall not be earned for any period of time on unpaid leave. Employees returning from leave shall return with no less seniority for purposes of layoff, recall, vacation accrual or other seniority.
18.14.08 MEDICAL CERTIFICATION/RECERTIFICATION: Medical certification from the health care provider of the individual requiring care shall be provided initially upon request for FMLA leave. The certification shall indicate the estimated duration of the need for leave. Periodic updates or recertification may be required upon expiration of the period of leave originally estimated or every 30 days, if requested by the Human Resources Department.
The employer may, at its own expense, require the eligible employee obtain the opinion of a second health care provider designated or approved by the employer. When the second opinion differs from the first, the employer may require, at its own expense, that the employee obtain the opinion of a third health care provider designated and approved jointly by the employer and employee. The opinion of the third health care provider shall be considered final and binding on the employer and employee.
If leave is foreseeable, medical certification must be provided within fifteen days (15) after receipt of the employee's request for leave. If the employee fails to provide certification, the leave may be denied until certification is provided. If the leave is not foreseeable, the certification shall be provided within fifteen days (15), or as soon as is practicable under the circumstances. Failure to provide certification within a reasonable time under the pertinent circumstances may result in denial of continuation of the leave.
18.14.09 ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIRED: If the event necessitating the leave becomes known to the employee more than 30 calendar days prior to the need for a leave, the employee shall provide notice as soon as he/she learns of the need for a leave -- at a minimum, 30 days written, advance notice.
If the event necessitating the leave becomes known to the employee less than 30 calendar days prior to the employee's need for a leave, the employee shall
64
provide as much advance notice as possible, and, at a minimum, written notice no more than five working days from learning of the need for the leave.
If the need for a family care leave is foreseeable due to a planned medical treatment or planned supervision of a child, parent or spouse with a serious health condition, the employee shall provide reasonable advance notice of the need for the leave and consult with the supervisor regarding the scheduling of the treatment or supervision so as to minimize disruptions to the school/department. Any such scheduling shall be subject to the approval of the health care provider of the family member.
Prior to granting a leave under this policy, medical certification as identified above, may be required.
18.14.10 REINSTATEMENT UPON RETURN FROM LEAVE: Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee shall be restored to the position held when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment, provided the employee is able to perform the essential duties of the position.
If FMLA leave was due to the employee's own serious health condition, prior to returning to work, the employee shall provide a certification from the health care provider that the employee is able to resume the essential duties of the position.
18.14.11 REMEDIES FOR EMPLOYER VIOLATION OF THE ACT: If an employee's rights under the FMLA have been violated, the employee may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor, the Fair Employment and Housing Commission, or file a private lawsuit within two years after the last action which the employee contends was in violation of the Act, or three years if the violation was willful.
18.15	FOREIGN EDUCATIONAL EMPLOYMENT LEAVE
18.1501	Unit members may be granted an unpaid leave for not less than (1) full school year nor more than three (3 years for the purpose of accepting full-time foreign educational employment or Peace Corps employment. Request for such leave shall be submitted by April 15 of any year.

66
b.	"Eligible leave credits" means vacation leave and sick leave accrued to the donating employee.
c.	Eligible leave credits may be donated to an employee for a catastrophic illness or injury if all of the following requirements are met:

Annual Comparability Study
19.1	SELECTION OF DISTRICTS
19.101	Study will be conducted no later than December of each year, and will be based on fifteen (15) districts determined in the following manner:
19.102	Based on the most recent statistics available from the SCOE's Bureau of Local Assistance, a list of unified districts will be chosen with ADA ranging 1500 above that of Elk Grove to 1500 below Elk Grove.
19.103	The districts so selected will be arranged in order from highest base revenue limit to lowest base revenue limit per ADA.
19.104	The eight (8) districts, in succession, which are higher (in base revenue limit) and the seven (7), in succession, which are lower (in base revenue limit) will comprise the fifteen (15) comparison districts.
19.105	The comparison will employ schedules from all districts, including Elk Grove, for the previous fiscal year in which the study is conducted.
19.106	The comparison group may also include, should the District so elect, those school districts within the immediate geographical proximity.
19.2	CONTENT OF STUDY
19.201	Minimum regularly scheduled salary placement in each column.
19.202	The 7th experience step in each column including Master's and Tenure bonuses.
19.203	Maximum salary in each column, including Master's and Tenure bonuses and excluding Doctorate and longevity bonuses with notation of any districts which do not pay these bonuses.
19.204	Maximum salary including all earnable bonuses.
19.205	Types of and maximum amounts paid per employee for contracted fringe benefits (not to include STRS and other mandated costs).
19.206	Current fiscal year salary settlements for the comparison districts will be listed in the appendix of the study. Elk Grove will not be included as part of the statistical base. Those comparison districts which have not settled will have listed the most current negotiated position of the district and the represented organization (listed as "offer" and "request").
69
19.3
CONDUCT OF STUDY
19.301	The study will be conducted jointly by the association and the district. Results will be approved by the parties within fifteen (15) working days of completion of the study.

ARTICLE 20
Compensation
20.1	COMPENSATION
20.101	The District agrees to increase the salary schedule by the percentage amount of the funded COLA for 1995-96 less .5% which will be allocated to repay the advance received for salary compression in 1994-95. (Salary Schedule: Appendix B)
20.102	No differential shall exist in rates of compensation except as provided elsewhere in this agreement.
20.103	The advanced percentage will be repaid to the unit salary schedules in 1997-98 by increasing the salary schedules by the funded COLA for 1997-98 plus .5%.
20.104	In 1999-2001, the salary schedule shall be increased by the amount of the funded COLA for 1999-2001.
20.105	Funded COLA is the amount which the District actually receives in increased revenue limit per ADA. It is not intended to include funds already received by the District in some other category. In the event that there is a dispute concerning the percentage, the District and EGEA agree that Paul Goldfinger of School Services, Inc. shall be asked to designate a number for funded COLA which shall resolve the controversy. If he is not available, then the District and EGEA will select a respected financial person to designate "funded COLA."
20.105.1 Class Size Reduction in Grades K-3. The District and EGEA acknowledge the desirability of lower class sizes and want to participate in the State incentive program at grades Kindergarten through third grade (as allowed by State Law). The District agrees to assume the immediate costs for participating in the program. However, in 1998-99, EGEA agrees to reduce the funded COLA to be applied to the salary schedule by .75% to share in the cost of class size and H Step implementation. EGEA agrees to deduct a total of 1.5 percent from the funded COLA over three years (1998-1999, 1999-2000, and 2000-2001) if required to implement these programs. The intent of this agreement is to reconsider the required proportion of participation in the funding process for class size reduction should there be a substantive modification of the state’s funding. In the event there is no funded COLA or a COLA of less than the .75%, the parties agree to meet and negotiate an alternative resolution.
The actual additional amount required to fund EGEA’s share will be driven by the Elk Grove Unified School District Budget Department’s Estimated Impact of Class Size Reduction and H Step
71
Implementation generated on 9/17/96 and its successor reports. In particular, page two’s Total Uses will serve to guide the determination. The District and EGEA recognize that ‘99-’00 and ‘00-’01 cannot currently be agreed, but this provision shall be determined to be an agreement one year at a time within the constraints of the duration provisions of EERA.
20.105.2 The District and EGEA acknowledge that "non-twenty-to-one" grade
levels need additional resources to continue learning gains established in the primary grades. The District agrees to address the issue by analyzing ways in which categorical funds previously targeted (or available if not targeted) for primary may be realigned to meet the needs of "non-twenty-to-one" teachers. "Non-twenty-to-one" teachers have identified a number of areas in which priorities need to be met--including but not limited to instructional assistant time designed to lower student to adult ratios. Of primary interest is aide time. The District and EGEA encourage sites to allocate resources to "non-twenty-to-one" grade levels from the funding provided sites in one-time monies, traditional general fund site allocations, categorical funds, and other appropriate resources.
20.105.3 The District and EGEA agree to set as a mutual goal class size
reduction in grades four through six. Both facilities and funding pose hurdles to be overcome. As a component of this goal, it is understood that preparation time delivery will be modified to either before or after the student day.
20.106
20.107
The District agrees to share the lottery income in accordance with past practices.
The lottery distribution system will be modified as necessary to comply with the requirements of the initiative for increased dollars to be spent for instructional materials and equipment.
The 1999-2001 lottery bonuses will be a percentage bonus off the salary schedule to be established on monies available to the Elk Grove Education Association unit. Each unit member will receive a percentage bonus based on their placement on the 1999-2000 negotiated salary schedule. It is further understood that unit members under contract for less than 45 days will not be entitled to a lottery bonus. Unit members working in excess of 45 days but less than the 184 contracted days (traditional) and 181 (year-round) will receive a proportionate lottery bonus based on their salary schedule placement. This understanding excludes all additional responsibilities, i.e., extended year, adjunct duties, hourly pay, Mentor Teacher stipend, etc.
Pursuant to the Jack O’Connell Beginning Teacher Salary Program, there shall be
a minimum teacher salary step created for the 1999-2000 school year effective July 1, 1999. Only teachers who qualify with appropriate credentials may be placed on this step. Teachers appropriately on this step will remain only so long as the step exceeds that of the appropriate regular salary schedule step.

20.604	Prior approval from the site level administrator shall be obtained for all units which apply to advancement.
20.605	No more than twelve (12) semester units during one school year may be taken without written approval of the site level administrator.
20.606	College/university units and in-service units shall be treated equally but shall not be duplicated for advancement. One (1) semester unit will be credited for each fifteen (15) hours of in-service participation.
20.607	Semester units for travel, approved by the site level administrator, will be credited at six (6) semester units for one (1) year, three (3) semester units for one-half year, two (2) semester units for a minimum of six (6) weeks and one (1) semester unit for less than six (6) weeks.

20.609	G Step (five percent (5%) above F Step) advancement requires fifteen (15) units earned after September 1, 1985. Unit members shall be eligible for placement on this step beginning July 1, 1987. Units taken must be approved according to current District practice and further the instructional goals of the District and model curriculum standards as outlined by the Board of Education. Entering teachers may not be placed on Column G until and unless they have earned that placement after employment in the District. All educational advancement rules in 20.601 - 20.608 apply.
20.610	The District and EGEA agree to modify the structure of approved units for movement across the salary schedule effective July 1, 1995. Those teachers who have already taken units under the former system will be grandpersoned under the old system. The new system will allow the District to designate six of the fifteen required units to be taken from an approved list for Columns B through F. The list shall be correlated with priorities for learning within the Elk Grove Unified School District including, but not limited to, technology, BCLAD, and reading. A Staff Development Committee shall be organized with balanced representation for the purpose of establishing an H Step (or exploring multiple options under the general umbrella of an "H Step"). The Committee will also deal with other issues related to the ongoing learning needs of Elk Grove unit members. It is intended that the Committee will assist the District in linking the learning needs of Elk Grove teachers to the curricular needs of the Elk Grove students.
74
20.611
The District and EGEA have previously agreed to form a committee for the purpose of establishing an H Step. EGEA and the District’s interest in establishing an H Step is to allow for continued professional growth in high priority areas of the District’s curricular focus for those employees who are otherwise not encouraged to continue professional development by the nature of the salary schedule. H Step shall be two percent (2%). See 20.105.1 for the funding agreement. It remains EGEA’s goal to increase H Step to 3.3%.
20.611.1	H Step will require 150 hours to complete.
20.611.2	H Step will be renewable; i.e. hours accumulated for H Step
must be renewed every 5 years. EGEA and the District are aware of Education Code 45028’s requirement for a salary schedule based upon uniform allowance for years of training and years of experience. It is the intent of the parties to modify that requirement for the purposes of H Step. However, each teacher will be uniformly treated in regard to H Step’s applicability and H Step hours. The specific purpose for the requirement to renew the training hours is continuing commitment to achieving District goals after a unit member has arrived at the top of the salary schedule.
20.611.3	H Step course work must be taken from a District approved list.
20.611.4	Staff who are on G Step may start accumulating H Step hours in

20.611.9	H Step credit may be earned in areas not on the list on a case-by-case basis.
20.611.10	H Step will begin July 1, 1998.
75
20.7

20.702	Those unit members working less than a full contract (100%) for less than 75% of the work days in a year, will be entitled to an experience step when the total of their assignment (accumulated over the necessary years) equals 100%. For example, when unit members teach 40%, they will be entitled to an experience credit of one year at the beginning of the fourth year of their employment. If there is credit accumulated beyond 100%, it will be banked.
1.	Experience credit on the salary schedule for those working fewer than seventy-five percent (75%) of the days of a year will occur the July 1 following when the person accumulates more than seventy-five percent of a complete assignment.

20.803	Credit for prior experience will be determined by the Human Resources Department guided by the following criteria:
a.	Prior teaching experience shall have required a teaching credential.
b.	A "year is defined as 75% of the contract or calendar or requested year. Fractional parts of one (1) year may not be combined to meet the percentage requirements.

Reimbursement for approved job-related travel will be at the per mile rate established by IRS. Home to work site travel is not reimbursable. Fixed travel allowances for those employees whose job related travel is extensive shall be approved by the Business Office. Such allowance shall be reviewed annually and adjusted when necessary.
20.12	TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT FOR FEDERAL PROJECTS
20.1201 Salary and Payment. Unit members employed in federal programs which do not correspond with the teaching year will be paid a salary equivalent to the salary they would receive if they were a regular teacher in the district with the salary being computed on a per diem basis for the period in which the project is financed by the federal government. This per diem rate will be determined by dividing the salary schedule placement by the number of days in the current

ARTICLE 21
Additional Compensation
21.1	CRITERIA
21.101 It is the purpose of the Elk Grove Unified School District to provide compensation over and above contract salaries for certificated teaching employees who accept substantial and continuing extra responsibilities.

22.802.	3 Those unit members who can provide proof of alternative medical coverage may waive out of medical benefits. Those so electing will receive through the IRC 125 a cash option payment. The District and EGEA agree to increase, on a trial basis, the amount paid to those waiving health benefits to $650 yearly. It is intended that the District will determine whether the increase in waiver amount will yield additional savings to the District prior to the plan year for 1996-97. Should there not be savings over the current amount, the District may, as its sole option, determine that the waiver amount return to not less than $500. Those electing to waive out of dental and vision will receive a cash option payment of $150 maximum yearly.

22.802.	4 The District will create a fund for medical reimbursement of the copays for retired employees electing Kaiser funded with $240 per eligible retiree. Retiree may be reimbursed for copay up to $240 annually. After all copay expenses have been received, a retiree will be paid up to $240 for incurred expenses. That amount left over from retirees not using the entire $240 will be used to pay the claims of those which exceed $240 on a prorated basis. The retiree copay reimbursement dollars are increased to match the increased copay amounts.
22.802.	5 Life insurance is changed from a $20,000 decreasing term and a $10,000 level term policy to one $50,000 level term insurance policy for active employees.
22.803	The District and EGEA agree to a continuation of the current system of paying for health benefits for 1995-96, 1996-97, and 1997-98 except as set out below. Effective July 1, 1995, eligible employees will make a contribution to their current health care benefit package of $24.00 tenthly.
22.804	The District and EGEA agree to augment the dental benefit program to allow for the option of a Dental PPO. It is intended that the PPO will offer dentists available within the Elk Grove and Sacramento area who have agreed in advance to accept reduced fees for listed dental services. Those employees who elect the Dental PPO will have the above contribution ($24.00) waived for the duration of this agreement.
22.805	The current dental benefit program will have orthodontia increased from 50% of the cost to a maximum of $1500 to 50% of the cost to a maximum of $2500 for active employee health packages. The annual dental cap is increased from $1500 to $2000 for both active and retiree health packages.
22.806	Hearing Aide coverage is added to both the active and retiree health packages.
22.807	The District also agrees to substitute an Employee Assistance Plan for employees
in place of the current plan. The plan is intended to assist employees needing personal or family help seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day.
22.808	The District and EGEA agree to join the other bargaining units in the creation of the Elk Grove Benefits Employee Retirement Trust (EGBERT). The intent of all the bargaining units is to preserve health care benefits at retirement. The EGBERT will assume the responsibility for the payment of retiree health benefits for those retiring effective July 1, 2000. During the interim time frame, the District will assume the responsibility for the payment of retiree health benefits for those retiring prior to July 1, 2000, will continue the payments for existing retirees as set out in current agreements, and will make the agreed upon contribution to the trust ($48.00 tenthly for each benefit qualified unit member).
22.809	The member’s contribution will be increased to $26.00 tenthly for the 1999-2000 school year and will increase by $1.00 tenthly per year for the following four years (up to $30.00 tenthly.) The district will continue to match the employees contributions.
85
22.8010	It is intended that the EGBERT board will be made up of one representative from AFSCME, one from ATU, one from EGUSD MGT, one from EGEA, one from PSWA, and two from current retirees (one certificated and one classified). It will be the continuing responsibility of the EGBERT to determine benefits and recommend contribution levels. The EGBERT and the Elk Grove Exclusive Representatives agree to use a combined negotiating team drawn from all of the participating District exclusive representatives to negotiate those contributions with the District. [The retirement health benefits trust component of the proposal is contingent upon the District reaching agreements with the other three bargaining units with identical terms.]

While it is recognized that Adult Education personnel may be concurrently employed in other district programs including but not limited to K-12, it is the intention of the parties that the employment relationship described in this Article, and the rights that flow therefrom, are separate and distinct from the rights which may accrue to the individual from other employment in the District. If there is any conflict between the terms of this Article and the terms of other provisions of the Agreement as they apply to Adult and continuing education, this article shall prevail.
24.3	AGREEMENT AND RECOGNITION
24.3.1	All personnel in adult education programs shall be employed under contracts appended to this agreement. These contracts shall specify the duration of the employment, and shall terminate on or before June 30 of the year in which they are issued. If the duration of the contract is to extend beyond June 30, a second contract shall be issued to cover the balance of the employment period.
24.3.2	The contract term for a person hired to complete the term(s) of employment of another person shall be for the duration of the original term(s). All contracts of employment shall be terminable at any time prior to expiration, but only for lack of funds, elimination or reductions of the educational offering, insufficient enrollment or attendance, unsatisfactory performance, or any of the causes listed in Education Code § 44932 et. seq.
24.4	DEFINITIONS
24.4.1	Unit member(s) covers those persons who are, by virtue of being assigned for six (6) or more hours per week, included within the bargaining unit.
100
24.4.2	For purposes of the grievance procedure, "Day" shall be defined by the Adult Education schedule. 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.11 shall be applicable from Article 2. Definitions.
24.5	CLASS SIZE
Class size shall not exceed the room occupancy/seating requirements of applicable fire codes. Classes are subject to cancellation if they fall below fifteen (15).
24.5.1	Except as indicated by tenure laws or as indicated below, adult school unit members shall be employed on an hourly, as-needed basis. For employees working and entitled to fewer than 19.2 hours whose class(es) have attendance of ten (10) or more at the class-size, minimum-evaluation point, the class will be continued for the duration of the term so long as the attendance does not drop lower than seven (7).
24.5.2	If the class is subsequently offered pursuant to the assignment pattern in 24.15.2 and taught by the same unit member, the class must have fifteen (15) or more to be continued for the duration of the term.
24.5.3	For unit members with 19.2 or more hours whose class has an attendance of 10 or more at the class-size, minimum-evaluation point, the class will be continued through its term. If the class does not meet the minimum of ten (10), paragraph 24.5.4 applies.
24.5.4	If the class is subsequently offered to the same permanent unit member, the class must have fifteen or more students to be continued. If not, the unit member will be assigned within the scope of his or her credential to a position held by the least senior employee/unit member for the number of class hours canceled. The displaced employee/unit member shall not have bumping rights.
24.5.5	Class-size minimums will be reviewed on the fourth meeting of that class when they meet three (3) or more times per week and on the second class when they meet two (2) or less times per week. In the event that a class is to be closed at the above evaluation point(s), the director of the adult and continuing education program or a designee will personally inform any instructor of the decision to close the class and the date/time of the final class meeting. A formal written notification will be given to the instructor.
24.5.6	Classes which do not meet the minimum class size requirements described above may be continued at the discretion of Adult Education based upon the following criteria:
24.5.6.1	The class is part of a "start-up" or "venture" program.
24.5.6.2	The class is part of a high school diploma program for credit.
24.5.6.3	The class is fee-based and financially self-supporting.
24.5.6.4	The class is legally mandated.
101
24.5.6.5	The class is long-standing and has traditionally met a specific community need.
24.5.6.6	Other classes that do not meet the above criteria may be continued by mutual agreement of EGEA and Adult Education (in reference to on-going classes that have no specific start or stop date).
24.5.7	If an individual unit member believes that a particular class size is inappropriate, that unit member may refer the issue to the Adult Education Administration for discussion with the Faculty Advisory Council.
24.6	EVALUATION PROCEDURE
24.6.1	The District retains sole responsibility for the evaluation and assessment of performance of each adult school unit member, subject only to the following procedural requirements. Should an adult school unit member believe an evaluation to be derogatory, the unit member will be given an opportunity to comment thereon as provided for by law. Accordingly, no grievance arising under this Article shall challenge the substantive objectives, standards, or criteria determined by the District, nor shall the grievance contest the judgment of the evaluator; any grievance shall be limited to a claim that the following procedures have been violated.
24.6.2	Evaluation of the performances of adult school unit members shall be made as needed, at least once every semester for probationary personnel, and at least once every other year for unit members with permanent status. Should a teacher be employed after the midpoint of the first semester of a school year, evaluation for that semester shall be at the option of the principal.
24.6.3	Adult school unit members with permanent status may be evaluated yearly or more often if the District or the evaluator deems it appropriate. Reasons for evaluating permanent personnel more often than the minimum required could include but would not be limited to situations such as a new assignment; unsatisfactory previous evaluations; the assignment of a new evaluator; or a need to improve the instructional program.
24.6.4	Adult school unit members must comply with the standards contained in the evaluation forms which are contained in the Adult School Appendix.
24.6.5	Classroom observations may be, but shall not be required to be, arranged by the evaluator and the adult school unit member in advance of an observation. Evaluations need not be based solely upon formal classroom observations.
24.6.6	Previous to the completion of the summary evaluation form, at least one observation and conference should be held. The Evaluation Report may be presented in writing. An adult school unit member may request a conference to discuss its conclusions.
24.6.7	The evaluator shall not base his/her evaluation on the quality of an adult school unit member's classroom instructional program on information not collected
102
through a means reasonably calculated to achieve accuracy. Negative evaluation of performance shall not be predicated upon information or material of derogatory nature that has been received by the evaluator from sources such as other teachers, parents, and citizens unless the facts have been verified by the evaluator and discussed with the unit members. Student evaluations will be a factor in formulating the overall evaluation of a unit member.
24.7	LEAVES
24.7.1	All other leaves in Article 18 except for Sabbatical Leave, Sick Leave, Catastrophic Leave shall be granted and implemented according to the procedures in Article 18.

24.8.6	The Human Resources Department shall notify the applicant of the status of the transfer, increase in hours, increase in hours due to expansion of any program, or other employment opportunities including positions that are new or vacant.
24.8.7	Transfers by the District shall be based on the following criteria: preference of the employee; length and quality of employee service in the District; experience and teaching background; affirmative action goals and needs of the District; and preference of AEA.
103
24.8.8	Seniority shall be determined by hiring within the Adult Education program as a regular employee.
24.8.9	If a unit member is transferred involuntarily due to enrollment shifts and/or decline, the unit member shall be offered the first opportunity to return to the unit member's previous site if a subsequent vacancy develops at that site from which the employee had been involuntarily transferred.
24.8.10	Those to be involuntarily transferred may indicate a preference of assignments to the Human Resources Department and AEA.

A formal, written notification will be given to the instructor one week prior to the date/time of the termination of the class.
24.9.1.2	The hourly rate of pay shall be set forth in the Adult Education Appendix. Advancement in pay due to experience shall be contingent upon the unit member having provided service (actively working) to the District as an adult school teacher for not less than twenty-seven (27) weeks during the preceding year. Verification of Units must be made no later than October 1 of the year in which unit member anticipates movement between columns. Units taken must be approved in advance by the Staff Development/Human Resources Department based upon the criterion that the teaching performance of the unit member will be enhanced either in subject matter or technique.
24.9.2	The substitute rate shall be based on the lowest rate of pay on the schedule for all new substitutes. Any existing member shall be paid their current wage for substituting.
24.9.2.1	A unit member who wants to substitute will fill out the days and hours of availability and file the form with AEA for inclusion on the substitute list.

Qualification for benefits cannot combine hours worked between regular day school employment, substituting, and adult school employment in any capacity.
24.10.3	All unit members receiving fringe benefits may continue to receive fringe benefits for that benefit year by contributing the differential percentage that their assignment is to qualifying time, i.e., if the unit member were assigned twenty (20) hours and during the benefit year was reduced to sixteen (16) hours, then the unit member could retain benefits by contributing twenty-five percent (25%) of the costs. This right is conditioned upon continuing employment with Adult Education.

24.14.1.2	The seniority of all non-tenured personnel teaching the course(s) and assigned to the time-reporting site shall be reviewed.
a.	Seniority is measured by the number of consecutive, uninterrupted years of satisfactory service. Time spent on approved unpaid leaves of absence does not count as time served but does not constitute an interruption of the "consecutive' service requirement.

c.	Service in both Adult Education and continuing education programs (categorical and general fund) shall apply.
24.14.1.3	The employee qualified according to the criteria of 24.15.l.2 with the least seniority shall be released first unless the site administrator reasonably determines that the person has needed instructional skills or qualifications, not possessed by an employee with greater seniority. A seniority list shall be maintained by the Human Resources Department, provided to impacted employees and EGEA prior to layoff pursuant to this Article. EGEA shall be kept informed on the requirements for layoff during regularly-scheduled
106
consultation meetings. It is intended that any unit member who is credentialed and competent to perform continuing services will be retained over more junior employees even if the continued service is outside of the current assignment.
a.	The employee shall be provided notice of layoff no less than ten calendar days prior to its effective date and an opportunity to have a hearing on the matter before the Administrator of Personnel if a hearing is demanded within five (5) days of notice.

24.15	STAFFING
24.15.1	Prior to the beginning of a term, the AEA shall prepare a list of courses to be offered at that site by program.

24.15.1.2	The AEA shall maintain eligibility lists of qualified employees composed of those employees currently servicing a site by credential, seniority, past assignments, and bilingual ability. "Qualified" as used in this sub-section, shall mean that the applicant has taught the same course or closely related course in the same subject, possesses the requisite credential, and possesses the needed instructional skills or qualifications as stated on the job posting. The AEA shall select from among the qualified applicants at the site to fill each position.
24.15.2	The first priority for assignment shall be the filling of positions by tenured staff who are guaranteed a number of hours. The second priority for assignment shall be maximizing the assignment of those who are qualified for benefits. The third priority for assignment shall be maintaining the current ratio of tenured to nontenured positions. The fourth priority for assignment shall be enhancing the hours of those staff who have been rated above satisfactory in their evaluations. The fifth priority will be filling positions from the eligibility lists maintained by site administrators.
24.15.2.1	No unit member shall be entitled to, nor may he or she gain a right to a continuing assignment of more than full-time.
107
24.15.3	All remaining new or vacant part-time positions or courses in Adult Education funded programs shall be posted at the applicable time, reporting site, and each division thereof by June 1 for year round programs, and August 1 for Adult Education Programs and by January 5. The posting shall identify the subject(s), number of hours per week, class schedule and time(s), certification required, any special skills and qualifications, and the deadline for applications.
24.15.3.1	These vacancies shall be filled by paper screening applications based upon the priorities in 32.15.2 and interviewing no fewer than the top four candidates.
24.15.4	Remaining unfilled positions shall be posted at the District Office and at all Adult Education sites by June 15 for year round programs, August 15 for traditional programs, and January 15. To apply for such positions a person must either qualify as provided above or possess other appropriate training and experience needed for the position, possess the requisite credential, and possess the instructional skills or qualifications as stated in the job posting. The AEA shall select from among the applicants.
24.15.5	Positions coming available after the beginning of the term may be filled at the discretion of the AEA.
24.15.6	Those to be involuntarily transferred may indicate a preference of assignments to the AEA.
24.15.7	Those to be involuntarily transferred shall, upon written request, have a written reason for the impending transfer from AEA.
24.15.8	Adult Education agrees to make a good faith effort to consider part-time teachers preference in making assignments. When possible, employees will be notified of their assignment fifteen (15) calendar days before the beginning of each semester. Employees may indicate a preference for a change of assignment by notifying the AEA in writing forty-five (45) days before the beginning of the next semester.
24.16	RELEASE OF PERSONNEL FOR UNSATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE
24.16.1	Current personnel in either Adult Education or categorically funded positions do not have an implied right to employment beyond their assigned term except as required by the Education Code. However, if they are not to be renewed due to dissatisfaction with the quality of their services, they shall be evaluated in accordance with the requirements of this article.
24.16.1.1	Unit members released for unsatisfactory performance must have been preceded by compliance with the evaluation provisions of this Article.
