1.	Prior to the employment of such workman, the Employer shall first contact the Union advising them of the type of equipment for which the employee is to be dispatched. If the Employer and the Union have met and it is determined the job warrants the necessity of such workman, he shall then be dispatched to the Employer but shall only operate the piece of equipment for which he was dispatched. In the event the Employer violates the provisions set forth in Paragraphs 1,2,3 and 4 of this Article, then he shall lose the privilege of this Article for a period of six (6) months.

3.	In the event the workman shall, as referred to above, designate that such fringe benefit contributions be made by the Contractor to trusts other than those specified by this Agreement, such contributions shall be made by the Contractor in the amounts specified from time-to-time by the applicable bargaining agreements providing for such other trusts and for the contributions thereto, and shall be made at the time and in the manner specified by such other trusts or the Trustees thereof.

Such workman who leaves the employ of the Contractor shall not gain "A" Status on the Union's referral lists for a period of two and one-half (214) years following his original referral and may register with the Union only in the classification of work he performs for the Contractor to whom he was originally referred.
5.	No such workman shall be employed to the extent that would deprive a full-time Operating Engineer or Apprentice Operating Engineer from employment with the Contractor. No such workman shall be allowed to perform any work covered by this Agreement on a job or with a company which does not meet the requirements for Apprenticeship ratio or EEOC rules and requirements.
J.	Each Employer who employs over five (5) Operating Engineers on any one (1) job
-37-
ARTICLE II. Sec.J/K
or project covered by this Agreement or, if there are not over five (5) Operating Engineers on any one (1) job or project, who employs eleven (11) Operating Engineers on all company jobs or projects covered by this Agreement, shall have a minimum of one (1) Apprentice in his employ, if available. Thereafter, he shall include an additional Apprentice in each six (6) Operating Engineers employed after the first six (6) on any job or project covered by this Agreement or in each twelve (12) Operating Engineers employed after the first fifteen (15) on all company jobs or projects covered by this Agreement. Preferred workmen and nonworking Foremen will not be considered in determining the number of Operating Engineers employed for the purposes of this section.
K.	The Joint Apprenticeship Committee established by the parties to this Agreement shall have the responsibility for establishing a referral procedure for Apprentices in conformance with the training standards.

ARTICLE III, Sec. A/B
ARTICLE III
Strikes, Lockouts, Jurisdictional Disputes
A.	It is agreed by the parties hereto that all grievances or disputes arising between them over the interpretations or applications of the terms of this Agreement shall be settled by the procedure set forth in Article V hereof. During the term of this Agreement, the Union shall not call or engage in, sanction or assist in a strike against, or any slowdown or stoppage of the work of the Contractor, unless specifically noted in this Article. The employees will perform the services for the Contractor under work described herein when required by said Contractor to do so, and during the term of this Agreement, the Contractor shall not call or engage in, sanction or assist in a lockout of the employees on work described herein.
B.	If work on a project is declared to be unfair by a Building and Construction Trades Council and/or the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local Union No. 12, and work thereon is stopped for that reason, the Union shall not be deemed to have vio
-40-
ARTICLE III, Sec. B/C
lated this Agreement if during the period of said work stoppage, the members of the Union refuse to cross a primary picket line.
C.	The Union recognizes the construction industries for the settlement of jurisdiction disputes, known as the plan, and will utilize that plan in the first instance in an honest attempt to resolve any dispute that may arise. The parties signed to this Agreement recognize, however, that some Contractors and some Building Trades Unions are not "stipulated" to the plan which creates a major problem in the industry. To alleviate that problem, Local 12 submits that all classifications contained in this Agreement be recognized as the work of the Operating Engineers and shall be assigned accordingly. The Union also recognizes that other Building Trades Unions claim certain equipment that has been recognized as the work of the Operating Engineers for many years but assign the operation of said equipment in violation of past practices, agreements of record and previous assignments of the work.
If an Employer or its Subcontractor makes an assignment that is obviously a misas
-41-
ARTICLE III, Sec. C/D
signment to cause discord on the job or completely ignore Local 12's rightful jurisdiction, then the Union shall notify the Contractor by Certified Mail that a jurisdictional dispute exists and they are in violation of the Agreement. If the Contractor does not rectify said dispute in accordance with the provisions noted herein, the Union shall not be in violation of the Agreement if services are withheld. It is also recognized that it is prevalent in the industry to engage the services of a Subcontractor to perform certain job functions on the project. In the event a Subcontractor is used, all provisions of this Article shall apply.
In the event the Contractor is in doubt as to the proper assignment, he shall consult the various jurisdictional agreements between the trades and absent the clarification of the dispute the contractor and/or subcontractor shall make the assignment based on the classification contained in the Agreement.
D.	The Union pledges to work very diligently with the employer to avoid any misunderstanding that may occur with the interpretation of this Article.
-42-
ARTICLE III, Sec. E/F
E.	Jurisdictional disputes which cannot be resolved at the local level shall then be referred to the International Unions involved for determination and the work shall proceed as assigned by the Contractor until such determination by the International Unions has been confirmed to the disputing Unions and the Contractors.
F.	In the event of the failure of settlement under the paragraphs above, the Union and the Contractors, except the Teamsters, agree to be bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement establishing procedure for the resolution of jurisdictional disputes in the Construction Industry known as "The Plan for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Disputes in the Construction Industry". In particular, the undersigned agrees to abide by those provisions of the plan requiring compliance with the decisions and awards of the Administrator, Arbitrators or National Arbitration panels established under the plan, and to fulfill the obligations of the Employer set forth in this Agreement.
This plan shall run for the term of this Agreement and shall continue in effect for each year thereafter unless specifically ter
-43-
ARTICLE III, Sec. F/G - ARTICLE IV, Sec. A
minated, effective upon the anniversary date of said Agreement, in accordance with the notice provisions contained in this Agreement. In the event the Impartial Jurisdictional Dispute Board for the Construction Industry ceases to function, the provisions of Article XVIII, General Savings Clause, will apply.
G Nothing contained in this Agreement or any part thereof, or in this Article III, or any part thereof, shall affect or apply to the Union in any action the Union may take against any Contractor who has failed, neglected or refused to comply with or execute the final settlement or decision reached through the procedure for settlement of disputes, except grievances concerning subcontracting.
ARTICLE IV Classifications
A.	When new types of equipment or machines are put into operation for which present classifications and wage rates are not applicable, the Contractor, the appropriate Contractor Association, and the Union will, within three (3) working days, agree
-44-
ARTICLE IV, Sec. A/B
upon temporary classifications and wage rates. Such temporary classifications and wage rates shall be immediately referred by the appropriate Contractor Association to the Labor-Management Adjustment Board which shall at its next meeting review and establish the proper classifications and wage rates. Either party having a dispute under this Article shall have the right of adjudication of same in accordance with the provisions of Article V
B.	The Contractor and the Union agree that wage scales apply to classifications rather than to men. The Contractors agree when the number of pieces of equipment on a job or project exceed the number of employees employed to operate the equipment, the Contractor shall not assign the operation of any of the equipment to any other employee not covered by this Agreement. An employee may be changed from one (1) classification or piece of equipment and returned to his original classification or piece of equipment only once on any shift. If an employee is changed from one (1) piece of equipment to another piece of equipment, the piece of equipment which
-45-
ARTICLE IV, Sec. B/C
the employee leaves may not operate unless the employee is replaced by another employee (this will not apply when the individual Contractor or Subcontractor has seven [7] or less pieces of equipment, excluding pumps, compressors and generators on the job). If the Contractor is found violating this Section B of Article IV, it is agreed that the Contractor shall pay a penalty contribution to the Operating Engineers Health and Welfare Fund equal to one (1) day's pay for each day or portion thereof the violation occurred at the highest Journeyman rate of pay, plus fringe benefits to the Operating Engineers Trust Funds. However, an employee who is transferred to another piece of equipment and who is not qualified to operate that equipment, shall not be discharged or laid off but shall be returned to the equipment to which he was originally dispatched if such equipment will be further used within a reasonable time on the project. This Section B shall not apply to indentured apprentices.
C.	The number of employees and the number of classifications required to perform any operation covered by this Agreement shall be determined by the Contractor
-46-
ARTICLE IV, Sec. C-E
(except for established crew sizes listed in this Agreement), provided that if a Contractor desires to lessen or increase the number of employees or the number of classifications used to perform any such operation and no understanding can be reached, then either party may have same determined by the procedure provided for in Article V of this Agreement.
D.	There shall be no limitations or restrictions against the use of any machinery, tools, or labor-saving devices, provided, however, that such machinery or power tools and equipment shall be furnished by the Contractor and provided, further, that no employee shall be required to work under any conditions that are injurious to his health or safety, or in conflict with the present well-established customs in the industry.
E.	An employee who has been found to have been unjustifiably disciplined or discharged for refusing to perform work which would endanger his health or safety, or the health or safety of any other employee, shall be reinstated in his former classification as determined by the grievance procedure.
-47-
ARTICLE IV, Sec. F - ARTICLE V, Sec. A

For the purpose of administering this Fund, the individual Employer by becoming signatory to this Agreement does hereby designate the Nevada Contractors Association (NCA) to act as his agent in all matters concerning the Fund. The Nevada Contractors Association (NCA) shall receive all Contract Administration and Industry Advancement Funds contributed by NCA proxied members.
C.	The Majority Association shall receive on a proportional basis Contract Administration and Industry Advancement Funds based on reported hours worked by contractors not proxied to a Contractor Association (i.e. 90% of reported hours worked = 90% of Contract Administration and Industry Advancement Funds not proxied or designated to a Contractor Association).
For the purpose of this Article the following definitions shall apply. The term "Contractor Association" shall refer to a Contractor Association whose members have selected the Association by written proxy to represent the members in matters of collective bargaining, grievances, arbitra
ge-

tion and/or all other matters pertaining to labor relations. The term "Majority Association" herein shall refer to the Contractor Association which has the majority of reported hours worked by the Operating Engineers through proxied members.
ARTICLE XIII
Trust Funds and Delinquencies
A.	Trust Funds:
Trust Funds named in this Agreement have been established and subsequently amended by the Contractors and the Union. The Contractors agree to abide by said Agreements and Declarations of Trust as they now exist or as they may be amended and, further to make payment to each Trust Fund in the amount designated in Appendix "F" to this Agreement on all hours of employment (hours worked or paid) of each employee who performs any work described in this Agreement.
-67-
ARTICLE XIII, Sec. B
B.	Delinquencies:
1.	In the event a Contractor is determined to be delinquent in performing any obligation to a Trust Fund by the Board of Trustees or authorized committee of trustees of that Trust Fund, the trustees shall provide a written notice of delinquency to the Contractor. If the Contractor fails to finally resolve the delinquency dispute to the full satisfaction of the Trust Fund within ten (10) days after the date of transmittal of the written notice, the Union party to that Trust Fund may take economic action including, but not limited to, the right to withhold employees, refusal to dispatch workmen and strike action against such Contractor until satisfactory resolution of the delinquency dispute between the Trustees and the Contractor.
2.	The respective Trustees of the Trust Funds shall furnish a list of delinquent Contractors each week to the Contractor Associations and Unions without charge. The respective Trustees of the Trust Funds shall be requested to make available to all contributing Employers, upon subscription, at a charge to be determined by the Trustees
-68-
ARTICLE XU). Sec. B
as their actual cost, a list of delinquent Contractors each week. Because the furnishing of services by a Subcontractor who has not made the appropriate fringe benefit payments serves to undermine the standards of this Agreement and to deprive employees who would otherwise be having fringe benefit contributions paid on their behalf of the opportunity for employment, the Contractor agrees that it shall not subcontract any portion of his job to any such listed delinquent Contractor. The Contractor agrees he will not subcontract any portion of his job, including work covered by this Agreement, to any Employer whose name appears on the delinquent list of the Trust Funds until such Employer has paid all delinquent monies to the Trust Funds. In the event the Contractor subcontracts to any such delinquent Employer in violation of the foregoing, the Contractor shall remove such Subcontractor from the job immediately unless such delinquent Subcontractor immediately makes full payment of all amounts owed to the Trusts.
The terms "Employer" and "Subcontractor" shall include all present and prior entities of the delinquent Employer or Subcontractor
-69-
ARTICLE XIII, Sec. B
regardless of any change of name, or change of entity, provided that the owner or shareholders of the delinquent Employer or Subcontractor holds at least ten percent (10%) ownership in the new entity.
This Section 2 shall be enforceable only through a lawsuit.
3.	In the event the Contractor subcontracts work covered by this Agreement to an Employer named in the delinquent list most recently published by the Trust Funds before the date of subcontracting, the Contractor shall be liable to the Trustees of the Trust Funds for all accrued delinquencies of the delinquent Subcontractor. Further, the Contractor shall withhold sufficient funds from monies due or to become due such Subcontractor and shall pay the sums over to the Trust Funds. Should the Contractor subcontract to a Subcontractor who becomes delinquent and is named on the delinquent list after executing a subcontract document, the Contractor will be liable for only those delinquencies that occur on his labor project even though the Subcontractor commences work on the project after his name appears on the delinquent list.
-70-
ARTICLE XIII, Sec. B
If a Subcontractor becomes delinquent after commencing work for the Contractor, the Contractor shall be liable for all delinquencies incurred on the Contractor's jobs or projects. The Contractor shall remove the Subcontractor who fails to correct his delinquency within five (5) working days after notification of such delinquency. If the Contractor fails to remove such Subcontractor in accordance with this paragraph, the Contractor shall become liable for all past accrued delinquencies of such Subcontractor.
This Section 3 shall be enforceable only through a lawsuit.
4.	The Employer shall make contributions to the appropriate Trust Funds for all employees covered by this Agreement for all hours of employment (worked or paid) of such employees. The Union represents all employees who perform any work in the Union's jurisdiction and such employees shall be covered by this Agreement.
5.	The Trustees shall have authority to audit Contractor records to determine the appropriate contributions and shall have
-71-
ARTICLE XIII, Sec. B.
specific authority to examine Contractor's Federal W-2 Forms and 1099 Forms. In addition, Cash Disbursement Records, individual time cards, individual payroll records and Employer reports to other trust funds, may be audited by the Trustees to verify total amounts due the Trust Funds. Upon demand of the Trustees, any Contractor shall immediately submit relevant payroll information for audit by the Trustees or their designated auditors. If litigation is required to compel such audits, then in addition to any sums found due, the Contractor shall pay all attorney fees, audit costs, interest and other costs incurred in connection therewith. In the event a Contractor or Subcontractor refuses to submit to such audit, the Union shall have the right to take economic action against any or all jobs of such Subcontractor or Contractor.
6.	The Contractor has a duty to report to the Trust Funds as required by this Agreement. The Contractor shall maintain for a period of not less than five (5) years all payroll and related records showing all payments to persons or firms for work of the nature covered by this Agreement. The
-72-
ARTICLE XIII, Sec. B
Contractor shall furnish such records for audit by the Trust Fund representative upon written request. The Contractor and the Union agree that such audits are expensive and time consuming for the Trust Funds and the Contractor, but the Trust Funds otherwise have no way of knowing the full extent of the Contractor's obligation, since the records showing the related employment are in the possession and control of the Contractor. In order to minimize the need for and frequency of such audits, the Contractor agrees that the Trustees and the Union place trust and confidence in the Contractor to report and pay contributions properly. For these reasons, if an audit by the Trust Funds discovers that the Contractor has failed to report and pay properly as required by this Agreement, the Trust Fund's right to sue for the Contractor's failure to pay shall begin to run from the date of the audit in which the delinquent amounts are discovered.
7.	Each individual Contractor found to be delinquent, in accordance with the trustees' determination, shall be liable to pay all legal fees, court costs, and auditing costs in connection with such delinquency.
-73-
ARTICLE XIII, Sec. B
Liquidated damages in the amount of Twenty-Five Dollars ($25.00) or ten percent (10%) of the delinquent amount, whichever is the greater, shall be due to each Trust Fund from the delinquent Contractor.
8.	If an employee of the Contractor performs any work covered by this Agreement and is paid by any method other than (or in addition to) hourly wages, including, but not limited to draws, bonuses, dividends, or equipment rental payments, the Contractor is obligated to pay contributions to each of the Operating Engineers Trusts on behalf of the employee at the specified hourly rates, based on a minimum of forty (40) hours per week of employment. This obligation shall commence on the date the employee first performs any work covered by this Agreement, and shall continue for each week until the employee is terminated from all employment with the Contractor. The obligation shall not be diminished by evidence that the employee worked or was paid for fewer than forty (40) hours in any week.
The obligation under this Paragraph 8 shall not apply with respect to a maximum of
-74-
ARTICLE XIII, Sec. B - ARTICLE XIV, Sec. A
two (2) employees, each of whom owns at least ten percent (10%) of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Contractor, provided that the Contractor has executed and has fully complied with the terms of a Principal Shareholder Program Participation Agreement with the Operating Engineers Trust covering such employee(s) for the term of employment involved.
The obligation under this Paragraph 8 shall not apply to a bona fide year-end or mid-year bonus which the Contractor establishes to the satisfaction of the Trusts is not a disguised attempt to pay wages or to pay a bonus in lieu of wages.
ARTICLE XIV Qualifications

-77-
ARTICLE XIV, Sec. C/D - ARTICLE XV, Sec. A

B.	The Union shall bear the entire responsibility for obtaining the written authorization from the employee and furnishing the authorization to the Board of Trustees in a form satisfactory to the Trustees. All costs, expenses and fees of the Board of Trustees incident to the accounting, administration, and remittance to the Union of the Supplemental Dues payments shall be borne solely and entirely by the Union. The Contractors and Union agree to amend the Agreement and Declaration of Trust in the Operating Engineers Vacation-Holiday Savings Trust for the purpose of authorizing, allocating and distributing the foregoing sums.

TRUCK CRANE CRANE AND HOISTING EQUIPMENT OPERATORS
Qualifications and Certification:
1.	The parties signatory hereto have established a Certification Examination for all operators of cranes in excess of a 5-ton lifting capacity. A committee of not less than three (3) management representatives and three (3) union representatives appointed by the Training and Retraining Trust shall establish the protocol for the Certification Examination and its revisions. Each member of the committee must have full knowledge of the skills and necessary requirements for the crane operations that the examination(s) will cover.
2.	The address for testing shall be at the Operating Engineers and management's training site at 6350 Howdy Wells Avenue, Las Vegas. In addition, the testing site may be designated at an employer’s place of business or some other location designated by the management/union committee to give a test to all operators. Irrespective of the test
-180-
site, testing is to be conducted by an independent and impartial testing organization. The independent and impartial testing organization will be selected from a list of at least five (5) candidates invited to offer proposals and establish qualifications to the Committee. In the event one (1) candidate cannot be selected by mutual agreement, the Committee will alternately strike names from the list until one (1) candidate remains. At the end of one (1) year of service to the testing program or any anniversary date thereafter, either the union or the management committee will have the unqualified right to terminate the current independent testing organization and the entire selection process will be repeated. The cost associated with the testing is the sole responsibility of the Training and Retraining Trust.
3.	All operators must initially participate in the written and practical test with no exception. In the event the operator is applying for certification of more than one (1) type and size of crane, he must pass the test for each specific crane separately. Passing of the written test is the successful completion of the written examination with a mini
-181-
mum of seventy percent (70%) correct response. All operators at a minimum must pass a Department of Transportation physical and a substance abuse test before making an application for testing. At the end of the three (3) calendar years, each operator must take a current written exam, and provide current proof of passing a Department of Transportation physical and substance abuse test. A practical exam would also be required if the operator is unable to document at least 1000 hours of experience during the immediately preceding certification period, operating the crane or hoisting equipment for which recertification is sought
a.	An operator applying for re-certification and not wishing to take the practical exam must provide a complete employment record of the past three (3) calendar years. The employment record must include but is not limited to the following items.
(1)	Name, address, telephone number, verifying supervisors at past and present employment covering the past three (3) calendar years.
-182-
(2)	Make and model of cranes or hoisting and equipment operated.
(3)	Total hours of operation for this employee.
b.	Waiver of the practical examination will only be granted after review and verification of the employment record.
4.	Trainees may be authorized to operate crane and hoisting equipment provided they are under the supervision of an operator possessing a current, valid Certification of Competence.
5.	It is also agreed between the parties that if any public or private authority should enact or impose any statute, law, regulation or specification that this testing program does not accommodate, then the parties to this Agreement shall meet within five (5) working days.
If this procedure is not followed, then it will be deemed a violation of this Agreement if employees are instructed to take any other test or certification unless agreed upon by the union.
-183-
6.	Exemption:
a. Mechanic's Cranes - must be mounted on a truck, be operated by a remote pendant, have a maximum height from the ground to the tip of the boom of twenty-five (25) feet and have a maximum lifting capacity of 11,500 pounds.

The Apprenticeship Standards will be modified as follows and shall apply to all Step I Apprentices indentured after July 1, 1992. No pension contributions will be required for the first 2,000 hours. After completing 2,000 hours, fringe benefit payments will include Pension Fund.
The above contributions will be made on the basis of straight-time or overtime hours worked or paid each employee under the terms of this Appendix. The Contractor shall pay fringe benefit contributions to the Operating Engineers Trust at the specified hourly rates on all hours of employment (worked or paid) of each employee who performs any work whatsoever of the nature covered by this Agreement.
The Memorandum Of Understanding on Drug Abuse Prevention and Detection which became effective on July 1, 1992, is included herein by reference.
The Contractors or Association Members, signatory to this Agreement shall recognize that the Retirees of the Operating Engineers Union are in need of a periodic increase in
-198-
their benefits to keep abreast of economic factors such as inflation and normal cost of living increases.
Effective July 1, 1998. pension benefits shall be increased by Five Dollars ($5.00) per credit for all active members who are participants in Local No. 12 Pension Plan.
Effective July 1, 1999. pension benefits shall be increased by One Dollar ($1.00) per credit for ail active members who are participants in Local No. 12 Pension Plan.
Effective July 1, 2000. pension benefits shall be increased by One Dollar ($1.00) per credit for all active members who are participants in Local No. 12 Pension Plan.
Effective December 1, 1998, 1999. and 2000. all retirees shall receive an extra month benefit in the amount of the previous month benefit check.
It is agreed that benefits shall also be increased for all active members for the years 1998. 1999 and/or 2000 at the option of the membership.
-199-
The above pension benefit increases reflect the increases that were negotiated in the Master Labor Agreement for the period 1998-2001. During the current negotiations for the period 2001, the increases are not known at this time of negotiations and future increases will be based on the results of negotiations for renewal of this Agreement. Therefore, the Union would like the privilege to insert the pension benefit increases at a later date, or upon conclusion of negotiations.
It is further agreed that in the event there is insufficient margin existing in the Pension Fund to increase the benefits as noted herein, the Union shall have the option of allocating a portion of their negotiated increase to pay for the increase, or foregoing the increase. However, the margin that may be created during the life of this Agreement shall first be used before any further allocations are made.
Commencing with the first actuarial valuation prepared subsequent to this Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Trustees of the Pension Fund are hereby directed to request of the actuary that the Scheduled Cost of the
-200-
Plan in that valuation and in each subsequent actuarial valuation be derived by using a single rolling amortization schedule of a period of fifteen years for the Plan's combined unfunded actuarial accrued liability.
It is also understood this provision of the contract is subject to the provisions described below for resolving disputes.
PROCEDURE FOR RESOLVING TRUST FUND DISPUTES
1. Pending amendment of the Trust Agreements, by all of the parties to the Trust Agreement, the following procedure shall be used to resolve any Trust Fund dispute in the event there is a deadlock in implementing the increases noted above.
a.	The deadlocked dispute shall be submitted to the Labor-Management Adjustment Board consisting of three (3) persons from the Contractors Negotiating Committee and three (3) persons from the Operating Engineers Negotiating Committee, all of whom participated in the negotiations, for a determination of the deadlocked
-201-
motion. The parties’ Trustees shall also be present as observers. There shall be no alternates appointed by either party. In the event of a deadlock, the parties shall select an arbitrator in accordance with Article V of this Agreement. The arbitrator shall rule only on the provisions outlined in this Appendix F. The Trustees shall be obligated to carry out the instruction resulting from this process with respect to Appendix F of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
b.	If either party fails to meet with the Labor-Management Adjustment Board within thirty (30) days of submission of the dispute, or if the Labor-Management Adjustment Board fails to meet within thirty-nine (39) days of the submission to it of the dispute, the decision of the Labor-Management Adjustment Board shall be against the party that failed to meet, or whose members of the Labor-Management Adjustment Board failed to meet.
-202-
TRUST AMENDMENT
The Union and the Association shall jointly propose and support the following amendment to the Agreement establishing the Operating Engineers Pension Trust:
ARTICLE V, SECTION 2
The following shall be inserted after the third sentence of Article C, Section 2:
The Board of Trustees shall amend or modify the plan of benefits in effect on July 1, 1989, to include the schedule of benefit modifications set forth in Appendix F of the Nevada Contractors Association Master Labor Agreement adopted July 1, 1995. Should the Trustees be unable to agree on implementing the increases, the questions raised shall be referred to the parties for clarification as to the intent of the Collective Bargaining Parties. Should the Collective Bargaining Parties be unable to agree, they shall process the matter in the following manner:
a.	The deadlocked dispute shall be submitted to the Labor-Management Adjust
-203-
ment Board of any of the Collective Bargaining Agreements consisting of three (3) persons from the Contractors Negotiating Committee and three (3) persons from the Operating Engineers Negotiating Committee, all of whom participated in the negotiations, for a determination of the deadlocked motion. The parties' Trustees shall also be present as observers. There shall be no alternates appointed by either party. In the event of a deadlock, the parties shall select an arbitrator other than a permanent arbitrator in accordance with Article V of the Collective Bargaining Agreement. The arbitrator shall rule only on the provisions outlined in this Trust Agreement. The Trustees shall be obligated to carry out the instruction resulting from this process with respect to Appendix F of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
b.	If either party fails to meet with the Labor-Management Adjustment Board within thirty (30) days of submission of the dispute, or if the Labor-Management Adjustment Board fails to meet within thirty-nine (39) days of the submission to it of the dispute, the decision of the Labor-Management
-204-
Adjustment Board shall be against the party that failed to meet, or whose members of the Labor-Management Adjustment Board failed to meet.
APPENDIX "G"
A.	Air-conditioned cabs shall be provided on all equipment working in temperatures of 100 degrees F or more. This shall only apply to new equipment purchased after January 1, 1982, when air-conditioning is available from the original manufacturer. Such new equipment is defined and limited to CAT 14 Blade or larger or equivalent, D-9 or larger or equivalent, and self-loading scraper 623 or equivalent or larger and 992 loader or larger or equivalent
B.	It is also understood that it is not practicable to equip certain machines with air-conditioning because of the types of work or access of work such as housing tracts or when it is not practicable because of the safe operation of the equipment due to the restriction of view. In these instances, air-conditioning is not required.
