When the parties submit a grievance to mediation the timelines are waived so long as the agreement to submit the grievance to mediation occurs prior to the timelines spelled out in Step III below. No decisions reached during mediation are binding on the parties unless the agreement is reduced to writing and signed by both parties. In the event that mediation is not successful in resolving the dispute, the matter may proceed to Step III.

the grievance or the expiration of time limits for a disposition or the close of any unsuccessful voluntary mediation. The disposition of the grievance made by the arbitrator shall be binding on both parties; providing that the arbitrator shall have no power to add to or subtract from, modify or otherwise alter the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. The Board and the Association will share any information relative to the disposition of the grievance prior to or during arbitration.

TEACHING CONDITIONS
5.01 - WORK DAY: The basic work day for teachers shall be seven and one-half (7-1/2) hours on all days when students are in attendance. On all teacher duty days and inservice days, the basic work day for teachers shall be seven (7) hours. The work day for teachers shall include:
a.	A lunch time each day equivalent to the student lunch time, but not less than twenty-five (25) minutes. The teacher’s lunch period shall be without direct responsibility for students.
b.	Each middle and high school teacher shall be given one (1) continuous planning/conference time of not less than one instructional period per day. The length of the instructional period each day will be determined by the individual school’s master schedule. Elementary school teachers shall have planning/conference time totaling not less than fifty (50) minutes per day or the equivalent on a weekly basis to include a minimum of thirty (30) continuous minutes per teacher per day except in those cases as referenced in 5.01(d) and 5.03. Such time shall be used for lesson preparation and for meeting other job description responsibilities.
c.	Fulfillment of performance responsibilities as defined by the Board’s job description for teachers shall be made available upon request to the individual supervisor.
d.	The Board and the Association recognize that schools provide many learning activities other than in individual classrooms. Such activities as state or district testing programs, field days, field trips, theme days, or other similar activities are included within this provision. When participation in such activities is found to be necessary and will have the affect of temporarily changing a teacher’s schedule, if volunteers are not available, assignments shall be on a rotating basis in a manner to ensure an equitable distribution of additional responsibilities.
e.	The parties agree that teachers are professionals and have responsibilities, which may require the teacher’s attendance and/or participation beyond the normal work day. Prior to the beginning of each semester a school calendar will be jointly developed by school administrators and teacher representatives to include but not limited to the_TALC representative. Activities such as faculty meetings or other official school-related events

ARTICLE 8
SENIORITY
8.0	1: Seniority is the total number of good years (one day more than half) of instructional experience in Lee County School District while on annual, continuing or professional service contract. However, continuing or professional service contract teachers are considered to have seniority over any annual contract teacher regardless of the total years of service in the District. Authorized leave of absence, open-end or substitute teaching experience does not count toward seniority. Administrative experience in the District shall count toward seniority provided said experience occurred after the teacher attained three years seniority in the bargaining unit, and said teacher returned to the bargaining unit prior to July 1, 1991. Any tie in seniority between teachers shall be broken by counting the days of experience on open-end, temporary or interim contract rather than years. If a tie still exists, the tie shall be broken by drawing lots. Members of the association may be present to observe the lottery process.
Teachers lose their seniority as a result of the following:
a.	termination;
b.	retirement;
c.	resignation;
d.	layoff exceeding two (2) years or exceeding the individual’s length of service, whichever is less.
8.0	12: The District shall develop and maintain a seniority list based on the continuous years of service to the District while on annual, continuing or professional service contract. The list shall include the hire date which shall be the first day of duty under annual, continuing or professional service contact, all areas of certification and racial data. A copy of the list shall be available at each work site and provided to the Association prior to March 1 of each year. Teachers shall have access to the seniority list upon request to the principal or immediate supervisor.

All newly hired teachers must undergo a physical examination by a licensed medical doctor. The results of this examination shall be stated on a form provided by the Board. The form must be received by the Board before employment can begin. Additional medical examination may be required in order to determine whether matters reported in the initial examination would present a direct threat to the health or safety of the applicant or of any other person.
Once employed, physical examinations may be required only when the employee’s behavior gives reason to suspect that a medical or psychiatric condition may impair the employee’s ability to perform his/her duties, or when the employee has been injured or ill and an examination is needed in order to determine whether an employee can return to work safely or to determine whether the employee has a disability for which a reasonable accommodation can be made.

The employee will remain in his/her job site, performing appropriate duties as identified by the supervisor for a period of ten (10) work days. No later than eleven (11) days after returning to limited duty, the employee will be evaluated by the physician and, if not released for full duty, will be returned for limited duty for the work period not to exceed ten (10) work days. At the completion of the second ten (10) day period, if the employee is not able to return to a full-duty status, he will be evaluated by the physician, the principal/supervisor and the Insurance and Benefits Management to determine the employee’s status. Alternatives such as returning to worker’s compensation off-duty status, continuation of limited duty assignments, alternate duty assignments, and/or other assignments will be reviewed with the employee.

c.	All alternate duty positions will be funded from the Workers’ Compensation loss fund budget, as directed by Insurance and Benefits Management.
9.101	- WAGES: Employees selected for alternate duty assignments will be paid in accordance with the appropriate salary schedule, but in no case shall the employee receive less than the amount received prior to the injury.

PROVISIONS FOR LEAVES
11.01 - GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR LEAVES OF ABSENCE: The Board and the Association agree that there is no substitute who can replace the regular teacher in meeting the needs of the students served by the District. Therefore, the Board encourages regular attendance and limited use of leave of absence. Leave should be requested only when necessary and under the provisions of law, state board regulations and terms of this Agreement. The Board and the Association believe that there is a direct and positive relationship between attendance and successful performance of job functions.
11.011 - ABSENCE WITHOUT LEAVE: Any absence from duty without leave constitutes a violation of a teacher’s contract and shall subject the teacher’s contract to cancellation by the Board.
11.012 - ABSENCE WITHOUT PAY: The deduction for each day of absence shall be determined by dividing the base salary plus designated supplements by the total number of hours in the teacher’s contract year to determine the hourly rate, then multiplying that rate by the number of hours absent. Designated supplements are defined as those supplements that are attached to all positions of a specific title such as guidance counselors, school psychologists, etc.
11.013 - NOTICE OF ABSENCE: Any teacher who will be absent from duty for any cause except for leave duly authorized and granted in advance shall report such absence utilizing the District's electronic absence reporting system (LMS) as soon as possible prior to his/her absence. A teacher may be required to notify both the electronic system and a designated supervisor in cases of suspected leave abuse.

11.017- LEAVE DISPOSITION: All teachers making an application for leave shall be notified in writing of the disposition of such leave on the form provided by the Board. Reasonable effort will be made to ensure notification of the employee regarding the disposition of the leave prior to the date for which leave is requested.
11.02 - TYPES OF LEAVE:
11.0201 - SICK LEAVE: Any teacher on a full-time basis shall be entitled to four days of sick leave as of the first day of employment during each contract year and thereafter shall accrue one (1) day of sick leave credit for each month of employment. Teachers hired during the last four months of the school year will not be eligible for the four-day advanced sick leave time. Sick leave shall be credited to the teacher at the end of the month and may not be used prior to the time it is earned and credited, provided that no teacher may earn more than one (1) day of sick leave times the number of months of employment during the school year. Such leave shall be cumulative (actual number of hours earned) from year to year without limit to the number of hours that may be accrued. Any leave charged against accrued sick leave shall be with full compensation. As stated above, the teacher receives four (4) sick days at the end of the first day of the contract year, but does not actually earn those four (4) days until he/she has worked four (4) months of the contract year. Therefore, if termination occurs when the employee has used more sick days than he/she has earned that contract year, and if he/she has no sick leave accumulated from prior years, the School Board will withhold the amount of the teacher’s daily rate of pay for each sick day used that has not been earned. Also, if an employee who is eligible for terminal sick pay benefits terminates before completion of his/her contract year, the number of sick leave days for which he/she receives benefit shall not exceed the number of sick leave days accumulated prior to the beginning of that contract year plus one (1) sick leave day for each month of actual employment in the contract year during which termination occurs.
a.	Claims: Sick leave claims may be submitted by the teacher for his/her own personal illness as well as illness or death of father, mother, brother, sister, husband, wife, child or other close relative, or member of his/her own household.
b.	Record of Accrued Sick Leave: The Board shall provide all employees with a cumulative record of accrued sick leave hours on each pay statement.
c.	Use of Sick Leave in Summer School: Regular employees who are employed for the exclusive purpose of working during the summer school session, shall earn one day (actual number of hours worked per day in summer session) of sick leave for each three (3)-week term employed during summer school if such employment meets the requirements of law

e.	Conditions for Sick Leave:
1.	Sick leave may be claimed for a minimum of one-half (1/2) day. One-half (1/2) day shall be defined as one-half the number of hours defined as the teacher’s regular work day.
2.	Any teacher who has used all accrued sick leave but who is otherwise entitled to sick leave shall be granted sick leave without pay. The claim for such sick leave shall clearly state that the leave is without compensation.
3.	In the case where sick leave abuse is suspected, the Superintendent may require a doctor’s statement of verification of illness. A request to the Superintendent for a verification of claim may be initiated by the principal or supervisor.
4.	A false claim for sick leave shall be deemed cause for employee discipline up to and including discharge. Where there is any doubt as to the validity of a sick leave claim, the Superintendent may require the employee to file supporting evidence where personal illness is not involved.
5.	An application for sick leave due to an extended illness (not fewer than twenty (20) days) shall have attached to it a statement from a practicing physician certifying that such leave is essential and indicating the probable duration of the illness and needed leave.
6.	If leave is granted for an extended illness, teachers must notify their principal or supervisor (in writing) no later than the work day before the last day of the leave of their intent to:
a)	Return to work
b)	File a request to extend their leave, or

g.	Reinstating Accrued Sick Leave: When a teacher of the Lee County School District interrupts service through termination and subsequently returns to employment in the District without having used his/her Lee County accrued sick leave credit in another Florida school district, such accrued sick leave credit shall become valid on the first day of contractual service.
h.	Terminal Sick Leave Pay: When a teacher receives terminal pay benefits based on unused sick leave, all unused sick leave credit shall become invalid.
11.0202 - Illness or Injury In-Line-Of-Duty Leave: Any full-time regular employee shall be entitled to illness- or injury-in-line-of-duty leave with pay, less any Workers’ Compensation payments, for a period not to exceed ten (10) work days per fiscal year regardless of the number of illnesses or injuries, nor to exceed ten (10) days per any single illness or injury when that illness or injury continues or recurs from one fiscal year to succeeding fiscal years, except as provided in this Agreement, when he/she has to be absent from work because of personal injury received in the discharge of his/her duties.

Employees needing intermittent FMLA leave must attempt to schedule their leave so as to minimize disruption to the District’s operations. The District may assign an employee to an alternative position on a temporary basis with equivalent pay and benefits that better accommodates the employee’s intermittent leave schedule. Intermittent FMLA leave must be requested by the employee in writing at least thirty (30) days in advance, or as soon as is practicable.
e.	Maintenance of Group Medical Insurance: The Board shall maintain an employee’s medical insurance coverage during FMLA leave to the same extent coverage was provided to the employee prior to taking FMLA leave, for a period not to exceed twelve (12) weeks during the applicable twelve (12) month period. Medical insurance premiums which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave for any dependent coverage must continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave period. If such payments are not made by the employee, the dependent’s insurance coverage will lapse and no benefits will be paid for claims incurred while the

policy has lapsed. When the employee is reinstated, and payroll deduction of dependent’s premiums resumes, the dependent’s insurance will be reinstated with the same coverage as prior to the lapse.
f.	Notice: Employees must request FMLA leave in writing, directed to the Personnel Department, at least thirty (30) calendar days in advance, or as early as is practicable. The time for the start of the leave may be delayed for up to thirty (30) days for failure to provide timely notice.
g.	Job Restoration: Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee shall be restored to the same or an equivalent position. An equivalent position must be at the same pay, benefits, and working conditions, include the same privileges, prerequisites and status, and involve the same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities. The equivalent position must be located at the same or geographically proximate work site unless the employee’s request for transfer has been accepted.
h.	Failure to Return: At the start of any FMLA leave, the employee must state whether he/she intends to return at the end of the leave. If the employee does not intend to return, the employee will be deemed to have resigned voluntarily, and no FMLA benefits will be provided. If the employee states that he/she intends to return, and then fails to return, for reasons other than 1) the continuation of a serious health condition of the employee or a covered family member or 2) circumstances beyond the employee’s control (certification required within 30 days of failure to return for either reason), the employee must promptly reimburse the Board for the cost of insurance provided by the Board during the leave. If the employee fails to do so, the Board may take action to recover the premiums paid.
i.	Application of Paid Leave: Employees are required to use paid accrued sick leave before any FMLA leave is taken as a result of a serious health condition. Employees are required to use any paid accrued vacation before any FMLA leave is taken. Any such paid accrued leave taken will be counted toward the allowable twelve (12) weeks of FMLA leave.
j.	Medical Certification: Employees requesting FMLA leave due to a serious health condition of the employee, or of the employee’s spouse, child or parent, are required to submit a certification from a health care provider, verifying that the leave is medically necessary. Form WH-380 shall be used. The Board may require an employee

to obtain a second medical certification, at the Board’s expense. The second health care provider may not be employed on a regular basis by the District. If the opinions of the first and second health care provider differ, the Board may require a third medical certification, again at the Board’s expense, from a health care provider selected by the employee from a mutually agreed upon list maintained by the Director Insurance and Benefits Management. The third opinion shall be final and binding.
k.	Fitness-for-Duty Certification: As a condition of restoration of an employee who has taken FMLA leave due to the employee’s serious health condition, the employee is required to provide certification from the employee’s health care provider that the employee is able to resume work, i.e., is fit for duty.
11.0212 - INSURANCE COVERAGE: The insurance coverage of any employee who is granted a leave terminates on the first scheduled pay day that the employee does not receive a paycheck, except as otherwise provided by law or this agreement. To continue insurance coverage during the leave period, the employee must remit all premiums due thereafter when permitted.
11.03 - TERMINAL PAY BENEFITS: A regular full-time teacher, upon application, after ten years of creditable service in a retirement plan established by the Florida Legislature, shall be entitled to terminal pay at the time of:
a.	normal retirement or early retirement;
b.	disability retirement;
c.	termination.
However, if termination is by death of the teacher, the ten (10) years of creditable service in a retirement plan established by the Florida Legislature will not be required and payment will be made to the teacher’s beneficiary.
11.031: Terminal pay shall be paid after ten (10) years of creditable service in a retirement plan established by the Florida Legislature and shall be based on the total number of accrued and valid sick leave days credit to the teacher at the daily rate of pay of the teacher at the time of termination. The amount of terminal pay shall be computed as follows:
a.	during the years of service one through three (1-3) in the District, thirty-five (35) percent of the hours of accumulated sick leave shall be multiplied times the hourly rate of pay
b.	during the years of service four through six (4-6) in the District, forty (40) percent of the hours of accumulated sick leave shall be multiplied times the hourly rate of pay

11.032: Any teacher entitled to terminal pay benefits shall have been under contract to render services for the period immediately preceding termination of employment and shall not be under suspension from duty except for reasons pertaining to health, or have any charges pending which could result in dismissal from employment.

In the event an SLB member cannot contribute an additional day due to leave exhaustion, and he/she is not currently drawing from the SLB, the additional day automatically shall be the next accrued sick leave day.
11.043 - DURATION: If membership in the bank and the number of days in the bank should fall below three hundred (300), the bank shall be discontinued and days remaining in the bank shall be distributed as provided elsewhere in this section.

1.	All accumulated sick leave and all other forms of paid leave available to the teacher must first be expended, followed by an unpaid leave of ten (10) continuous work days.
2.	Application must be made to the SLB, submitting medical certification and justification of the number of days required for the leave.
3.	A maximum of one hundred (100) continuous paid work days may be received by a teacher in a school year or a total of one hundred (100) days for any one illness or disability.

In cases denied, the Overview Committee shall provide, in writing, reason(s) for such denial. The applicant may appeal his/her request to the committee	for
reconsideration within ten (10) days from receipt of denial. The Overview Committee’s determination is not subject to the grievance procedure and arbitration.
