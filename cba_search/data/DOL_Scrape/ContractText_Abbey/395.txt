The______________________________________________
(Company or Association)
hereinafter referred to as the "EMPLOYER," and LOCAL UNION NO. 705, affiliated with the INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS, AFL-CIO, agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
ARTICLE 1
PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT AND ITS SCOPE
Employers Covered
Section 1.	The Employer consists of Associations, members of Associations who have given their authorization to the Associations to execute this Agreement, members of Associations who have not given such authorization, and individual Employers who become signatory to this Agreement.
Unions Covered
Section 2.	The Union consists of Local Union No. 705, Chicago, IL.
1
Transfer of Company, Title or Interest
Section 3.	The Employer's obligations under this Agreement shall be binding upon its successors, administrators, executors and assigns. The Employer agrees that the obligations of this Agreement shall be included in the agreement of sale, transfer or assignment of the business. In the event an entire active or inactive operation, or a portion thereof, or rights only, are sold, leased, transferred or taken over by sale, transfer, lease, assignment, receivership, or bankruptcy proceedings, such operation or use of such rights shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement for the life thereof. Transactions covered by this provision include stock sales or exchanges, mergers, consolidations, spin-offs or any other method by which a business is transferred.
It is understood by this Section that the signator Employer shall not sell, lease or transfer such run or runs or rights to a third party to evade this Agreement. In the event the Employer fails to require the purchaser, transferee, or lessee to assume the obligations of this Agreement, the Employer (including partners thereof) shall be liable to the Local Union and to the Employees covered for all damages sustained as a result of such failure to require the assumption of the terms of this Agreement until its expiration date, but shall not be liable after the purchaser, the transferee or lessee has agreed to assume the obligations of this Agreement. The obligations set forth above shall not apply in the event of the sale, lease or transfer of a portion of the rights comprising less than all of the signator Employer's rights to a non-signator company unless the purpose is to evade this Agreement. Corporate reorganizations by a signatory Employer, occurring during the term of this Agreement, shall not relieve the signatory Employer or the re-organized employerof the obligations of this Agreement during its term.
2
The Employer shall give notice of the existence of this Agreement to any purchaser, transferee, lessee, assignee, or other entity involved in the sale, merger, consolidation, acquisition, transfer, spin-off, lease or other transaction by which the operation covered by this Agreement or any part thereof, including rights only, may be transferred. Such notice shall be in writing with a copy to the Local Union, at the time the seller, transferor, or lessor makes the purchase and sale negotiation known to the public or executes a contract or transaction as herein described, whichever first occurs. The Local Union shall also be advised of the exact nature of the transaction, not including financial details.
The term rights shall include routes and runs.
When a signator to this Agreement purchases rights from another signator, the provisions of Article 8 (Seniority), including applicable layoff provisions, of this Agreement shall apply.
Agreement
Section 4.	The execution of this Agreement on the part of the Employer shall apply to all local cartage operations of the Employer which are covered by this Agreement, and shall have application to the work performed within the classifications defined and set forth herein.
Single Bargaining Unit
Section 5.	The Employees covered under this Agreement shall constitute one bargaining unit. It is understood that the execution and printing of this Agreement in separate Agreements is for convenience only and is not intended to create separate bargaining units. This Agreement covering local cartage operations has resulted from joint collective bargaining negotiations as to common problems and interests in respect to basic terms and
3
conditions of employment, and this Agreement covers a single bargaining unit for the purposes of collective bargaining. Accordingly, the Associations and Employers which are parties to this Agreement acknowledge that they are part of a multi-Employer collective bargaining unit which is comprised of the Associations and those of their members which have or will authorize such Associations to represent them for the purpose of collective bargaining, and such other individual Employers which have or may singly become parties to this Agreement.
ARTICLE 2
RECOGNITION, UNION SHOP AND CHECK-OFF
Recognition
Section 1. (a) The Employer recognizes and acknowledges that the Union is the exclusive representative of all Employees in the classifications of work covered by this Agreement for the purposes of collective bargaining as provided by the National Labor Relations Act.
This provision shall apply to all present and subsequently acquired operations and terminals of the Employer. This provision shall not apply to wholly-owned and wholly independently operated subsidiaries which are not under contract with the Union. "Wholly independently operated" means, among other things, that there shall be no interchange of freight, equipment or personnel, or common use, in whole or in part, of equipment, terminals, property, personnel, or state or ICC rights.
The exception set forth above shall not apply to accretions to the collective bargaining unit.
4
The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to all accretions to the bargaining unit including, but not limited to, newly established or acquired terminals, consolidations of terminals, etc.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs, the provisions of this Agreement shall be applied, without evidence of Union representation of the employees involved, to all subsequent additions to, and extensions of, current operations which adjoin and are controlled and utilized as a part of such current operation, and newly established terminals and consolidations of terminals which are controlled and utilized as a part of such current operation. The provisions of Article 13 (Subcontracting) shall apply to this paragraph.
(b)	All present Employees who are members of the Union on the effective date of this subsection or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, shall remain members of the Union as a condition of employment. Union membership, for purposes of this Agreement, is required only to the Extent that employees must pay either (I) the Union’s initiation fees and periodic dues or (ii) service fees which in the case of a regular service fee payer shall be equal to the Union’s initiation fees and periodic dues and in the case of an objecting service fee payer shall be the proportion of the initiation fees and dues corresponding to the portion of the Union’s total expenditures that support representational activities. All present Employees who are not members of the Union and all Employees who are hired hereafter shall become and remain members of the Union as a condition of employment on and after the 31st day following the beginning of their employment or on and after the 31st day following the effective date of this subsection or the date of this Agreement, whichever is the later. An Employee who has failed to acquire or thereafter maintain membership in the Union as herein provided
5
shall be terminated seventy-two (72) hours after his/her Employer has received written notice from an authorized representative of the Union certifying that membership has been and is continuing to be offered to such Employee on the same basis as all other members, and, further, that the Employee has had notice and opportunity to make all dues payments. This provision shall be made and become effective as of such time as it may be made and become effective under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, but not retroactively.
For purposes of this Article "present Employees" and "Employees who are hired hereafter" shall include "replacement Employees" as defined in Article 2, Section 3 and "supplemental Employees" as defined in Article 2, Section 4. Such replacement/supplemental Employees will be required to join the Union on or after the 31st day following their first day of employment for any Employer signatory to this Agreement.
(c)	When the Employer needs additional Employees he shall give the Union equal opportunity with all other sources to provide suitable applicants, except in the case of replacements where the Employer shall give the Union first opportunity, but the Employer shall not be required to hire those referred by the Union. The names and addresses of all Employees shall be sent to the Union within twenty four (24) hours after their hiring.
(d)	No provision of this Article shall apply in any state to the extent that it may be prohibited by state law. If under applicable state law additional requirements must be met before any such provision may become effective, such additional requirements shall be first met. If any agency shop clause is permissible in any state where the provisions of this Article relating to the Union Shop cannot apply, the following Agency Clause shall prevail:
6
(1)	Membership in the Union is not compulsory. Employees have the right to join, not join, maintain, or drop their membership in the Union, as they see fit. Neither party shall exert any pressure on or discriminate against an Employee as regards such matters.
(2)	Membership in the Union is separate, apart and distinct from the assumption by one of his/her equal obligation to the extent that his/her receives equal benefits. The Union is required under this Agreement to represent all of the Employees in the bargaining unit fairly and equally without regard to whether or not an Employee is a member of the Union. The terms of this Agreement have been made for all Employees in the bargaining unit and not only for members in this Union, and this Agreement has been executed by the Employer after it has satisfied itself that the Union is the choice of a majority of the Employees in the bargaining unit. Accordingly, it is fair that each Employee in the bargaining unit pay his/her own way and assume his/her fair share of the obligation along with the grant of equal benefit contained in this Agreement.
(3)	In accordance with the policy set forth under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this Section all Employees shall, as a condition of continued employment, pay to the Union, the Employee's exclusive collective bargaining representative, an amount of money equal to that paid by other Employees in the bargaining unit who are members of the Union, which shall be limited to an amount of money equal to the Union's regular and usual initiation fees and its regular and usual dues. For present Employees, such payments shall commence thirty-one
7
(31)	days following the effective date or on the date of execution of this Agreement, whichever is the later, and for new Employees, the payment shall start thirty-one (31) days following the date of employment,
(e)	If any provision of this Article is invalid under the law of any state wherein this Agreement is executed, such provision shall be modified to comply with the requirements of state law or shall be re-negotiated for the purpose of adequate replacement. If such negotiations shall not result in mutually satisfactory agreement, either party shall be permitted all legal or economic recourse.
the statement of certification of the member and remit to the Union. Where laws require written authorization by the Employee, the same is to be furnished in the form required. All monies required to be checked off shall become the property of the entities for which it was intended at the time that such check-off is required to be made. All monies required to be checked off and paid over to other entities under this Agreement shall become the property of those entities for which it was intended at the time that such payment or check-off is required to be made.
(0 In those instances where subsection (b) hereof may not be validly applied, the Employer agrees to recommend to all Employees that they become members of the Union and maintain such membership during the life of this Agreement, to refer new Employees to the Union representative and to recommend to delinquent members that they pay their dues since they are receiving the benefits of this Agreement.
(g)	To the extent such amendments may become permissible under applicable federal and state law during the life of this Agreement as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial determination, all of the provisions of this Article shall be automatically amended
8
to embody the greater Union security provisions or to apply or become effective in situations not now permitted by law.
(h)	Nothing contained in this section shall be construed so as to require the Employer to violate any applicable law.
Probationary Employees
Section 2.	A probationary Employee shall work under the provisions of this Agreement, but shall be employed on a thirty (30) calendar day trial basis. During the probationary period, the Employee may be terminated without further recourse; provided, however, that the Employer may not terminate the Employee for the purpose of evading the Agreement or discriminating against Union members. A probationary Employee who is terminated by the Employer during the probationary period and is then worked again at any time during the next full twelve (12) months at any of that Employer's locations within the jurisdiction of the Local Union covering the terminal where he/she first worked, except if the Local Union maintains a hiring hall or referral system, shall be added to the regular seniority list with a seniority date as of the date that person is subsequently worked.
Replacement Employees
Section 3.	(a) The Employer will maintain a list of replacement/supplemental Employees ranked in relative order.
(b)	A replacement Employee is defined as an Employee who may be utilized by an Employer to replace regular employees when such regular employees are off due to illness, vacations or any other absence. However, it is understood and agreed that days worked by replacement Employees to replace a regular employee who is absent from work for a known extended illness in excess of a ninety (90) day period shall not be considered as replacement
9
days for those days worked in excess of such ninety (90) days.
(c)	Replacement Employees will be called to work as a replacement in the order he/she appears on the Employer's replacement/supplemental Employee list.
(d)	Each replacement/supplemental Employee shall have access to the grievance procedure on and after the thirty first (31st) day following the first day he/she works on and after April 1, 2003. The date applicable to Employees having worked prior to ratification shall be April 1, 1998.
(e)	The Employer is not considered to have supplemented its work force on a day where the increase in Employees called to work is due to an "Act of God" such as unusual weather-related delays in incoming truck or train traffic.
(f)	The Employer is required to make daily Health & Welfare and Pension Fund contributions for each day worked by a replacement/supplemental Employee with a maximum of five (5) days contributions in any one (1) calendar week.
A replacement Employee who is placed on the seniority list shall not be required to serve a probationary period unless he/she has not worked thirty-one (31) days for the Employer, in which case such Employee shall be a probationary Employee only for the calendar days remaining to reach thirty-one (31) days.
Supplemental Employees
Section 4.	A Supplemental Employee may be used by an Employer to supplement the work force but cannot be used to deprive regular Employees of premium day work.
10
When an Employer supplements the work force thirty (30) accumulative days within a ninety (90) calendar day period, such Employer shall be required to add one (1) probationary Employee to the seniority list from among those that have worked during the qualifying period for each occurrence, and such probationary Employee to be added shall be designated no later than the beginning of the next payroll period.
The thirty (30) accumulative days in a ninety (90) calendar day formula shall apply with regard to additions to the work force; when the formula is triggered the work force shall be increased.
When and if a Preferential Hiring List is provided; the Preferential Hiring List shall likewise be increased so as to maintain the agreed to maximum five percent (5%) of the work force with a minimum of one (1).
Replacement/supplemental Employees must be available for call; any unreasonable failure to be available may result in removal from the replacement/supplemental Employee list. Replacement/supplemental Employees on the replacement/supplemental Employee list shall also be subject to the disciplinary provisions of the labor agreement. Employees on the replacement/supplemental Employee list shall have full access to the Grievance Procedure.
A monthly list of all extra (e.g. laid-off, supplemental, replacement and/or probationary) employees used during that month shall be submitted to the Union by the tenth (10th) day of the following month. Such list shall show:
1.	The Employees name, address, and social security number;
2.	The dates worked;
11
3.	The classification of work performed each day, and the hours worked;
4.	The name, if applicable, of the employee replaced.
The list shall be compiled on a daily basis, and shall be available for inspection by a Union Representative.
Check-Off
Section 5 (a). The Employer agrees to deduct from the pay of all Employees covered by this Agreement the dues, initiation fees and/or uniform assessments of the Union having jurisdiction over such Employees and the Employer shall deduct such amount within two (2) weeks following receipt of the statement of certification of the member and remit to the Union. Where laws require written authorization by the Employee, the same is to be furnished in the form required. All monies required to be checked off shall become the property of the entities for which it was intended at the time that such check-off is required to be made. All monies required to be checked off and paid over to other entities under this Agreement shall become the property of those entities for which it was intended at the time that such payment or check-off is required to be made.
When the Employer institutes an electronic funds transfer (EFT) system, the Employee shall have the option of participating.
(b)	D.R.I.V.E. The Employer agrees to deduct from the paycheck of all Employees covered by this Agreement voluntary contributions to DRIVE. DRIVE shall notify the Employer of the amounts designated by each contributing Employee that are to be deducted from his/her paycheck on a weekly basis for all weeks worked. The phrase "weeks worked" excludes any week other than a week in which the Employee earned a wage. The Employer shall
12
transmit to DRIVE National Headquarters on a monthly basis, in one check, the total amount deducted along with the name of each Employee on whose behalf a deduction is made, the Employee's Social Security number and the amount deducted from that Employee's paycheck. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, shall reimburse the Employer annually for the Employer's actual cost for the expenses incurred in administering the weekly payroll deduction plan.
(c)	Teamsters 401 (k) Plan
When written authorization is given by the employees, the Employer agrees to deduct from the pay of such employees money for deposit in the Teamsters’ National 401 (k) Plan, if on the date of execution of this Agreement the Employer does not have its own existing 401 (k) Plan.
Should a company 40 l(k) plan provide for employer contributions, the Union may elect to choose such plan in lieu of the Teamsters 401(k) plan.
Replacement Employment
Section 6(a). The Employer agrees to give first opportunity for work as a replacement Employee to those Employees on letter of lay-off from an Employer member of the MCLAC/CRTA multiemployerunit. This obligation shall apply only at terminals located within the jurisdiction of Local Union 705. The Local Union will furnish each Employer with the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of those laid off Employees interested in replacement work opportunity and the job each Employee is qualified to perform. Where applicable, replacement employment may not be offered to laid off employees under this provision ahead of preferential replacements nor shall this provision supersede an
13
established order of call contained in this Agreement.
Regular Employment
Section 6(b). The Employer agrees to offer regular employment to those Employees on letter of lay-off from an Employer member of the MCLAC/CRTA or TMI multi-employer unit at other terminals located within the jurisdiction of Local Union 705 who have made application for regular employment at the terminal offering regular employment in accordance with the following order, unless an agreed to practice provides an order of call other than as follows, then such other order of call shall supersede the following:
1.	Preferential replacement/supplemental where applicable.
2.	Employees of the Employer, on a seniority basis.
3.	Employees of other MCLAC/CRTA or TMI Employer members based on the date such Employees made application.
Employees who accrue seniority under this provision who are on lay-off from another Employer shall retain their seniority at the Employer he/she is laid off from until such time as recalled to that Employer. In such cases, the employee must either accept recall and forfeit seniority with the new Employer or refuse recall and forfeit seniority at the Employer is being recalled to.
In order to be eligible for either replacement or regular employment opportunity under this provision, the laid-off employee must meet the minimum hiring standards established by the employer and be otherwise qualified to perform the work available and must be able to report for work in compliance with the employer’s established call-time procedures. The employer’s hiring standards and examinations shall be applied uniformly to all applicants for employment. The employer shall provide the hiring
14
standards and examinations upon written request of the Local Union. Employees who are offered work opportunity under this provision shall be able to furnish proof of their qualification to perform the work available.
Any employment examination for applicant must test skills or physical abilities necessary for performance of the work in the job classification in which the applicant will be employed. Violations of this subsection shall be subject to the grievance procedure.

Cost-of-Living
Section 2.	All regular employees shall be covered by the provisions of a cost-of-living allowance as set forth in this Article.
The amount of the cost-of-living allowance shall be determined as provided below on the basis of the “Consumer Price Index for
17
Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers”, CPI-W (Revised Series Using 1982-84 Expenditure Patterns), All Items (1982-84=100), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor and referred to herein as the “Index”.
Effective April 1,2004, and every April 1 thereafter during the life of the Agreement, a cost of living allowance will be calculated on the basis of the difference between the Index for January, 2003 (published February 2003) and the Index for January, 2004 (published February 2004) with a similar calculation for every year thereafter as follows:
For every 0.2 point increase in the Index, over and above the base (prior year’s) Index plus 3.0% there will be a 1 cent increase in the hourly wage rates payable on April 1,2004, and every April 1 thereafter. These increases shall only be payable if they equal a minimum of five cents ($0.05) in a year.
All cost of living allowances paid under this agreement will become and remain a fixed part of the base wage rate for all job classifications. A decline in the Index shall not result in the reduction of classification base wage rates.
In the event the appropriate Index figure is not issued before the effective date of the cost-of-living adjustment, the cost of living adjustment that is required will be made at the beginning of the first (1st) pay period after the receipt of the Index.
In the event that the Index shall be revised or discontinued and in the event the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor does not issue information which would enable the Employer and the Union to know what the Index would have been had it not been
18
revised or discontinued, then the employer and the Union will meet, negotiate, and agree upon an appropriate substitute for the Index. Upon the failure of the parties to agree within sixty (60) days, thereafter, the issue of an appropriate substitute shall be submitted to an arbitrator for determination. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding.

Overtime
Section 5.	(a) Time and one-half shall be paid for all work performed by an Employee before and after his/her regular scheduled work day. Time and one-half rate shall be paid after eight (8) hours in one day and after forty (40) hours in any one (1) week, except as otherwise provided in Article 4 (Hours), but overtime shall not be paid twice for the same hours worked.

25
work whenever practical and reasonable.
Weekly
Section 3.	(a) The first ninety percent (90%) by seniority, of Employees called or put to work during any day of the regular work week (Monday through Friday) shall be guaranteed forty (40) straight time hours of work or the full equivalent of pay for such regular work week, but the Employer shall be exempt from such weekly guarantee if (1) an Employee at his/her own initiative takes off a regularly scheduled work day during such work week, or is laid off, or discharged for just cause, or (2) the Employer has not directly or indirectly caused a work stoppage, such as fire, destruction or emergency, which as a proximate result thereof caused a complete stoppage of all the Employer's operations.

Supplemental Employees
Injured on Job and Compensation Claims
Section 4. (a) Employees injured on the job shall not forfeit their daily guarantee for such day notwithstanding the fact that such injuries prevented them from working the full scheduled day. An Employee who was injured on the job, and is sent home, or to a hospital, or who must obtain medical attention, shall receive pay at the applicable hourly rate for the balance of his/her regular shift on that day. An Employee who has returned to his/her regular duties after sustaining a compensable injury who is required by the Workers' Compensation doctor to receive additional medical treatment during his/her regularly scheduled working hours shall receive his/her regular hourly rate of pay for such time.
(b)	Modified Work
(1)	The Employer may establish a modified work program designed to provide temporary opportunity to those employees who are unable to perform their normal work assignments due to a disabling on-the-job injury. Recognizing that a transitional return-to-work program offering both physical and mental therapeutic benefits will accelerate the rehabilitative process of an injured employee, modified work programs are intended to enhance worker's compensation benefits and are not to be utilized as a method to take advantage of an employee who has sustained an industrial injury nor are they intended to be a permanent replacement for regular employment.
(2)	Implementation of a modified work program shall be at the Employer's option and shall be in strict compliance with
27
applicable federal and stale worker's compensation statutes. Acceptance of modified work shall be on a voluntary basis at the option of the injured employee. However, refusal to accept modified work by an employee, otherwise entitled to worker's compensation benefits, may result in a loss or reduction of such benefits as specifically provided by the provisions of applicable federal or stale worker's compensation statutes. Employees who accept modified work shall continue to be eligible to receive "temporary partial" worker's compensation benefits as well as all other entitlements as provided by applicable federal or state worker's compensation statutes. Employees who need additional medical and/or physical therapy, may go for such treatments during scheduled hours for modified work whenever practical and reasonable.
(3)	At facilities where the Employer has a modified work program in place, temporary modified assignments shall be offered in seniority order to those regular full time employees who are temporarily disabled due to a compensable worker's compensation injury and who have received a detailed medical release from the attending physician clearly setting forth the limitations under which the employee may perform such modified assignments. Once a modified work assignment is made and another person is injured, the second person must wait until a modified work opening occurs, regardless of seniority. All modified work assignments must be made in strict compliance with the physical restrictions as outlined by the attending physician. All modified work program candidates must be released for eight (8) hours per day, five (5) days per week. The Employer at his/her option, may make a modified work offer of less than eight (8) hours per day where such work is expected to accelerate the rehabilitative process and the attending physician recommends that the employee works back to regular status or up to eight (8) hours per day by
28
progressively increasing daily hours. A copy of any release for modified work must be given to the employee before the modified work assignment begins.
It is understood and agreed that those employees who, consistent with professional medical evaluations and opinion, may not be expected to receive an unrestricted medical release, or whose injury has been medically determined to be permanent and stationary, shall not be eligible to participate in a modified work program.
In the event of a dispute related to conflicting medical opinion, such dispute shall be resolved pursuant to established worker’s compensation law and/or the following method:
When there is a dispute between two (2) physicians concerning the release of an Employee for modified work, such two (2) physicians shall immediately select a third (3rd) neutral physician within seven (7) days, whom shall possess the same qualifications as the most qualified of the 2 selecting physicians, whose opinion shall be final and binding on the employer, the union and the employee. In the event the availability of a qualified doctor is in question, the Local Union and the Company shall resolve such matter by selecting the third (3rd) physician, whose opinion shall be final and binding on the Employer, the Union and the Employee. The expense of the third (3rd) physician shall be equally divided between the Employer and the Union. Disputes concerning the selection of the neutral physician or back wages shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
For locations where the Employer intends to implement a modified work program or has a modified work program in place, the Local Union shall be provided with a copy of the current
29
form(s) being used for employee evaluation for release and general job descriptions. This information shall be general in nature, not employee specific.
When a modified work assignment is made, the employee shall be provided with the hours and days he/she is scheduled to work as well as the nature of the work to be performed in writing. A copy of this notice shall also be submitted to the Local Union.
An employee who is placed in a modified work position may be subject to medical cvaluation(s) by a physician selected by the Employer to determine if the modified work being performed is accelerating the rehabilitative process as anticipated by Section 2 above. In the event such medical evaluation(s) determine that the rehabilitative process is not being accelerated, the employee shall have the right to seek a second opinion from a physician of his/her choosing. Any disputes regarding conflicting medical claims shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions outlined above. The employee may be removed from the modified work program based upon final medical findings under this procedure. Employees so removed shall not have their workers’ compensation benefits affected because of such removal. In the event the employee's temporary disability workers compensation benefit is subject to reduction by virtue of an applicable Federal or State statute, the Employer shall pay the difference between the amount of the reduced temporary workers compensation benefit and the amount of the full temporary workers' compensation benefit to which the employee would be entitled.
(4)	Modified work shall be restricted to the type of work that is not expected to result in a re-injury and which can be performed within medical limitations set forth by the attending physician. In the event the employee, in his/her judgment, is
30
physically unable to perform the modified work assigned, he/she shall be either reassigned modified work within his/her physical capabilities or returned to full "temporary total" worker’s compensation benefits. In the event a third (3rd) party insurance carrier refuses to reinstate such employee to full temporary total disability benefits, the Employer shall be required to pay the difference between the amount of the benefit paid by such third (3rd) party insurer and full total temporary disability benefits.
Determination of physical capabilities shall be based on the physician's medical evaluation. Under no condition will the injured employee be required to perform work at that location subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Prior to acceptance of modified work, the affected employee shall be furnished a written job description of the type of work to be performed.
(5)	The modified workday and workweek shall be established by the Employer within the limitations set forth by the attending physician. However, the workday shall not exceed eight (8) hours, inclusive of coffee breaks where applicable and exclusive of a one-half (‘/a) hour meal period and the workweek shall not exceed forty (40) hours, Monday through Friday, or Tuesday through Saturday, unless the nature of the modified work assignment requires a scheduled workweek to include Sunday. Whenever possible, the Employer will schedule modified work during daylight hours, Monday through Friday, or during the same general working hours and on the same workweek that the employee enjoyed before he/she became injured. In the case of an employee whose workdays and/or hours routinely varied, the Employer will schedule the employee based on the availability of the modified assignment being offered. Any alleged abuse of the assignment of workdays and work hours shall be subject to the grievance procedure.
31
(6)	Modified work time shall be considered as time worked when necessary to satisfy vacation and sick leave eligibility requirements as set forth in this Agreement. In addition to earned vacation pay as set forth in this Agreement, employees accepting modified work shall receive prorated vacation pay for modified work performed based on the weekly average modified work pay. The only time modified work is used in prorating vacation is when the employee did not qualify under this Agreement.
Holiday pay shall first be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement as it relates to on-the-job injuries. Once such contractual provisions have been satisfied, holidays will be paid at the modified work rate which is the modified work wage plus the temporary partial disability benefit.
Sick leave and funeral leave taken while an employee is performing modified work will be paid at the modified work rate, which is the modified work wage plus the temporary partial disability benefit. Unused sick leave will be paid at the applicable contract rate where the employee performed modified work and qualified for the sick leave during the contract year.
(7)	The Employer shall continue to remit contributions to the appropriate health & welfare and pension trusts during the entire time period employees are performing modified work. The payment of health & welfare and pension contributions while the employee is on modified work is not included in the health and welfare and pension contributions required by this Agreement when an employee is off work on workers’ compensation. Continuation of such contributions beyond the period of time specified in this Agreement for on-the-job injury shall be required. Provisions of this Section shall not be utilized as a reason to disqualify or remove an employee from the modified work program.
32
(8)	Employees accepting modified work shall receive temporary partial benefits as determined by each respective state workers' compensation law, plus a modified work wage when added to such temporary partial benefit, shall equal not less than eighty-five percent (85%) of forty (40) hours’ pay he/she would otherwise be entitled to under the provisions of this Agreement for the first six (6) months from the date the modified work assignment commences. After this initial six (6) month period, the percentage shall increase to ninety percent (90%) for the duration of each individual modified work assignment. The Employer shall not refuse to assign modified work to employees based solely on such employees reaching the ninety percent (90%) wage level. Such refusal shall be considered an abuse of the program and shall be subject to the grievance procedure. Modified work assignments beginning or ending within a workweek shall be paid on a prorated basis; one (1) day equals one fifth (1 /5th).
(9)	Employees accepting modified work shall not be subject to disciplinary action provisions of this Agreement unless such violation involves an offense for which no prior warning notice is required under this Agreement (Cardinal Sins). Additionally, the provisions of Article 23, Section 9, shall apply.
(10)	Alleged abuses of the modified work program by the Employer and any factual grievance or request for interpretation concerning this Article shall be submitted directly to the Local 7O5/M.C.L.A.C./C.R.T.A Joint Area Grievance Committee. Proven abuses may result in a determination by the Local 705/M.C.L.A.C/C.R.T.A, Joint Area Grievance Committee that would withdraw the benefits of this Article from that Employer, in whole or in part, in which case affected employees shall immediately revert to full worker's compensation benefits.
33
(c)	The Employer shall provide any injured Employee transportation at the time of injury from the job to the medical facility and return to the job, or to his/her home, if required.
(d)	In the event of a fatality, arising in the course of employment, while away from the home terminal, the Employer shall return the deceased to his/her home at the point of domicile.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Section 5.	The Union and the Employer recognize their obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act. It is agreed that the Employer shall determine whether an employee is a qualified individual with a disability under the ADA and, if so, what reasonable accommodation, if any, should be provided. In the event that the Employer determines that a reasonable accommodation is necessary, the Employer shall notify the Local Union before providing the reasonable accommodation to a qualified bargaining unit employee to ensure that the reasonable accommodation selected by the Employer does not impact another employee’s seniority or other contract rights.
Any dispute over whether the Employer complied with its’ duty to notify the Local Union before implementing a proposed reasonable accommodation or whether providing the reasonable accommodation violates any employee’s rights under any other provision of this Agreement shall be subject to the grievance procedure. Disputes over whether the Employer has complied with its’ legal requirements under the ADA, including the ADA requirement to provide a reasonable accommodation, however, shall not be subject to the grievance procedure.
34
Late Rule
Section 6.	Employees reporting after their scheduled shift start will be allowed to punch in up to thirty (30) minutes late and will be guaranteed eight (8) hours from the punch. Tardiness will be dealt with in accordance with the Discipline Procedures set forth in Article 19 (Grievance Procedure).
