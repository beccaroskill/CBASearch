Appendix A
Longevity Increment Eligibility Rules
The following rules shall govern the eligibility of Employees for the longevity increments provided for in Article TIT, Section 9, of the 2002-2005 Principal Administrative Associates, et al. agreement:
1.	Only service in pay status shall be used to calculate the 15 years of service, except that for other than full time per annum Employees only a continuous year of service in pay status shall be used to calculate the 15 years of service. A continuous year of service shall be a full year of service without a break of more than 31 days. Where the regular and customary work year for a title is less than a twelve month year such as a school year, such regular and customary year shall be credited as a continuous year of service counting towards the 15 years of service. If the normal work year for an Employee is less than the regular and customary work year for the employee’s title, it shall be counted as a continuous year of service if the Employee has customarily worked that length of work year and the applicable agency verifies that information.
2.	Service in pay status prior to any breaks in service of more than one year shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service. Where an Employee has less than seven years of continuous service in pay status, breaks in service of less than one year shall be aggregated. Where breaks in service aggregate to more than one year they shall be treated as a break in service of more than one year and the service prior to such breaks and the aggregated breaks shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service. No break used to disqualify service shall be used more than once.
3.	The following time in which an Employee is not in pay status shall not constitute a break in service as specified in the paragraph 2 above.
a.	Time on a leave approved by the proper authority which is consistent with the Rules and Regulations of the New York City Personnel Director or the appropriate personnel authority of a covered organization.
b.	Time prior to reinstatement.
c.	Time on a preferred list pursuant to Civil Service Law Sections 80 and 81 or any similar contractual provision.
d.	Time not in pay status of 31 days or less.
Notwithstanding the above, such time as specified in subsections a, b, and c above shall not be used to calculate the 15 years of service.
Principal Administrative Associates, et al.
Term: July 1,2002 - June 30, 2005
36
4.	Once an Employee has completed the 15 years of "City" service in pay status and is eligible to receive the $925 longevity increment, the $925 shall become part of the Employee’s base rate for all purposes except as provided in paragraph 5 below.
5.	The $925 longevity increment shall not become pensionable until 15 months after the Employee becomes eligible to receive such $925 increment. Fifteen months after the Employee becomes eligible to receive the $925 longevity increment, such $925 longevity increment shall become pensionable, and as part of the Employee’s base rate, shall be subject to the general increase provided in Article in, Section 3, of this Agreement.

Appendix B
Guidelines on Merit Increases for Sub-Managerial Employees
In awarding merit increases to sub-managerial Employees, agency heads must adhere to the following guidelines:
1.	An increase in duties within a title ordinarily shall not be considered the basis for a merit adjustment. If the increase in duties is significant, the position should be reevaluated to a higher level.
2.	Only one merit adjustment or provisional promotion can be granted to an Employee within any twelve month period.
3.	Merit adjustment must be limited to Employees with above-average ratings on their annual performance evaluations. A copy of the performance evaluation must be submitted to the Department of Personnel and the Mayor’s Office with the Monthly Planned Action Report.

Re: 2002 - 2005 CWA Local 1180 Agreement
Dear Mr. Cheliotes:
This letter is to confirm certain mutual understandings and agreements regarding the above-captioned agreement.
The parties agree to establish a “Joint Labor Management Committee on Productivity Initiatives” (“Committee”).
Composition of the Committee
The Committee shall comprise representatives designated by: the Deputy Mayor for Operations, the Law Department, the Office of Labor Relations, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Operations, and CWA Local 1180.
Goals and Objectives
The Committee shall work to identify efficiencies in the administration and delivery of governmental services which shall in turn be utilized to provide additional compensation to employees. This agreement expresses the joint labor and management commitment to associate improved City service and performance with appropriate compensation for the workforce.
The goal of the Committee’s work shall be to identify, review, recommend and develop initiatives that generate workplace savings, maximize the potential of the City workforce and ensure the provision of essential services while at the same time improving compensation for the City
Principal Administrative Associates, et al.	45	Term: July 1, 2002 - June 30, 2005 C
workforce. To that end, the parties will seek to identify quantifiable savings while at the same time maintaining or improving City services.
The Committee shall make all reasonable efforts to issue a report or reports on or about October 1, 2004 which propose initiatives representing meaningful, quantifiable, recurring savings to the City and which generate funding to be utilized to compensate employees. Upon completion and acceptance of all committee members of the report, an additional one percent (1%) increase shall be paid to employees covered by this agreement.
The parties agree to meet and negotiate the application of any additional savings above 1 % generated by the programs developed by the Committee.
Areas for Consideration
The Committee’s study may encompass such matters, including, but not limited to, work rule modifications, absence control, contracting in, workers compensation and other efficiencies.
1.	Sick leave usage. The Committee will seek to design a program to examine baseline data as to sick leave usage as a benchmark for comparison. The goal will be to reduce employee sick leave usage on an ongoing basis as a productivity enhancement.
2.	Contracting-in. The Committee shall identify areas wherein City services are now being outsourced with the goal of providing those services by City employees with a cost savings to the City.
3.	Workers Compensation Cost Containment Task Force. The Committee shall create a special task force, requesting such assistance of cost containment experts as necessary, with the goal of developing reforms that emphasize effective treatments and speed the return to work; that explore the manner in which treatment services are provided; that set specific standards of evaluation and treatment; and that serve to root out fraudulent claims.
4.	Such other areas as the Committee may mutually agree.
Resolution of Disputes
The initiatives and programs developed pursuant to this Committee must be unanimously agreed upon. In the event there is a dispute as to the amount of savings generated by an initiative or the implementation of a program, or the savings generated by a program are not paid pursuant to this agreement, it shall be submitted to arbitration upon written notice therefor by any of the parties to this Agreement to the party with whom such dispute or controversy exists. The matter submitted for arbitration shall be submitted to an arbitration panel consisting of the three impartial members of the Board of Collective Bargaining pursuant to Title 61 of the Rules of the City of New York. Any award in such arbitration proceeding shall be final and binding and shall be enforceable pursuant to Article 75 of the CPLR.

Fifteen months after the employee begins to receive the $925 longevity increment, such $925 longevity increment shall become pensionable and as part of the employee’s base rate, the $925 longevity increment shall be subject to the general increases provided in Section 3 B(a) of this Agreement.
