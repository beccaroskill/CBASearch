Section 2.	The Employer reserves and shall have the right to accept or reject, to employ or not to employ, any person referred by the Union, which referrals shall be made nondiscriminatory, or to discharge for cause any employee who has been accepted but who subsequently proves unsatisfactory to the Employer.
Section 3.	The Employer shall be the sole judge of, and have the right to determine the number of employees required on any job, or any portion of the work being done by the Employer. There shall be no limitation as to the amount of work an employee shall perform. There shall be no restrictions as to the use of machinery, tools, or appliances.
Section 4.	The Employer shall not employ any person from outside the Industry if any qualified member of the bargaining unit is available for hire. Failure of any Employer to comply with this Section shall be considered a violation of this Agreement and the Union shall have the right to strike to enforce compliance therewith, any contrary provision in this Agreement notwithstanding.
ARTICLE 2
Equal Employment Opportunity
Section 1.	The Employers hereby agree that they will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, national origin, age or sex. The Employer will take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated fairly without regard to race, creed, color, national origin, age or sex. Such action shall include but not be limited to: employment, promotion, demotion, transfer, recruitment advertising, layoff, termination, wage rates or other forms of compensation, and selection for training.
Section 2.	The Union agrees that it will not discriminate against any applicant for employment or referral because of race, creed, color, national origin, age or sex; and refer them without discrimination because of race, creed, color, national origin, age or sex if their qualifications meet those required by the Employer.

Section 1.	It is understood and agreed that all Employers shall each month submit to the Union a complete list of their Mason Tender employees so long as the Union requires the same.
Section 2.	The Union office provides a valuable and essential service to the Employer and the Industry in maintaining a supply of experienced workmen. In recognition of this service, and in order to maintain efficiency, the Employer shall give first consideration to the Local Union Office having territorial jurisdiction over the actual job site to secure new and additional qualified and experienced workmen. The Employer has the right to rehire any employee who has been on the Employer’s payroll during the preceding twelve (12) months.
Section 3.	If qualified and experienced workmen are not available from the Local Union Office having territorial jurisdiction over the actual job site, then the Employer shall secure workmen from the remaining local unions signatory to this Agreement.

Continued employment of persons who were in the employ of the Employer prior to the date of this Agreement and who are not now members of the Union shall be conditional upon those persons becoming members of the Union not later than the eighth (8th) day following the execution date of this Agreement. The failure of any person to become a member of the Union at such required times shall obligate the Employer, upon written notice from the Union to such effect and to the further effect that Union membership was available to such person on the same terms and conditions generally available to other members, to forthwith discharge such person. Further, the failure of any person to continue payment of the periodic dues of the Union as required herein shall, upon written notice to the Employer by the Union to such effect, obligate the Employer to discharge such person. The foregoing requirement of “Union membership” may be met, irrespective of actual membership in the Union, by paying an amount equivalent to the Union’s regular initiation fees and periodic dues.

Audits: The Employer agrees that any of the trust organizations or agencies receiving a portion of the Employer’s fringe benefit or contribution payments, either singularly or as a group, have the right to verify the accuracy of the Employer's monthly reports and reconcile the number of mason tender hours worked in any given month with the number of stamps purchased. This verification may be accomplished by the individual trust or agency, or group thereof, having their respective employees, agents, representative or accountants audit and examine, during the Employer's regular business hours, the Employer's weekly payroll journal, individual mason tender's earnings records, copies of federal payroll tax records for mason tenders, and other mason tender pay records as may be necessary to allow such examiner to determine whether the Employer is making full and complete monthly reports of hours worked and has purchased the necessary number of stamps as required by this Agreement. If such examination shows that the Employer has not made a full reporting of the number of hours worked in a given month, or if the Employer has not purchased stamps equal to the number of hours worked, the cost of the examination shall be paid by the Employer. The Employer will not be required to pay the cost of the examination if an error in the reported number of hours worked or stamps purchased is the result of inadvertent or immaterial error, or clerical mistake.
e.	The Employer agrees that if an examination or audit of the Employer's payroll records proves the number of stamps purchased was less than the actual number of mason tender hours worked, the Employer will pay as liquidated damages, in addition to the amount of fringe benefits and Employer contributions due, an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the fringe benefits and Employer contributions due but not paid

If the Union elects to direct its members to cease work for an Employer, it must provide the Employer and the Mason Contractors Association written notice not less than seventy-two (72) hours prior to the cessation of work.

Stamps will be made available in 1/4, 1 and 8 hour units. No other charge shall be made for the stamps.

Apprenticeship
Apprenticeship: Notwithstanding provisions pertaining to the hiring of employees contained elsewhere in this Agreement, it is agreed that, except for persons who were employed at any time before March 1, 2005 as a journey level laborer on work within the area limits of this Agreement, an Employer may not continue to employ an employee hired after that date unless the employee has, within eight (8) days after commencing such employment, registered for whichever of the following training requirements is applicable, and thereafter pursues such training to completion.
•	If the employee has less than 4,000 hours of documented previous construction experience, the employee must register, with a letter of intent to hire from the Employer, to enter the Construction Craft Laborers’ Apprenticeship Program for Eastern Missouri. If the employee has previous construction experience, the employee may be advanced to a period of apprenticeship appropriate to the employee’s documented working experience and demonstrated job skills, as determined solely by the Joint Apprenticeship Committee.
13
•	If the employee has 4,000 or more hours of documented previous construction experience, the employee must register with a letter of intent to hire from the Employer, and enroll and complete the OSHA Safety & Health and Industry Orientation classes, by the Laborers-AGC Training Center (High Hill, MO), or other location approved by the Joint Apprenticeship Committee.
An employee who has once completed the applicable training requirement shall not be required to repeat such training on account of later employment by a different Employer.
For purposes of this agreement, the term journey level laborer shall mean the same as general laborer.
The parties to this agreement hereby incorporate into this Agreement the Apprenticeship Standards for the Apprenticeable Occupation of Construction Craft Laborer (D.O.T. #869.463-580), as registered and approved on October 23, 1995 by the Bureau Of Apprenticeship and Training of the U.S. Department of Labor for the Eastern portion of the State of Missouri, including the St. Louis metropolitan area, under Registration Number MO-002-95002, including any amendments or modifications heretofore made, or which may be made, during the life of this agreement, and the Employer and the Union agree to be bound by the terms and provisions thereof.
The Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee (hereinafter referred to as "committee") referred to herein shall mean the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee established under the aforementioned standards. The apprenticeship program shall be administered by the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee. The Employer and the Union agree to be bound by the decisions of the Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee.
The apprenticeship program shall be a "letter of intent" type of program which shall allow for persons to enter the apprenticeship program provided they have an employer willing to employ them for the term of apprenticeship under the terms of the standards. Apprentices enrolled pursuant to these standards shall be indentured to the committee.
The term of apprenticeship shall be for two years (4,000 hours) of diversified work and on-the-job training, excluding time spent in off-the-job related instruction and training.
Apprentices must complete a minimum of 288 hours of off-the-job related instruction and training in an individual educational program (hereinafter referred to as "IEP") as determined by the Committee, in order to successfully complete the apprenticeship program. Apprentices must attend all off-the-job related instruction and training as assigned and scheduled. Apprentices not attending classes to which they are assigned and scheduled shall be cancelled from the apprenticeship program. Any persons so cancelled shall not be eligible for employment in the apprenticeship classification by any employer signatory to a collective bargaining agreement providing for such classification and negotiated by the Eastern Missouri Laborers' District Council or any of its affiliated Local Unions.
Apprentices shall not be entitled to payment of wages, nor shall the employer be responsible for payment of fringe benefit contributions, for time spent in off-the-job related instruction or training - and no such time spent by an apprentice shall be considered in the hours of work for pay purposes.
Apprentices must complete assigned and scheduled off-the-job related instruction and training within prescribed working hours as follows:
14
Period 1
1 - 499 hours of work
50% of journey level hourly rate
Period 2
60% of journey level hourly rate
500 - 1,499 hours of work
Period 3	70% of journey level hourly rate
1,500 - 2,499 hours of work and completion of 144 total hours of off-the-job related IEP instruction
Period 4	80% of journey level hourly rate
2,500 - 3,499 hours of work and completion of 216 total hours of off-the-job related IEP instruction
Period 5	90% of journey level hourly rate
3,500 - 3,999 hours of work and completion of 288 total hours of off-the-job related IEP instruction
Journey Level	100% of journey level hourly rate
4,000 hours of work and completion of all off-the-job related IEP instruction
Employers shall make full payment of all fringe benefit contributions provided for in this agreement for each hour worked by apprentices in their employ.
Applications for apprenticeship will be accepted Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. at the Apprenticeship office of the Laborers-AGC Training Center (High Hill, MO). Receiving of applications shall be stopped by the committee whenever it determines that sufficient apprentices are enrolled in the program to meet anticipated worker requirements, or it finds that excessive numbers of apprentices already in the program are unemployed. The committee will resume receiving applications when, in the opinion of the committee, the condition or conditions warranting the cessation of receiving applications no longer exists.
Employers shall be allowed: one (1) apprentice when employing two (2) or more journey level mason tenders; two (2) apprentices when employing ten (10) or more journey level mason tenders; three (3) apprentices when employing fifteen (15) or more journey level mason tenders; four (4) apprentices when employing twenty (20) or more journey level mason tenders. Employers employing more than twenty-five (25) journey level laborers shall be entitled to employ one (1) additional apprentice for each additional five (5) journey level laborers employed.
In the event a specific project warrants additional manpower requirements above the ability of the Local Union to provide workmen, the above apprentice to journey level worker ratios may be waived by the Eastern Missouri Laborers’ District Council.
15
In the event of temporary reduction of workforce, the employer shall reduce the number of apprentices in accordance with the above and promptly notify the committee of the name of the apprentice. Apprentices so temporarily laid off will have their names placed in a pool and will be available for employment by employers desiring to employ apprentices during times that the committee is not accepting new applications for apprentices.
Apprentices shall work at all times under the supervision of a competent and qualified journey level mason tender employed by the same Employer.
Apprentices shall be subject to the same working conditions as the Employer's journey level mason tenders. However, it is expressly agreed and understood that employers shall assign apprentices to different job tasks so as to allow them to become adept at a variety of operations and work skills.
No person who has previously been employed as a journey level mason tender shall be eligible for employment as an apprentice.
Should any provision of this article be contrary to or in violation of any applicable existing law or statute hereafter promulgated, then in that event such provision shall be void and of no force and effect, but all other provisions of this article shall continue in full force and effect.
Any contractor involved in litigation or pre-litigation with any Laborers’ Benefit Fund will be ineligible for any additional apprentices.
It is hereby agreed and understood that any person entering but failing to maintain and complete his or her Apprenticeship shall not be employed by the Employer as a Journey Level Mason Tender under this Agreement. Further, the failure of any Apprentice to maintain his or her Apprenticeship status shall, upon written notice to the Employer by the Union to such effect, obligate the Employer to discharge such person.
ARTICLE 21
Reduced Rate for Residential Work
The parties hereby agree that at such time as Bricklayers’ Local Union #1 of Missouri agrees to and accepts a reduced wage and/or compensation rate for employment of its members in residential construction, this Agreement will be immediately revised so that Employer will pay mason tenders working on residential construction a similar reduced wage and/or compensation rate.
ARTICLE 22
Effective Dates
This Agreement shall be and remain in full force and effect through the 28th day of February 2010. The Agreement shall renew from year to year thereafter unless either party serves written notice to the other of a desire to terminate or modify the Agreement not less than sixty (60) days or more than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date or any extended expiration date. Within thirty (30) days after such notice is received, a committee of representatives of the respective parties hereto shall meet and endeavor to come to an agreement on any matter at issue.
