ARTICLE I	- INTENT AND PURPOSE
THE PURPOSE of this Agreement is to assure the efficient and economical operation of the Authority; to secure and sustain the maximum work effort of each employee covered by this Agreement; to maintain a harmonious relationship between the employees in the bargaining unit and the Authority; to establish wages, hours and working conditions; and further, to set forth the entire Agreement between the Authority, the Union and the employees covered by this Agreement, concerning rates of pay, wages, and other conditions of employment to be observed by the parties hereto.
ARTICLE II	- RECOGNITION AND NON-DISCRIMINATION
Section 2.01: Recognition
THE AUTHORITY recognizes the Union as the exclusive bargaining representative in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment and other conditions of employment for all employees of the Authority not excluded as supervisory. The parties agree that, although the positions are not in existence, should the Authority employ Utility (I or II) or Janitor (I or II) classifications during the term of this Agreement, individuals employed in those positions shall be within the recognition provided under this Section.
Section 2.02: Union Membership
It is not a condition of employment with the Authority to become or remain a member of a labor organization or bargaining representative. Any employee of the Authority may join or refrain from joining a labor organization or bargaining representative. Moreover, no employee of the Authority is required to pay to any labor organization, charitable organization or third party an amount that is in lieu of, equivalent to, or any portion of dues, fees, assessments, or other charges or expenses required of members of or public employees represented by a labor organization or bargaining representative. Regardless of what individual voluntary free choice is made by an employee, it shall not affect the employee’s employment with the Authority.
1
Section 2.03: Union Checkoff
THE AUTHORITY will deduct, initiation fees, dues and assessments from the pay of any member of the Union who voluntarily authorizes such deduction as provided in this Section. Initiation fees, and assessments, if any, will be deducted on the first pay day of each month. Dues will be deducted from the second pay day of each successive month. The authorization for such deduction is to be on a form provided by the Union.
The Union agrees to indemnify and hold the Authority harmless for any costs, attorneys’ fees and/or damages which may be incurred by and/or assessed against the Authority from any suit, claim or other action brought against the Authority as a consequence of the Authority’s compliance with the checkoff provisions for union initiation fees, dues and assessments under this Section. The Authority agrees to notify the Union in writing at the time of any inquiry or claim made pursuant to this section. The Authority further agrees to work and cooperate with the Union’s attomey(s) as pertains to this Section.
The Authority also agrees to deduct all share purchases, loans and interest payments made by the Credit Union members as submitted on authorization slips by the Treasurer, and remit the same to the Treasurer of the Credit Union.
Section 2.04: Bulletin Boards
BULLETIN BOARDS will be provided for the Transportation and Maintenance Departments, with the location to be in full view of the members of the Union. These boards shall be for the exclusive use of the Union Officers to post bulletins and notices of their meetings or other Union business that may come up, provided that nothing obnoxious or detrimental to the interests of the Authority shall be posted on such boards. Postings containing statements adversely portraying ITP employees and/or religious or political messages are prohibited from posting on the bulletin board.
Section 2.05: Recognized Union Representatives
THE ACCREDITED officers who shall conduct all business under the provisions of this Agreement, on the part of the Union, shall be the President, Business Agent, Executive Board, or such additional representatives as may be selected and designated under the bylaws of the Union. The accredited officer who shall conduct all business for the Authority under the provisions of this Agreement shall be the CEO, or their designee, whose decision shall be final.
The Union shall keep the Authority constantly advised of the names and addresses of its officers, and the members of its committee authorized to bargain with the Authority. The Authority shall be notified, in writing, of the names of the Union Officers and members of the Union’s committee, their alternates, and in what representative capacity they are to serve before the Authority shall be required to recognize them.
2
Section 2.06: Union-Management Communications
COMMUNICATIONS, WRITTEN or verbal, between the Union and the Authority, shall be addressed to the proper officers. When necessary to have conferences between management or staff of the Authority and officers of the Union, they shall be conducted in the offices of the Authority unless otherwise agreed upon. Such conferences shall be held at the date and time agreed upon and mutual respect shall at all times be shown between representatives of the Authority and Union.
Section 2.07: Union Officers Special Days Off
UNION OFFICERS CALLED upon to transact business of the Union or the Authority requiring their absence from duty shall, upon application (written if practicable), be allowed to absent themselves from duty for a sufficient time to transact such business, provided the number applying for leave of absence shall not be so great as to be detrimental to service obligations of the Authority. No employee shall engage in Union activities during working hours' without permission from a Department Manager. Union Officers will not be paid when absent from duty to conduct Union business or represent Union members.
The Employer will release employees, without pay, to participate in committees that are established under this Agreement and on which they have been designated by the Union to serve. An employee may otherwise be released under these provisions on a case-by-case basis where the employee has been designated by the President of the Union in a written request for time off which has been approved by the Employer. The approval of a particular request does not bind the Employer in any future request.
Section 2.08: Non-Discrimination
THE AUTHORITY and the Union agree that there will be no discrimination against any employee for any reason contrary to provisions of Federal and State law.
Section 2.09: Temporary Employees
TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES engaged by the Authority shall not be required to become members of the Union, but shall be limited to (90) ninety working days of employment. What constitutes temporary work shall be agreed upon by the Authority and the Union.
ARTICLE ffl - MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
Section 3.01: Authority of Management
The Authority hereby reserves and retains all rights vested in the Authority. The parties expressly recognize that such management rights and authority include, by way of illustration, the following:
3
1.	The right to manage and administer the transit system, its policies, properties and facilities;
2.	The right to determine the location, types and amount of service to be provided, including the making of schedules, frequency of service, amount of time allowed on individuals runs, and composition of runs;
3.	The right to determine methods of operation and the equipment to be used in the operation of the Authority, including the introduction of new or improved methods or equipment;
4.	The right to develop and control the budget of the Authority;
5.	The right to determine the number and locations of its facilities;
6.	The right to hire, promote and determine the qualifications, job functions, job descriptions, assignments, placement and need for employees;
7.	The right to make and enforce reasonable policies and work rules;
8.	The right to discipline and discharge for just cause;
9.	The right to ensure the safety and security of employees, customers, then-property, and the property of the Authority;
The foregoing enumeration of rights is not intended to be all inclusive, but indicates the type of matters arising which belong to and are inherent to management and shall not be deemed to exclude other rights of the Employer not specifically set forth herein. The parties agree that the Authority will not exercise these rights in contradiction with the express provisions of this agreement or the mandates of federal or state law.
Section 3.02: Subcontracting
A.	The Authority has the right to subcontract demand response service in its entirety, both operations and maintenance. All line haul, deviated line haul, tripper, express routes, light rail, electric street car and other new forms of fixed-route service and the related maintenance will be performed by bargaining unit members, except as noted in subsection B below. Disputes regarding whether work is demand response or bargaining unit work may be resolved through the grievance procedure.
B.	The Authority may subcontract maintenance work when the work cannot reasonably be accomplished in-house. Prior to subcontracting maintenance work, the Authority will meet with the Union and demonstrate that the particular work cannot be reasonably performed in-house. The Union will not withhold its consent for subcontracting that cannot reasonably be performed in-house. Failure to provide prior notice, to seek Union
4
consent or demonstrate reasonable inability may be grieved through the grievance procedure.
The parties understand and hereby acknowledge that the parties have a longstanding history whereby certain subcontracting has been consented to, including where maintenance staff are not immediately available, trained, or hold the necessary licenses/certifications to safely and/or efficiently perform repairs or assist with a maintenance issue and that, during such occasions, the Authority is authorized to seek assistance from outside entities or current contractors (such as lawn care, certain vehicle repairs, facility repairs and construction, janitorial services, and the occasional assistance of the staff of the fuel lane provider).
Section 3.03: Discipline
The Authority has the ability to discipline and discharge employees for just cause. Disciplinary actions will be rendered in writing. A copy of the disciplinary action will be furnished to the disciplined individual upon request.
The Authority agrees to provide employees with Union Representation during any investigatory interview where the employee reasonably believes they may be subject to discipline and makes a request for Union Representation.
ARTICLE IV - GRIEVANCE AND ARBITRATION PROCEDURES
Section 4.01: Grievance Defined
A GRIEVANCE is defined to be:
A.	Any controversy between the Authority and the Union as to any matter involving the interpretation or application of the express terms of this Agreement as herein set forth; or
B.	Any controversy between the Authority and the Union as to whether or not any employee disciplined, suspended or discharged for violation of any rule of the Authority is guilty of such violation.
Section 4.02: Time Limit For Filing Grievances
A.	NO GRIEVANCE shall be entertained or considered unless it is presented in writing within ten (10) days after the incident occurred which gave rise to the controversy involving the interpretation or application of the terms of employment as herein set forth, or after the discipline, suspension or discharge of any employee for violation of a rule.
B.	Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, as defined in Section 13.01, shall be excluded in computing the time limits herein specified.
5
Section 4.03: Procedure
THE AUTHORITY and the Union agree to the following procedure of presenting and handling grievances, including steps, time limits and conditions:
Step 1: Any grievance presented in a due and timely manner as herein above provided shall be presented in writing by the Union's Grievance Committee to a Department Manager or designated representative of the Authority. The grievance shall be signed by the employee and a Union representative, setting forth the facts of the dispute, the relief sought and shall refer to the specific provision or provisions of the Agreement alleged to have been violated.
Within ten (10) working days after receipt of the written grievance, the Department Manager shall answer the grievance in writing.
Step 2: Such answer should be final unless the grievance is appealed by written notice given to the Authority's CEO or designee within ten (10) working days from the date of the Manager's written answer in Step 1.
A decision on said appeal shall be rendered within ten (10) working days after ‘ receipt of the written appeal by the CEO or designee in writing.
Step 3: Such answer shall be final unless the Union appeals the grievance to arbitration by submitting a Petition for Grievance Arbitration to the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) and_giving written notice of its desire to arbitrate to the Authority after receipt of the CEO's or designee's answer in Step 2. If the final appeal is rejected by the CEO or designee, the Union will have ten (10) days following its next monthly Union meeting to request arbitration.
If not so settled, and if arbitration shall not have been so demanded by the Union, such grievance shall be forever barred and extinguished.
Nothing herein above contained shall prevent the proper representative of either party from discussing any and all matters pertaining to grievances prior to their reduction to written form.
Section 4.04: Arbitration
A.	In the event the Union shall have demanded that a grievance be submitted to arbitration as herein above provided, the following procedures shall be observed:
In the event the parties are unable to agree upon an impartial arbitrator within fifteen (15) days after the service of a demand for arbitration as aforesaid, then and in that event the party pursuing arbitration shall forthwith, make application to the Michigan Employment Relations Commission for a list of fifteen (15)
6
names from which the parties shall select their impartial arbitrator unless the parties mutually agree to an alternative arbitrator. Either party shall have the right to reject the list and request a new one upon written notification to the other party and notice to MERC. If accepted, each party may strike any names , found unacceptable and then rank the remaining names in numerical order with the number “one” being the most preferred and return their selections to MERC within ten (10) days of the issuance of the panel of arbitrators. MERC shall select an arbitrator based upon the parties selections and notify the parties and arbitrator of the appointment in accordance with MERC’s arbitrator selection process.
B.	If it shall become necessary to appoint a successor for the impartial arbitrator, such successor shall be selected in the same manner as the original impartial arbitrator was selected. Any such successor arbitrator shall act with the same power and authority as though originally appointed.
C.	The parties may, upon mutual consent, agree to conduct an expedited arbitration. The expedited procedure shall require a bench decision from the impartial arbitrator without briefs being submitted by either party.
Section 4.05: Time Of Arbitration
THE ARBITRATION hearing shall be held at Grand Rapids, Michigan, at such time as may be mutually agreed upon between the parties and shall thereafter continue to meet on every day that it is practical until all of the evidence and arguments have been received and heard. The arbitrator shall be bound by and function in accordance with the Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
Section 4.06: Authority of the Arbitrator
THE ARBITRATOR shall be empowered to make a decision in cases of alleged violation of rights expressly accorded by this Agreement, and his decision will be final and binding on the parties. The arbitrator shall not add to, detract from, ignore or change any of the terms of this Agreement, nor any agreement made supplementary to this Agreement. The arbitrator shall not be empowered to consider any question or matter outside of this Agreement, to establish wage scales or rates on new or changed jobs, or to change any pay rate unless it is provided for in this Agreement. Such decision shall be delivered in writing within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the hearings. In addition, if the grievance concerns rights that are not otherwise limited by the express terms of this Agreement, the grievance shall not be arbitrable. If the issue of arbitrability is raised, an arbitrator shall not determine the merits of any grievance unless arbitrability has been affirmatively decided. Either party may require a bifurcated hearing in any proceeding in which the arbitrability of the grievance is at issue. Should the issue of arbitrability be raised, it will be determined via an expedited hearing (utilizing AAA or FMCS rules) or through the submission of briefs on the issue, prior to a hearing on the merits of the grievance. Where in dispute, the Arbitrator shall determine the necessity of an expedited hearing versus the submission of briefs.
7
Any award of the arbitrator shall not be retroactive more than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the time the grievance was first submitted in writing. An award to an employee who is found to have been wrongfully disciplined, suspended or discharged shall never exceed the employee's loss of earnings which shall be determined by deducting any wages or compensation (including unemployment compensation or workers compensation benefits) received by the employee from another Authority or from self-employment during the period he/she was out of service due to his/her suspension or discharge from what he/she would have earned had he/she not been suspended or discharged.
Section 4.07: Effect of Time Limits:
THE PARTIES agree to each of the foregoing steps in the processing of a grievance. For the purposes of the grievance procedure, selection of the arbitrator, and scheduling of any hearing, time is of the essence. Indeed, under no circumstances should any grievance “sit” without pursuit and/or further processing by the party pursuing the grievance for more than ten (10) calendar days (excluding Saturday’s, Sundays, and holidays under the parties Agreement), unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties. If the Union or its representative^) fail to follow the procedures within the periods defined herein, or fails to otherwise pursue a grievance in a timely fashion, the specific grievance at issue shall be considered abandoned and withdrawn with prejudice and no one shall have any power to review the grievance or issue any finding. If the Authority fails or neglects to answer a grievance within the time limits specified herein, the grievance shall be automatically referred to the next higher step in the grievance procedure except that nothing herein contained shall be construed to automatically advance a grievance to arbitration.
Section 4.08: Extension Of Time Limits
EXTENSIONS OF days to answer or move a grievance may be granted by mutual agreement, provided such extensions are presented in writing to the designated Authority or Union officials.
Section 4.09: Arbitration Expenses
THE FEES and expenses of the impartial arbitrator, as well as other joint expenses incidental to the arbitration, shall be borne equally by the parties. Each party to the arbitration shall bear the full costs and expenses of their own witnesses and representatives, including pay for all working time lost during any employee's regularly scheduled shift. In no event shall one (1) party be responsible for bearing the costs and expenses of the other party's witnesses and representatives.
Section 4.10:	Exclusive Forum.
It is the intent of the parties that disputes between the Authority and the Union should not be subject to resolution in more than one (1) forum. The Union hereby agrees that if proceedings involving any matter which is or might be alleged as a grievance are instituted in any administrative action including, but not limited to, claims before a governmental board, agency
8
or entity, or in any court, then such administrative or judicial proceedings shall be the sole remedy and such matters will no longer be arbitrable under this Agreement. In the event that the Union elects to arbitrate any dispute with the Employer, then the Union hereby agrees that arbitration shall be the sole remedy for dispute and hereby waive any rights that may exist to institute proceedings involving this matter in any administrative action including, but not limited to, claims under state and federal law. The parties agree that this provision does not prohibit an individual from pursuing their individual statutory claims before a federal or state agency.
Section 4.11:	Class Action
No more than one dispute may be heard by any arbitrator unless expressly agreed between the parties. Class action grievances involving discipline are expressly prohibited unless otherwise agreed in writing.
ARTICLE V - NO STRIKE - NO LOCKOUT
Section 5.01: No Lockout
THE AUTHORITY agrees that there shall be no lockout of Union members; and will settle all grievances as provided in this Contract.
Section 5.02: No Strike
The Union agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, the Union, its officers, and its members will not advocate, sanction, support or endorse any action that is recognized by the Michigan Employment Relations Commission as unlawful strike activity. The Union, its officers and members will not engage in conduct that curtails, restricts or interferes with the Authority’s operations.
The Union agrees that the scope of activity prohibited in this paragraph is intended to include, but is not limited to, such activities as sympathy strikes, unfair labor practice strikes and a refusal of an employee or employees to cross any type of picket line for any reason whatsoever, unless their safety is in immediate jeopardy.
The Authority reserves the sole right to discipline an employee or employees up to and including discharge for violating the provisions of this Section. Any appeal to the Grievance Procedure shall be limited solely to the question of whether the employee or employees did, in fact, engage in any of the above prohibited activities and whether the disciplinary action was disparately applied.
The Union agrees that it will take prompt affirmative action to discourage, disavow and curtail any strike related conduct on the part of its members. Should any employee engage in strike conduct, the Union will ask the employees to return to work or cease the conduct in violation of this Section. If requested, the Union will take the aforementioned action within two (2) days after such a strike or other refusal to work occurs.

(A)	Sign-ups shall occur in the following manner:
(1)	Sign-ups shall be open for selection by seniority three (3) times each year: April, August, and December;
(2)	Irrespective of a bus operator’s seniority date, a bus operator within each classification who has completed their probationary period will make their work assignment selection ahead of all bus operators who have not completed their probationary period;

(7)	An Operator shall perform the work on the selected schedule assignment until the next regular sign-up takes effect;
14
(B)	The Authority shall create work schedules consistent with the following:
(1)	Prior to cutting five (5) day work schedules, the Authority shall establish a number of four day work schedules, which will be still subject to the hours of pay requirement of Section 6.03. The parties agree that any individual working these four day work schedules shall not receive daily overtime (i.e. premium pay for time worked beyond eight (8) hours in any day) and shall have at least two consecutive days off. These four day work schedules shall be selected during the regular sign-up process and shall equal at least ten (10) percent of the total number of work assignments offered. Effective the last “Sign-Up” of the parties Agreement, the number of four-day work schedules available for selection shall increase to at least fifteen (15) percent of the total number of assignments offered.
a. The parties agree that an individual filling in for a normally scheduled four day operator shall not receive any daily overtime for the hours spent on the run normally filled by a four day operator. However, an individual filling in shall continue to receive the daily overtime premium for any hours worked on run(s) before or after the run of the four day operator, where they would otherwise work beyond eight (8) hours of work in that day.
(2)	In the preparation of five (5) day work schedules, the Authority shall exercise its discretion in a manner that gives priority to the following (in order preference):
a.	The creation of work schedules that include a minimum of an 8 hour run, Monday through Friday, with Saturday and Sunday off.
b.	The creation of Monday through Friday work schedules that may not involve the same run(s), but will provide Saturday and Sunday off and will involve less than a three hour variance in start times.
c.	The creation of work schedules that may not involve the same run(s) but provide two consecutive days off, which may or may not include Saturday and/or Sunday, and will likely involve less than a three hour variance in start time.
d.	The creation of work schedules that provide Operators with a consistent weekly work assignment for the selection period, but may involve a larger variance in start time and may not involve consecutive days off and/or the same run.
(3)	The Parties recognize that the preferences detailed in paragraph 1 do not require the construction of every possible option at each level and that some work schedules will be less desirable than others. Rather, the Authority will construct runs, based upon these preferences, other contractual obligations and in accordance with the services to be provided. Moreover, nothing in this section shall be construed as creating any daily minimum of hours.
(4)	A committee of two (2) Union representatives and two (2) Management representatives will be established to monitor the formulation of work schedule. Before each sign-up, the committee will receive the work schedules at least seven (7) days before the posting of the schedule assignments, and will review the work schedules to ensure they have been
15
formulated in accordance with these provisions and immediately bring any concerns to the Authority’s attention.
Section 7:04: Revolving Work List
THE PURPOSE of the Revolving Work List (RWL) is to provide the Authority with a ready pool of Regular Operators willing to accept extra work (which is beyond the capacity of the Extra Board and Part-Time Operators) as it becomes available each day. There shall be a Day RWL and a Night RWL.
A.	Qualification
To qualify for work assigned to the RWL, Regular Operators must sign the RWL sign-up sheet. The sign-up sheet will be posted for a minimum of three (3) days and will be taken down at noon on Friday prior to the period for which the list will go into effect. Regular Operators who have signed the RWL will be listed in seniority order on this list. Operator names will not be added to that list after it has been taken down.
Operators willing to work Day assignments will sign the Day RWL sign-up sheet. Operators willing to work Night assignments will sign the Night RWL sign-up sheet. Operators may sign both Day and Night lists. Operators will indicate on the sign-up sheet which days of the week they are willing to accept extra work. There will not be a Night RWL on Sunday unless the Authority initiates substantial service on Sunday night.
B.	Operation of the List
Work assignments will be offered to the RWL starting with the most senior Operator on the list starting on the first day of the four week period. Each day thereafter work will be offered to the first person after the last person previously used on the RWL. The list will revolve each day until the start of the next four week period.
Work being scheduled for the following day will be assigned according to the time it is to be performed, staring with the earliest assignment. In the event two assignments start at the same time, the work that pays the greatest will be assigned first. Day work will be assigned to the Day RWL and Night work will he assigned to the Night RWL.
Work assigned as it becomes available on the same day will be offered starting with the first Operator on the RWL after the last person on the RWL to receive a work assignment. In the event same day work must be assigned to the RWL after it has been used for scheduling work for the following day, the same day work will
16
be offered to the first person after the last person scheduled for work on the RWL for the next day.
Once all the assignments for each day have been made, a line will be drawn under the last person’s name to have received extra work that day. The rotation for the following day will start with the first name below the line.
In the event an Operator is not available for assignment, the Operator will be bypassed and not be eligible for another assignment until his/her name comes up in the normal rotation. Work will not be assigned to Operators on vacation unless they have notified the dispatcher, in writing and in advance, that they are willing to work.
C.	Posting of the List
The Day RWL and the Night RWL shall be updated and posted in the Employee Lounge by 6:00 p.m. each day.
D.	Refusal of Work
An Operator that refuses extra work two (2) times during the period of the current RWL will be dropped from the current RWL for the remainder of the four week period and the following four week period. When an Operator refuses work, no more work will be offered to the Operator that day. Once accepted, any call off involving an accepted piece of work shall be treated as an initial refusal to work under this provision.
E.	Exemption of Work
Any RWL work that becomes available with less than two (2) hours’ notice shall be exempt from the requirements of this section.
F.	Exhaustion of the List
In the event that the list is exhausted, volunteers will be solicited in the following order: RWL Operators on the opposite shift of the shift being assigned; Regular Operators not signed on the list. For any extra work remaining, the Authority may assign the least senior employee to perform the work. Assigning of employees shall be done in rotation order beginning with the least senior Operator. No employee will be assigned more than three (3) trippers in any one pay period.
G.	Avoidance of Overtime.
Under all circumstances involving the distribution of extra hours, runs or overtime, preference shall be given to those individuals who would not receive any premium
17
pay (i.e. overtime compensation, etc. . .) for working and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as requiring the Employer to replace previously scheduled staff. This provision is not intended to allow the Employer to work Part Time Operators in excess of the contractual Emits governing Part Time.
Section 7.05: Attendance
Except as provided in Section 6.04 of this agreement, employees are required to work their scheduled shift and/or pieces of work each day, including additional pieces of work or shifts employee agrees to or is required to work. An employee who does not work their scheduled shift and/or pieces of work will receive attendance points for any of the following:
(1)	Absent from scheduled piece of work and employee does not have enough Paid Personal Leave to cover the absence. Absence is defined as missing more than two (2) hours of work. Employee will receive two (2) attendance points;
(2)	Reporting up to two (2) hours late for a piece of work or otherwise missing less than two (2) hours of work. Employee will receive one (1) attendance point;
(3)	Employee fails to contact their supervisor at least 30 minutes prior to the start of their scheduled piece of work that they will be absent. Employee will receive one/l) attendance point;
If an Operator reports late for an assignment he/she may be placed at the bottom of the Extra Board for that day only. If there is no work available, an Operator may be granted time off and may use Paid Personal Leave if desired.
If an employee maintains a perfect attendance record for a period of ninety (90) consecutive calendar days, the attendance point(s) on his/her record issued most recently prior to the 90-day period will be removed. Perfect attendance is defined as not being absent, tardy, or missing any work time during any of the employee’s scheduled shifts, with the exception of paid vacation days, holidays, jury duty, bereavement, military duty, paid personal leave that is approved in advance, in writing, by the employer, and union business.
Attendance points will be cumulative for a rolling, continuous 12-month period. Time on a leave of absence shall not be considered in determining the accumulation or elimination of points. During a leave of absence, attendance points shall be frozen. Only the period immediately before and immediately after the leave shall be considered part of the rolling, continuous 12 -month period. Employees who receive attendance points will be addressed as follows:
(a)	1-5 points - written warning;
(b)	6-7 points - written warning and counseling session with Department Manager and Human Resources Representative;
(c)	8-9 points - written warning and subject to discipline up to and including a two-day suspension without pay. In no event shall a suspension be applied more than once in a 12-month period;
18
(d)	10 or more points - discipline up to and including discharge at the discretion of the Authority;
Nothing in this section restricts the right to challenge the application of the attendance policy based on Article IV of this agreement.
Section 7.06: Contacting Dispatch
ANY OPERATOR not available for work assignment on account of illness shall call the Dispatcher at least thirty (30) minutes before the Operator's report time.
When an Operator has reported to work, a request to be relieved from a piece of work should be made at least 30 minutes in advance of the relief time requested. If the Dispatcher can accommodate the request sooner than 30 minutes, the Operator will be relieved at that time, and will not receive attendance points for late call-in. In all cases, the Dispatcher and the Operator will work together to make the transition as expeditious and smooth as possible.
Any Operator working on the day shift who has been on the sick list and wishes to return to work shall call or report to the Dispatcher no later than 4:00 P.M. to be marked up for work assignment the following day. Any Operator working on the night shift who has been on the sick list and wishes to return to work shall call of report to the Dispatcher no later than 6:00 p.m. to be marked up for work assignment the following day.
Operators working night runs who become ill after 6:00 p.m. may call in by 9:00 a.m. for work the same day, for a one (1) day illness only. When an operator is available for work the Dispatcher shall make a record of same on the Extra Board.
ARTICLE Vin - SENIORITY
Section 8.01: Seniority Defined
For purposes of this Agreement, unless specifically provided in another Section of this Agreement, the term “seniority” shall be defined to mean the length of continuous full-time service with the Authority in the Transportation Department, commencing from the employee’s most recent date of hire. However, for Operators hired prior to January 1, 2007, the seniority date shall-be their first day following -successful completion of the route -review. Seniority shall govern and be binding upon the Authority in the selection of work assignments and vacations, with the exception that the Authority shall have the right, in exceptional case, where in its opinion the ability of an Operator makes it necessary, to make deviations in the rights of seniority by assigning such individual to a particular class of run. Vacancies in regular runs will be assigned to Extra Board Operators. Operators laid off due to lack of work shall not lose their seniority when put back into service.
Operators transferring amongst Authority Departments must return to their original department within one hundred eighty (180) consecutive calendar days to maintain their previous seniority.
19
Operators who stay in a new department for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days shall have no seniority in the Transportation Department. Except as provided in Section 8.04, Operators may only return to the Transportation department if a vacancy exists within that department.
Section 8.02: Transfer To Non-Union Status
The parties agree that the provisions of this section apply to individuals voluntarily transferring back into a Union position. Individuals terminated outside the Union are not subject to the terms of this section. Employees transferring to positions not represented by the Union shall have one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive calendar days to return to their seniority classification without loss of seniority. Employees transferring from non-represented positions and who stay in the position for more than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive calendar days shall start as new employees with respect to seniority date. Employees returning from non-represented positions will be credited with all other benefits as their total work years of service provides regardless of whether their return occurs within one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive calendar days.
Section 8.03: Probationary Period
ALL NEW bus operators hired as herein specified shall work as probationary employees for a period of ninety (90) calendar days. During the 90 day probationary period, each person so engaged shall be regarded as a probationary employee, during which time the Authority may at its sole discretion terminate said employee's relation. Should it deem necessary, the probationary period may be extended at the discretion of the Authority for up to sixty (60) days. Thereafter,, probationary periods may be extended upon the mutual agreement of the parties. After the expiration of the probationary period, if the employee is retained by the Authority, he/she shall then come under the provisions and protection of this Agreement. The Authority shall notify the Secretary of the Union in writing of the names and addresses of employees who have completed their probationary period to the satisfaction of the Authority and are thereby eligible to become members of the -Union.
Probationary employees shall not be eligible for holiday pay, bereavement pay, and jury duty pay.
Section 8.04: Layoff And Recall
WHEN NECESSARY to reduce the regular force of Operators, layoffs shall be in the inverse order of seniority.
When regular forces of Operators are increased, preference shall be given to former employees of the Authority who were laid off in accordance with the provisions of paragraph one of this Article and offered reemployment in the reverse order in which they were laid off, provided that this Agreement or any renewal, amendment or extension thereof is still in effect and no more than two (2) years shall have elapsed since their last layoff, provided they can, in the judgment of the Authority, qualify for the job. Employees transferring between the Transportation Department,
20
Maintenance Department, or Facilities Department, shall retain their total Authority seniority, but shall start a new Department and Classification seniority. Total Authority seniority shall apply to pension and number of weeks of vacation. When employees are laid off, such employees shall be considered on inactive status and shall not be entitled to fringe benefits under this Agreement, but such employees shall retain and accumulate seniority for a period of two (2) years or until recalled under this Article, whichever is the shorter.
In the reemployment of persons in accordance with paragraph one above, the following procedure shall be followed:
First: The Authority will attempt to notify each person to be reemployed to report for work, by Certified U.S. Mail (return receipt requested). Such letter shall be directed to the last known address of such person, and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the Union. By so doing, the Authority shall have discharged its notice obligations under this Section. Employees who were laid off must keep the Authority and the Union supplied with a correct and up-to-date mailing address or risk forfeiture of their seniority and reemployment rights hereunder.
Second: Persons so notified to report for work must report for work within fourteen (14) days after date of mailing or sending of telegram or lose their seniority and reemployment rights hereunder.
In the event of layoff, the employee shall receive two-week advance notice, or in lieu thereof, 94 hours of pay at straight time. This provision shall not apply in the case of discharge for cause, voluntary retirement, or leave of absence, nor shall it apply to layoffs necessary by labor disputes.
Section 8.05: Establishment of Initial Seniority Position
Within their respective classifications, this procedure shall apply to full-time and part-time bus operators.
1.	At the start of a new class, the Commercial Driver’s License (CDL) status of each bus operator is determined;
2.	If a new bus operator possesses the appropriate CDL at the start of class, that bus operator is given the highest seniority position;
3.	If multiple bus operators possess the appropriate CDL at the start of class, a random selection or draw -is conducted amongst .those operators to .assign .the highest seniority positions;
4.	Bus operators without a CDL then are assigned seniority positions based on a random draw or selection;
5.	The random selection or draw order is used to schedule the CDL testing;
6.	If an operator fails to successfully complete the CDL test, the operator shall drop to the bottom of the seniority list;
7.	The random selection or draw order is then used to schedule the Route Review;
8.	If an operator fails to successfully complete the Route Review, the operator shall drop to the bottom of the seniority list.
21
9.	At the successful completion of the Route Review, the bus operator is then assigned a seniority date.
Section 8.06: Loss of Seniority
An employee's seniority with the Authority and the employment relationship shall terminate for the following reasons:
(a)	If the employee quits or retires.
(b)	If the employee is discharged for just cause.
(c)	If the employee is on leave of absence status (including leaves of absence covered by
worker's compensation) consecutively for a period of twelve (12) months or the length of the employee's seniority with the Authority acquired by the employee at the time of commencement of leave of absence, whichever is the lesser. If the employee is on layoff status consecutively for a period of twenty-four (24) months or the length of the employee's seniority with the Authority acquired by the employee at the time of layoff or commencement of leave of absence, whichever is the lesser.
(d)	If, following the issuance of notice and in accordance with Section 8.04, the employee fails to report for work on the required date following recall to work from layoff, unless the employee's failure to report is otherwise excused for a reason satisfactory to the Authority.
(e)	If the employee is absent from work for three (3) consecutive days without properly
notifying the Authority unless the employee's failure to properly notify is otherwise excused for a reasons normally satisfactory to the Authority. The provisions of this subsection (f) of this Section are intended to apply only to an employee's obligation to properly notify the Authority of absence within the required period of time and regardless of whether an employee properly notifies, the employee may still be subject to disciplinary action under the Authority’s Attendance Policy, up to and including discharge for the absence without notice.
(f)	If the employee fails to maintain certification or licensure required for their position for more than thirty days, unless otherwise on an approved leave of absence. The parties agree that this provision is not triggered by an individual working under a temporary license. The parties also agree that any individual whose certification or licensure expires or is otherwise not maintained shall be removed from the-schedule, without pay, until they provide evidence of valid certification or licensure. However, although such individuals may suffer a reduction in pay, the parties agree that this provision was not intended to apply to the loss of MECP, ASE, State of Michigan, IMI/CMI certifications required for classifications set forth in Appendix 1.
