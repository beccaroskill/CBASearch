INTRODUCTION
The management of Genera] Motors recognizes that it cannot get along without labor any more than labor can get along without the management. Both are in the same business and the success of that business is vital to all concerned. This requires that both management and the employees work together to the end that the quality and cost of the product will prove increasingly satisfactory and attractive so that the business will be continuously successful.
General Motors holds that the basic interests of employers and employees are the same. However, at times employees and the management have different ideas on various matters affecting their relationship. The management of General Motors is convinced that there is no reason why these differences cannot be peacefully and satisfactorily adjusted by sincere and patient effort on both sides.

[Sec Doc. 18] [SccCSA<*6]
(4i) Deductions shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of said Authorization for Check-Off of Dues, together with the provisions of this Section of the Agreement.
(411) Once each month, the designated financial officer may submit to local management a list showing the name and social security number for each employee who is certified as owing an initiation fee and/or monthly dues, specifying the amount of the liability and the period to which any such monthly dues liability applies.
[See Par. (4d)J
(a)	This list shall be dated and shall be submitted on or before the first Tuesday following the third pay day in the month.
(b)	Such amounts will be deducted'from the first pay received following the first payroll period ending in the next following calendar month provided the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover the liability.

(4j) ■• A properly executed copy of such “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues" form for each employee for whom Union membership dues are to be deducted hereunder, shall be completed by the employee and submitted to the Local Management before any dues deductions are made, except as to employees whose authorizations have heretofore been delivered to Local Management. Deductions shall be made thereafter, only under the applicable Authorization for Check-Off of Dues forms which have been properly executed and are in effect. Local Management shall deliver to the Local Union an “Application for Membership" form for each employee for whom Union membership dues are to be deducted under the provisions of the Check-Off except as to employees whose authorizations have heretofore been delivered.
[See Par. (4d)]

[See Doc. 18] [SecCSA#!!]
(41) The initial monthly dues deduction from the pay of an employee who completes an “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues" form shall be made from the second pay received by the employee following the date on which the authorization was executed. It shall be presumed that employees owe initiation fees, unless they had previously executed an “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues" form at that plant, and such initiation fees will be deducted simultaneously with the initial deduction as specified in this paragraph.

made from subsequent payrolls or from Regular Benefits paid during payroll periods that end in the calendar month shall be included with the remittance for the following month. Local Management shall furnish the designated financial officer of the Local Union, monthly, with the names, social security numbers, department numbers and clock numbers of those for whom deductions have been made, the amounts of the deductions and the amounts deducted, by employee and in total, respectively, for initiation fees, regular monthly dues, and S.U.B. dues. Regular monthly dues and S.U.B. dues shall be identified as to the period to which such deductions apply. This information should be furnished along with the dues remittance. The designated financial officer will be advised of the order in which the names will be listed and of any future changes in the order of the listing as far in advance as possible. The foregoing notwithstanding, deductions made on a declining balance basis, deductions of a past dues or initiation fee liability from a Regular Benefit and deductions from pay for a liability incurred more than six (6) months prior to the actual deduction date will not be identified to a specific deduction month.

Fund shall be liable to the International Union or its locals by reason of the requirements of this Section for the remittance or payment of any sum other than that constituting actual deductions made from employee wages earned or from Regular Benefits received.
[See Par. (4n)J (See CSA #6)
(4r) In the event net earnings are sufficient to cover union membership dues for only one dues deduction month and an employee has a dues liability for more than one (1) month, the deduction will be for the current dues deduction month. In such situations membership dues for the past dues liability will be deducted from the next earnings received in that month or in a succeeding month in which the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover such union membership dues.
(See Par. (4d)]
(4s) In the event an employee receives a back pay settlement or award for any calendar month for which no dues deduction has been made, a deduction for each such month shall be made from such settlement or award.
(See Doc. 181

Ji:; -fr^'ft	f w-li
inttfri Wii	i t:il.at-Ak-..m... 1...;...a.
(a)	The deduction for monthly dues will be made from the first pay received following the first payroll period ending in the calendar month. All payroll periods ending in a calendar month will constitute, in the aggregate, the dues deduction month. Regular monthly dues and past dues or initiation fees, if any, will be deducted provided the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover the deductions. In the event there are insufficient net earnings, the deductions will be made from the subsequent pay or Regular Benefit received by the employee that is sufficient to cover the deductions. Any liability will be carried forward until the employee has sufficient net earnings to cover the deduction or breaks seniority, whichever occurs first. However, deductions will only be made from Regular Benefits provided the employee has an applicable “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues” form in effect as of the date the deduction is made. In the event an employee has a past dues or initiation fee liability and receives a payment for the unused portion of Vacation Entitlement, such liability may be deducted from such payments.
(b)	The dues deducted from an employee's earnings will be a sum equivalent to two (2) hours straight time pay and will be based upon the employee’s hourly wage rate including cost of living allowance but excluding all other premiums for the job classification of record held by the employee during the pay period to which the deduction applies.
(c)	This paragraph was deleted during 1993 National Negotiations.)
(d)	In the event of a retroactive change in an employee’s job classification of record for the pay period in which dues have been deducted, there will be no retroactive adjustment in the check-off of Union membership dues.
(e)	The amount deducted from an employee’s pay pursuant to these provisions shall be in addition to







an amount which may be authorized by a Local Union pursuant to the Constitution and By-Laws of the Union and of which the Local Union has given notice to Local Management.
(f)	In the event an employee does not receive a paycheck for a payroll period ending in a dues deduction month prior to the receipt of a Regular Benefit applicable to any such period, union dues in the amount of five dollars ($5.00) or such other amount as may be established as dues shah be deducted from the Regular Benefit, provided the employee has the applicable “Authorization for Check-Off of Dues" form in effect as of the date the deduction is made. In the event such an employee subsequently receives a paycheck for a payroll period ending in the same dues deduction month, the difference between the amount of union dues paid and the amount then owing will be deducted from such paycheck.
(4m) In the case of employees rehired, or returning to work after layoff or leave of absence, or being transferred back into the bargaining unit, who previously have properly executed Authorization for Check-Off of Dues forms, deductions will be made for membership dues as provided herein.
(4n) In cases where a deduction is made which duplicates a payment already made to the Union by an employee, or where a deduction is not in conformity with the provisions of the Union Constitution and By-Laws, refunds to the employee will be made by the Local Union.
[Sec Par. (4o),(4p),(4q))
(4o) Dues deductions shall be remitted to the designated financial officer of the Local Union once each month as soon as available but no later than 10 days after the regular deduction date. Any deductions

discussed between the designated representative of local Management and the Chairperson of the Shop Committee in an effort to resolve the problem. In multiplant divisions, if the problem is not resolved locally, it will be reviewed by divisional Central Office personnel and a representative of the General Motors Department of the International Union. If the problem is not resolved after exhausting the above procedure, the Corporation’s Vice President of Industrial Relations or the Director of the General Motors Department of the International Union may request, in writing, a meeting of their designated representatives to discuss the problem and take appropriate action.
[Sec Par. (88).(2I5)] [See Doc. 79.95]
(6)	The Corporation will not interfere with, restrain or coerce employees because of membership or lawful activity in the Union, nor will it by discrimination in respect to hire, tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment, attempt to discourage membership in the Union.
(6a) It is the policy of General Motors and the UAW that the provisions of this Agreement be applied to all employees covered by this Agreement without discrimination based on age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation as required by appropriate state and federal law. Any claims of violation of this policy, claims of sexual harassment or of any laws regarding discrimination or harassment on account of disability may be taken up as a grievance.
When a grievance containing a claim of violation of this paragraph is appealed to the Shop Committee the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may refer the claim to a designated member of the Civil Rights Committee of the Local Union for a factual investigation and report. Any such investigation will be conducted in accordance

12

. J -	h.
with the provisions of Paragraph (33). Neither the Chairperson of the Civil Rights Committee, nor the member of the committee that the Chairperson may designate to investigate such a claim in the Chairperson’s place, shall receive pay from the Corporation based solely upon any activity arising pursuant to this paragraph.
The grievance and arbitration procedure shall be the exclusive contractual procedure for remedying such discrimination claims.
[See Par. (37))
(See App. H]
(See Doc. 30.3 i.32.33.99.107.121)
(7)	The Union agrees that neither the Union nor its members will intimidate or coerce employees in respect to their right to work or in respect to Union activity or membership, and further that there shall be no solicitation of employees for Union membership or dues during working time. The Union further agrees that the Corporation shall take disciplinary action for any violations of this provision.
(8)	The right to hire; promote; discharge or discipline for cause; and to maintain discipline and efficiency of employees, is the sole responsibility of the Corporation except that Union members shall not be discriminated against as such. In addition, the products to be manufactured, the location of the plants, the schedules of production, the methods, processes and means of manufacturing are solely and exclusively the responsibility of the Corporation.
REPRESENTATION
(9)	The Union shall be represented in each bargaining unit as follows;
In the ratio of not to exceed one district committeeperson for each two hundred and fifty
13


WI

employees covered by this Agreement except that in plants of five hundred or less employees there may be three committeepersons; in plants of five hundred to one thousand employees there may be five committeepersons; in plants of one thousand to fifteen hundred there may be seven committeepersons. Any deviation from these rules to cover special conditions in any plant will be negotiated between the Corporation and the International Officers of the Union.
District Committeepersons
(10) Each bargaining unit will be districted by agreement between the local Plant Management and the Shop Committee so that insofar as practicable each district on each shift shall contain approximately two hundred and fifty employees. Each committeeperson shall have a definitely defined district. The members of the Union in each such district shall select a committeeperson who is working in that district to represent the employees in that district. An alternate district committeeperson in each district, whose duties shall be the same as those of the regular district committeeperson for that district while the regular committeeperson is absent from the plant, may be selected by the members of the Union. The total number of employees receiving a regular payroll check for work performed (plus employees who did not receive a regular payroll check who are on an approved vacation or leave of absence pursuant to Paragraphs 103 and 109 • short term) during a week representative of normal operations, mutually selected by the Plant Management and Shop Committee, will be the number used for redistricting. Plants shall be redistricted not more frequently than at six-month intervals, upon request of either the Plant Management or Shop Committee, when there is a change in the number of employees equal to two hundred and fifty or five percent, whichever is greater. Thereafter, redistricting shall be accomplished within twenty working days of such request.

Hi
[See Par (23a)) (See App. I] [See Doc. 7]
(18)	It is mutually agreed that the prompt adjustment of grievances is desirable in the interest of sound relations between the employees and the Management.
[Sec Par. (5).(34)J [Sec App. I]
[Sec Doc, 5,44,45.48]
(19)	The prompt and fair disposition of grievances involves important and equal obligations and responsibilities, both joint and independent, on the part of representatives of each party to protect and preserve the grievance procedure as an orderly means of resolving legitimate grievances.
Committeepersons acting properly in their official capacity should be free from orders by supervision which, if carried out, would impair the orderly investigation and presentation of grievances. Actions which tend to impair or weaken the grievance procedure, whenever they occur or in whatever manner or form, are improper.
Committeepersons have a responsibility to the Union and the employees they represent to conduct themselves in a businesslike manner and shall conform to the shop rules. The normal standard of conduct applicable to all employees shall be applied to committeepersons.
[See Par. (5)] [See Doc. 7,44.45]
(20)	Upon entering a department in the fulfillment of their duties, committeepersons shall notify the supervisor of that department of their presence and
18

^'jj;
<i ,':;':r • t* - -	•<
purpose or give the supervisor a copy of the written complaint if one has not already been provided.
(20a) In the event an employee requests representation under Paragraph 29 prior to being notified of a temporary transfer to another district, the committeeperson for the employee's regular district may respond to the request, providing the districts involved are in reasonable proximity and there is no change of shift.
(21)	For the purposes of representation in handling and performing other legitimate provided herein,

grievances
representation functions as committeepersons will be scheduled to report at the
plant as follows:
1.	All regular hours up to eight that their district or zone is scheduled to operate, on their respective shifts.
2.	Other than regular hours (including overtime, part time or temporary layoffs, shutdown for model change, inventory or plant rearrangement) when ten (10) or more of the people they normally represent arc working in their district or zone on their respective shift. Employees on continuous seven-day operations or operations manned by rotating or alternating shifts will not be considered in applying this provision.
When district committeepersons who would be scheduled to report during overtime hours, as provided herein, advise Management in advance that they will be absent during such hours, Management will schedule the alternate committeepersons for those districts to report. If committeepersons have been scheduled to report and fail to inform Management that they will not be at work, Management will not be responsible for calling the alternate committeeperson.
[See Doc. 7)
19


ft


(21a) The shift starting and ending time for committeepersons will be the starting and ending time of the majority of the employees they represent. The provisions of this Representation Section do not require that Committeepersons be called earlier than their regular starting times because some employees in their districts start work earlier than their starting times or be given overtime when some employees in their districts start and quit later than their regular shift hours.
[Sec Doc. 7)
(21b) Any problem arising under or not covered by the above provisions, including representation for shifts comprising fewer than 250 employees, shall be subject to local negotiations with the Plant Management, with the right of appeal under the Grievance Procedure. If the problem is not resolved through local negotiations, it may be raised by the General Motors Department of the International Union directly with the Corporation's Labor Relations Staff.
(21c) In the event of a reduction in force:
Committeepersons (including Chairpersons of Shop Committees, Zone and District Committeepersons) shall be retained regardless of seniority as long as any employees whom they represent are retained at work in their district or zone.
Alternate committeepersons shall, at the point they would be subject to being removed from their respective district, be retained on a job they can do that is operating in their district. If after complying with all of the terms of this Agreement, alternate committeepersons are laid off, they will be the first to be recalled in their regular groups when work starts in those groups on their own jobs or on other jobs in their districts that they can do.
(See Doc. 7|
(22)	Committeepersons shall enter and remain in the plant only on their respective shifts unless otherwise

agreed to by the Plant Management. They shall be paid at their regular rate for the time spent in the plant on their respective shifts as provided in this Representation
Section.
(See App. I]
[See Doc. 7]
(22a) Committeepersons shall establish a regular rate equal to their regular straight time hourly rate, as of the time they assumed their duties as Committeepersons.
This rate shall be adjusted in accordance with any adjustments made in the rate for the classification the Committeeperson then held.
When provisions of the Local Seniority Agreement entitle committeepersons to return to their former groups on higher rated jobs, their rates will be adjusted in accordance with such provisions. Also Committeepersons are eligible for promotion to higher rated jobs in their District or Zone in accordance with Paragraphs (63) (a) (1), (63) (a) (2) or (63) (b) provided they are the most senior applicant and they are capable of doing the job.
(See Doc. 7)
(22b) All Committeepersons shall ring in and out, or otherwise account for their time, in the manner required by the Local Management. Problems regarding the administration of this provision may be referred directly to the General Motors Department of the International Union and the NAO Industrial Relations Staff for resolution.

[See Doc. 7.77]
(24a) Chairpersons of Shop Committees in plants employing 500 or more employees will be permitted to leave the plant in accordance with Paragraph (24) and will be paid their regular rates for up to six (6) hours per day Monday through Friday while they are out of the plant in the performance of legitimate representation functions during straight time hours when they would otherwise be entitled to be in the plant for representation purposes. They shall notify the designated Management representative, if available, when leaving and returning to the plant during working hours. Chairpersons of Shop Committees in plants employing less than 500 employees will be permitted to leave the plant in accordance with the above and will be paid their regular rate for up to twenty (20) hours per week, which will be a reservoir available at the start of the week, to be drawn

(25)	The names of the committeepersons and alternate committeepersons in each district and the names of the committeepersons constituting the Shop Committee shall be given in writing to the Local Management, No committeepersons shall function as such until the Local Management has been advised of their selection, in writing, by the officers of the Local Union, Chairperson of the Shop Committee, or an International Officer. Any changes in committeepersons shall be reported to the Local Management in writing as far in advance as possible,
(26)	International Executive Officers of the Union, or their representatives, duly authorized to represent the International Union at Shop Committee meetings, or the President of the Local Union if not employed in the plant, will be permitted to attend meetings between the Shop Committee and the Management of any plant. Presidents of Local Unions who work in the plant and are not Shop Committeepersons may attend Shop Committee meetings in that plant and will be paid their regular rates for time spent in such meetings for the hours they would otherwise have worked in the plant. The Plant Manager, or designated representative, shall not be requested to meet with more than two such representatives, whose names must have been submitted previously to the Corporation and who must be prepared to show proper credentials. Written request will be given to Plant Management at least twenty-four (24) hours before each meeting in all cases covered by this paragraph,

GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE
Step One. Presentation of Grievance to Supervisor
r; ;■	.. ' : mJ ' •	’ ’’*	->


(28)	Any employee having a grievance, or one designated member of a group having a grievance, should first take the grievance up with the supervisor who will attempt to adjust it.
[S« Par. (224)]
(29)	Any employee may request the supervisor to call the committeeperson for that district to handle a specified grievance with the supervisor. The supervisor will send for the committeeperson without undue delay and without further discussion of the grievance.
[See Par. (20a))
[Sec App. I)
[See Doc. 5:7-Sec,IV]
(30)	If the grievance is not adjusted by the supervisor, it shall be reduced to writing on forms provided by the Corporation, and signed by the employee involved and one copy shall be given to the supervisor. The committeeperson shall then take the grievance up with higher supervision with or without another committeeperson, according to the agreed local practice.
[See Par, (77)]
[S« App, I]
-21

Step Two. Appeal to Shop Committee
(31)	If the case is not adjusted at this step, it may be referred to the Shop Committee (or sub-committee where established).
(32)	In plants in which sub-committees are established, cases not adjusted by the sub-committee and the representative of Management may be appealed


*?'*>*'
to the Shop Committee as a whole to be taken up with the highest Local Management.
(33)	After a written grievance signed by the employee making the complaint has been appealed to the Shop Committee by a committeeperson, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may designate one of its members to make a further investigation of the grievance in order to discuss the grievance properly when it is taken up by the Shop Committee at a meeting with the Management. After a grievance has been discussed at the Shop Committee Meeting and before the submission of Notice of Unadjusted Grievance, the designated Shop Committeeperson may reinvestigate the grievance in the light of any new facts disclosed in the Shop Committee Meeting or appearing in the Shop Committee Minutes.
[See Par (6a),(79d).( 125)] (See App. K.IV(CX12)J
(34)	A final decision on appealed grievances will be given by a representative of the highest Local Management within a maximum of fifteen working days from the date of first written filing thereof unless a different time limit is established by local agreement in writing. Any grievance not appealed from a decision at one step of this procedure in the plant to the next step within five working days of such decision, shall be considered settled on the basis of the last decision and not subject to further appeal. However, in plants where there are less than twenty-five hundred employees, the Shop Committee may, upon notifying the Plant Management in writing, substitute a ten (10) day period for the fifteen (15) day period and a three (3) day period for the five (5) day period. Provided further, however, that within the applicable time limits of this Paragraph a grievance may be withdrawn by mutual agreement without prejudice to either party.

(36) The question of supplying minutes of the Shop Committee meetings with the Management to the Shop Committee and the form of such minutes is a matter to be negotiated with the Management of each plant by the Committee involved. In the interest of expediting orderly procedure, it is desirable for the Chairperson of the Shop Committee to furnish Management with an agenda of the matters, including a listing of grievances the Union desires to discuss at the meeting. The agenda if submitted should be furnished as far in advance of the meeting as possible. Such an agenda would not preclude discussion of other pertinent subjects. The minutes of Shop Committee meetings will be furnished to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee within six (6) calendar days from the date of the meeting.
Such minutes should include:
(1) Date of meeting.
(2) Names of those present.
(3) Statement of each grievance taken up and discussed, also, in summary fashion, of the Union's contention or, at its option, a written contention, in the event of failure to adjust.
(4) Management’s written answer on each grievance, with reason for same if answer is adverse.
(5) ’’Highlights’’ of the meeting, these including specific questions asked by the Committee on policy matters and any answers to such questions given by Management.
(6) Date of approval, and signatures as agreed upon locally.
The above provisions shall not interfere with any mutually satisfactory local practice now in effect.

Step Three, Appeal to Corporation and International Union
(37)	If the grievance is not adjusted at this step and the Shop Committee believes it has grounds for appeal from the Plant Management decision, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee will give the Plant Management a written “Notice of Unadjusted Grievance,’’ on forms supplied by the Corporation, and the Chairperson or designated member of the Shop Committee will then prepare a complete “Statement of Unadjusted Grievance,” signed by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, setting forth all facts and circumstances surrounding the grievance, and where an alleged violation of Paragraph (6a) is included in the grievance, a statement of the facts and circumstances supporting such claim. The Plant Manager, or a designated Management representative, will also prepare a complete “Statement of Unadjusted Grievance” and the Management’s reason in support of the position taken, signed by the Plant Manager or an authorized Management representative. Three copies of the Union’s statement will be exchanged with the Management for three copies of the Management’s statement as soon as possible and in any event within five (5) working days of the date of filing the Notice of Unadjusted Grievance. The exchange of statements shall take place fifteen (15) working days after receipt of the Plant Management’s decision, unless this time is extended by mutual agreement in writing, in which event the thirty days for appeal by the Regional Director as provided in Paragraph (38) shall be automatically extended by the same number of days as the amount of extended time for exchanging "Statements of Unadjusted Grievance.” Each Shop Committee shall consecutively number each “Statement of Unadjusted Grievance” from one upward for identification purposes.

(38)	The Chairperson of the Shop Committee shall then forward copies of the "Statements of Unadjusted Grievance,” to the Regional Director of the international Union. The Regional Director will review the case and determine if an appeal shall be made. The Regional Director or a specified representative and the Director of the General Motors Department of the International Union or a specified member of the Director’s staff will be granted permission to visit the plant for the purpose of investigating the specific grievance involved in "Statements of Unadjusted Grievance,” providing such a grievance is of the nature that observation or investigation will aid in:
[See Par. (43a),(77).(79e)]
[See Doc. 52]
(1)	Arriving at a decision as to whether or not a grievance exists;
(2)	Arriving at a decision as to whether or not such grievance shall be appealed;
(3)	The purpose of its proper presentation in the event of appeal.
Such visits will occur only after the following procedure has been complied with:
(a)	The names of the individuals who will be permitted to enter the plant must be submitted in writing to Local Management previous to the date such entry is requested. Such names will be submitted to the Corporation by the General Motors Department of the International Union.
(b)	The Regional Director shall give notice in writing to Plant Management of the request for entry and will identify the representative designated to make the visit and the specific grievance to be investigated. In the case of the Director of the General Motors Department or a specified member of the Director’s staff, notice may be given either verbally or in writing.
28



UWaiM>l
(c)	Plant Management will acknowledge receipt of the request and set a time during regular working hours which is mutually agreeable for such visit.
(d)	A member of the Shop Committee or a district committeeperson may accompany the Union representative during such visit if their presence is requested. Management representatives may accompany the Union representatives during such visit.
(e)	Only one such visit on a specified grievance shall be made by the Regional Director, or specified representative, unless otherwise mutually agreed to.
(f)	Such visits shall be restricted to the time mutually agreed upon in Point (c) above and shall be of reasonable duration and shall be subject to all plant rules and regulations which apply to employees and all regulations made by the United States Anny, Navy and Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It is mutually agreed that the purpose of this provision is solely to facilitate the operation of the grievance procedure, and that the Union representative shall confine such a visit to its stated purpose. If it is necessary the Union representative may interview the employee or employees signing the grievance and employees in the bargaining unit who have information relevant to the case. Such interview shall be a private interview when requested by the Union Representative and a suitable place will be provided.
Any dispute developing out of the application of these provisions may be finally determined by the Umpire.
If the Regional Director shall decide to appeal the case, notice shall be given on the form "Notice of Appeal” supplied by the Corporation, sending one copy each to the local Plant Management and the Chairperson

of the Shop Committee. Such “Notice of Appeal” will carry the same case number as the “Statement of Unadjusted Grievance.” Except as provided in Paragraph (79e), any case not appealed within thirty days, or within thirty days plus any agreed upon extension of time for exchanging Statements of Unadjusted Grievance as provided in Paragraph (37), after the date the written Statements of Unadjusted Grievance are exchanged, or, in any event, within forty-five (45) days of the date of the written decision of local Plant Management to the Shop Committee, shall be finally and automatically closed on the basis of the written decision of the local Plant Management to the Shop Committee and shall not be subject to further appeal. The forty-five (45) day time limit for appeal shall be extended by the same number of days the local parties agree to extend the time limit for the exchange of Statements of Unadjusted Grievances. No case shall be reopened unless the Regional Director shall submit new evidence to the Plant Management and it is mutually agreed by them that such case should be reopened. The case shall then date from the date it is reopened.
(39)	The case will then be considered by an Appeal Committee consisting of four members as follows: For the Union, the Regional Director or one specified representative of the Regional Director who is permanently assigned to handle all cases arising under this Agreement, in all plants in that region, and the Chairperson or another designated member of the Shop Committee of the plant involved; and two representatives of Local or Divisional Management, one of whom has not previously rendered a decision in the case. No person shall act as a representative of a Regional Director in meetings of the Appeal Committee ■unless the designated person’s name has been given to the Corporation in writing by the International Union. A representative of the International Office of the union
30


*?a*4wi



and/or a representative of the Industrial Relations Staff of the Corporation may also attend such meetings at any time. Upon the written request of the Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the Regional Director, or specified representative, to the Plant Management, twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the meeting, a member of the Shop Committee (or the district committeeperson, in lieu of such Shop Committeeperson, who has previously handled such case) will be permitted to participate in the appeal meeting on such case. Whenever the Union requests the presence of a third representative at the appeal hearing, Management may also select a third representative who has previously handled the case', to participate in the appeal meeting on such case.
(See Par. (54))
(40)	Attendance of district committeepersons at Appeal Committee meetings shall be considered as absence from the Plant. Such committeepersons will be paid their regular rate of pay for time spent in such meetings of the Appeal Committee for the hours that they would otherwise have worked in the plant.
(41)	Meetings of the Appeal Committee shall be held not more frequently than once each two weeks for each bargaining unit, unless mutually agreed otherwise. In the event no meetings of the Appeal Committee have been held for more than two weeks, meetings will be arranged within seven days after “Notice of Appeal’’ has been received.
(42)	If an adjustment of the case is not reached at this meeting, the Management will furnish a copy of its decision in writing and a copy of the minutes of the meeting, to the Chairperson of the Shop Committee and the Regional Director within five working days after the meeting, unless this period is extended by mutual agreement in writing.
(42a) Special Procedure — Contracting of Work
(See Par. (46)(1)] (See App. F*F2]
Grievances charging a violation of the Corporation’s express commitments set forth in Paragraph (183a), (183b), (183c), (183e) and Appendix F-l shall be handled in the following manner:
(1)	When a grievance arises involving the above, it shall be reduced to writing on forms provided by the Corporation, signed by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee or the Shop Committeeperson involved, and referred to the Shop Committee at Step Two of the grievance procedure. The grievance may then be processed in the grievance procedure through Step Four under the terms of the National Agreement, unless the Director of the GM Department of the International Union elects otherwise as provided in Paragraph (42a)(2) below.
(2)	Within thirty (30) days of the date of Notice of Appeal to the Umpire, written notice will be given to advise the Director of Labor Relations of the Corporation of any case which the Director of the General Motors Department of the International Union has elected to refer back to the Appeal Committee. Thereafter, the bargaining procedure provided in Paragraph (117) may then be applicable.
Step Four. Appeal to Impartial Umpire
(43) In the event of failure to adjust the case at this point, it may be appealed to the impartial Umpire, providing it is the type of case on which the Umpire is authorized to rule. Notice of appeal of such cases to the Umpire by the Union shall be given by the Regional Director to the Plant Management of the Plant in which the case arose, with copies to the Industrial Relations
32
Staff of the Corporation in Detroit and to the International Union Office at Detroit; in cases appealed to the Umpire by the Corporation, notice of such appeal will be given by the Corporation to the International Union Office in Detroit. Cases not appealed to the Umpire within twenty-one days from the date of a final decision given after review in an Appeal Committee meeting shall be considered settled on the basis of the decisions so given; provided, however, that within the twenty-one (21) day time limit of this paragraph a case may be withdrawn by mutual agreement without prejudice to either party.
[See Par. (55)] [See Doc. 48]
(43a) After a case has been appealed to the Umpire but prior to the Umpire hearing of the case, the Director of the General Motors Department of the International Union or a specified member of the Director’s staff will be granted permission to visit the plant for the purpose of investigating the specific grievance in accordance with all of the provisions of Paragraph (38) regarding plant visits.
(43b) (1) Any grievance involving a dispute regarding an employee’s job assignment which has resulted in a loss of work (except as provided in [a] below), or a refusal of Management to return an employee to work from sick leave of absence by reason of the medical findings of a physician or physicians acting for the Corporation, will be initiated at the Second Step, if such findings are in conflict with the findings of the employee’s personal physician with respect to whether the employee is able to do a job to which the employee is entitled, in line with the employee’s seniority, or do the disputed job assignment as the case may be. Failing to resolve the question, the parties may refer the employee to a local clinic or physician mutually agreed upon for an impartial medical
35
,-fe, a- . ^rfijjlj^^ilrr-"'-1-
opinion as to whether the employee is or is not able to do a job to which the employee is entitled, in line with the employee’s seniority, or do the disputed job assignment as the case may be. If Management and the Union are unable to agree on any aspect of the referral to a clinic or physician, the case may be appealed as provided in the grievance procedure. Without adding to or modifying any other provisions of this Agreement or any of its Supplements, where an Impartial Medical Opinion (IMO) Program is in effect in a plant the medical authority(s) approved for such program may be the “local clinic or independent physician” provided for above. The expense of any mutually agreed to physical examination(s) in accordance with the above provisions of this Paragraph (43b) shall be paid one half by the Corporation and one half by the Local Union.

However, in cases of transfers not exceeding thirty (30) days employees will retain their seniority in the occupational group from which they were transferred and not in the new occupational group, unless a longer period is specified for any plant or particular occupational group of groups by written local aigreement.
[See Par. (72)]
(63)	The transferring of employees is solely the responsibility oft Management subject to the following sub-paragraphs. The provisions of this paragraph shall be applied without discrimination because of race, religion, color, age, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or national origin, so that equal employment opportunity will be afforded to all employees.
This Paragraph (63) will be openly displayed in each department in each plant in such a manner that it may be reviewed by the employees so that they will be aware of transfer and promotional opportunities that may become available to them and the procedure for expressing their desires. All classifications within a department and their rates of pay will also be openly displayed in that department so that employees will be aware of transfer and promotional opportunities that may become available to them. Local agreements that have been negotiated pursuant to sub-Paragraph (63)(b) below will also be so openly displayed in each department in each plant.




(63) (a) (1) Employees who desire advancement to higher paid classifications within their department or other established broader scope of selection, may make application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department on forms provided by the Corporation on which they may state their qualifications and experience. Thereafter, as openings occur, selection for the promotion will be from among such applicants and applicants for that classification that have filed pursuant to sub-Paragraph (2) below, who have applied at least one (1) week in advance of the opening in question, and where ability, merit and capacity are equal, the applicant with the longest seniority will be given preference.
[See Par. (120)1 [See Doc. 69]
(63)	(a) (2) Employees who desire advancement within the plant to higher paid classifications in another department or to higher paid classifications where the employee is working outside an established scope of selection that is broader than a department may make application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department on forms provided by the Corporation on which they may state their qualifications and experience. Thereafter, as openings occur, such applicants will be considered in the selection process for that promotion provided they have so applied at least one (1) week in advance of the opening in question. Each employee may have two (2) such applications on file. An employee who has been transferred and established seniority under this Paragraph (63) (a) (2) will not be eligible to reapply for consideration for another such promotion until six (6) months have elapsed from the effective date of transfer. An employee who has been offered a transfer and refused the transfer under this Paragraph (63)(a)(2) will have such application for transfer cancelled and thereafter, for a period of six (6) months from the date of such refusal, may be entitled to only one (1) valid application for

transfer under these provisions. Such transfer or offer of transfer to employees working outside a scope of selection shall be without prejudice to the establishment or identification of such scope.
Promotions made pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph (63)(a) in the preceding week will be openly displayed in mutually satisfactory locations in the plant which are frequented by large numbers of affected employees.
If the settlement of a grievance alleging violation of this Paragraph (63)(a) is on the basis that a different employee should have been promoted, that employee will receive the difference in wages earned (exclusive of earnings received for overtime hours which they worked but were not worked by the employee improperly promoted to the higher rated job) and the wages they would have earned had they been promoted.
If an employee is transferred pursuant to the provisions of this Paragraph (63)(a) and the employee is subsequently reduced from the new classification prior to establishing seniority, the provisions requiring advanced application for an opening in that classification will be waived, provided the employee refiles for such classification within one (1) week from the date of being reduced.
[See Par. (120)]
[Sec Doc. 71.72]
(b) It is the policy of Management to cooperate in every practical way with employees who desire transfers to new positions or vacancies in their department. Accordingly, such employees who mala* application to their supervisor or the Personnel Department stating their desires, qualifications and experience, will be given preference for openings in tiieir department provided they are capable of doing the job.

provided for above and who are capable of doing the job available shall be given preference for the openings in their department over new hires. In case the opening is in an equal or lower rated classification and there is more than one applicant capable of doing the job, the applicant with the longest seniority will be given preference. Any secondary job openings resulting from filling jobs pursuant to this provision may be filled through promotion: or through transfer without regard to seniority standing, or by new hire.
Any claim of personal prejudice or any claim of discrimination for Union activity in connection with transfers may be taken up as a grievance. Such claims must be supported by written evidence submitted within 48 hours from the time the grievance is filed.
In plants where departments are too small or in otfier cases where the number of job classifications within a department is insufficient to permit the practical application of this paragraph, arrangements whereby employees may make such application for transfer out of their department may be negotiated locally, subject to approval by the Corporation and the International Union.

all

(76)	Employees who have been disciplined by a suspension, layoff or discharge will be furnished a brief written statement advising them of their right to representation and describing the misconduct for which they have been suspended, laid off or discharged and, in the case of a layoff or discharge, the extent of the discipline. Thereafter, they may request the presence of the committeeperson for their district to discuss the case privately with them in a suitable office designated by the Local Management, or other location by mutual agreement, before they are required to leave the plant. The committeeperson will be called promptly upon such request. Whether called or not, the committeeperson will be advised in writing within one working day of 24 hours of the fact of written reprimand, suspension, layoff or discharge and will be given a copy of the
[ans^isaaii

statement given to the employee. After a suspension has been converted to a layoff or discharge, the committeeperson will be notified in writing of the fact of layoff or discharge. The written statement furnished to the employee pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph shall not limit Management’s rights, including the right to rely on additional or supplemental information not contained in the statement to the employee.
[See App. A) (See Doc. 47.50.51.54)
(76a) When a suspension, written reprimand, layoff or discharge of an employee is contemplated, the employee, where circumstances permit, will be offered an interview to allow for answering the charges involved in the situation for which such discipline is being considered before being required to leave the plant. Employees who, for the purpose of being interviewed concerning discipline, are called to the plant, or removed from their work to the supervisor’s desk or to an office, or called to an office, will be advised that they may, if they so desire, request the presence of their District Committeeperson to represent them during such interview.
(See Duc. 49.96]
(76b) Employees will be tendered a copy of any warning, reprimand, suspension or disciplinary layoff entered on their personnel records, within three days of the action taken. In imposing discipline on a current charge, Management will not take into account any prior infractions which occurred more than twenty-four months previously. Further, Management will eliminate from an employee’s record any infraction where there was a lapse of time of greater than 18 months between infractions provided the employee has not been on leave of absence the majority of the time between the infractions. Also Management will not impose

(77)	It is important that complaints regarding unjust or discriminatory layoffs or discharges be handled promptly according to the Grievance Procedure. Grievances must be filed within three working days of the layoff or discharge. Within two working days after a grievance has been answered by higher supervision, pursuant to Paragraph 30 above, the specific charge will be discussed with designated representatives of local Plant Management, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, or designated representative, and another member of the Shop Committee or the district committeeperson who filed the grievance. If the grievance is not resolved, local Plant Management will review and render a decision on the case within three working days thereafter. In any event, local Plant Management will render a decision on the case within 10. working days from the date the grievance is filed. If a Notice of Unadjusted Grievance is not submitted by the Shop Committee within five (5) working days of a decision of the local Plant Management, the matter will be considered closed.
(See Par. (37).(38),(48).(56)J

PRODUCTION STANDARDS
(78)	Production standards shall be established on the basis of fairness and equity consistent with the quality of work, efficiency of operations, and the reasonable working capacities of normal operators. The Local Management of each plant has full authority to settle such matters.
[See Par. (8).(79a-i)]
car, body or truck line assembly operations. The speed of such assembly lines will not be increased beyond the level for which they are' staffed for the purpose of gaining additional production or for the purpose of making up for loss of production due to breakdowns or unscheduled line gaps or stops.
(Sec Par. (46).(H7)I
(78b) Work assignments on conveyor lines will be made in accordance with line speeds and available work space and the expected normal ratio of model mix and optional equipment. When it is necessary to adjust the normal scheduled mix on conveyor lines which results in more or less work being required, compensating adjustments in work assignment, number of employees, spacing of units, line speed or any combination thereof will be made. Arrangements will be made locally to establish procedures which will provide advance knowledge of mix changes that require compensating adjustments so that such adjustments will be made in a timely manner. On conveyor line operations, Management will designate specific off-line operations from which employees will be made available to compensate for such mix changes when one of the compensating adjustments requires an increase in the number of employees and in such case the assignment of employees to the conveyor line operation will be given priority over the off-line operation. Upon request, Management will advise the Union of the arrangements made.
[See Par. (46).(1 J7)J
(78c) After the time or the requirements for a normal operator to perform an element has been established on a car, body or truck line assembly operation and the element is subsequently changed because of engineering changes, a change in method, machinery, equipment,


layout or tools, only the time or the requirements of the elements affected by such change will be adjusted.
(Sec Par, (46))
(78d) If a standard is to be established on a new offline or machine operation and has not been established when the operation is placed in production, the operator will be advised of the reason for not establishing the standard and the expected requirements of the operation.
(See Par. (46)]
(79)	When a dispute arises regarding standards established or changed by the Management, the complaint should be taken up with the supervisor. If the dispute is not settled by the supervisor or if the complaint is not taken up by the employee with the supervisor, the cominitteeperson for that district shall, upon reporting to the supervisor of the department involved, examine the job to determine the merits of the complaint. The employee may then file a grievance. The supervisor or the time study person will furnish the committeeperson with all of the facts of the case. If there is still a dispute after this examination has been completed, the committeeperson may then re-examine the operations in detail with the supervisor or the time study person. The committeeperson will, upon request, be given in writing the work elements of the job without undue delay. When available, the cycle time or other pertinent data that is relevant to the dispute will be provided in writing upon request; however, it is mutually recognized that it would be impractical to provide this information during periods of production acceleration. If the matter is not adjusted at this stage, it may be further appealed as provided in the procedure below. If the dispute is settled at any stage of this procedure, the parties to the settlement will, upon request of either party, specify in writing what the elements are that constitute the job as settled including a notation in assembly plants of the then current model
mix and line speed and this information will be initialed and dated by the parties.
[See Par. (46)]
[See Doc. 44,45.53.55]
(79a) After the supervisor has had reasonable time to consider a grievance filed claiming violation of Paragraph (78), which shall be not more than two working days, an answer to the grievance shall thereafter be given:
[See Par. (46))
(a)	Within one working day after requested to do so by the committeeperson, or
(b)	In any event after ten (10) working days of the date the grievance was filed with the supervisor.
The above time limits may be extended by mutual agreement.
(79b) If the case is not adjusted by the supervisor, it may. within three (3) working days of the supervisor’s written answer, be appealed by the Shop Committeeperson for the Zone, or another member of the Shop Committee, or the Chairperson of the Shop Committee to the next step, as provided below, by giving written notice to the Personnel Department.
(See Par. (46),(79d)]
(79c) Within three (3) working days of receipt of the appeal, the case will be considered at a Special Step of the Grievance Procedure by not more than three representatives of the Union, including the District Committeeperson, the Shop Committeeperson for the zone or another member of the Shop Committee, and the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, and not more than three representatives of Management, at least one of whom shall be a member of higher supervision.
In the multi-shift operations, the District Committeeperson or the Shop Committeeperson from the opposite shift(s) may, by mutual agreement, attend


the Special Step Meeting when a standards dispute ‘ exists on the same operation on more than one shift. An additional representative of management may also attend the Special Step Meeting in these situations. The schedule for such meetings will be established at a time mutually convenient to the participants.
(Sec Par. (46)]
&
(79d) After a case is appealed to the Special Step and prior to the meeting on the case at that step, a member of the Shop Committee who will participate in the Special Step meeting may make a further investigation of the case as provided in Paragraph (33).
[See Par. (46),(79b)]
(79e) Within five (5) working days of this Special Step meeting, higher supervision will give a written answer. If the case is not settled at this step, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may, within three working days appeal the case by submitting to Management a “Notice of Unadjusted Grievance." Thereafter the case will be handled in accordance with Step Three of the Grievance Procedure Section, except that “Statements of Unadjusted Grievance” need not be exchanged and the 30-day time limit for “Notice of Appeal” by the Regional Director, referred to in Paragraph (38), shall run from the date of the answer given by Management at the Special Step of the Grievance Procedure, Plant entry as provided in Paragraph (38) may be made after the “Notice of Unadjusted Grievance" has been filed and before the Appeal Meeting.
[See Par. (37).(46)]
(79f) The time limits specified above may be extended by mutual agreement in writing. Any case not appealed from one step of this procedure to the next

(79g) After a production standards grievance is filed on a job, the Committeeperson representing the employee who filed the grievance will be informed in writing of any change in work content which results in an increase or decrease in work content or which is made in an attempt to adjust the grievance.
(See Par. (46)]
(79h) In the event a standard has not been established on a job, an employee who is following the prescribed method and using the tools provided in the I proper manner and performing at a normal pace, will not 3 be disciplined for failure to obtain an expected amount of production on that job.
(Sec Par. (46)} [Sec Doc. 54}
(791) If a production standards grievance writing and the employee who signed the grievance is subsequently replaced by another employee and if, thereafter, additional work is added to the job without any other change having occurred which affects the job, the District Committeeperson may initiate a grievance alleging that the additional work constitutes a violation of the settlement.

of journeymen/women employed for the program averaged over the preceding twelve (12) months. The ratio of apprentices in training to joumeymen/women should not exceed one (1) apprentice to eight (8) journeymen/women. However, the Union agrees that local Management can establish a ratio of apprentices to joumeymen/women in excess of the one (1) to eight (8) ratio, but not to exceed a ratio of one (1) apprentice to five (5) joumeymen/women. Deviations below the one (1) to five (5) ratio may be agreed to by the Local Apprentice Committee. Favorable consideration will be given to requests for deviation below the one (1) to five (5) ratio in instances in which it is anticipated the impact of early retirement will create a shortage of skilled trades employees. Disputes concerning such deviations or the enrolling of new apprentices at a time when seniority joumeymen/women in the same classification are laid off due to a permanent reduction in force will be referred to the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee for decision.

[See Doc. 68]
(178a) Journeymen/women in an apprenticeable classification will be considered to be joumeymen/women classified in the classification(s) for which they are qualified and which is (are) related to that apprenticeable classification, in the application of Paragraph (174).
For the purpose of this Paragraph, the machine operations listed in the apprentice training schedules for the Die Making, Machine Repair, Pattern Making-Metal, Pattern Making-Wood, Tool and Die Making and Tool Making trades, are considered related to their respective classification. In addition for this purpose, the local parties may determine, in writing, other classifications which are to be considered related to

these and other apprenticeable classifications, subject to approval of the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee. In the event the parties are unable to reach agreement locally, the area of difference may be referred to the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee for resolution on the basis of the specific facts involved. The GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee may also determine classifications which are to be considered related to apprenticeable classifications.

Model Change or Major Plant Rearrangement
(179)	During model change or major plant rearrangement employees may be temporarily transferred to classifications to assist in such work and paid in accordance with the local wage agreement. The duration of such temporary transfers is limited to the temporary period of such model changes or major plant rearrangements. Seniority of such employees shall remain and accumulate in the seniority group in which it is established at the time of the temporary ’transfer. It is understood, therefore, that no employee will be credited with any seniority in such classifications for the purpose of being retained in the classification.
[See Par. (153)]

(202b) During February of each year, the local Management will notify the Shop Committee of its decision to schedule the week before or the week after the Independence Week Shutdown period as a Plant Vacation Shutdown Week.
(202c) In addition, during February of each year, the local Management will notify the Shop Committee which productive operations, if any, will be scheduled to operate during the Independence Week Shutdown Period and which productive operations, if any, will be scheduled to operate during the Plant Vacation Shutdown Week. Unforeseen circumstances may require subsequent changes in these announced schedules and will be reviewed with the Shop Committee as soon as is practicable.
(202d) Employees who are not scheduled to work during any portion of the Independence Week Shutdown Period shall be paid up to eight (8) hours of pay for each of the Independence Week Shutdown Period days they are not scheduled to work, up to a maximum of thirty-two (32) hours, which will be calculated on the basis of the employee’s regular rate of pay, plus attached night shift premium, not including overtime, as of the employee’s last day worked prior to the Independence Week Shutdown period provided:

(3)	The employee works their last scheduled work day in the pay period prior to and their next scheduled work day in the pay period after the pay periods of Independence Week Shutdown and Plant Vacation Shutdown Week.
Employees shall receive such pay in the pay period following the Independence Week Shutdown Period,
(202e) Failure to work either their last scheduled work day in the pay period prior to or their next scheduled work day in the pay period after the pay periods of the Independence Shutdown and Plant Vacation Shutdown Week will disqualify the employee for Independence Week Shutdown pay for the two (2) Independence Week Shutdown days which follow or precede such scheduled work day.
(202f) Employees who are scheduled to work during the Independence Week Shutdown Period, including the Independence Day holiday shall be entitled to up to eight (8) hours of Additional Time Off with pay up to a maximum of forty (40) hours in lieu of the Independence Week Shutdown Period pay for each day worked provided:

(202h) Management at each plant will establish a procedure whereby employees, during February, may make application in writing for vacation time off, indicating first, second and third choices. If a Plant Vacation Shutdown is scheduled, the dates of such shutdown are to be included in the employee’s vacation schedule. In the event more employees apply for time off than can be spared from the job at a given time, plant seniority will be the basis for resolving priority of applications for time off, except that applicants working on jobs which usually operate when the plant is shut down during such periods as model change, plant rearrangement, plant vacation shutdown or inventory will be given first consideration for time off during periods other than shutdown period.
(2021) Each employee will be given a written disposition of their vacation time off request. Approved vacation time off, exclusive of the time identified as a Plant Vacation Shutdown, will not thereafter be canceled or changed without the mutual consent of Management and the employee. If an employee’s approved vacation time off scheduled for a Plant Vacation Shutdown is canceled or changed, the employee may reschedule their vacation in accordance with local plant practice.

b. Volunteers will be placed in seniority order.
It is recognized that the hiring of new employees in one location while there is a surplus of seniority employees in other locations is not in the best interest of the parties. Therefore, the parties will provide eligible seniority iaid-off, Protected and active seniority employees an opportunity to relocate to UAW-GM facilities outside of their area, with particular emphasis on placing employees from closed or idled facilities. For the purposes of this Memorandum, seniority refers to longest unbroken GM seniority.
When employed, such employees will acquire seniority in the plant where hired in accordance with Paragraphs (56) and (57) of the National Agreement.
In the event of a permanent opening at a GM facility, the following placement procedure is to be utilized:
a. Combined list of seniority employees on indefinite layoff, Protected employees, active employees from plants that have excess employees and seniority return to former community applicants.
c. In the event of insufficient volunteers, the employee with the least seniority on the Area Hire List (except active and Protected status employees) will be offered the job.

It is further understood that the National Parties may also mutually agree to deviate from the above order of selection in a particular situation.
•• In addition, the Union assured the Corporation of its willingness to implement Document No. 118.
Any complaints regarding the application of these provisions in any plant may be taken up with Local Management of that plant by the local Shop Committee and if not resolved may be referred to the GM Labor Relations and the International Union for resolution; however, the above provisions shall not be the basis for any claims for back wages or any form of retroactive adjustments.
It is understood that if an employee whose problem is referred to the GM Labor Relations and the International Union is adjudged by the National Parties to be entitled to an adjustment, the employee will be offered an available opening as soon as possible, but in any event within two weeks of such decision. If no such opening develops, he or she will be offered the opportunity to displace a lesser seniority employee, seniority permitting, at the plant where the problem occurred.
I. AREA HIRE PLACEMENT (Formerly Appendix A and Document No. 21)
A.	An Area Hire Area is comprised of all plants within a 50 mile radius of a given plant or larger as may be agreed upon by the National Parties.
B.	Employees on the Area Hire List include: seniority employees on indefinite layoff, Protected status, active employees from plants that have excess employees, and seniority return to the former community applicants.
C.	Such employees will be given the opportunity to designate from among those plants within their Area Hire Area which plants, if any, they volunteer to accept an offer of employment, should future job openings occur. An employee will be allowed to change the plants so designated any time prior to a bona fide job offer.
D.	In the event that higher seniority employees are placed on layoff, employees with the least seniority who would have otherwise been laid off will be placed on the Area Hire List. Such employees placed on the Area Hire List will be advised of this fact and be given the opportunity to designate plants within the Area Hire Area.
E.	Volunteers will be offered the available jobs in seniority order.
F.	Laid off employees who refuse any job offer within the Area Hire Area will be placed on a formal leave of absence without Corporate-paid benefits with recall only to a job in the regular active workforce.
Protected status employees who refuse any job offer within the Area Hire Area will be placed on lay off.
G.	Active employees will be made a maximum of three (3) Area Hire job offers in each year of this Agreement. Such employees may
later be eligible to refile an Area Hire application in the event that their status changes at their current plant.
H.	When selecting employees the longest unbroken GM seniority date will be used for non-skilled job offers. For skilled trades job offers, the longest unbroken seniority date in the skilled trades classification will be used. In the event that two or more employees have the same longest unbroken seniority date, the employee’s entire social security number in ascending order will be used as the tie breaker.
I.	Skilled trades journeymen/women laid off from a plant and working in a non-skilled trades classification will have their name placed on the area hire list and will remain eligible for area hire in the same or a related skilled trades classification.
J.	It is further understood that each plant would review local procedures for implementing the provisions of Area Hire and Extended Area Hire Placement and that during these reviews particular attention would be directed toward insuring that information regarding applying for Area Hire and Extended Area Hire Placement is made available to all seniority employees. Employees will receive confirmation of their application(s).
II.	EXTENDED AREA HIRE PLACEMENT

, Employees continue to be eligible for Extended Area Hire placement as long as they retain unbroken GM seniority.
. The offer of an available job will be made in seniority order from volunteers on the Extended Area Hire List.
If an opening occurs for which an active employee is eligible, the active employee will be given the opportunity to fill the opening only if there is a seniority employee within the Area Hire Area to replace the active employee, if required.
Employees who have filed an Extended Area Hire Application will receive up to three (3) offers for placement in each year of the Agreement to one of the plants they have selected. If employees do not take advantage of any of these offers, their Extended Area Hire Application will be canceled at the end of each year. Such employees may later be eligible to refile an Extended Area Hire Application only in the event their status changes at their present location.
F. Employees will be eligible for relocation as described in the Relocation Section (Section VJ) of this Memorandum of Understanding Employee Placement and in Paragraph (96a) of the National Agreement.
G, Employees who are placed in accordance with the Extended Area Hire Placement provisions of the National Agreement and who accept the Basic Relocation Option specified in Paragraph (96a) of the National Agreement may not be subject to recall or rehire or Extended Area Hire placement at

any General Motors plants, for a period of six (6) months or until permanently laid off under conditions which establish there is no reasonable likelihood of recall, whichever occurs first. It is understood that the six month period may be modified or extended by mutual agreement between the Corporation and the International Union, UAW.
At the end of such period, employees who would'otherwise have been recalled or rehired to a former location(s) may either remain at the current plant or return to such previous location. If an employee returns, the local parties may make adjustments necessary to insure that the employee is neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the above provisions. Local Managements have ninety (90) days following the date an employee elects to return to accomplish such adjustments.
Employees will be given a reasonable amount of time to relocate to another plant.
Employees who are placed in accordance with Appendix A and accept the Enhanced Relocation Allowance will not be eligible to initiate another Extended Area Hire placement or initiate an Area Hire placement as an active employee for a period of 36 months unless the employee’s status changes to laid off or Protected. In the event the plant has excess employes,, on permanent indefinite layoff or placed on Protected status with ng likglihggd Qf_rcg,all inte.ttte acfivg workforce, the 36 month period will be eliminated.

B.	In medical disputes, the National Parties may refer the employee for an impartial medical opinion.
YUL SENIORITY RETURN TO FORMER COMMUNITY (Formerly Document No. 14)
The following methods and procedures detail the circumstances under which eligible employees who apply will be offered the opportunity to return to their former community.
A. Eligible employees are those seniority employees on roll at a plant who have been relocated to that plant from a plant outside the Area Hire in accordance with Appendix A and worked there six (6) months and who still retain seniority at a plant in the former community.
B, Eligible employees will be given the opportunity to file an application to return to their former community. Employees will receive a confirmation of their application.
Employees may have only one return to former community application on file at any given time. Once employees return to a former community under the provisions of this document, they are no longer eligible to return to any other community until such time as they are laid off or relocate in accordance with Appendix A.
C.	Eligible employees who have applied to return to their former community shall have their names placed on the Area Hire list for the plants within the community to which they have applied.
180
At the time of receiving an offer to return to a plant in a former community, employees who have filed a Return to Former Community Application, may elect to receive a payment of $6,000 to remain at their current plant. As a result of receiving this payment, the employees will terminate seniority and return rights at all other GM facilities and therefore no longer be eligible for Return To Former Community consideration.
Employees returning to a plant in their former community will acquire seniority in accordance with the Application of Corporate Seniority Section (Section IX) of this Memorandum.
Should employees return to their former community under the provisions of this Section, their seniority will be terminated pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (64)(d) at the plant from which they are leaving, effective with the date to report to the new plant.
It is recognized that the plant from which the eligible employee is released must do so in a manner consistent with the maintenance of quality and efficiency. Accordingly, no eligible employee will be released until a fully trained replacement is available. Consistent with these principles, it is recognized that the rate at which employees are released may vary due to the types of jobs held by such employees, the availability of replacement personnel, product or new model launch, the releasing plant’s staffing requirements or other business reasons. In all cases, management will endeavor to release employees as quickly as possible.

IX, APPLICATION OF CORPORATE SENIORITY (Formerly Appendix D-l)
A. Employees who are moved to a secondary plant in accordance with this Memorandum, while retaining unbroken seniority in their base plant, shall establish seniority in such secondary plant as follows:
1.	Employees with seniority dates of January 7, 1985 or earlier will establish an adjusted plant seniority date of January 7, 1985,
2.	When two (2) or more employees establish the same plant seniority date pursuant to Paragraph (1) above, the date established for each employee for vacation under Paragraph (190) of the National Agreement will be used to determine seniority preference among such employees.
3.	Employees with seniority dates subsequent to January 7, 1985 will establish that subsequent date as their plant seniority date.
4.	Joumeymen/women or E.I.T.S. employees with unbroken Skilled Trades seniority dates or dates of entry of January 7, 1985 or before, who are employed in the same or related Skilled Trades Classification, will establish a date of entry of January 7, 1985 in that classification.

During the course of the discussions leading to the current National Agreement, the Corporation and the UAW discussed situations where the placement in the program of a selected apprentice or EIT applicant is delayed. The Union emphasized that problems resulted when such a delay occurs due to (1) an approved leave of absence for jury duty, (2) approved time off pursuant to the Vacation Entitlement Section, (3) a sick leave of absence under the provisions of Paragraph (106) or (108), (4) the short term needs of Local Management such as the necessity to train a replacement for the person who has been selected, or (5) an absence which qualifies the employee for bereavement pay, (6) for paid absence allowance time off under the provisions of prior agreements, or (7) for short term military duty.
The Corporation has advised the Union that if an opening occurs and the person selected to fill the opening is delayed for one of the reasons specified above and the delay is for not more than 21 calendar days, that person's date of entry for seniority purposes shall be the date he or she would have originally been placed in the opening.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
It is the policy of the General Motors Corporation to perform maintenance work with its own employees, provided it has the labor, skills, equipment and facilities to do so and can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limits. At times the Corporation does not deem advisable doing the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve to itself the right to decide whether it will do any particular work or let the work to outside contractors. This letter is not to be regarded as impairing that right in any way.
The Corporation hereby assures the Union that it has no plans to change its policy and that it expects to continue its general operating policy of placing primary reliance on its own skilled trades employees to perform maintenance work to the extent consistent with sound business practice, as in the past.
In this regard, we have seen the use of joint Management and Union work schedule and business opportunity teams work very successfully in many of our locations. This approach has not only enhanced job security, but has allowed a better understanding as to the competitive challenges facing the parties. As such, each location is encouraged to establish a skilled trades subcontracting planning team involving both Management and Union representation who will review forecasted work schedules, including projects and jobs which may be subject to subcontracting, in order to




&



i
develop the most efficient approach to the work to be performed. Plants who have experienced success with this approach have found that meetings scheduled weekly, if necessary, were most beneficial, and therefore such meetings should be scheduled accordingly at all plants.
The Corporation is genuinely interested in maintaining maximum employment opportunities for its skilled trades employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation. Therefore, in making these determinations, the Corporation intends always to keep the interests of General Motors personnel in mind.
Very truly yours,
Troy A. Clarke

During the 1979 negotiations the Union discussed with the Corporation serious problems affecting the job security of employees resulting from contracting out of work.



APPENDIX F-1
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course of negotiations, the Union complained that in certain instances the work force in maintenance and tool and die trades particularly was reduced through attrition and then work was contracted out to the point where there was insufficient manpower available within the plant to perform the work; that in certain instances EIT's were reduced to production jobs and work in their trades which they historically performed and which they were capable of performing was subsequently contracted out for extended periods without recalling the EIT's to the skilled trades jobs from which they had been reduced; and that in certain instances skilled trades employees were permanently laid off and new work which they had historically performed was contracted out for extended periods, instead of recalling these employees to their jobs. Similar complaints were made relative to work in the Corporation's engineering departments. In certain instances, the Union alleged that work historically performed in the Parts Division had been contracted out accounting in part for the reduction in the number of employees in that division.
The essential elements in the complaints registered by the Union went to the question of job security.

Hi
During the 1996 National Negotiations, the parties reviewed the competitive advantage of General Motors talented skilled trades workforce. Discussed were the Union's concerns for the integrity of the apprenticeable trades, the job security of the skilled trades workforce, the content of skilled trades work assignments, and the status of work functions historically performed by the bargaining unit.

At times it is not practicable for the Corporation to do the work itself, and it must, as in the past, reserve the right to decide whether it will do particular maintenance, tool and die and engineering skilled trades work, or contract it out. The Union recognizes that in making such decisions the Corporation must consider among other things, the efficiencies and economies involved, the need for specialized tools and equipment, special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model change and plant rearrangement deadlines.
In our discussions we agreed that employees' jobs should not be eliminated by reason of a practice of contracting out, and we agreed that existing employment opportunities of seniority employees should not be unnecessarily reduced by reason of management contracting out work. The Corporation, moreover, states that it is its policy to fully utilize its seniority employees, under circumstances in which it is reasonable and practicable to do so, in the performance of work which they have historically performed to produce its product and perform its services.
While GM intends to provide this opportunity to its skilled trades workforce, the parties agreed that prolonged schedules involving substantial overtime were not in the best interest of employees or the Corporation and, as a result, GM must consider the availability of its skilled workforce when scheduling potential overtime. The parties are expected to work out acceptable means by which Management will have reliable information as to the hours employees will work when planning such work schedules.
196
figwrjH'^fUgggal
197
mi
Accordingly, the Corporation states that it will make a reasonable effort to avoid contracting out work which adversely affects the job security of its employees and that it will utilize various training programs available to it, whenever practicable, to maintain employment opportunities for its employees consistent with the needs of the Corporation.

Troy A. Clarke Group Vice President Manufacturing & Labor Relations {See Par. (42a),(183)(a)-(e)] [See App. F.F2] (See Doc. 58.59]

In any Plant on a shift where there are 30 or more skilled trades employees (E.I.T, H-l.i.x, Joumeymen/women) who are not represented by a District Committeeperson who is classified as a skilled trades employee, a Special Skilled Trades Representative may be selected as specified below to assist in handling skilled trades grievances as provided hereinafter.
A. In those plants where there is a District Committeeperson on the shift classified as a skilled trades employee, such District Committeeperson shall be the designated Special Skilled Trades Representative on that shift. If there is more than one District Committeeperson on the shift classified as a skilled trades employee, only one shall be selected as the Special Skilled Trades Representative by the Union.
B. Where there is no District Committeeperson on a shift classified as a skilled trades employee, the Local Union will select a skilled trades employee from among those working on that shift to be the Special Skilled Trades Representative and a reservoir of 12 scheduled straight time hours for Monday through Friday will be established for that representative to handle the duties specified below without loss of pay except that time spent attending the regular Shop Committee meetings pursuant to Section II.C. below will not be charged against this reservoir.
Upon written notification designating the Special Skilled Trades Representative selected

pursuant to Paragraph I above, that representative will be allowed to leave regular job duties without undue delay to perform the following duties:
A. If a District Committeeperson who is not a skilled trades employee is called pursuant to Paragraph (29) to represent a skilled trades employee to handle a specified grievance concerning an alleged violation of one of the provisions of Paragraphs (152) through (183), such committeeperson may request that the supervisor call the Special Skilled Trades Representative for that shift. Before a grievance is reduced to writing by the District Committeeperson, the Special Skilled Trades Representative may assist the District Committeeperson in a consultative and advisory capacity, and in doing so, if necessary, may make an independent investigation of the grievance and submit a report to the District Committeeperson. The Special Skilled Trades Representative may not function as a committeeperson nor initiate a grievance.
B.	If the grievance is reduced to writing by the District Commiiteeperson and the Special Skilled Trades Representative has made an independent investigation and submitted a report to the District Committeeperson on that grievance before it is reduced to writing, the Special Skilled Trades Representative may, at the request of the District Committeeperson, assist the District Committeeperson in a consultative and advisory capacity during the committeeperson’s discussions conducted with supervision pursuant to Paragraph (30)
202
of the National Agreement. During discussions with higher supervision, the Special Skilled Trades Representative will function as an alternative to the second committeeperson provided for in the provisions of Paragraph (30) of the National Agreement.
C.	In those plants where there is no member of the Shop Committee classified as a skilled trades employee, one Special Skilled Trades Representative will attend regular Shop Committee meetings to serve in a consultative and advisory capacity during the resolution of a Paragraph (140b) or Paragraph (14 l)(a) issue or discussion of a grievance which involves a specific skilled trades issue and which alleges a violation of a local Agreement, or Paragraphs (3), (102) or one of the provisions of Paragraphs (152) through (183) of the National Agreement.
D.	In the event there is no committeeperson classified as a skilled trades employee representing skilled trades employees, one Special Skilled Trades Representative will attend the special conference provided for in the provisions of Paragraph (182)(a) of the National Agreement, replacing one of the Union’s representatives provided for in that paragraph, to serve in a consultative and advisory capacity during such conference.
E.	In the event none of the Local Union representatives designated in Paragraph (183)(d) are skilled trades employees, one Special Skilled Trades Representative will replace one of those representatives during the specified advance discussion and serve in

APPENDIX K
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING JOB SECURITY (JOBS) PROGRAM
The Corporation and the Union are committed to enhancing the job security of General Motors employees. The Parties also recognize that such job security can only be realized within a work environment which promotes operational effectiveness, continuous improvement and competitiveness.
Accordingly, the parties have agreed to this JOBS Program and have pledged to work together, consistent with this Program and other provisions of the National Agreement to enhance the Corporation’s competitive position.
The cornerstone of the JOBS Program is a commitment to pre-determined Secured Employment Levels (SELs), a series of SEL Benchmark Minimums, and protection against indefinite layoff for eligible employees as expressly provided herein.

SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM - The Corporation and the Union agree that:
(A)	The secured employment levels (SELs) (i.e., numbers of eligible employees or positions covered by this Program as defined herein) initially shall be established as of the Effective Date of the Agreement at each bargaining unit for skilled and non-skilled employees will be continued. The transfer of an employee between skilled and nonskilled will cause the SEL for the group receiving the employee to increase and the other group from which the movement occurred to decrease unless the movement occurred to satisfy the SEL, in which case the SEL will remain the same in each group,
205

i. i.£d<itai
(B)	The initial Secured Employment Levels for each Unit shall be equal to the sum of: (1) the number of active employees with one or more years seniority at work and on roll in the Unit on the Effective Date; (2) the number of active employees occupying SEL slots in the Unit on the Effective Date; and (3) the number of unfilled new hire obligations in the Unit as of the Effective Date due to the application of the outsourcing/new hire provisions of the 1996-99 Agreement, Appendix K (Article II (O)(2)b.3.). Such active employees will be SEL eligible and shall include employees not at work who are:
(1)	on vacation,
(2)	receiving bereavement pay,
(3)	on jury duty,
(4)	on any leave of absence of 90 days duration or less,
(5)	on temporary layoff, and
(6)	any other employee having a direct attachment to the active workforce.
(C)	A series of SEL Benchmark Minimums will be established for each Unit on the Effective Date, representing projected SEL-eligible employment minimums as of the close of each calendar quarter beginning with the quarter ending December 31, 2003 through the quarter ending June 30, 2007. Each quarterly Benchmark shall be determined by subtracting from the immediately preceding SEL Benchmark an amount equal to .333% of the Unit’s Initial SEL, so that the June 30,
206
2007 Benchmark shall equal 9.0% of the initial SEL. (If this calculation results in something other than a whole number, sequential rounding adjustments may be made to even out the calculations over the term of the Agreement.)
(D)	No employee will be laid off for any reason, other than described in 1(E), if such layoff would cause the number of active employees in the unit to fall below the then current SEL or otherwise result in the layoff of one or more SEL eligible employees.
(E)	Paragraph 1(D) notwithstanding, an employee protected from layoff by the SEL may be laid off for any of the following reasons:
(1)	volume related declines attributable to market related conditions as described in Document No. 10, JOBS Program -Volume Related Layoffs - SEL, not to exceed 48 weeks (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks) over the life of the Agreement;
(2)	acts of God or other such reasons beyond the control of the Corporation;
(3)	the sale of a part of the Corporation's operations as an ongoing business;
(4)	the layoff of an employee recalled or reassigned to fill an opening known in advance to be temporary; or
(5)	model change or plant rearrangement until the employee otherwise would have been recalled.
207

209:. .

An employee impacted by any of the above reasons is, if otherwise eligible, covered by the appropriate Supplemental Agreements which are attached to the National Agreement as Exhibits.
(F)	The number of employees protected by this JOBS Program will be the equivalent of the employees within the SEL who would otherwise have been laid off as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph 1(E).
II. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SEL AND SEL ELIGIBILITY - Following the initial determination of the SEL, it will be adjusted as follows:
(A) An employee shall become SEL-eligiblc for any of the following reasons at which point the SEL will be increased by one position for each such employee: (1) an employee in the active workforce, as defined by Paragraph 1(B) who had less than one year seniority on the Effective Date of the Agreement who subsequently attains one year of seniority; (2) an employee with one or more years seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SEL, and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the effective date of the Agreement; (3) an employee with less than one years seniority is recalled, except if recalled to satisfy the SEL, who subsequently attains one years seniority and is actively at work, on vacation or receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the
208
effective date of the Agreement; (4) an employee rehired pursuant to Paragraph (64)(e), except if rehired to satisfy a SEL, who subsequently attains one years seniority and is actively at work, on vacation hr receives pay in at least 26 weeks during any consecutive 52-week period ending after the effective date of the Agreement; (5) ah employee‘newly hired after the effective date of the Agreement who attains three . . years seniority; (6) an.employee deemed to ; be'eligible, recalled br newly hired in order to satisfy a SEL Benchmark Minimum. ; ■ Notwithstanding the above, the National JOBS Committee is authorized to establish special .mechanisms, including .SEL eligibility provisions, for the purpose of attracting new work. ■
(B) The SEL will be reduced for the attrition of eligible employees who quit, retire, or die.
(£) Unit SELs will be adjusted in the event of transfers of operations or consolidations between Units. The Unit SEL will be decreased by one at the transferring location . arid increased by one at the receiving , ,, location by the corresponding number of '
•employees who transfer, unless otherwise agreed to by the National parties. Similarly, . corresponding adjustments will also be made to the SEL Benchmark Minimums of . each affected unit. .
(J))Each employee who leaves the bargaining■ unit for a permanent salaried position will be replaced immediately with no effect on the.. SEL by recalling an employee from layoff or from the Area Hire List, or by hiring a new •




■ 4
employee if no such laid off employee is available. For each regular salaried employee returning to the bargaining unit, the SEL will be increased by one.
(E) SEL eligible employees off roll will maintain their eligibility upon reinstatement.
(E) (1) Following the last day of each month and within 15 days of the following month (SEL Benchmark Review), the number of SEL-eligible employees in each Unit shall be compared to the Unit's corresponding SEL Benchmark Minimum. Adjustments will be made consistent with the provisions of this Memorandum, and attrition replacement obligations will be fulfilled as set forth below.
(2)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees exceeds the Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-two basis by recalling employees on layoff in accordance with the procedure described in Section (3)(b) below.
(3)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees would otherwise fall below the Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on a one-for-one basis by the following actions in order to maintain eligible employment at the Benchmark Minimum:
(a)	First, by allowing an ineligible active seniority employee at the affected facility to become eligible,
(b)	Second, by recalling a seniority employee from layoff from the
210
facility, or rehiring an employee with a Paragraph (64)(e) rehire right, or from the Area Hire list,
(c)	Or third, by hiring new employees up to the net number of jobs outsourced minus those insourced (as defined in Appendix L of the Agreement and determined by the National Committee) subsequent to the Effective Date. Such positions will be filled on a Unit basis no later than ninety (90) days following the SEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected Unit is encountering market-driven, volume-related layoffs.
(4)	Notwithstanding the above, the net outsourcing/new hire obligation provided in Section (3)(c) above shall be activated earlier than required therein if and when the number of SEL-eligible employees is less than the greater of: (1) the SEL Benchmark Minimum for the quarter; or (2) 95% of the Unit’s Baseline SEL under the 1996 Agreement.
(5)	If, after fulfilling the above requirements, subsequent attritions would cause the number of SEL-eligible employees to fall below the Unit’s Benchmark Minimum, attrition will be replaced on the following basis:
(a)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees is greater than 90% but less than 100% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (I) new employee will be hired for each three (3) attritions.
in.
(b)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees is greater than 80% but less than 90% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (1) new employee will be hired for each two (2) attritions.
(c)	When the number of SEL-eligible employees is below 80% of the Benchmark Minimum, one (I) new employee will be hired for each one (1) attrition.
(d)	Such positions will be filled on a Unit basis no later than ninety (90) days following the SEL Benchmark Review, except when the affected unit is encountering market-driven, volume-related layoffs.
(6)	Employees recalled, hired, or rehired to fulfill the above obligations may be assigned within their Unit at Management’s discretion, subject to applicable seniority provisions of the Agreement.
(G)	If on the evaluation date the SEL number results in less than a whole number, the Engineering Method of Rounding will be used to determine the SEL.
(H)	Notwithstanding the above, SEL Benchmark Minimums will not be established for a facility determined to be closing,
JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS - In recognition of the fact that job security can only result from joint efforts to improve operational effectiveness, the Corporation and the Union agree that:
212

(A)	For a period commencing with the Effective Date of this Memorandum of Understanding and for the life of the current Agreement, no employee within the SEL will be laid off as a result of any event other than those described in Paragraph 1(E).
(B)	An employee whose regular job is eliminated will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the National Agreement and Local Seniority Agreement.
(C)	The number of employees protected from layoff due to the JOBS Program will be that determined in Paragraph 1(F). Each Protected employee will be identified by application of the Local Seniority Agreement provisions as if such job security were not provided.
(D)	If an event, other than those described in 1(E), would otherwise cause the number of active employees in a unit to fall below the then current SEL, the employees so protected, as provided for in 1(D), will be placed on Protected employee status. The Parties recognize that events, other than those described in 1(E), may occur during the course of this Agreement that will cause the number of SEL eligible employees to exceed the Corporation’s production requirements. The parties further recognize that the scope of this program requires flexibility with regard to the assignment of such Protected employees and the selection of employees for training. In this regard, the Local JOBS Committee (described in Section IV, below) will insure that assignments are made on a basis consistent with the seniority provisions
213
of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and Local Seniority Agreement while meeting plant needs, minimizing work force disruption and enhancing the personal growth and development of employees. After a decision by the Local JOBS Committee a Protected employee may be (1) placed in a training program, (2) used as a replacement to facilitate the training of another employee, (3) placed in a job opening at another GM plant provided there is no employee on layoff from that plant with a seniority recall or Paragraph (64)(e) rehire right or an Area Hire applicant who has not been offered a job at that plant, (4) given a job assignment within or outside the bargaining unit which may be non-traditional, (5) placed in an existing opening or (6) given other assignments consistent with the purposes of this Memorandum of Understanding.
(E)	(1) Notwithstanding the above, an available Protected employee may be placed on the Area Hire list by Management for selection to an available opening at another location within the area. The number of such Protected employees made available for placement cannot exceed the number of Protected employees who have been laid off for the duration of the 48 week volume-related layoff limit (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks). Protected employees will be made available for Area Hire placement in inverse seniority order.
(2)	A location that has no one on layoff with a seniority recall or Paragraph (64)(c) rchirc right may fill a job opening with an
214

215
<f>



available Protected employee from another location within the Area Hire Area pursuant to Paragraphs M (1) and (2), or an Area Hire applicant who has not been offered a job in the Area Hire Area.
The SEL will be reduced by one at the plant from which the employee is transferred and increased by one at the plant to which the employee is transferred, unless the transfer satisfied the SEL, in which case the SEL will remain the same at both plants.
An available Protected employee transferred permanently to another location may remain at the secondary location until at the employee’s home location (1) there is an available opening in the regular active workforce to which the employee is entitled, or (2) the employee is recalled to Protected employee status, or (3) the employee is laid off from the secondary plant, at which time the employee will return, seniority permitting, to the active workforce.
(F)	Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness will be encouraged and supported by the national parties including, as may be appropriate, approval of requests to waive, modify or change the National Agreement.
(G)	A Protected employee will continue to receive their regular straight time hourly rate of pay. In the event a Protected employee is assigned to another classification, the employee will receive the rate of pay as provided by the Local Wage Agreement.


216
"A
(I)
(J)
217

■
V
(H)	Protected employees’ assignments will be
considered temporary and not subject to provisions governing permanent filling of vacancies or the application of shift preference, except for assignments to fill openings resulting from volume increases. Experience gained from these temporary assignments will not be used to advantage such Protected employee over other employees for selection to fill permanent vacancies, nor will the Protected employee gain seniority under Paragraph (62) of the National Agreement from such assignments.
An employee replaced by a Protected employee will receive their regular straight time hourly rate of pay, and will be returned to the same classification and job assignment upon completion of the replaced employee's assignment. In the event the employee has insufficient seniority to return to the formerly held classification, the employee will be placed pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Local Seniority Agreement.
If an employee would have been transferred pursuant to Paragraphs (63)(a)(l), (63)(a)(2). (63)(b) or (153) of the National Agreement or placed in an Apprentice program were it not for participation in a training assignment provided by this program, the employee will be transferred to this classification upon completion of the training assignment. In the event the employee would have been selected for an E.I.T. or Apprentice assignment the employee’s date of entry will be adjusted as if the employee’s assignment had not been delayed.
(K> A replaced employee returned to a job assignment under this Program will be credited with all overtime hours the employee worked while out of the equalization group, but not with the overtime hours the employee would otherwise have worked in the group had the employee not have been replaced by the Protected employee.
(L) A training assignment will be voluntary on the part of an employee being replaced by a Protected employee, unless such training is to develop or improve technical skills relevant to the employee’s current job assignment or anticipated future job needs.
(M) No Protected employee will be temporarily assigned to a job outside of the bargaining unit except on a voluntary basis, subject to the direction of the National Committee. Permanent transfers of Protected employees outside the bargaining unit to other GM-UAW represented plants within the Area Hire Area will be handled as follows:
(1)	Management may place a Protected employee’s name on the Area Hire list. The number of names so placed may not exceed the number of employees who have been laid off for the duration of the 48 week volume-related layoff limit (inclusive of vacation shutdown). Protected employees will be made available for Area Hire placement in inverse seniority order. Thereafter, such employees may be selected in seniority order to available jobs at other locations. The seniority used by a skilled trades
&
a
jwi
Ri

employee in administering these provisions will be the employee’s date of entry or Joumeyman/woman date.
(2)	A Protected employee who is transferred permanently out. of the Area Hire Area in accordance with this paragraph, or if so transferred later accepts a recall or rehire at a former location, will be eligible to receive a relocation allowance and other relocation services as provided in Paragraphs (96a) (1), (2), (3), and (4), of the National Agreement. A Protected employee temporarily transferred out of the Area Hire Area who does not change permanent residence as a result of the transfer will receive reasonable transportation and living expenses for the duration of the assignment. Any problems connected with the above may be raised with the National Committee.
	in '
(N)	In the event there is an opening due to a volume increase, the available Protected employee with the highest seniority will be placed in this opening, unless the Local Committee determines the employee should first complete the employee’s current assignment. If seniority employees are on layoff from that plant, a number of such employees, equivalent to the number of Protected employees placed in openings due to volume increases will be recalled from layoff. A Protected employee transferred to another GM plant due to a volume increase who is subsequently laid off from the secondary plant due to a volume decrease will be returned to available openings at the employee’s home plant, seniority permitting.
218

(O)	A layoff caused by an event described in Paragraph 1(E) will have no impact on the number of Protected employees except for an employee who is protected from a layoff attributable to a market related volume decline in excess of 48 weeks (inclusive of vacation shutdown weeks). In those instances, Protected employees, having the least seniority, will be laid-off and replaced by an equivalent number of greater seniority employees who would otherwise have insufficient seniority to remain in the plant.
(P)	In the event the Local or National Committee determines that the number of Protected employees exceeds the number of expected openings at the plant or in the Area within the next succeeding 12 months, special programs as set forth in Attachment A may be triggered upon prior approval of the National Committee. Thereafter, to the extent the number of Protected employees is still in excess of expected openings, such employees, under the direction of the National Committee, may be transferred out of the area pursuant to Paragraph (M). The National Committee may also explore the extension of Attachment A to other locations to create job opportunities for excess Protected employees within the Area Hire area.
(Q)	Earnings, including wages and wage related payments, received by employees while on Protected employee assignments, will be charged against the maximum liability amount. The cost of benefits and other payments made or incurred on behalf of Protected employees, specifically, health care

(including dental and vision), group insurance, pensions, legal services, training fund contributions, and F1CA will be charged against the maximum liability amount. Moving allowance payments and the cost of benefits provided under Attachment A of this Memorandum of Understanding will not be charged against this liability. Earnings received and the cost of benefits and other payments made on behalf of Protected employees while assigned to fill permanent job openings resulting from volume increases or assigned to other regular and productive work (e.g., absentee replacements) will not be charged against this liability.
(R)	Charges against the Corporation's liability will commence with the first payments made to Protected employees and will continue until the maximum liability is reached or the expiration of the Program as provided in this Memorandum of Understanding, whichever occurs first. The records of such charges will be maintained by the Corporation and will be available to the Union at appropriate times.
ADMINISTRATION OF THE JOBS PROGRAM - The Corporation and Union agree that:
(A)	At each bargaining unit covered by the current GM-UAW National Agreement, a Local JOBS Committee will be established to administer the Program.
(B)	The membership of the Committee will consist of the local Plant Manager, and other representatives selected by management; the local Union President, if a General Motors employee, and the Shop Committee.
220
(C)	The duties of the Local Committee will be:
(1)	Review local accessions and separations relative to the Unit Secured Employment Level (SEL) and the number of Protected employees.

(12)	Review any complaint regarding the administration of the JOBS Program. Refer unresolved complaints to the National Committee. The National Parties will limit the review of complaints to those raised, in writing, within 60 days of a SEL Benchmark Review or other event giving rise to the complaint unless the time limit is waived by the National Committee. Only those matters governing the size of the SEL-eligible population, the number of Protected employees, the SEL; or the treatment of a Protected employee as set forth in Section HI of this Memorandum of Understanding will be subject to the Grievance Procedure. Such grievances will be filed at the Second Step of the grievance procedure. All other unresolved complaints will be settled expeditiously between the parties at the National level,
Disputes arising from the following matters may be submitted within fifteen (15) days of a SEL Benchmark Review to the Vice President and Director of the UAW General Motors Department and the Group Vice President, Manufacturing & Labor Relations, General Motors Corporation: (1) market-driven, volume-related layoffs; and (2) new hire obligations required pursuant to Section 11(E). If unresolved, the dispute must be appealed to the Umpire within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal.

ATTACHMENT A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
The National JOBS Committee may, from time to time and for specified periods, authorize the following Special Programs for designated eligible employees or may approve requests from Local JOBS Committees for implementation of such Programs. Employees must apply within the application period determined by the local parties and approved by the National JOBS Committee.
SPECIAL PROGRAM #1 JOBS VOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM
The JOBS Voluntary Termination of Employment Program (VTEP) provides a guaranteed lump-sum benefit payment subject to the conditions and limitations contained herein. This Program is applicable to an employee with at least one year of seniority who is at work or is a Protected employee on or after the effective date of the Agreement.
Description of Program Benefits
Years of Seniority		Allocation	
As of Application			Period
Date		$ Amount	(Months)
1 but less than	2	15,000	6
2 but less than	5	21,000	9
5 but less than	10	37,000	15
10 but less than	15	47,000	19

20 but less than	25	67,000	27
25		72,000	29
228
The maximum gross amount of the benefit payable under this Program is $72,000 for employees with 25 or more years of seniority.
In no event, however, shall the amount of a VTEP payment provided under this Program exceed such amount permissible under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
An employee who accepts a VTEP payment shall be ,, provided with basic health care coverage for a period of
6 months dating from the end of the month following the month in which the employee last worked.
An employee eligible for an immediate pension benefit under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan, at the time of his/her break in service (due to participation in a VTEP), shall upon completion of the Allocation Period and application for a pension benefit under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan become eligible for post retirement health care and life insurance on the same basis as other retirees. For purposes of applying the terms of the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan, such employees shall not be treated as deferred vested by reason of their participation in a VTEP.
VTEP Payment Offsets
Any VTEP payment to an eligible employee will be reduced by the employee's outstanding debts to the Corporation or to the Trustees of any Corporation benefit plan or program, including any unrepaid overpayments to the employee under the SUB Plan or GIS Program, Exhibits D and E, respectively, to the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Effect of Receiving VTEP Payment
An employee who accepts a VTEP payment shall (i) cease to be an employee and shall have his/her seniority broken at any and all of the Corporation’s Plants or other locations as of the last day worked subsequent to


the date his/her application for a VTEP payment is received (termination date), (ii) shall have cancelled any eligibility the employee would otherwise have had for a Separation Payment and/or Redemption Payment under Exhibits D-l and E-l, respectively, to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, (iii) shall not be eligible to receive a mutual satisfactory retirement benefit under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan, and (iv) shall not be permitted to retire under the Hourly Rate Employees Pension Plan for the number of months of the allocation period following the termination date.
An employee who receives a VTEP payment, and who is subsequently reemployed by General Motors, will not be eligible for any future VTEP payments until the employee has 5 or more years seniority following such reemployment. No seniority used to determine the amount of a previous VTEP payment shall be used in determining a subsequent VTEP payment.
General
The JOBS Pension Program provides pension benefits unreduced for age, payable under the Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan (Exhibit A to the Collective Bargaining Agreement) subject to the eligibility terms and conditions contained in such Pension Plan, and further subject to such terms and conditions contained herein. This Program is applicable to employees who are at work or is a Protected employee, on or after the effective date of the Agreement.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
GOALS AND
OBJECTIVES OF JOB SECURITY AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS
The Corporation and the Union recognize that quality and operating efficiency are inextricably wed to job security, and that a high level of quality and operating efficiency requires mutual respect and recognition of each other's problems and concerns. Accordingly, in addition to the Local JOBS Committee’s responsibilities for the JOBS Program and participation in discussions provided in related Letters of Understanding, each committee will focus on cooperative efforts toward our common goal to improve the effectiveness of operations and remove barriers to improvements, increase job opportunities and fully utilize the workforce. The local committees will jointly develop a plan through an exhaustive analysis of the location’s operational efficiency.
Within six months of the effective date of the Agreement, each Local JOBS Committee will review with Divisional/Group Management and the International Union the overall competitiveness of the location's products and their plans indicating actions, and/or changes needed to improve quality and efficiency at their location and to stimulate job security of the existing workforce and attract new work. Such plans must then be approved by the established National Job Security and Operational Effectiveness Committee.
At the national level, the Committee will have an equal number of Union and Corporate representatives designated by the General Motors Group Vice President - Labor Relations and by the Vice President and Director of the GM Department, International Union, UAW.

232

The National Committee will oversee implementation and administration of these Job Security and Operational Effectiveness Plans. Members of the National Committee will meet jointly with Local Committees to discuss the importance of job preservation and job creation, the reasons for the commitment to increase operational efficiency, suggest possible topics for consideration, and encourage goodfaith efforts to develop and implement meaningful local plans.
The National Committee will be available on an ongoing basis as a resource to Local Committees and will review progress at the local level at least on an annual basis.
In these efforts, it is recognized that a great deal of initiative and imagination will be required by the local parties. While not intended to limit such innovation, the following are examples of appropriate areas the local parties may address:
1)	identification of investments in the facility or equipment necessary to improve product quality or operational effectiveness;
2)	the establishment of a team concept and/or pay-for-knowledge wage structure;
3)	the identification of non-labor cost savings and efficiencies;
4)	procedures and plans to review past outsourcing and outside contracting decisions, and identify opportunities for insourcing and new business;
5)	the examination of new forms of work organization, such as job assignments relating to Just-in-Time or other quality enhancement systems;
233
234

APPENDIX L SOURCING




235
6)	procedures to review supervisory staffing and support for the initiatives in this Job Security and Operational Effectiveness section of the JOBS Program;
7)	a realignment in skilled classifications to a number of appropriate basic trades to support the needs of the operation or location;
8) the implementation of skilled trades team concepts;
9) initiatives to reduce chronic absenteeism;
10) procedures for improved access by the Local Joint Committee to product plans and other information affecting employment security and operational effectiveness, assuring confidential treatment of such information;
11) the establishment of work standards on operations that fully utilize employees;
12) the examination of alternative work schedules which provide greater employment opportunities.
Efforts of the local parties to improve operational effectiveness may require change or waiver of certain agreements or practices. It is understood that any such waivers, modifications or changes would not be effective unless agreed to by the local parties involved and approved in writing by the GM Labor Relations Staff and the General Motors Department of the Union. Such changes would be effective only at the location(s) specifically designated.
(See Par. (S2)J
(See CSA #11]

During these negotiations, the Union raised numerous concerns about the Corporation’s sourcing actions and the impact on employment opportunities. To that end, the Corporation will work with and assist the Union at both the Local and International levels to preserve jobs, replace jobs which may be lost by outsourcing action and to create jobs for Protected employees and laid off dfriployees. It is an objective of the Corporation to grow’ the business and to continue to rely upon its employees and facilities as the source of its products. During the life of the current Agreement, the Corporation will advise, in writing, the Union members of the Sourcing Committee of the Labor Policy Board meeting results relative to sourcing recommendations, including the number of potential jobs affected. Additionally, data regarding incoming and outgoing work will be given to the International Union in a quarterly meeting. (The Corporation will provide inquiry access to the International Union through the use of a computer terminal.) In this manner, the parties can judge the success of mutual efforts toward improved job security. The Corporation agrees to incorporate the procedures and structure outlined herein when making sourcing determinations during the cunent Agreement.
The rationale for sourcing actions will consider the criteria of quality, technology, cost, timing, statutory requirements, occupational and related environmental health and safety issues, the impact on long-term job stability, the degree to which the Corporation’s resources can be allocated to further capital expenditures, the overall financial stability of affected facilities, and the impact on related facilities. Other factors considered by the Corporation before a final sourcing decision is made will include the effect on
3V,


111
236
237


employment, and job and income security costs, on both a short and long-term basis. Such criteria shall give . equal weight to the full impact of a sourcing action on General Motors-UAW represented employment levels and the job and income security of General Motors-UAW represented employees. The National Parties will jointly further develop the above criteria to be used to address sourcing issues. In developing this criteria transfer pricing profits will not be considered in making sourcing decisions. Only appropriate return on investment and burden will be considered.
Following the development of the sourcing criteria, the National Sourcing Committee may form Joint Task Forces to ensure full implementation of such criteria throughout the Corporation and, on an as needed basis, to address any specific sourcing areas of concern identified by the Union. Pertinent criteria will be applied consistently in comparisons of internal and external supply capability. The International Union and where appropriate the local union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information, that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and contemplated sourcing. The Union agrees to keep all such information confidential until the Corporation consents to its release. Further, in this regard, the plant Chairperson will designate in writing those Union representatives who will have access to the quote package and related information.
If the Local Committee cannot resolve a sourcing issue, it may file a grievance at the second step of the grievance procedure.
In addition, the following specific commitments have been made to address sourcing-related job security concerns of UAW members:


1. Insourcing
The Local JOBS Committee will discuss the practicality of insourcing, in whole or in part, work previously outsourced or new work which the Committee identifies as that which might be performed competitively within the location based on the criteria outlined above. To assist in this process, the International Union will be furnished a complete master file of commodities which will be used to generate a list of parts similar to those currently ^manufactured at the location that have been (1) outsourced from that location or (2) arc currently manufactured by non-GM/UAW suppliers for General Motors. This list will be updated and expanded to include supplier expiration dates, supplier location (city and state), annual volume, and Union affiliation if known and will be furnished quarterly or as otherwise agreed by the National Parties. Thereafter, the parties will initiate efforts to insource particular work consistent with the aforementioned criteria to create prospects for growth and to provide jobs for Protected employees and employees on layoff.
If it is established that certain work can be performed competitively judged by the above criteria, management will adopt the Committee’s proposal and barring unique or unforeseen circumstances, bring the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approval or ratification within 30 days of the decision to bring the work in-house,

- Work currently performed by an outside supplier that has never been produced inside the Corporation is subsequently insouiced and the tel JOBS Committee verifies actual manpower imuagt on the plant floor.
As an insourcing incentive, any work not covered-in the two preceding paragraphs, which the Corooration contemplates producing in a UAW-reoresented location(s) and for which it desires insourcing credit will be considered for such credit by the National Sourcing Committee, upon request from the Joe al parties.
The National Parties recognize the importance of the local JOBS Committee reviewing_the.jnsouregd.i2.bs on the plant floor for accurate employee verification relative to insourcing notices.
2.	Outsourcing
Outsourcing as used herein means the Corporation’s sourcing of work from GM/UAW locations, including work connected with current, new or redesigned vehicles, fabricated parts, powertrain, and component products.
When the quoting process begins, the local Union at the affected location(s) will review and have access to the entire request for quotation package for this work along with cost book information. Upon receipt of this package at the plant, the Chairperson and the Personnel Director will indicate on the accompanying notice (Notice of Potential Outsourcing) that the information has been received. This notice will include a description of the work involved and will be mailed to the Vice President and Director of the General Motors Department of the UAW, and the Group Vice President - Labor Relations, North American Operations.
238


239

Following receipt of the request for quotation package (or in the infrequent instances where a quote package is not utilized), the local parties will have the opportunity to jointly develop a plan to perform the work competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix. The local Union will be provided full and timely access to all appropriate data, including financial information that is pertinent to evaluate product competitiveness and the potential sourcing action. Prior to submission of the initial '•quote response, the information contained therein will be reviewed by the local parties.
At the close of the quoting process, the local parties will be advised in writing of the most favorable quote response which best meets customer requirements and the terms and conditions contained therein. If this quote response is other than the one submitted by the affected location(s), a written notice will be issued to the Chairperson which includes the reason for the . potential outsourcing, the quote price from the affected location, if applicable, the terms and conditions of the most favorable quote response, the potential jobs impact, and the anticipated impact date. Thereafter, the local parties will be given an additional 30 days, or longer when possible, to meet the terms and conditions of the quote response referenced above. A copy of this notice will be sent to the Group Vice President - Labor Relations, North American Operations, and the Vice President and Director of the General Motors Department of the UAW
If it is established that the work can be performed competitively, judged by the criteria listed earlier in this Appendix, Management will, barring unique and unforeseen circumstances, keep the work in-house. The Union shall thereafter obtain any necessary approvals or ratification within 30 days of the decision to keep the work in-house.

The sourcing authority will not enter into a contractual relationship with a non-GM-UAW supplier until such time as the designated management representative of the impacted location provides written verification that the above notification procedure and discussion by the JOBS Committee, has taken place.
Additionally, International Union input will be sought by the Corporation and its Groups and Divisions as early as possible in the outsourcing decision-making process in order to allow for more thorough discussion and to permit the parties to better assess the impact of outsourcing on the longterm job stability of employees and the financial viability of given Corporate locations.
The Corporation agrees to a full disclosure to the International Union of the procedures utilized in sourcing activities.
3.	Temporary Outsourcing
The National Parties agree that temporary outsourcing is not intended to provide a means for circumvention and abuse of the normal outsourcing notification procedures outlined in this Agreement. Outsourcing notices issued for temporary situations such as: breakdown of machinery or equipment, plant rearrangement and/or modernization, spot buys, model changeovers, and factory assists, etc., will be incorporated in the Quarterly Sourcing Report. By incorporating these occurrences in the Quarterly Sourcing Report, it is mutually understood that legitimate temporary outsourcing will not be considered in determining the Corporation’s hiring requirements, pursuant to Appendix K, due to the scheduled return of the outsourced work.
240
The National Parties will monitor all temporary outsourcing to assure the return of such work in a timely fashion in keeping with the intent of this Appendix and Appendix K.
Beginning with the effective date of this Agreement, Temporary Outsourcing Notices which remain open 30 days beyond the date the work was projected to be returned will be converted to permanent notices and the manpower associated with the work will be counted in the Net Sourcing calculation under Appendix K. Upon return of the work after a notice has been converted to permanent status, a notice of insourcing will be issued to the impacted location.
The Parties understand that circumstances do arise wherein the projected return date of temporarily sourced work legitimately requires an extension and the above provisions are not intended to create Appendix K liabilities in those circumstances.
Any questions or problems that may arise relative to the meaning and intent of this understanding will be reviewed and resolved by the National Parties on a case-by-case basis.
4,	Future Product Sourcing
Semi-annually, a confidential review will be held concerning future product programs which will identify new or redesigned vehicles, subsystems, or component parts. These semi-annual meetings will be attended by the Group Vice President - Manufacturing & Labor Relations, North American Operations, and the Vice President and Director of the General Motors Department of the UAW, both of whom may also be requested to attend additional meetings, if deemed appropriate by the National Parties. In reviewing future product programs, representatives from various Corporate disciplines; e.g., Marketing, Engineering, and Product Planning, may be invited to attend.
243
242
iS'

In addition, an annual powertrain review meeting will be conducted by senior powertrain operations management. This meeting will include a review of the powertrain long-range plan and anticipated effect on powertrain plant product capabilities.
International Union input io early, sourcing decisions will be sought.by the Corporation’s Groups, and Divisions., In that regard, the international Union will be notified in writing by the Director. Employee Elasement. Job Security ..and Sourcing-upon Document of Strategic Intent fDSD that the Corporation will proceed with a study involving a new or redesigned vehicle., new engine, or transmission, A comparable, notification wji fa given for those components and subsystems that are not included in a new vehicle development process.
Following the notification, the members of the National Sourcing Committee shall have responsibility for overseeing the interface with individual vehicle programs and the Powertrain. Metal Fabricating, and gPQ Divisions. The UAW Future Product Sourcing Representatives for Vehicle Manufacturing. Powertrain, Metal Fabricating and SPO Divisions will work with members of their respective organizations so as to gain information and knowledge and to provide input into sourcing discussions and sourcing determinations for those organizations.
The Corporation is commitied_tQ_implemcntLng j Future Product-Sourcing process that provides the Union with early involvement, open access and input to decisions. The process will commence at the_DSI stop of the Advance Vehicle. Development Process. at which time a joint team will be formed consisting of the appropriate UAW and Labor Relations representatives, partnered with the Manufacturing Integration Manager for each product program^. The

The original installation of free-standing welding and non-welding fixtures into the Metal Assembly Department will be considered a proper part of the “Millwright” classification.
The Union referred to Paragraph 12 of Management’s proposed Skilled Trades Settlement Agreement and inquired which classification of labor would be responsible for the installation of non-welding fixtures into a line in the Metal Assembly Department.

Management stated that the necessary wiring and piping to and from non-welding fixtures which are installed into a line in the Metal Assembly Department will be the responsibility of the “Electrician” and “Pipefitter” classifications respectively during initial construction. The synchronization of such equipment into an existing line, however, will be a responsibility of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification of labor. If the installation of the new details required for an engineering change necessitated the installation of new piping from the main supply valve, the work of installing the new piping would be a proper part of the “Pipefitter” classification.
The Union referred to the recent addition of several operations on the ME Line in the Metal Assembly Department which the Union had contended at that time was a new installation and inquired how Management’s proposed Skilled Trades Settlement would affect such work in the future,
Management stated that it was the intent of its proposed settlement to consider such work as new installation which would, therefore, be a responsibility of the Plant Maintenance Department and “Die Maker -Devices” classification. As with the installation of the non-welding fixture referred to above, however, the synchronization of the new operations with the existing line would be a responsibility of the Welder Maintenance Department.
The Union referred to the automatic turnover at the end of the door lines in the Meta! Assembly Department which are currently a responsibility of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification and inquired how Management’s proposed Skilled Trades Settlement would affect this work.

fiewEgfEcsg^
would be maintained by the Plant Maintenance Department since it could be considered as an out-of-the-line operation. In this regard, however, Management stated that such a turnover in-line would be the responsibility of the Welder Maintenance Department.
Management referred to Paragraph No. 9 of its proposed Skilled Trades Settlement Agreement and stated that all fixtures constructed in this plant whether they are to be shipped to another plant or to be used in this plant will in the future be piped and wired during iqjtial construction by employees in the “Pipefitter” and “Electrician” classifications respectively. In addition, the piping and wiring on those fixtures constructed outside the plant for use in this plant which have not been piped and/or wired will be the responsibility of the “Pipefitter” and “Electrician” classifications respectively. In the past, Management stated, the piping and wiring on those fixtures constructed in this plant for use at this location were the responsibility of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification. Likewise, Management stated, the original wiring of electrical control panels which was previously the responsibility of the Welder Maintenance Department would in accordance with its proposed settlement agreement be a proper part of the “Electrician” classification of labor. In this regard, if, for example, it is necessary to replace individual wires in a control panel during a production run, such work will be assigned to the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification; however, if on the other hand it is necessary to partially or completely rewire a control panel, whether or not such work is performed in-line, the task of rewiring the control panel will be a proper part of the “Electrician” classification of labor.
The Union referred to a current appeal case wherein the Union is protesting the assignment of employees in the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair”

253
.... av rrlr^L,^a
classification to the task of jumping the lubrication system on a welding press in the Metal Assembly Department and inquired if Management’s proposed Skilled Trades Settlement language would affect the assignment of such work in the future.
Management stated that the lubrication system on the welding press in question had been jumped to complete tryout of that line, and such work would continue to be a responsibility of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification, In this regard, Management stated that the repair of mechanical systems on welding presses would be a responsibility of the Plant Maintenance Department but repairs to the electrical systems on welding presses, except the press drive motor, would continue to be a responsibility of the Welder Maintenance Department.
Management stated that the installation of air circuitry controls of the mechanical handling equipment during new construction will be a proper part of the “Pipefitter” classification. Modification of air circuitry will, likewise, be a proper part of the “Pipefitter” classification of labor. Trouble shooting and maintenance of such control units will in the Press Department be a responsibility of the “Die Maker - Devices” classification and in the Metal Assembly Department of the “Welding Equipment -Maintenance & Repair” classification. Management stated, however, that maintenance of such units referred to, for example, repairing or replacing a broken hose, changing filters, changing valves, adjusting air flow, etc., and in no way implied stripping down and rebuilding an entire control unit. The stripping down and rebuilding of air circuitry control units performed by plant employees, whether performed in-line or off-line, will be a proper part of the “Pipefitter” classification.
The Union referred to the “dope” dispensing fixture on the MA Line in the Metal Assembly Department and
252


stated that the maintenance of this unit has historically been a responsibility of the “Pipefitter” classification and stated that it was its opinion that this fixture should continue to be maintained by Pipefitters even though an air circuitry control unit had recently been installed on this fixture.
Management stated that it concurred with the Union in this regard, and since air circuitry controls were installed on a piece of equipment previously maintained by the “Pipefitter” classification, such controls should in the future be maintained by that classification of labor.
Management stated that modifications on the electrical circuit on mechanical manipulators will be a proper part of the “Electrician” classification. Trouble shooting and maintenance of such units will in the Press Department be a responsibility of the “Die Maker -Devices” classification and in the Metal Assembly Department of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification. The maintenance of such units in no way implies stripping down and rebuilding the entire electrical circuit. The stripping down and rebuilding of the electrical circuit on mechanical manipulators performed by plant employees, whether performed in-line or off-line, will be a proper part of the “Electrician” classification.
It will be the general operating practice that the maintenance of shuttle rails between welding operations in the Press Department will be a proper part of the “Die Maker - Devices” classification. The synchronization of shuttle units with the welding operations will be a proper part of the “Welding Equipment - Maintenance & Repair” classification.



MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON OVERTIME
255
254


Introduction
The parties recognize that the manufacturing operations of the Corporation are highly and completely integrated. An interruption at one stage of the production process, whether during the regular work day, work week, or overtime or other premium hours, can, and probably will, cause costly interruptions of the process at earlier and/or later stages. This Memorandum represents an accommodation between the needs of the Corporation and the rights of individual employees to decline overtime work on occasion for a variety of individual and personal reasons.
The parties have earnestly sought during negotiations resulting in the contract dated today, feasible steps that the Corporation might take in scheduling overtime work to provide employees an opportunity to accept or decline work opportunities during such periods, and have reached the following understanding which shall constitute a supplement to the National Agreement.
In order to accommodate the scheduling of overtime in a manner compatible with changing production requirements, while preserving the right of employees to decline overtime, Local Plant Management will make an election once each model year to schedule overtime operations in accordance with Plan A or Plan B below.
PLAN A
1. Dally Overtime
Hours in excess of nine (9) hours worked per shift shall be voluntary, except as otherwise provided in this Memorandum of Understanding, for an employee who shall have notified Management in accordance with Paragraph 8.
2.	Saturday Overtime
Employees may be required to work Saturdays; however, except as otherwise provided in this Memorandum of Understanding, an employee who has worked two or more consecutive Saturdays may decline to work the following (third) Saturday provided (a) the employee shall have notified Management in accordance with Paragraph 8, and (b) the employee has not been absent for any reason (excluding absences for which pay is received under Paragraphs (194], [203], [218] and [218b]) on any day during the week preceding the Saturday. Absences excluded under Paragraph (194) must be excused. For purposes of this Paragraph, Saturday work shall not include hours worked on Saturday by employees regularly scheduled to work Saturday or any portion thereof as the normal fifth day worked such as (i) an employee whose shift starts Friday and continues into Saturday, or (ii) an employee who is assigned to work on No. 1 Shift (Midnight) operations regularly scheduled to start with the No. 1 Shift (Midnight) Tuesday.
3.	Sunday Overtime
Except as otherwise provided in this Memorandum of Understanding, overtime work on Sundays shall be voluntary and employees may decline to work Sunday; provided that (a) the employee shall have notified Management in accordance with Paragraph 8, and (b) the employee has not been absent for any reason (excluding absences for which pay is received under Paragraphs [194], [203], [218] and [218b]) on any day during the week preceding such Sunday, except for a Saturday which employee declined to work pursuant to Paragraph 2 above. Absences excluded under Paragraph (194) must be excused. For purposes of this Paragraph, Sunday work shall not include those hours worked on Sunday which are part of an employee’s normal five-day work week (Sunday P.M. through Friday A.M.)

Daily hours in excess of ten (10) hours worked per shift and Saturday hours in excess of eight (8) hours per shift shall be voluntary, except as otherwise provided in this Memorandum of Understanding.
5. Saturday Overtime
Management shall have the right to designate, during a model year period, beginning at the completion of the model launch exemption period stated in Paragraph 10 below, and ending two weeks preceding the announced model build-out, six Saturdays as non-voluntary overtime work days. All other Saturdays are voluntary, except as otherwise provided in this Memorandum of Understanding, and employees may decline to work any other Saturday during such model year, provided (a) they shall have notified Management in accordance with Paragraph 8, and (b) they have not been absent for any reason on any day during the week preceding any Saturday which they elect not to work (excluding absences for which pay is received under Paragraphs [194], [203], [218] and [218b]).

6.
Sunday Overtime
The provisions of Paragraph 3 shall apply.
7.
to as
This Memorandum of Understanding shall not apply employees working on what are normally classified seven (7) day operations. The International Union
may bring to the attention of the Corporation any overtime problems connected with employees on such operations.
8.	Notice
With respect to all voluntary hours provided for in this Memorandum of Understanding in a given week, the employee may decline to work such hours if the employee notifies the employee’s supervisor on a form to be provided by Management before the end of the shift on the preceding Wednesday provided the employee has been notified of the overtime schedules for such week not later than the preceding day. If the employee is not so notified, the employee shall give such notice to the employee’s supervisor before the end of the* shift following the day of such notice, provided that if the employee is not so notified until the week in which the overtime is scheduled, the employee shall give such notice by the end of the shift in which the employee receives such notice from Management.
9.	Critical Plants
A.	Critical plants or parts of plants are those that are crucial to the integrated supply system of the Corporation and whose output is essential to meeting the scheduled production of one or more other plants or of customers, and as a result, must operate, in whole or in part, seven (7) days a week.
B.	The Corporation may, from time to time, designate plants or parts of plants as critical, provided, however, that fifteen (15) days prior to making such designations, it will inform the GM Department of the International Union, which will indicate its objections, if any, to a plant or plants being so designated.
C.	Any plant or part thereof that the Corporation designates as critical, shall, for a period of ninety (90) days after it is so designated, be exempt from the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding that limit or restrict the right of the Corporation to require employees to work daily overtime or on Saturdays or
257
256

Sundays or entitle employees to decline to work at such times. After a plant or part of a plant has been initially designated as critical, it may thereafter be redesignated as such by mutual agreement.
10.	Annual Automatic Exemptions
A.	The provisions of this Memorandum of • Understanding that limit or restrict the right of the Corporation to require employees to work daily overtime or Saturdays or Sundays shall be ineffective in each assembly plant (a) beginning on a date two (2) weeks preceding the announced build-out date and ending on the build-out date, i.e., when the plant produces for sale the last unit of the model it has been producing; provided, however, the above-mentioned provisions may be ineffective for up to two (2) additional weeks, provided the Corporation gives advance notice of supply or other problems which would interfere with the build-out, and (b) for the week in which it launches, i.e., after the build-out, frames the first unit of a new model, and for three (3) weeks thereafter or until the line reaches scheduled production, whichever is later.
B.	Said provisions shall likewise be ineffective during model change time each year in plants other than vehicle assembly plants for periods to be designated by Plant Management that shall not exceed, in the aggregate, four (4) weeks. Local Unions will be advised in advance of such designated periods.
11.	Concerted Activity
A.	Any right to decline daily overtime or Saturday or Sunday work that this Memorandum of Understanding confers on any employee may be exercised only by each employee acting separately and individually, without collusion, conspiracy or agreement with, or the influence of, any other employee or employees or the
Union or pursuant to any other concerted action or decision. No employee shall seek by any means to cause or influence any other employee to decline to work overtime. Violation by any employee of the terms, purpose or intent of this Paragraph shall, in addition to subjecting the employee to discipline, nullify for one (1) month (not including the periods mentioned in Paragraph 10 above) the employee’s right to decline overtime.
B.	The Corporation shall have the right to suspend for a period of two (2) weeks (not including the periods *- mentioned in Paragraph 10 above) as to an affected plant or part of a plant the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding that limit or restrict its right to require employees to work daily overtime or Saturdays or Sundays, or that entitle employees to elect not to work daily overtime or on Saturdays and Sundays, in the event employees collusively, concertedly or in response to the influence of any employee, or group of employees, or the Union (i) fail or refuse to report for daily overtime work or work on Saturday or Sunday that they have not declined as herein provided, or (ii) decline, as so provided, daily overtime work or work on Saturday or Sunday. If employees who are scheduled to work daily overtime in a plant or department or on Saturday or Sunday fail or refuse to work as scheduled in significantly greater numbers than the Corporation’s experience under this Memorandum can reasonably lead it to expect, such evidence should be carefully considered by the Umpire in any decision involving the question of whether their failing or refusing to work the scheduled hours was collusive, concerted or influenced by other persons. The Union shall have the right to present directly to the Umpire any claim that the Corporation has acted wrongly in suspending the provisions of this Memorandum as to employees or a plant or part thereof. If the Umpire sustains the Union’s claim, the
258
259

Corporation shall, within sixty (60) days of the date of the Umpire’s award, give each affected employee the right to decline work on as many daily overtime days or Saturdays or Sundays as such right was suspended.
12.	Emergencies
The provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding that limit or restrict the right of Management to require employees to work daily overtime or Saturdays or Sundays shall be suspended in any plant whose operations are interrupted by emergency situations, such as single breakdowns of four hours or more, government mandated work, power shortages, strike, fire, tornado, flood or acts of God, for a period of time necessary to overcome such emergencies.
Any breakdown is to be considered justification for suspending the limitations on Management’s right to require overtime work for purposes of correcting the breakdown itself; Management's right to suspend such limitations for the purpose of making up lost production is, however, in the case of breakdowns, limited to production lost as the result of single breakdowns of four or more hours.
13.	Exempt Operation
Employees on over the road trucking operations shall be exempt from the provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding.
14.	New Plants
The provisions of this Memorandum of Understanding that limit or restrict the right of the Corporation to require daily overtime work or work on Saturdays and Sundays shall be ineffective at any plant the Corporation builds or buys and remodels for a period of one year after regular production in such plant starts.
260
261
15. SUB
Daily overtime hours or Saturday or Sunday work that an employee declines under the terms of this Memorandum of Understanding shall be deemed “Compensated or Available Hours” within the meaning of the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan.
16.	General
A.	In order to implement this Memorandum, the Corporation shall have the right to hire temporary part-time employees for straight-time, overtime or weekend work in any plant. Such temporary part-time employees shall not be entitled to Saturday or Sunday overtime premium pay, except as required by law, until they are qualified to perform the work to which they are assigned or for fifteen (15) working days, whichever is sooner.
As to skilled trades work such part-time employees will be qualified to perform the work, The term “qualified” will conform with the skilled trades provisions of the National Agreement.
B.	Nothing herein shall preclude a plant from expanding its work force beyond the normal requirements of its operations by hiring new employees and adopting a program pursuant to which employees of said plant may have one (1) or two (2) days off per week (which days need not be Saturdays or Sundays); provided, however, that work performed on Saturday or Sunday shall be at present premium rates. Plans for such a program shall be discussed in advance with the GM Department of the International Union, and any system of rotating days off among some or all of the employees shall be by mutual agreement between the Local Union and the Plant Management.
C.	Nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding shall make ineffective any local past practice or

.?■
?'■ "f "v?yj£'l'p ’	'“ ”
262


' agreement concerning voluntary overtime that is mutually satisfactory to the Local Union and the Plant Management,
D. It is understood that each bargaining unit shall have the option of applying this Memorandum of Understanding to skilled trades employees as a group, and not to non-skilled trades employees as a group, and vice versa. For the purpose only of exercising this option, non-skilled trades employees (e.g., Crane Operator in Die Room) whose work is supportive of skilled trades employees work will vote with the skilled trades employees as a group and skilled trades employees (e.g., W.E.M.R.) whose work is supportive of non-skilled trades employees work will vote with the non-skilled trades employees as a group. The local Union will notify the local Management in writing of its election not later than October 1, 1982. In plants where the election is to continue the application of this Memorandum, it shall continue without interruption. In plants where the bargaining unit elects for the first time to apply this Memorandum the effective date at such location will be November 1, 1982.
Further, if a bargaining unit elects to apply this Memorandum as provided herein, thereafter the local parties may mutually agree in writing from time to time to suspend the terms of this Memorandum for specified periods during which periods previous mutually satisfactory local practices and agreements in regard to voluntary overtime, overtime equalization and augmentation will apply. A copy of all such agreements will be forwarded to the International Union and the Corporation.
During the life of this Agreement, in the event the Local Plant Management changes its designation to schedule overtime operations from Plan A to Plan B or from Plan B to Plan A as provided herein, the bargaining
263

unit employees may conduct another vote as provided in this Paragraph (16D) and notify the local Management in writing of its election within 30 days following the notice of change by the Local Plant Management.
E. Nothing in this Memorandum of Understanding shall make ineffective any local agreement pertaining to overtime equalization or augmentation.
F. Problems which may not be foreseen in the administration of the voluntary overtime concept which may affect the ability of the Corporation to operate efficiently may arise during the course of the current National Agreement. In such event, the matter will be raised at the Corporation-International Union level for resolution.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused their names to be subscribed by their duly authorized officers and representatives on this 2nd day of November, 1996.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON WORK CENTERS
During the 1967 negotiations, the Union requested that a Work Center be furnished in each plant where designated Union representatives could meet internally regarding representation matters, prepare statements required by the Grievance Procedure Section of the National Agreement, and keep files necessary to carry out their representation functions. By letter to the International Union dated December 15, 1967 from Mr. L. G. Seaton, Vice President, the Corporation agreed to provide such Work Centers in certain plants of the Corporation with certain contingencies.
During 1976 negotiations the Corporation brought to the attention of the International Union alleged abuses which the Corporation claimed existed in the operation of the Work Centers at some locations. As a result of those discussions, it was agreed as follows:
1.
2.
3.
Local Management may bring to the attention of the Local Union Shop Committee and Regional Servicing Representative any alleged abuses in the operation of the Work Center. The parties will attempt to resolve the issue.
Should the discussions between Local Management and the Local Union Shop Committee and Regional Servicing Representative fail to resolve the matter, Local Management may advise the Labor Relations Staff of General Motors Corporation which in turn may bring the matter to the attention of the UAW General Motors Department for discussion. The General Motors Department will dispatch one or more of its staff representatives to examine the alleged abuses at the plant site.
If the problem is still not resolved it may be referred by either of the parties to the Industrial

Relations Staff of the Corporation and the General Motors Department of the International Union. The International Union and the Corporation will determine the necessary corrective action.
Utilization of Work Centers
Usual office type equipment such as typewriters and duplicating machines may be furnished by the Local Union for use in the Work Center. In such instances, the plant procedures for bringing and removing personal property into and from the plant must be followed.
A notice will be placed at the entrance of each Union Work Center explaining the function of the facility and expressly prohibiting unauthorized entrance by persons other than the Shop Committee.
Pictures, calendars, cardboard, etc., will not be affixed to the windows, nor will the view be obscured in any manner.
A window opening similar to a cashier’s window will be installed in each Union Work Center so that employees with a bona fide question or inquiry can receive necessary service without entering the Union Work Center.
Lighting will be provided in such a manner that it cannot be extinguished during times that Shop Committeemen are in the plant.
Non-duplicating keys or magnetic keys will be issued to members of the Shop Committee, and the Work Center will be locked to prohibit entry by unauthorized persons.
At each plant location a joint examination of the furniture in the Work Center will be made within

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING JOINT ACTIVITIES
During current negotiations, the parties discussed the challenges in the marketplace from both foreign and domestic competitors. There is mutual recognition that these challenges require a fundamental change to maximize the potential of our human resources. This change can occur only by building on our current joint efforts and by fostering a spirit of cooperation and mutual dedication that will permit the full development of the skills of our people and meaningful involvement in the decision-making process. Success in these endeavors benefits all of the parties: The UAW through a strong and viable membership; the employees through job satisfaction and job security; and the Corporation through achieving its goal of becoming a world class competitor.
The parties agree that in order to make constructive progress in this regard, there is a need to reach a common understanding of the concept of “jointness” and to establish a facilitating mechanism to assure that the various programs related to changes in the work environment are appropriately and effectively administered.
The term “jointness” is understood to mean that concepts for these activities be jointly developed, implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Furthermore, decisions must be arrived at in a setting which is characterized by the parties working together in an atmosphere of trust; making mutual decisions at all levels which respect the concerns and interests of the parties involved; sharing responsibility for the problem solving process; and sharing the rewards of achieving common goals.

The Union will be fully involved in all phases of training including analysis and development that is directed at UAW-represented employees. When such employees will be impacted by training and manual specifications for equipment and manufacturing systems, Union input with respect to development and delivery of training will be obtained by either Management’s Group/Division or plant training personnel prior to GM signing off on the specifications.
In situations where mutual agreement regarding joint activities cannot be reached locally, either party may appeal the issue to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Committee for resolution.
Ilf. FUNDING
A. NATIONAL FUNDS
It is agreed that the Corporation will make available funding at five cents (50) per hour worked for use at the national level. Further, the Corporation will make available additional funding up to $5.00 per overtime hour worked in incremental amounts in excess of five percent (5%) of straight time hours worked (calculated on a twelve month rolling average). Such additional funding will be calculated in accordance with the following incremental table:

It is agreed that the Corporation will make available funding at ten cents (100) per hour worked for use either in the plants (LOCAL FUNDS) or certain nationally approved projects (RESERVOIR FUNDS). The parties will allocate the ten cents (100) between LOCAL FUNDS and RESERVOIR FUNDS on an as required basis over the term of the Agreement. Funds allocated ■as RESERVOIR FUNDS may be used for national activities, upon approval of the Executive Board - Joint Activities.
C.	FUNDING UNDER 1999 NATIONAL AGREEMENT
It is agreed that uncommitted funding balances accrued under the 1999 National Agreement in both the five cents (50) per hour fund and the ten cents (100) per hour (LOCAL FUNDS) and (RESERVOIR FUNDS) as of September 18, 2003 will be carried forward under the new National Agreement. Subsequent to September 18, 2003 a
272
final reconciliation and balancing of accounts, expenditures and commitments as of September 18. 2003 will occur. Thereafter, the remaining funds will be available for the parties.
D.	AGREEMENT EXPIRATION
In the event the parties should agree to discontinue, in whole or in part, this Memorandum prior to the expiration date of the new National Agreement, or upon expiration, the parties shall meet to discuss any problems arising out of the termination. After reconciliation of claims, commitments, and accruals through the expiration date of the new National Agreement, remaining NATIONAL, RESERVOIR and LOCAL FUNDS shall be disposed of in such manner as the parties shall agree consistent with the objectives of this Memorandum.
IV.	APPROVAL PROCESS
A.	NATIONAL AND RESERVOIR FUNDS
Requests for authorization to expend either NATIONAL FUNDS or RESERVOIR FUNDS must be approved in advance by the National Joint Skill Development and Training Committee and the Executive Board-Joint Activities.
B.	LOCAL FUNDS
Requests for authorization to expend LOCAL FUNDS must be jointly approved by the local parties. In addition, certain requests, specified in the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources Funding Guidelines, must receive prior approval from the National Joint Skill Development and Training Committee. In situations where mutual

agreement regarding fund approval cannot be reached locally, either party may appeal the issue to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Committee for resolution. When the local parties authorize funds for Human Resource Development endeavors, the proposal must be forwarded to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Committee for review and monitoring in accordance with its guidelines.
V.	FUNDS UTILIZATION
The NATIONAL, RESERVOIR and LOCAL FUNDS may only be used for joint endeavors in furtherance of this Memorandum of Understanding, or in support of those Joint National Committees specified in Paragraph I above. Definitive guidelines will be jointly reviewed and communicated subsequent to ratification.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
A landmark letter appeared in the National Agreement in 1973 which recognized the desirability of mutual organizational change efforts designed to improve the quality of work life of employees and the success of the Corporation. Going forward, General Motors Corporation and the International Union, UAW. have agreed that a single focus must be communicated throughout the organization.
This focus should revolve around people and the beliefs and values of the Quality Network, recognizing that the total involvement of people in all that we do is essential to job security and the success of both the UAW and the Corporation.
In accordance with this focus, the parties recognize that all joint activities will continue to encompass a philosophy that emphasizes joint relationships built on mutual trust, cooperation and respect,
Therefore, the parties agree that all processes directed at developing our human resources will be jointly developed, implemented, monitored and evaluated.
The parties further recognize the need for organizational strategies that focus on large systems change and the integration of all people involvement efforts. Joint resources will be provided to support this objective.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TUITION ASSISTANCE PLAN
During current negotiations, General Motors and the UAW reaffirmed the necessity of providing active and laid-off workers opportunities for education and training. These efforts will enable them to either reenter the work force or enhance their development. Accordingly, the parties agree to continue the Tuition Assistance Plan for all qualifying workers who wish to pursue further education and training. The plan is designed to help workers:
•	Who are laid off, improve their chances for reemployment
•	Or who are active, enhance their opportunities for advancement.
Under this Plan, qualified workers are able to receive assistance in the form of up-front payment to licensed or accredited schools such as colleges, universities, proprietary schools or vocational institutions. The Plan permits workers to select virtually any type of vocational training or education, for their situation and goals, subject to approval by the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources.
TUITION ASSISTANCE PLAN FOR LAID OFF WORKERS
Eligibility
The participant must be a UAW represented General Motors-U.S. worker on indefinite layoff, who has recall or rehire rights under the terms of the current GM-UAW National Agreement, and who had at least one year seniority as of the last day worked prior to layoff.

Certain changes in employment status will affect eligibility. If recall or rehire rights are lost under the terms of the GM-UAW National Agreement, or full-time employment is accepted that would pay wages comparable to those on the former job at General Motors, or if similar training programs are provided by a new employer, eligibility will cease. Continued eligibility will depend upon satisfactory completion of courses in which the employee has enrolled and

Interpretation of the Time and One-Half Provisions of the National Agreement Paragraph (85)(a) (Special Case Caused by Short Shift)
In the event an employee works more than eight consecutive straight time hours on a shift (exclusive of an unpaid lunch period) under circumstances where the present daily overtime provisions and interpretations would make the time worked in excess of eight hours on that shift payable at straight time, such time worked in excess of eight hours on that shift will be paid for at time and one-half. Any such time worked and paid at time and one-half instead of straight time, will be considered as having been paid at straight time for purposes of computing daily overtime within the 24-hour cycle in which such time worked occurs.

Interpretation of Working Hours Section
(Delayed Starting Time on Sunday Night)
In negotiations, the Union has cited the following examples:
An employee is scheduled to start work at 12:01 a.m. on Monday and at 10:30 p.m. for the rest of the week. The first eight hours beginning at 12:01 a.m. Monday were paid at straight time.
An employee starts a week at 10:30 p.m. Monday. This shift is also worked Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Thursday night and Friday night. The shift beginning 10:30 p.m. Saturday may or may not be worked. The employee is brought in Sunday night but instead of starting at the usual time of 10:30 p.m., the starting time is delayed until 12:01 a.m. Monday. The next week is then started at the usual time of 10:30 p.m. Monday. The first 8 hours beginning at 12:01 a.m. Monday were paid at straight time.
The Corporation advised the Union that in these and similar cases, the shift that starts at 12:01 a.m, on Monday will be considered a Sunday shift and paid at double time. The employee’s 24-hour cycle shall be considered to have started at 10:30 p.m. Sunday night.

Interpretation of Working Hours Section
(Special Double Time Case)
During negotiations the Union has cited a situation in which a third shift employee worked seven shifts in the week and received no double time under the following circumstances.

Example #1
The employee worked the first five days of the week beginning each day at the regular shift starting time. The employee’s sixth shift was advanced from 12:01 a.m. Saturday to 11:00 p.m. Friday and the employee then worked eight hours. The seventh shift was advanced from 12:01 a.m. Sunday to 11:00 p.m. Saturday.
Example #2
The employee worked the first five days of the week beginning each day at the regular shift starting time. Then the employee’s sixth shift was advanced from 12:01 a.m. Saturday to 11:00 p.m. Friday and eight hours were then worked. The seventh shift was advanced from 12:01 a.m. Sunday to 3:30 p.m. Saturday.
The Corporation advised the Union that if this or other such cases occur where the starting time of the employee’s seventh shift is advanced from Sunday to Saturday, the employee involved will be paid at double time for the hours worked by the employee on the seventh shift worked even though the shift starting time falls on Saturday.
[See Par. (86)]

Interpretation of Working Hours Section
(Special Protracted Work Period Case)
During negotiations, the Union cited a situation in which an employee worked for a continuous period of more than twenty-four (24) consecutive hours where the hours worked in excess of twenty-four (24) were paid for at straight time.
The Corporation advised the Union that in such a case, those continuous hours worked in excess of twenty-four (24) will be paid for at the rate of time and one-half unless such hours would otherwise be paid for at a higher premium pursuant to the provisions of the Working Hours Section of the National Agreement. Any such time worked and paid at time and one-half instead of straight time, will be considered as having been paid at straight time for purposes of computing daily overtime within the 24-hour cycle in which such time worked occurs.

RELIEVING EMPLOYEE FOR COMMITTEEPERSON DISCUSSION
1-
Consistent with the purpose of the Grievance Procedure, a rule of reason should be applied in determining whether an employee should be excused from the job in order to confer with the Committeeperson handling the employee’s grievance. A rule of reason should likewise be applied when, due to production difficulties, excessive absenteeism, or other emergencies, it will not be possible to immediately relieve the employee from the job. On many jobs discussion between the employee and the Committeeperson is entirely practical without the necessity for the employee being relieved. On the other hand, an employee working on a moving conveyor, in an excessively noisy area, or climbing in and out of bodies, should be permitted a reasonable period of time off the job and a suitable place in which to discuss the grievance with the Committeeperson. This shall not interfere with any local practice which is mutually satisfactory.

Such recommendations will include details as to facilities, length of project, funding, etc. Upon their agreement and approval, the Executive Board - Joint Activities will allocate and monitor the expenditure of funds. Funding, which will be provided from joint health and safety funds, will not exceed $7.5 million for anticipated Research Projects for the duration of this Agreement.
To assist the NJC on health related research activities, the Corporation and the UAW have established the Occupational Health Advisory Board (OHAB). The function of the Board is to advise the NJC in implementing its research agenda. Board activities and those of its consultants or specialists will be supported by joint funds. The Board will consist of a maximum of five (5) recognized specialists in the fields of occupational health consistent with the research agenda approved by the NJC. The selection of Board members, terms of
322
office and operating procedures will conform to the Board’s charter as established and amended by the NJC. Additionally, as needed, the NJC will retain consultants who are recognized specialists in occupational health and safety to function as independent peer reviewers. These consultants will be responsible directly to the NJC and assist and advise on matters stipulated by the NJC. The number of consultants and the terms of their retention will be determined by the NIC and the scope of its research program.
Ihe NJC will institute, review and, as necessary, revise operating procedures and guidelines for its research program and consultants to improve the research process, and enhance communication pertaining to sponsored research. Included in the guidelines will be core criteria to assess proposed research in terms of its potential impact on worker health and safety, the established need for such study, its practicability, as well as the recognized benefits and probability of success. Where warranted, and based on confirmed results of sponsored studies, the NJC will devise an action plan and make appropriate recommendations to the Corporation.
VII.	ERGONOMICS
General Motors and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America recognize that Ergonomically-related MusculoSkeletal Disorders (EMSDs) are occupational illnessg£ present in the automobile industry.
The parties also recognize that the control of EMSDs is a complex issue often requiring the application of a number of different control methods and technologies that may differ from operation to operation. These include an ergonomically appropriate design, along with
I®
Mali
*
Ki.:

325
324
feasible engineering and administrative controls that materially reduce or eliminate job related EMSD stressors, employee and supervisory training and education, early recognition of the problem, early and proper medical diagnosis, treatment and care.
General Motors will continue to administer an Ergonomics Program at UAW represented locations utilizing guidelines established between General Motors and the International Union, UAW. General Motors recognizes the accomplishments of the joint ergonomics process and realizes the need for continued efforts to further reduce work-related EMSDs. General Motors is committed to progressively pursue improving and enhancing the current process with the UAW. The purpose of the program is to deal cooperatively and constructively with the problem of EMSDs in the workplace.
General Motors re-committed to fixing jobs that are identified as presenting a corresponding and documented risk of employee injury. The parties recognize that effective corrective action for jobs which present a documented risk of injury, require the timely use of sound judgment in combination with training, experience, and the following:
• Analysis results from the risk factor checklist and secondary analysis tools (when utilized)
• Injury/illness history of both the job and the worker
• The history and future plans of the job
Also, seats, chairs and mats can be considered appropriate solutions to control specific ergonomic risk factors. The Corporation agrees to leave such devices in place when they are provided in accordance with the guidelines in the UAW-GM risk factor checklist.


The PSRB has the responsibility for supervising and supporting the ergonomics program. In plants with 750 or more employees, the parties will establish a Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, which will be comprised of one full-time UAW Technician and one GM Management Technician. In addition, plants with 2,000 or more employees will supplement the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team with a second full-time UAW Technician. In plants with less than 750 employees, the PSRB will identify the resources to be trained to perform the responsibilities of the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, as needed, and to administer the Ergonomics Program. Plant Safety Review Boards in plants with 4,000 or more employees can petition the NJC for an additional UAW Technician based on the level of activity required to meet the needs of the Ergonomics Program in the plant. Plants with 750 or more employees that do not experience enough ergonomic activity to sustain the level of resources agreed upon can also petition the NJC for a variance. Any petition must be based on the level of sustained activity required to meet the requirements of the Ergonomic Program for that plant. In addition, the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team at any location can request additional interim resources when the ergonomic needs of the plant exceed what the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team can be reasonably expected to accomplish in a timely fashion. Such requests will be reviewed and approved by the PSRB. The local parties may refer unresolved issues or concerns to the NJC.
The NJC has established selection criteria for the Joint Ergonomics Technicians. The UAW Technicians will be selected from the local workforce and appointed to the position by the Vice President and Director of the General Motors Department of the International Union.
The responsibilities of the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will include, but not be limited to, the following:



326
327
Participating in_the “Design-m." togesg
Conducting job analysis
Providing recommendations for corrective action
Monitoring the implementation of job improvements
Conducting review and follow up
Reporting monthly to the Plant Safety Review Board
ws
...




The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will coordinate their efforts with the LJHSC. and resources from appropriate departments; e.g., Medical, Engineering, Skilled Trades, and Production, will be made available to support the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team. The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team will report monthly at each PSRB and LJHSC meeting and keep minutes specific to ergonomics. Quarterly reports will be provided to the LJHSC. the PSRB. and the NJC. The status of the ergonomics process for each facility will be reviewed at the Divisional Safety Review Board meeting with assistance from the Ergonomic Managers. Discussions concerning significant problems or roadblocks will take place at these meetings.
The parties agreed to use the jointly developed process for the use of outside consultants in situations where in-house efforts concerning reduction of job EMS Ds are not successful. The consultant’s reports will be made available to both the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team and the co-chairs of the NJC.
Based on the results of the job analysis program, each facility shall implement feasible measures to control EMSD risk factors. The Joint Ergonomics Technician Team, in conjunction with input from the
workers, engineering, supervision, skilled trades and others, as appropriate, will make recommendations for corrective actions in accordance with the current ergonomics process. Once it is determined through the agreed upon ergonomics process that a job requires correction, recommendations for corrective action will be developed using the results of the jointly agreed upon analysis tools. GM Erg. 1.2 may be referenced for information regarding areas for potential improvement. GM Erg. 1.2 is currently undergoing revision and will undergo future revisions as deemed appropriate by the Corporation. A good-faith effort will be made to accomplish correction of identified EMSD hazards at a particular job or work station within six (6) months, after the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team determines that corrective action is required. The parties acknowledge that there may be times when it may take longer than six (6) months to make the proper correction, and those reasons need to be documented. The corrective action will include any combination of the following:
Engineering controls such as design, selection, location and orientation of tools, parts and equipment will be used.
Administrative controls (e.g,, job enlargement, job rotation, and appropriate job assignment) will be used in the following manner: as interim abatement measures pending engineering changes, when engineering changes are determined to be insufficient to significantly reduce the EMSD stressors, and in those instances when an administrative control is the most effective fix among the possible choices for corrective actions.
The PSRB will monitor the corrective actions being implemented and any unresolved issues or concerns can be referred to the NJC.
General Motors will inform and instruct affected employees on the controls implemented at their work station and how they are to be used.
The facility will maintain documentation of modification activity, including the job or work station identified for modification, number of employees affected, the nature of modification, the projected completion date, the actual completion date and, where available, the cost of the modification when completed.
Plants and facilities will include “ergonomics" in their planning process and this information will be available to the Joint Ergonomics Technician Team.
General Motors recognizes the importance of identifying and addressing ergonomic issues early in the development process and values the importance of receiving input from plant ergonomic personnel. Input from the Joint Ergonomic Technician Team on site specific ergonomic issues and practices will be provided to the design process at the earliest appropriate planning/design stage. This will include new t££hnalagy. jew.prp^ugts.apd, new processes,

This training may include Practical Ergonomic Training (PET) with the understanding that any person receiving PET may conduct a first level job analysis using the UAW-GM Risk Factor checklist. Jointly selected GM ergonomics design-guidelines will be included in training, for JETTs.
The UAW-GM Ergonomics Awareness Education and Training Program will continue to be provided for newly hired employees as well as employees returning to work from an extended leave, who have not received awareness education and training previously.
All newly hired and transferred employees will be informed on the proper use of the tools and equipment required to be used in the performance of their assigned duties.
General Motors shall annually review with employees the application of ergonomic principles to the prevention of EMSD on their jobs during regular safety talks.
The parties agree to continue to maintain a Medical Management Program for the early detection, evaluation, and treatment of EMSDs at all UAW-GM facilities. The Medical Management Program will provide for common medical practice guidelines for patient evaluation and treatment, follow-up, workplace walk-throughs, and restricted work placement.
General Motors agrees to continue implementation of a EMSD Education and Training Program for medical
330
physicians (including contract personnel) that render medical services related to EMSD. The introduction in this training includes the effect of poor job design, identifying problem jobs, and potential solutions based on ergonomic stressors. This training also includes medical instruction and early recognition, evaluation, treatment, and prevention of EMSDs. All medical personnel (including contract personnel) will receive EMSD education and training prior to rendering medical services related to EMSD. The Corporate Medical Director and staff will ensure that appropriate EMSD training has been provided and their training plans for medical staff will be reviewed with the International Union, UAW on an annual basis.
General Motors shall authorize Medical Department personnel to attend education and training conferences that address EMSDs. including but not necessarily limited to regional conferences, teleconferences, and Corporate conferences. Where practical, conference proceedings will be videotaped and made available to medical personnel who do not attend the conference.
General Motors will audit a random sample of medical records, Workers Compensation reports, and work-related sickness and accident data to verify the OSHA 300 log is correct.
The Corporate Medical Director and staff are responsible for the quality, implementation, and compliance by local Medical Departments with the GM Medical Management Program, as it applies to ergonomics. This program will be jointly reviewed periodically for continuous improvement and elimination of unnecessary complexity.
The NJC will monitor implementation of this process and consider changes for continuous improvement.
331

VIII.	HEALTH AND SAFETY TRAINING
UAW-GM CHR Health and Safety will continue to develop training programs to enhance employees skills and abilities to perform their jobs in a safe manner. The NJC will be responsible for identifying employee job-related health and safety education and training needs which are mandated by the government or would be applicable across UAW-GM sites.
It is recognized by the NJC that the LJHSC should be involved in identification of what health and safety training is needed and appropriate for their particular location, including monthly safety talks.
A local training needs analysis will be conducted at each location. Based on this analysis, a comprehensive training plan consistent with NJC requirements and local plant initiatives will be developed, and the necessary resources will be identified as part of the business planning process to provide such training. The Plan will specify target audiences, recommendations for completion dates, class size, and methods of delivery. The Plan will be reviewed by the PSRB. their Divisional Safety Review Board, and the NJC. to ensure consistency with requirements. The LJHSC shall be responsible for monitoring the progress of their local training plan.
The NJC through UAW-GM CHR Health and Safety will continue to provide training resources for use by the plants. The NJC will direct and oversee the development and administration of required training courses. Alternatively, the NJC may approve the use of other commercially developed courses. The NJC with input from the Divisional and Plant Safety Review Boards will establish the appropriate selection criteria for plant health and safety trainers. Trainers selected will receive necessary instruction in conducting the specific training. Hourly plant trainers will be selected by the Local Union.
Required health and safety training will be introduced to plants by top Union Leadership and Corporate Management. The NJC will monitor and evaluate training programs and make periodic reports to the Center for Human Resources Executive Board. The NJC encourages the participation of International and Regional Servicing Representatives and members of management in Health and Safety Training Programs developed by UAW-GM CHR Health and Safety.
IX.	SAFETY TRAINING FOR CHAIRPERSONS OF , SHOP COMMITTEES WITHOUT DESIGNATED
HEALTH AND SAFETY REPRESENTATIVE
The Chairpersons of Shop Committees in locations which do not have a designated Health and Safety Representative, may upon request of the National General Motors Department of the International Union, attend training or instruction programs provided by the Corporation in Section II, Item C of the Memorandum of Understanding - Health and Safety.
In addition, the Corporation advises that employees who wish to enroll in courses of instruction relating to industrial health and safety at approved educational institutions will be eligible to apply for tuition refund for such courses subject to the terms and conditions of the Corporation’s Tuition Refund Program.
X.	LOCKOUT POLICY
During the current negotiations the UAW and General Motors discussed their mutual concern regarding fatalities and serious injuries to employees, including operators, performing repair, service and maintenance activities on machinery and equipment. The parties agreed that, the Lockout - Energy Control program must be universally implemented and enforced throughout the Corporation. In order to be effective, the parties reaffirmed that the elimination of the potential
■ - jW'Sliv
Mai


for injury from hazardous energy is critical to worker safety.
riAJ,htP°liCy of’Gcneral Motors and endorsed by the UAW that:	J
Lockout is required where employees may be exposed to hazardous energy which could cause injury. Exposure means that the employee is in a position to be injured by released energy.
Where an employee is exposed to potential injury from expected machine energy/motion, the exposure must be eliminated. If the exposure cannot be eliminated, the machine will be locked out.
. Corporation will utilize a common tool at all Ria-nt? tp generate a common lockout placard for new machines end equipment, The tool will also be used to Update existing placards into the common placard j&rnpla^ whenever machinery and/or equipment is modified after October L 2003,
AH plants will also be required to conduct an annual review of lockout placards. The review is to be inducted tQ ensure that the placards are still representative 9f the procedure required to lockout the equipment and that all lockout points are appropriately identified.	—
Each location will maintain an effective Lockout-Energy Control program which will apply to all employees, based on implementation guidelines which have been published by UAW-GM CHR Health and Salcty.
Xi. MONITORED POWER SYSTEMS
The UAW and General Motors recognize the importance of designing processes and equipment with effective health and safety controls. Therefore, the
334
parties agreed to integrate “Monitored Power Systems into the existing Lockout/Energy Control procedures. The fundamental process begins with pcrlormmg an initial Task Based Risk Assessment (TaBRA) on any process where “Monitored Power-Systems may be appropriately used.
The use of these systems, when integrated into the existing Lockout/Encrgy Control procedures, can further reduce or eliminate the risk of exposure to employees. However, it is understood by the parties that Lockout must still be performed whenever the exposure cannot be controlled or eliminated as determined by the I ask Based Risk Assessment process.
XII. REFUSAL OF HAZARDOUS WORK
A worker, who has a reasonable belief that their work assignment may result in serious physical injury, including illness, should immediately discuss the safety aspects of the work assignment with their supervisor. Failing resolution, the issue may be discussed with the District Committeeperson.
Should technical consultation be requested by the supervisor or committceperson, the LJHSQ will be notified to respond before further action is taken. In line with the Memorandum of Understanding on Health and Safety upon joint recommendation, the machine or operation will be taken out of service to perform any and all corrective action.
Failing resolution of the matter, it may be taken up in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding on Health and Safety, Section IV, Complaint Procedure.
XIII.	IMPROVEMENT OF MEDICAL AND INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE SERVICES
The Corporation reserves the right to select and hire appropriate consultants for health and safety services.
335


The Union will be informed in advance and be provided an account based on specific legitimate requests regarding qualifications of the consultant(s) engaged by the Corporation to provide services. The Union may recommend consultants for Management’s consideration. Included in such recommendation should be an account of the qualifications of the consultants recommended by the Union.
The LJHSC will be informed regarding the engagement of consultants to provide industrial hygiene and safety services. Qualifications of such consultants will be provided upon request. Reports prepared by such consultants will be provided to the LJHSC. who will provide a copy to the local Industrial Hygiene Technician and the co-chairs of the NJC. In addition, the Corporation will provide a list of consultants under Corporate contract for industrial hygiene services to the NJC and update the list when changes are made.
Management in conjunction with the LJHSC will assess the need and where required, a facility will develop and implement an air sampling plan. Such plans should be reviewed and implemented on an appropriately scheduled basis. Guidance in the preparation of such plans will be provided by the NJC. Based upon the air sampling plan, an hourly employee selected by the Vice President and Director of the General Motors Department of the International Union, working under the technical supervision of a GM Industrial Hygienist, may assist in the collection of air samples. Job function key elements of the Industrial Hygiene Technician will be established by the NJC, and the appointee will demonstrate competency by successfully completing required training, determined by the NJC. Reports of industrial hygiene and noise measurement surveys will be provided to the LJHSC who will provide it to the co-chairs of the NJC. if appropriate.
336
337
XIV.	ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL
Environmental information and reports, which are required to be reported to various governmental regulatory agencies, will be made available to the NJC on a regular basis. For example, this information may include the local Toxic Release Inventory compiled to comply with the Superfund Amendments and Re-authorization Act, copies of environmental permits and compliance monitoring data. General Motors will notify the LJHSC of significant environmental remediation projects, and spills or releases that are subject to > government reporting requirements. The LJHSC will forward such information to the co-chairs of the NJC.
The co-chairs of the NJC will be invited as guest members of the GM Environmental Issues team for the purpose of providing them with periodic updates on environmental projects and issues that may affect UAW bargaining unit employees.
XV.	PERIODIC JOINT AUDITS OF PLANTS
The UAW and General Motors agree that a formal system of performance review is an effective means of obtaining and rc-enforcing compliance with established health and safety requirements. The parties, therefore, agree that the NJC will conduct audits to evaluate each facility’s health and safety performance. The purpose of the audits is to review the effectiveness of health and safely activities reaching the operations level and being implemented across the workplace. The parties also agree to enhance the cunent audit process by developing methods to assure the process is consistently applied and delivers measurable results. Additionally, the parties have developed as part of the Divisional Safety Review Board Process a method to address repeat audit findings for identical deficient conditions found on consecutive audits.
The NJC has established five (5) joint review teams to conduct such reviews.
A plant visit itinerary will be established by the NJC which will be scheduled through appropriate channels. The team will meet with the Plant Manager, Shop Committee Chairperson and the LJHSC before beginning the performance review, and have a closing conference upon completion of the on-site review. The finalized report will be prepared and sent to the plant and division within thirty (30) days of the review. Following the finalized report, the LJHSC after review by the Key Four, will reply, addressing issues contained in the report. All such review information shall remain the confidential property of General Motors and will not be released without the expressed written permission of General Motors.
The parties agree that through the joint audit process, they will verify that all facilities have an effective emergency notification system and that it is periodically tested to achieve the best possible response time for the emergency involved.
XVI.	NEW TECHNOLOG Y/SPECIFICATiONS
Discussions were held during these negotiations regarding Health and Safety being designed into new equipment, refurbished equipment and/or new processes. GM and the UAW recognize the advantages of designing processes and equipment with effective health and safety controls. The parties established a joint team from UAW-GM CHR Health and Safety, under the direction of the NJC. to work with the “Design-In Safety” group, established by the Corporation, to address health and safety concerns early in the development process. The main objective to the “Design-In” effort was to develop common design specifications for application across the Corporation, in the manufacturing processes, that incorporated health
338

and safety program requirements. The joint team serves as a technical resource to work with the engineering group to assure that UAW-GM health and safety program requirements are incorporated into the common design specifications.
In an effort to promote improved communications regarding such matters, as early as possible and preferably in the development phase of the planning in the design process and incorporating lessons learned, as described in Design for Health and Safety Specification (DHS), the parties agree to perform Task Based Risk Assessments (TaBRA), on new equipment and manufacturing systems, and on existing equipment and manufacturing systems where locally agreed to and approved by the P5RB. A Task Based Risk Assessment will be performed after the detailed designs are completed on new manufacturing equipment and/or processes. A review of anticipated equipment and/or processes with the shop committee, the J WSC. and_lhe JETT will be held. The LJHSC and, w!
the JETT, may be required to travel to vendors, plants, or other locations to participate in a design review of such equipment or processes as outlined in the DHS specification ^d-Jh£_ErganQmks_Dgsign Eroge^s (EQP-. 2D. The Union will have an opportunity to discuss health and safety and ergonomics concerns with Management and make recommendations designed to improve the equipment and/or processes, consistent with the common design specifications where they have been established by the “Design-In” activity in the DHS specification and EDP-21. Additionally, TaBRA data will be incorporated at several points or gate reviews early in the design process as described in the DHS specification.
Reviews will be made at the appropriate level (i.e. Plant Safety Review Board, Divisional Safety Review Board, and National Joint Committee), for new technology/process awareness and to discuss safety
339

related issues and/or concerns. Representatives from Worldwide Facilities Group will periodically meet with Lh_e_-N_a_tiQn_al	JBO-HeaUh. and Safety to
review advancements in technologv_that may, impact the Committee’s area of responsibility. In addition, the NJC has established a joint team to identify the risks associated with high hazard jobs, with the intent of developing recommendations for evaluating and controlling them. Recommendations from the team will be submitted to the NIC.
Machinery, equipment or processes will not be released for production without the written approval of the Plant Safety Supervisor. The Plant Safety will c.Qn.s.u.ii. wjth.t.hg.JETT during .this process. Where required, lockout placards will be posted for all applicable energy sources. The parties discussed and recommitted themselves to continue the implementation of the UAW-GM Lockout Placard Guidelines. These placards will continue to be reviewed during a UAW-GM joint audit and should be reviewed during safety observation tours.
The UH^C,andJ_wJien.ap.prppriateJ_LheJEIT. will consult with operators, skilled trades, engineers, supervisors or related personnel to ensure that required safeguards and ergonomics features provide effective protection and do not interfere with their ability to perform their assigned tasks.
The NJC will continue to oversee the development of communications material regarding the design-in-safety activity for the LJHSC and the EDP-21 for the JETT. This material includes informational material, guidelines, standards, checklists, CD ROM Disks, and other appropriate material to clearly communicate the common design specifications.
The parties will continue their efforts to integrate health and safety into the development process of the
340
Quality Network, which includes common design specifications, and review of such, into the earliest design phases of any new equipment, process, or operation at the appropriate level.
XVII.	CONTROL OF CHEMICAL AND FOUNDRY EXPOSURES
The Corporation will continue to update Occupational Exposure Guidelines (OEG’s) to assess employee exposure to chemicals in General Motors’ facilities, as needed. Guidelines are considered necessary whenever existing OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits do not sufficiently protect the worker, or when there is no applicable OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit. Guidelines will be based on consensus standards and recommendations in addition to available scientific evidence. General Motors will require plants to use OEG’s as the basis for evaluating employee exposures and for taking appropriate corrective or preventive action.
The Corporation will review Guidelines with the NJC on an annual basis and will discuss proposals for necessary changes. The Corporation intends to control. throjugh. pxotokrixd..ijT-diisiriaLhypractice .and method^.ernpLdyge exposures to

•	Will review the proposed change differences and its rationale.
•	Will review existing air sampling data to determine the prevailing exposure level to the chemical or substance under consideration.
• May seek the advice of the UAW-GM Occupational Health Advisory Board concerning the proposed change.
The Corporation and Union agree to continue to study the potential health effects of cutting fluids for the purpose of establishing an exposure guideline and to determine the need for additional controls where cutting fluids arc used. Where warranted, based on confirmed results of the current NJC - OH AB studies, the NJC will devise an action plan and make appropriate recommendations to the Corporation regarding coolant exposures. In this regard. General Motors will establish a plan to be reviewed with the NJC that reduces exposure to coolant aerosol. The plan will include a phased-in approach, as appropriate, across affected plants taking into consideration plant process and/or product changes.
The Joint Parties agree that prior to implementing new chemical technology/processes and changes to current chemical processes, reviews will continue to be made at the appropriate level (i.e. Plant Safety Review Board, Divisional Safety Review Board, and National Joint Committee), for awareness and discussion of safety related issues and/or concerns.
The LJHSC will review process exhaust ventilation systems at facilities where air is recirculated. Such review will be in accordance with guidelines established by the NJC. Air testing will be performed when requested by the LJHSC. To the extent feasible, these tests will be incorporated in the previously described air sampling plan. Recirculation will not be permitted where employee health and safety cannot be assured.

Medical surveillance for respiratory effects of machining fluids will be offered to employees who regularly work in operations with machining fluids. Such medical surveillance will include a standardized respiratory symptoms questionnaire and pulmonary function test. For personnel newly-assigned to such operations, pre and post shift pulmonary function tests will be done at least once during the first year.
The Industrial Hygiene Technician will receive notice of initial work related medical cases reporting symptoms such as headaches, nausea, skin problems, _an_d_respiratQry complain^
Records of laboratory testing and coolant additions will be maintained and made available to the local joint committee for health and safety upon request.
The NJC will establish a medical surveillance program for implementation at General Motors iron foundries. This will include an air sampling plan and chemical controls as related to iron foundry operations.
XVIII.	ACCESSTODATA
The Health Information System, (HIS), provides a common method for recording medical visit information in UAW-GM facilities.
During 1999 negotiations, the Joint Parties enhanced the Health Information System (HIS) for the purpose of making it easier for the LJHSC to retrieve and analyze injury/illness data.
343



Additionally, a joint effort through the NJC developed standardized reports of information customarily used by the LJHSC in carrying out their responsibilities. The existing reports in HIS, that include the OSHA 300 log overrides, will continue to be available for access by the LJHSC.
A joint procedure has been established for review of the quarterly audit results of HIS injury/illness records with the LJHSC. by the Medical Department (administrative joint letter dated June 10, 1999).

The Corporation further agrees lO-_keep these databases up to date and to jointly look forjwavs.to ’* enhance the effectiveness of these systems and.lhe inform align.
XIX.	NOISE ABATEMENT/CONTROL PROGRAM
The joint parties recognize that the Corporation has had a comprehensive Hearing Conservation and Noise Control Program for the purpose of continuous incremental improvements in noise reduction. In accordance with this program, each plant is required to have a Noise Control Committee. The Noise Control Committee will consist of representatives from Plant Engineering, Operations, Medical, Industrial Hygiene, Finance, Purchasing, the LJHSC. Industrial Hygiene Technicians (where available), and others as deemed appropriate by the PSRB. such as certain skilled trades personnel, and/or other employees. The Noise Control Committee has the responsibility to seek input from plant personnel in identifying noise sources and potential ways to reduce noise levels.
The Noise Control Committee will:
• Ensure audiometric testing is performed for employees exposed above 85 dBA.
» Perform an annual evaluation of the noise abatement plan and provide recommendation for improvement to the Plant Safety Review Board.
345
J‘- 
344
•	Ensure reports follow formats specified in GM Occupational Hearing Conservation and Noise Program SL 3.0.
•	Ensure new and rebuilt equipment meet the GM Sound Level Specification SL 1.0,
•	Identify planned maintenance items related to noise control.
The Corporation will continue to conduct the annual noise exposure survey and provide findings to the LJHSC and summary noise abatement program findings to the NJC,
The Noise Control Committee will meet regularly, record minutes, and report quarterly to the PSRB regarding progress on the Noise Abatement Plan, The annual evaluation will include:
Copies of the plant’s noise abatement program.
The number of employees that experienced standard threshold shift.
The number of employees that are required to wear hearing protection.
The number of employees at risk of exposure at or above 85 dBA.
The number of employees at risk of exposure above 90 dBA.
XX	. PLANNED MAINTENANCE
The NJC will jointly identify health and safety requirements to be integrated into the Quality Network “Planned Maintenance Action Strategy.” These requirements will include both those that are regulated by government agencies and those established in UAW-GM programs. The LJHSC will also review the
346
347
“Planned Maintenance Action Strategy’’ to assure local regulations and/or practices currently in effect arc included. Safety related information, such as established safe operating procedures, shall be.included in the Planned Maintenance Program (e.g.. MAXIMO).
XXL	WORKING ALONE
The parties have discussed the Corporation's policy regarding the assignment of employees to tasks in isolated locations or confined entry spaces. The Corporation explained that anytime an employee is assigned to work alone in an isolated area, the Corporation has instructed Plant Leadership to ensure an appropriate level of personal surveillance, (Sec jointly agreed to letter from Manufacturing Managers Council dated February 18. 2003.) Additionally, when work assignments involve situations hazardous to an employee, appropriate precautions will be taken in accordance with safe work practices, including air sampling and ventilation when necessary, communications systems, personal surveillance arrangements and, as required, adequate support personnel. When an employee brings to Management’s attention a situation where they arc reasonably concerned that their safety is jeopardized because they arc working alone. Management will provide a copy of an applicable written Safe Operating Practice to the employee detailing precautions to take to perform the task safely. If one has not been developed and reviewed, Management will give the employee job instructions to perform the task safely and within 24 hours make a written request to the LJHSC for the development of a Safe Operating Practice. Safe Operating Practices will be developed by the LJHSC within 5 working days and will be reviewed by the PSRB at the next regularly scheduled meeting. This will not change or restrict any mutually satisfactory local practices.

XXH. NO HANDS IN DIES POLICY
The Corporate policy has been and continues to be 2No Hands in Dies”. Implementation of 2No Hands in Dies” in the plant requires provision for expendable hand feeding tools, slide feeds, sliding bolsters, automatic or semi-automatic operation, die cutouts or other means and procedures whereby the operators are not required to place their hands into the point of operation. In addition, well disciplined procedures for use of die blocks and safety lock-outs for maintenance and setup personnel are imperative. An intensive orientation program for operating supervisors, and process and facilities engineers may also be advisable.
XXUt. PLASTIC INJECTION MOLDING MACHINES
Ihe parties recognize that hydraulically operated plastic injection molding machines may present hazards, different than mechanical power presses. Plastic injection molding machines will continue to be safeguarded in accordance with OSHA requirements and National Consensus Standards (ANSI). The NJC will continue to explore alternative methods of safeguarding the machines.
XXIV. CONTRACTOR SAFETY
It is the Corporation’s practice to provide outside contractors with Corporate Health and Safety policies and procedures and, where applicable, relevant site specific UAW-GM Health and Safety work practices. The Corporation will continue to use the_“Construction SafetyJ?rQgj£S.sL(CSPJ as. isvfewgd with ihe-National Joint_Cojniniiiee_0n_Health jnd Safety _at its April 8. 2QQ3_m€£Ling.-Th? contractors.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties had extensive discussions concerning the Corporations component and service parts operations. Both parties recognized the importance of maintaining and strengthening these operations. They are critical to the long-term viability and financial health of General Motors.
The parties also recognize that the competitive pressures facing these operations can be addressed successfully if both parties work together to find mutually acceptable solutions to common problems. In this connection, Management and Union representatives from the above-defined units will conduct a joint review of such operations and identify areas where improvements may be made to enhance their competitiveness. Such areas may include quality, productivity, cost, plant layout and process, materials/components, technology, capital investment, maintenance and preventive maintenance, supervision, work rules, pricing and marketing strategies, training, and capacity utilization.
Subject to this review, the following process may be implemented:
- At any component or service parts location as defined by the parties, either local party may raise the issue of the competitive viability of the operation;

ENHANCEMENT OF COMPONENT AND SERVICE PARTS OPERATIONS
- Thereafter, upon mutual agreement locally, a joint study would be conducted evaluating the unit and the competition through benchmarking in terms of the areas addressed in the previously conducted joint review.
Where the results of the study indicate that changes are required to become competitive, the parties will develop a plan that will identify the areas that need to be addressed so that the unit may be better able to compete effectively. The plan should include a timetable for implementation and periodic monitoring reports to appropriate joint leadership.
The parties view this undertaking as an opportunity to strengthen the relationship of the local parties with the goal of ensuring the long-term viability of component and service parts operations and thereby preserving the job and income security of UAW members.

JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS - SEL
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18. 2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
Subject: JOBS Program - Volume Related Layoffs -SEL
During the course of these negotiations, the Corporation and Union have provided General Motors employees with substantially increased job security through the new SEL feature of the JOBS Program, which protects eligible employees against layoff for virtually any reason except volume related market conditions. The parties recognize that employment levels may continue to fluctuate as a result of the cyclical nature of demand in our industry. The Corporation acknowledges, however, the importance of minimizing layoffs even in instances where volume related declines are unavoidable. In particular, the Union stressed the importance of reducing overtime and shifting dual sourced production requirements to UAW-General Motors plants in the event of overall market declines. The Corporation agrees to take these and other actions whenever practical.
In any event, however, employees affected by volume related declines would exercise their seniority in line with local seniority agreements and, if otherwise eligible, receive benefit treatment in accordance with the Supplemental Agreements attached to the current GM/UAW Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Identifying the complex inter-relationships of all the factors involved with volume fluctuations is a difficult task. The parties agreed, however, that for purposes of


JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS - SEL
determining SEL related protections they must identify just those volume declines that are attributable to market related conditions, and in turn just those declines that are not affected by Corporation sourcing choices of vehicles and components that compete with or act as replacements for vehicles and components produced by General Motors employees covered by this Collective Bargaining Agreement, In other words, volume declines that are attributable to the Corporation's production and purchase arrangements with any related or unrelated party (subsidiaries, affiliates, captives, joint ventures, transplants, etc.) would be considered an exception to the overall volume related exclusion in Section 1(D) of the JOBS Program.
The parties also agreed that the complexity of these issues requires that the Corporation provide Local JOBS Committees adequate notice of any impending volume-related layoff, as well as all information necessary to fully evaluate its underlying causes, the extent to which such decline is associated with a Corporate sourcing action and the appropriate number of SEL eligible employees that should be affected by the layoff.
The Corporation recognizes, moreover, that it has the responsibility to justify implementation of a layoff in the context of the protections spelled out in the JOBS Program and the guidelines outlined in this letter. Similarly, the Corporation also accepts the responsibility of proving that the proper number of employees are recalled to SEL positions when a volume related decline is reversed, again within the context of the JOBS Program protections and the guidelines outlined in this letter.
The following are to be considered as illustrations to assist the parties in determining when volume related declines support reductions in employment. These illustrations should not be considered all inclusive.
• Market Related Conditions - Included in this category is customer preference of one vehicle over another that might result in a decline in sales of a U.S.-built General Motois vehicle that requires the
JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS - SEL
layoff of employees, provided such sales declines are not the result, for example, of increased sales or increased market share of competitive captive imports or joint venture vehicles or any other vehicle sold in the U.S. by General Motors but not produced in a UAW-General Motors plant.
- Example of Market Related Conditions
(!) There is a decline in economic activity which depresses retail safes of UAW-General Motors vehicles. Lower production levels require the layoff of employees, Assembly Plant A,
,	employing 4,100 SEL-eligible employees, is the
sole source of Vehicle Z for the U.S. market; it is required to layoff one shift, or 2,000 employees. The number of SEL-eligible employees at the plant remains at 4,100, including 2,000 open positions for laid-off employees.
While the plant is down to one shift, the Corporation decides to outsource the cushion room, which reduces employment requirements by 250 employees per shift. Two hundred fifty (250) employees are placed on Protected employee status, There is no impact on the SEL numbers.
U.S. car demand picks up to pre-layoff levels and the second shift is called back. Active employment at the plant goes back to 4,100.
As the second shift is called back and the plant is back to pre-downturn production levels, an additional 250 employees are placed on Protected employee status which now leaves a total of 500 employees. The SEL plant number remains at 4,100.
(2) Assembly Plant B (5,000 SEL-eligible employees) is not the sole source of Vehicle Y, which is also produced in Canada for the U.S. market, in Plant BC. Plant BC supplies onefourth of the U.S. demand for Vehicle Y. An
357
358
359
WTOFFS^SEL" ’V0LUME RE1-ATE0
JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS - SEL
SEL-eligible employees at the assembly plant at the same level.

economic downturn in the U.S. reduces demand for Vehicle Y by 160,000. In accordance with SEL guidelines, volume related employment reductions cannot exceed Plant B's share of pre-downturn volume levels (three-fourths) applied to the reduced level of overall sales. Production in Plant B is therefore reduced by no more than 120,000 units, causing layoffs of 2,000 workers. Plant B s number of SEL-eligible employees remains at 5,000, including 2,000 open Bank positions.
Vehicle Y demand in the U.S. market picks up by 60,000. The Corporation decides to produce 30,000 of those units in Plant B and the rest in Canadian Plant BC. The increase in production is not accomplished in proportion to pre-layoff production shares; to comply with SEL, the Corporation must recall 250 employees which it assigns to Protected employee status in addition to the 500 employees required for the pick up in production.
Product Discontinuance - Because of the introduction of a new U.S.-built General Motors vehicle or a nonallied company vehicle not sold by General Motors, sales of another General Motors-manufactured vehicle may decline, and production of the latter vehicle must be curtailed necessitating reductions in employment. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
- Examples of Product Discontinuance or Phase Out and Changes in Retail Preference
(1)	A new U.S.-built General Motors vehicle (or any other new non-allied company vehicle which is not marketed by the Corporation) is introduced. Sales of Vehicle X decline by 50%. and assembly must be curtailed. The necessary reductions in employment are made through layoffs, keeping the number of
(2)	Engine Plant C, employing 1,400 SEL-eligible people, produced half of the engines for Vehicle X; the other half are produced at a Corporate plant in Mexico. The volume reduction is made totally at Plant C rather than split proportionately between Plant C and the plant in Mexico. Therefore, in accordance with the JOBS guidelines half of *• the 700 employees who are not required any longer in Plant C due to this event are assigned to Protected employee status, and the other 350 employees would be laid off. The number of SEL-eligible employees at Plant C remains at 1,400, including 350 open volume related positions.
Faulty Product - Vehicle line volume may decline because of faulty parts in a vehicle that cause customers to place the product in disfavor. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
Changes in Retail Preference - General Motors volume may decline because of customer preference shifts — in turn affecting mix and therefore demand, e.g., small car preference shifts to large car; option preference swings; high product content to low product content. Such reductions would be considered volume-related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
Non-General Motors Commercial Customer Preference - Cancellation or declines in product volume for General Motors Corporation manufactured parts that are sold to unrelated firms may cause volume changes. Such volume reductions would be considered volume-related declines under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program.
- Examples of Non-General Motors Commercial Customer Preference

JOBS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED
LAYOFFS - SEL
Plant A produces heavy duty cranking motors lor off the road construction equipment. Volume is reduced as a result of a decline in the construction industry. One hundred fifty (150) employees are laid off; 150 open volume-related positions are established.
At the time production is back to pre-Iayoff levels the Corporation introduces two robots which replace 25 employees. According to SEL guidelines all of the 150 employees are recalled from layoff, 25 of them are assigned to Protected employee status, and the number of SEL-eligible employees remains equal to its pre-layoff level.
• Non-General Motors Produced Vehicles - H sales of a new or replacement vehicle manufactured by an allied company for General Motors, that competes with a vehicle manufactured by the Corporation, results in reduced sales of the Corporation-manufactured vehicle, the action would not be volume related and layoffs under Paragraph 1(D) of the Program would not be permitted.
- Example of Non-General Motors Produced Vehicles
The Corporation outsources a vehicle that it markets in competition with Vehicle W manufactured by UAW-General Motors employees. This results in reduced sales of Vehicle W. Employment requirements are reduced, but this event is not covered under Paragraph 1(D) of the JOBS Program and layoffs are not permitted. This protection also extends to employees producing UAW-General Motors components which are manufactured for Vehicle W
■ Engines, Transmissions, Stampings, and other Components or Materials
It is recognized that reductions in vehicle production will often be accompanied by reductions in component production. When reductions in vehicle production are volume related, pro-rata reductions in component production will normally be
JOSS PROGRAM - VOLUME RELATED LAYOFFS -SEL
considered volume related as well. However, to the extent a reduction in component production results from a shift in sales to vehicles sold by General Motors but not produced in UAW-General Motors plants, the reduction will not be considered volume related. Furthermore, when a like or similar component is dual-sourced from a UAW-General Motors and a non-UAW-General Motors plant, production declines at the UAW-General Motors plant will only be considered volume-related to the extent the dual-sourced component produced at that plant continues to be produced in its pre-production decline proportion.
- Examples:
(1)
(2)
Plant A receives regular automotive batteries from a UAW-General Motors plant and heavy duty batteries from a non-UAW-General Motors plant. A volume decline occurs in regular automotive batteries because of customer preference for heavy duty batteries. Such reductions would be considered volume related declines under the Program but would not have to be taken proportionately because the batteries would not be considered like or similar components.
Plant B receives regular batteries that have plastic fastening brackets from a UAW-General Motors plant and regular batteries that have steel fastening brackets from a non-UAW-General Motors plant. The batteries are used interchangeably and would be considered like or similar components. Therefore, any volume declines in battery production would have to be taken proportionately to be considered volume related.
As implied by these examples, there are many variations to be considered when determining volume actions. This letter is intended to provide a framework
361

within which Local and National JOBS Committees may review the applicability of Paragraph 1(D) to volume reductions.
If a Local JOBS Committee cannot agree on a situation being defined as volume related, the matter may be appealed to the National JOBS Committee for resolution.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
During the current negotiations regarding the JOBS Program — SEL, the parties discussed utilization of Protected employees at some length. The Corporation and the UAW have agreed that productive utilization of Protected employees is critical to the viability of our operations, and to the continued success of our JOBS Program.
It was agreed that local JOBS Committees must make every effort to ensure that Protected employees are fully utilized on meaningful assignments. The parties have recognized that both underutilized employees and unproductive assignments are contrary to the spirit of the Agreement. It is the intent of the Parties to utilize Protected employees in accordance with previously agreed practices.
For purposes of the JOBS Agreement, "non-traditional" work could encompass any assignmen t(s) within the facility (except regular productive work, including the direct production, assembly or fabrication of vehicles or components) which can efficiently and safely be performed by the individuals involved.

Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
During these negotiations we have explored at length methods to preserve and increase the job opportunities of our employees — your members. Further, we have mutually recognized that the best potential for increased job opportunities is a growing and thriving Corporation fully competitive in all aspects of its business.
During the discussions and in response to your concerns regarding the outsourcing of UAW work, a new sourcing letter has been submitted providing a mechanism for meaningful advance Union involvement so that the plant, division, group or Corporate sourcing authority may objectively consider the Union's input. The Job Security (JOBS) Program provides job security unmatched in American industry.
The major concern addressed by both the sourcing letter and the JOBS program is the retention of UAW jobs within the Corporation. The entire issue of job security, however, is broader than the continuation by the Corporation of its current business activities. The JOBS Program recognizes that long range job security must include opportunities in our traditional business lines and development of businesses in non*traditional fields providing jobs for our cunent employees and future job entrants.
The challenge to the parties is a serious one, requiring the full range of all of our talent, experience and imagination. To enhance opportunities for employment

growth, the parties agree the Growth and Opportunity Committee will be continued during the term of the cunent Agreement, This Committee is charged with pursuing opportunities in non-traditional business areas with an overall view toward providing new jobs not currently included in the scope of General Motors operations. Each feature of the total business opportunity must be examined including 1) the market for the product to be produced, 2) expenditures that are required for equipment or tooling, 3) the cost of any plant modernization or rearrangement, including additions to an existing facility, 4) the availability of the necessary technology, 5) the lease or purchase of a new facility, 6) characteristics oi the business including material, capital funds, and wage and benefit levels of other employers in the industry in which the new business will compete, 7) the nature of bargaining agreements needed to assure the new business is competitive, and 8} the expected return on investment relative to the standard in the industry in which the new venture would compete.
In analyzing the feasibility of entering into new business ventures the parties have agreed to call upon the full extent of Corporate and Union resources. As an indication of the seriousness of its commitment to employment growth through business diversification into non-traditional areas, the Corporation will make available up to $100 million of funding to provide for this program during the term oi the current Agreement. However, should the Growth and Opportunity Committee recommend new business funding in excess of this amount. The Corporation agrees to review such requests in accordance with the guidelines of this Document No. 12. These funds will be available for investment in new business ventures including, as appropriate, the establishment oi separate Corporate organizational structures.
Investment funds will be released on an "as required" basis. Only those ventures receiving concept approval and initial funding prior to the expiration of the current Agreement will be considered as firm commitments by the Corporation. Accounting for fund expenditures will
(1)

GROWTH ANO OPPORTUNITY COMMITTEE
be the responsibility of the Growth and Opportunity Committee.
This new program will be administered by the Growth and Opportunity Committee. This Committee will be comprised of equal numbers of Corporate and GM-UAW representatives with multidisciplinary backgrounds. It will be the responsibility of the Committee to make recommendations to the Corporation and Union for concept approval and to request new venture funding from the Corporation for business opportunities deemed to be consistent with employment growth objectives of the program.
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will be responsible to: 1) communicate to group, divisional and local managements and to regional and local union representatives the full scope of this new business concept, 2) review and study the feasibility of proposals made by local JOBS Committees regarding entry into new business ventures, 3) initiate studies necessary for a complete examination of new business ventures proposed locally or by the Committee, 4) make presentations and recommendations to the Executive Board Joint Activities 5) report back, where appropriate, to the local JOBS Committee its findings and recommendations regarding a proposed new business venture, and 6) devise means of encouraging the entire organization, hourly and salaried, to participate in bringing new competitive business into the Corporation and creating new jobs.
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will be guided by the following when considering new business venture proposals:
The jobs created should be in areas in which there is no significant unionized domestic competition, or in the case of traditional areas, where the competition is non-union or outside the U.S, Work similar, but not identical to, work currently performed in-house, must be included for wage and benefit purposes under the National Agreement. Such proposals may include high risk

or marginally profitable projects that General Motors would otherwise not consider.
(3) Such new business ventures must be located completely separate from facilities under this Agreement except for those described in
Paragraph (2) above.
Contingent upon the business climate and market proximity, we have agreed to pay particular attention to communities affected by the loss of GM-UAW employment opportunities, Accordingly, any newly created business venture developed through the efforts of the Growth and Opportunity Committee will be expected to provide opportunities for new employees, with preferential consideration given to UAW represented employees laid off from or working at Corporation facilities. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law, the Corporation or other employer will recognize the UAW as the representative of the hourly employees working at businesses developed through the Growth and Opportunity Committee for the purpose of collective bargaining. In this regard, the parties recognize the need to develop innovative approaches to labor relations and commit to negotiating new collective bargaining agreements for each venture.
The Growth and Opportunity Committee will report periodically to the General Motors Executive Committee and International Union UAW on their progress in identifying and developing viable opportunities for employment growth,
The approach to job security and new business opportunity reflected in this agreement requires a relationship typified by trust and the mutual willingness to take risks in return for economic rewards and job opportunities, Our enthusiasm to search for new business must be shared by group, divisional and local managements and by regional and local union representatives.
The success of this joint activity will be measured based upon results. A high level of commitment will be

As a result of your deep concern about job security in our negotiations and the many discussions which took place over it, this will confirm that during the term of the new Collective Bargaining Agreement, until September 14,2007, the Corporation will not close, nor partially or wholly sell, spin-off, split-off, consolidate or otherwise dispose of in any form, any plant, asset, or business unit of any type, beyond those which have already been identified, constituting a bargaining unit under the Agreement.
In making this commitment, it is understood that conditions may arise that are beyond the control of the Corporation, e.g., act of God, and could make compliance with this commitment impossible. Should such conditions occur, the Corporation will review both the conditions and their impact on a particular location with the Union.
Should it be necessary to close a plant constituting a bargaining unit consistent with our past practice, the Corporation will attempt to redeploy employees to other locations and, it necessary, utilize the "Special Programs" identified in Appendix K of the GM-UAW National Agreement or other incentivized attrition programs as agreed to by the National JOBS Committee.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the roles and responsibilities of Divisional Management in the Joint Health and Safety Process. The parties agreed that leadership direction, whether Management or Union, must always be consistent with the Joint Health and Safety Process.
The GM Automotive Strategy Board initiative clearly directs Management to utilize joint health and safety programs to help support our efforts to achieve a healthy and injury-free workplace. During the negotiations, the Chairperson of the Manufacturing Managers' Council, the Management group identified to oversee our health and safety improvement efforts by the GM Automotive Strategy Board’s initiative, spoke with the parties about Management's commitment and desire to use the Joint Health and Safety Process for GM employees in UAW-represented facilities.
Therefore, the parties agreed that members of ■ Divisional Management and representatives of the
Union will support and operate within the policies and procedures established in the Joint Health and Safety Process.

During these negotiations, the parties discussed the problem created when local managements are reluctant to recall laid off employees to perform work of known short-term duration because under the terms of the 1982 Agreement such employees regenerate costly benefits.
As a result of these discussions, changes are incorporated in the current agreement which delay regeneration of certain benefits. In response to those changes the Corporation assured the International Union that local Management would discuss with the Local JOBS Committee plans to recall available laid off employees or hire available area hire applicants to fill

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course of these negotiations, many discussions took place concerning the development of a more efficient communication process with the Purchasing Activity, particularly with respect to its role in the sourcing process, To address the Union's concerns in this regard, the Corporation will provide an orientation meeting with senior Worldwide Purchasing management within 30 days of the effective date of the new Agreement. The purpose of the meeting will be to identify employees within the Purchasing organization who will serve as contacts in their area of expertise with the UAW General Motors Department Sourcing Staff. It is understood by the parties that the role of these purchasing contacts will be to provide information to the UAW General Motors Department Sourcing Staff on the Purchasing process, sourcing actions, and supplier quality concerns. To improve the open flow of information relative to any sourcing actions which may be pursued, representatives of the Worldwide Purchasing organization will be included in the Quarterly Joint National Sourcing meetings. Additionally, the National Sourcing Committee will have access to specific information in the Global Purchasing System, through a designated Worldwide Purchasing representative.

As a part of the current negotiations, General Motors informed the International Union, UAW, that Mr. George B. Morris, Jr.'s letter of November 19,1973 involving problems of Financial Secretaries would again be published. The text of that letter is as follows:
"During 1973 negotiations. General Motors and the International Union again discussed at length the problems encountered by Financial Secretaries of local unions in maintaining timely and accurate record systems of the dues payments of local union members. Certain new contract provisions in the new Agreement should facilitate the maintenance of these systems.
"Several of the matters raised during these negotiations involve the operation of local procedures, and accordingly, should be dealt with locally within the framework of the following general understandings.
"Local procedures should be such that signed Authorization for Check-Off of Dues forms are made available to the Financial Secretary on a prompt and orderly basis.
"In the case where it is appropriately certified that an employee owes a substantial amount in past dues, mutually satisfactory arrangements may be made to deduct portions of such dues from two or more pay checks.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed situations where the Local Union was required to refund union dues to a large number of employees. This occurred when employees were laid off after a dues deduction had been made but before they had worked sufficient hours to be liable for dues under the UAW Constitution for that month.
The Corporation advised the Union that in those situations where it is known in advance that a large number of employees (100 or more) are scheduled to be permanently laid off and are not anticipated to work the necessary hours to owe dues under the UAW Constitution, the Financial Secretary may request that the plant delay for one week the deduction of monthly dues. In similar situations where the number of employees being laid off is less than 100. the Financial Secretary may request that the regular deduction of monthly dues for these employees be suspended. These requests must be submitted to the plant Personnel Director one week prior to the payroll period that monthly dues deductions are made.
Upon request of the Personnel Director, the payroll department will initiate the required steps to accomplish this procedure.
Very truly yours.

During these negotiations the parties discussed the problems created when apprentices are permanently laid off or reduced from their apprentice classification due to the closing of their plant or the permanent discontinuance of their apprentice classification and as a result not able to complete their apprentice training.
As a result of those discussions, the Corporation agreed to establish an informal procedure whereby such apprentices may, within seven calendar days of their last day worked as an apprentice, apply for consideration for openings in the same apprentice classification at other plants in the same area hire community as described in Document 21 of the National Agreement. Application forms will be made available upon request, and a copy of completed forms will be forwarded to other plants in the area which have an apprentice program in the appropriate skilled classification.
In addition, such apprentices may apply for similar openings in other plants outside the same area hire community In the event such apprentices cannot be placed in the same area hire community they will be offered available openings in the same apprentice classification in other plants outside their same area hire community. When such apprentices, including those who do not apply, are not placed they may be offered other available openings upon the approval of

In this regard, the parties will continue io build on past joint efforts aimed at providing opportunities and incentives designed to encourage laid-off, Protected and active employees to relocate to available job opportunities at UAW-GM facilities outside of their current location, with particular emphasis on placing employees from closed or discontinued operations.
The parties, in committing to continued cooperation this employee placement effort, recognize that necessary productivity and quality improvements, together with the effects of norma! and accelerated attrition activities, have had and will continue to have a significant impact on staffing requirements at GM locations.
The parties agree that an employee placement, relocation and stabilization program will be jointly developed for closed and discontinued operations which will encourage accelerated retirements, relocation and placement of affected employees. Such program will be tailored on a mutually agreeable basis to the individual needs and circumstances of affected locations.

"Accordingly, when mass recalls are anticipated sufficiently in advance at a local plant, local management and the local union should discuss the matter of a pre-recall notification to employees in an attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory method to implement the notice.
"It is mutually recognized that such notice or lack of notice will be without prejudice to either party in the application of any terms of the National Agreement or any local agreements. Moreover, any agreement reached with respect to advanced

They also discussed the effect of Paragraph (188) of the new National Agreement on these employees and on employees to whom Paragraph (187) of the 1961 National Agreement was applied.
"The Corporation informed the International Union that during the term of the new National Agreement the provisions of Paragraph (188) shall apply to an employee whose vacation pay allowance was computed, as of his latest vacation pay allowance eligibility date under the 1961 National Agreement, in accordance with the

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING REGARDING DRUG TESTING
During 1990 National Negotiations, the parties discussed at length the worsening drug problem in our country and the rising incidence of chemical dependency. Chemical dependence on the part of employees impacts the workplace in terms of quality, productivity, and effectiveness of operations, while threatening the safety and well-being of both the chemically-dependent employee and his/her co-workers. As a result, the parties agreed to institute a screening program and to periodically review it during the term of the agreement and make adjustments where deemed appropriate. This memorandum reflects such screening program and adjustments to it.
PROCESS
Employees may be screened for substance abuse (alcohol and drugs) in the following instances;
1.	As part of a return to work physical for employees returning from substance abuse related sick leaves of absence,
2.	As required by law; such as, F.A.A., D.O.T. and D.O.D.
All testing and reporting will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines established by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
IMPLICATIONS
It is not the intent of the testing requirements to imply that an employee is impaired at the time a sample is provided for testing. An individual who tests positive will be handled in the following manner:
1.	FIRST POSITIVE; The employee will be deferred from working for approximately two weeks and
scheduled for follow-up testing. EAP services are to be offered to the employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be subject to further unannounced screening for a period of three months.
2.	SECOND POSITIVE: The employee will again be deferred from working for approximately two weeks and scheduled for follow-up testing. EAP services are to again be offered to the employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be subject to further unannounced screening for a period of six months.
3.	THIRD POSITIVE: The employee will again be deferred from working for approximately two weeks and scheduled for follow-up testing. EAP services are to again be offered to the employee and the employee is to be referred to the CDR. The employee will automatically be subject to further unannounced screening for a period of twelve months.
4.	FOURTH POSITIVE: The employee will be discharged regardless of prior disciplinary record or length of service. Grievances protesting irregularities in the testing procedure may be taken through the grievance procedure; however, extent of penalties arguments are not subject to the Umpire’s discretion.
All positive test results will be subject to a mutually agreed to third party evaluation upon request of either party. Problems selecting a third party may be referred to the National Work/Family Committee. Employees who refuse to be tested will be treated as though they had tested positive.
Once terminated, if the employee satisfactorily documents to local management and local union six months continuous sobriety, within the 60 months following discharge, the employee will qualify for re-

Re: Federally Mandated Drug Testing
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the subject of drug testing mandated by the Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the handling of positive drug tests under this legislation.
It is the Corporation's intent to continue the practice of removing employees who test positive from the covered job.
If an employee who is required to be tested by law, tests positive then transfers to a non-covered classification, the employee will be removed from the drug testing pool and will not be subject to further drug testing except in the case of return from substance abuse related sick leave. Such employees will not be returned to a covered job until submitting to a further drug screen and testing negative. The parties will discuss and develop a process for the placement of employees who have tested positive and wish to be placed in an assignment involving the use of motorized equipment requiring a license.

During the course of the cunent negotiations, General Motors and the International Union, UAW reaffirmed the matter of the Corporation's letter of November 19, 1973, regarding the National and Local Equal Application Committees. In line with that letter, the Parties have agreed to the following:
For many years the Corporation and your Union, in their respective fields, have been leaders in adopting and effectuating policies against discrimination because of age. race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation, and sexual harassment and to this end the parties have expressly incorporated Paragraph (6a) in their National Agreement that both insures adherence to that principle in all aspects of employment at General Motors and provides the contractual grievance and arbitration procedure for the resolution of alleged violations of that principle.
The parties recognize the desirability of increased communication and cooperative effort on this subject (1) to encourage employees and grievance representatives to use the grievance and arbitration procedure as the exclusive method for prompt resolution of all claims of violations of Paragraph (6a). (2) to determine the cause of such claims in order to reduce the probability of these claims arising or recurring, (3) to maintain liaison with appropriate federal and state civil rights agencies for the following

Accordingly, the parties agree to establish within thirty (30) days of the ratification of the National Agreement dated today a National Equal Application Committee and Local Plant Equal Application Committees,
The National Equal Application Committee will be composed of three (3) representatives of the International Union, one of whom will be a member of the International Union’s Civil Rights Committee, or a designee, and three (3) representatives of the Corporation, one of whom will be active in the Corporation's equal employment opportunity programs.

During the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern that the installation of an upgraded computer system in conjunction with the mechanization of the "Tandem System" would be used to establish work standards and gather data for purposes of disciplinary action.
It was pointed out that the use of the upgraded computer equipment is to facilitate order consolidation, mechanize the recording of material movements and accomplish more efficient direction of warehouse functions. The information accumulated and generated by this equipment will not be used to establish production standards or to initiate or support disciplinary action.

During the term of the 1984 Agreement, the parties developed a National Paid Educational Leave (PEL) Program which provided selected employees with a unique educational opportunity to enhance their knowledge of the automobile industry. Sponsored candidates are approved in advance by the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources, Expenses and lost time for participants in the program are provided from National Joint Training Funds.
The jointly developed and administered PEL Program utilizes industry experts, university analysts and political officials to examine and discuss the economic, technological, and political forces influencing the future of the world-wide automobile industry. This innovative, jointly administered labor-management program has been enthusiastically received by attendees, and UAW and Corporation officials. Academicians, Governmental representatives, writers for world-wide news and trades publications have examined the program and view it as a positive step forward in the industrial relations process. A local version of the PEL Program has also been jointly developed and is currently operating at numerous locations. During these negotiations, the Parties reconfirmed their support of the National and Local PEL Programs and agreed, under the direction of the Executive Board — Joint Activities, to continue to

ORIENTATION PROGRAM
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director
General Motors Department
International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The parties have long recognized the importance of providing orientation programs for new employees, Many of these programs resulted from the diligent efforts of plant employee groups and have addressed such topics as quality, teamwork, safety, and joint programs in addition to those items new employees must know to perform their jobs.
"Men and women enter the work force today with little or no knowledge of what is expected of them as employees and as union members in a unionized, industrial plant community. Many of them have not been adequately prepared to cope with industrial situations in which they suddenly find themselves.
"New employees come to General Motors with little or at best incomplete information about their employer and their union. They have little knowledge of the extensive economic benefits available to them as agreed upon in collective bargaining between the UAW and General Motors over a period of more than thirty years.
"Many new employees may be unaware of the commitment of GM and the UAW to fair employment practices and to the application of the National Agreement to all employees without regard to age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation. They are not familiar with basic contract provisions
ORIENTATION PROGRAM
covering such subjects as transfers, promotions, shift preference and seniority. They may be unaware of the opportunities for advancement to highly paid skilled trades jobs through the Apprentice and EIT programs. They tend to be unfamiliar with the obligations of the employee to his job, to the union and to his employer. Many are unaware of the importance of regular attendance, quality workmanship and the need for cooperation by ail in getting the job done. Too often they are unacquainted with the various procedural matters related to their job and their relationship to their union and their employer.
"New employees usually have little knowledge of the long history of the UAW and of the administrative structure of the UAW at the International and local union levels. They do not understand about their relationship to the union, about the initiation fees and dues requirements and their rights within the union contained in the UAW Constitution and guaranteed by right of appeal to the Union's Public Review Board.
"Frequently, they have never seen the inside of a manufacturing plant before and are unfamiliar with the operations, the nature of the product and how it is used."

In this regard, the parties agreed to supplement local plant programs by providing a national New Employee Orientation Program through the auspices of the Center for Human Resources. The program will be developed by a joint study team of UAW and GM representatives and technical consultants. The focus of the program will be on national materials that explain the respective roles of GM and the UAW, the state of the auto industry, the changing composition and diversity of the work force, the negotiated joint programs, and how employees, Management, and the Union work together to foster employee well-being and Corporation business success which benefits both employees and communities.

*■

ORIENTATION PROGRAM
The national program ensures uniformity of message and treatment. Throughout the development of the orientation program, the Center for Human Resources will obtain broad-based feedback from group/divisions, plant and Union representatives to ensure the program best meets the needs of its customers. The program will be made available to requesting locations, including appropriate support on how to deliver it most effectively. It is anticipated the national program will be packaged in a self-contained module to provide local parties the flexibility to incorporate it into their ongoing local orientation programs as they deem appropriate. Locations should make the program available to new employees within a reasonable period of time. The national program content will be kept up-to-date and the program will be evaluated periodically to ensure it is meeting its goals. Training will be provided as needed to Corporation and Union representatives from each location responsible for administering the program.
Development and promotion of the national New Employee Orientation Program shall be funded through the UAW-GM National Joint Training Funds. Ongoing costs incurred at each location may be funded through Local Training Funds. Local parties may request funding for ongoing program costs from the Center for Human Resources, as necessary.
The New Employee Orientation Program shall not be subject to the Grievance Procedure nor in any way limit communications by the Corporation with its employees or by the Union with its members.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
General Motors and the International Union express their determination to work jointly with personal problems including substance abuse and mental health among GM workers and their families.
Alcoholism and drug dependency is recognized by medical, public health authorities, General Motors and -the UAW as a disease. These diseases can impair workers’ ability to function in their lives and on their jobs. Alcoholism and drug dependency as well as other personal problems contribute to increased absenteeism and tardiness and deterioration of job performance. This in turn disrupts work schedules with consequent dissatisfaction among the majority of workers who are sincerely trying to do conscientious jobs. The combination of factors is recognized as having a potentially damaging effect on plant efficiency and endangers the job security of the worker.
The causes of personal problems including alcoholism, drug dependency and mental health are not well understood and cures are difficult. Nonetheless, General Motors and the UAW believe that constructive measures are possible to deal with these problems which can be a major cause of family breakdown and are related to persona! breakdown and violence in the community.
I.	Objective
The objectives of this joint effort are to help employees and their family members develop healthier life styles and enhance the effectiveness of the workforce. Further the purpose of this program is designed to help prevent the development of personal problems and provide access for treatment and after care for those already affected.
General Motors and the International Union acknowledge that neither local management nor the local union working alone can always provide the level of motivation required by employees experiencing personal problems. As a result, joint efforts are imperative in encouraging the employee to seek EAP services, as needed, to respond successfully to treatment, and to maintain a resolve to avoid further personal problems.
II.	Guidelines for Administration
Responsibility for directing and coordinating these efforts will be the principal function of the National Work/Family Program Committee. The Committee will be comprised of an equal number of representatives from the respective organizations and will be co-chaired by the Vice President - Labor Relations for General Motors and the Vice President and Director of the GM Department of the UAW, or their designated representative(s). This Committee will engage in joint efforts and function administratively in consultation with a Work/Family Committee comprised of local management and local union personnel which will review the efforts of the local Work/Family team on a regular basis. The Committee will meet regularly for the purpose of reviewing the administration and operation of the UAW-GM Employee Assistance Program, resolving issues not otherwise resolved and providing direction and consultation to local Work/Family Committees,
The National Joint Program Administrators, the National Benefits Administrators and CDR Representatives will meet periodically to discuss issues impacting EAP program administration. In this regard it is important to;
1.	Generate a climate at the plant level which will eliminate the effects of the social stigma associated with mental disorders, alcoholism and drug dependency, and other personal problems which act as a barrier to employees seeking help to resolve personal problems;
412
413

.Mali
2.	Insist that local management and the local union at • all levels exercise their best efforts toward the objective of earlier identification and motivation of the employee to accept EAP services;
3.	Assure confidentiality in working with the employee;
4.	Assist in developing educational and informational materials for use at the plant level.
'III, Local Employee Assistance Program Administration
The local Work/Family Committee consists of the Plant Manager or a designated Management representative, the Plant Personnel Director, the President of the Local Union and the Chairperson of the Shop Committee. It will be the responsibility of this Committee to review on a periodic basis the local Employee Assistance Program.
General Motors and the International Union will designate representatives of local management and representatives of the local union to work jointly on these problems. Among the responsibilities of the local Work/Family team are:
1.	In cooperation with the central review organization (CRO), the carrier and the local central diagnostic referral (CDR) agency, survey community resources to determine the availability of appropriate treatment facilities and the cost of treatment. Where facilities are inadequate or unavailable, undertake efforts to improve the situation.
There will be an assessment by a CDR within 24 hours of a Work/Family representative’s direct referral resulting from a medical emergency. While the parties recognize the value of providing timely assessments,
they also recognize that there may be situations where the 24-hour assessment does not occur. On a case-by-case basis, the joint parties will review such situations and undertake efforts to improve the situation.
2.	Help employees understand that they may consult on a confidential basis with the local Work/Family team, or an outside central diagnostic and referral (CDR) agency, concerning the employee’s problem.
3.	Arrange for the local union benefits representative to be available to explain to the employee and others who may be involved the extent to which recommended treatment qualifies for payment under the GM Health Care Program.
4.	Establish and maintain active aftercare and follow-up programs. Help employees understand the therapeutic benefits of self-help groups and engage EAP participants in these group activities.
General Motors and the International Union acknowledge that:
1.	Nothing in this statement is to be interpreted as constituting any waiver of Management’s responsibility to maintain discipline or the right to invoke disciplinary measures in the case of misconduct which may result from or be associated with the use of alcohol or drugs or personal problems. The union may exercise its right to process grievances concerning such matters in accordance with the GM-UAW National Agreement;
2.	During or following treatment the employee should not expect any special privileges or exemptions from standard personnel practices; and
3.	When a leave of absence is necessary so that an employee may undergo medical treatment for alcoholism or drug dependence or personal problems in
414
415
.Z_.-
or from an appropriate facility in accordance with this program, and when the employee has voluntarily submitted to such treatment and provided the employee has unbroken seniority, sick leave of absence will be granted pursuant to the National Agreement and the employee will be eligible for benefits in accordance with the GM Health Care and Life and Disability Benefits Programs as negotiated with the International Union.
IV. Additional Understandings
During the course of 1996 Negotiations, the parties held extensive discussions over a wide range of EAP subjects. The following represents the highlights of those discussions and the commitments arrived at between the parties:
1.	A key ingredient in combating personal problems lies in education, early identification and early intervention. Accordingly, the National Work/Family Committee has developed a comprehensive education and training program directed at ail levels of local management, local union, and the work force. Administrative costs of the program will be funded by the Executive Board-Joint Activities.
2.	The National Work/Family Program Committee through a series of meetings, with input from Work/Family Representatives in the plants, has developed Standards for UAW-GM Work/Family Programs. Those standards are incorporated by reference into the terms of this Memorandum, including revisions or modifications the parties may make in the future. Problems related to the implementation of these standards will be brought to the attention of the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources, Work/Family Program Staff for resolution.

2,	During overtime hours, when less than fifty percent (50%) of the people they represent on their respective shifts are scheduled to work, they will not function pursuant to this Memorandum of Understanding, but will be scheduled to perform Work/Family Program activities if they would otherwise have work available in their equalization group.
VI. Drug Testing
Because of the recent emergence of a substantial body of legislation requiring drug testing of many of the Corporation's employees, both represented and nonrepresented, the parties have had extensive discussions surrounding drug testing and have agreed to the following:
1. All drug testing performed will be conducted in accord with applicable laws mandating or regulating
416
such testing; such as, Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation, or Department of Defense.
VII. Conditions of Employment Guidelines -
For those Employees in the Employee Assistance Program Whose Seniority has been Broken
When Employee Assistance Program participants or other employees suspected of being in need of EAP services return to work, the following can be agreed upon between the bargaining unit representative, Labor Relations, the Work/Family team and the employee.
The specific items to be included will depend on the individual case and should be developed to meet the particular circumstances. Accordingly, items one through five may be recommended for inclusion in a condition of continued employment by the joint Work/Family team.
1.	Participation in in-plant self-help meetings. Length of participation that will be required and frequency of meetings can be either specified in advance or left up to the discretion of the Work/Family team.
2.	Participation in outside self-help groups and mandatory completion of an aftercare plan which might include antabuse recommended by a treatment facility and monitored by the Work/Family team.
3.	Mandatory cooperation in follow-up and monitoring for a period of time specified by Work/Family team members.
4.	Periodic scheduled urine screening when it is felt this procedure could be of value in monitoring and encouraging abstinence. In cases of positive findings, the results must be confirmed by a second testing method.

5., A specific period of total non-use of alcohol or other!drugs can be agreed to between the parties. The Work/Family team and the employee must concur with this probationary period which is defined as not less than six months nor more than two years and it must be understood by all parties that resumed use could result in termination of employment during this period.
The above items (one through five) will be administered jointly by the Work/Family team for those employees returning under these conditions. Any conditions of continued employment agreed to by Management, the Union and the employee are considered contractually binding and non-compliance could result in disciplinary action up to and including discharge. The employee's previous disciplinary record and action which may be taken for further misconduct will be matters reserved to the actual settlement of any grievance(s) involved and/or will be resolved between the bargaining unit representative and Labor Relations.
The seniority status of the employee must be specified as cither a new hire or reinstatement of former seniority. If seniority is reinstated, all rights and privileges which would normally accrue in line with the reinstated seniority under the terms of the national or local agreement must be granted.

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING QUALITY NETWORK
During the course of prior negotiations, General Motors and the International Union, UAW, held extensive discussions about the quality of our products and services. There is ongoing recognition on the part of both parties to the National Agreement that the cornerstone of job security for ail General Motors employees is the design, engineering, and manufacturing of the highest quality, customer-valued prodpets and services. This is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality, both on the national and local levels, exemplified by the formation and institution of the UAW-GM jointly developed Quality Network process. The Quality Network process is General Motors’ only Total Quality Management System utilized at UAW-represented locations.
Further, the parties recommitted themselves to the ongoing implementation of the Quality Network. This jointly developed quality improvement process emphasizes customer satisfaction and enthusiasm, continuous quality improvement, and elimination of waste in the design, engineering and manufacturing of products and services provided.
During the past several years, the Corporation in cooperation with UAW leadership, together with the men and women of General Motors, have worked together within a spirit of teamwork to improve product and service quality. This spirit of cooperation has resulted in substantial improvement in the quality of the Corporation’s products and services.
The parties recognize that the design, engineering and manufacturing of the highest quality, customer-valued products and services is essential to secure the Corporation’s position in the global market and assure
419

420
il
421
Mam
job security. The Corporation stated that high-quality products and services have to be the result of a total quality improvement process if General Motors is to continue to be the world leader in transportation products and related services.
Accordingly, General Motors’ process for total quality management is the Quality Network-the one process for total customer satisfaction and enthusiasm utilized at UAW-represented locations. Although Management has the ultimate responsibility for the Quality Network, it is recognized that UAW leaders and members are valuable partners in the development of the process, the action strategies, and its implementation plans.
This relationship is reflected in the extensive efforts both parties have devoted to the subject of quality, both on the national and local levels, exemplified by the institution of quality councils at appropriate levels throughout the GM North America (GMNA) Region and Electro-Motive Division.
It is recognized that the point where product design, technology, process and materials come together and must work in harmony is at the worker/supervisor level in the organization. High-quality products and services result from a well-managed process that motivates employees to work together within a spirit of teamwork to continuously improve customer satisfaction and enthusiasm. In this process, it is recognized that seeking opportunities for continuously improving product and service quality must be the foundation for customer satisfaction. Il is acknowledged that it is ultimately Management's responsibility to establish and assure product and service quality requirements. Further, it is Management’s responsibility to provide the processes for continuous quality improvement that support all employees based on the Beliefs and Values* The Beliefs and Values are recorded in the Vehicle Development and Technical

Operations. (VDTOLStaff Policy (revised 1/10/95) section of the General Motors Corporate Policy Manual* and arc referenced as “Quality Network" (VDTQ-01 and VDTO-
02). This manual outlines specific policies to be followed throughout General Motors Corporation* The VDTQ-01 and VDTQ-02 documents will be revised and made available through, thg Quaiity,NetwQrk website- -This document states in part:
“Guided by the Beliefs and Values, implementation of the Quality Network will lead to the highest
» satisfaction of the ultimate customers-those who buy GM products and use our services. This value system represents significant expectations. It is crucial that behavior is aligned with these values and that decisions and actions are tested against them. We must constantly monitor our behavior to be certain our actions are consistent with the commitments that have been made to the men and • women of General Motors.”
It is recognized that performance of high-quality work is everyone’s responsibility and, as a result, it is intended that the Quality Network Representatives and UAW leadership working together with local management will reinforce other ongoing quality improvement activities.
The parties also discussed the necessity for all GM employees to take individual responsibility for product and service quality. Management’s business planning process will include the necessity for providing employees with the appropriate training, methods and systems, materials, and equipment in an appropriate environment based on the Quality Network Beliefs and Values to perform their work. It is then incumbent upon employees to exercise diligence and properly perform their work to produce the highest quality, customervalued products and services.
It is only through personal commitment from every GM employee to provide the highest quality, customer-
valued products and services that we will satisfy our customers and maintain job security for all. Quality Council leadership at all levels within the GMNA Region and Electro-Motive Division, and the UAW will review and apply the training and principles set forth in the Quality Network Environment Action Strategies to assure the necessary level of understanding to lead this effort.
The general guidelines for the parties to provide additional support to employees in this quality improvement process are as follows:
I.	Quality Network Structure
During the term of the 1993 GM-UAW National Agreement, restructuring within the Corporation resulted in the NAO UAW-GM Quality Council being renamed the “UAW-GM Leadership Quality Council.” The following represents the Quality Network Structure:
A. The UAW-GM Leadership Quality Council is cochaired by the President of the GM North America Region, the Group Vice President of Manufacturing and Labor, Relations, and the Vice President and Director of the UAW General Motors Department. All Group/Divisional Quality Councils, as listed herein, will be subject to and in compliance with the direction and support provided by this Council for Quality Network activities. The UAW-GM Leadership Quality Council membership includes representatives from the GMNA Region Strategy Board, Operations Vice-Presidents, and designated UAW leadership. The UAW-GM Leadership Quality Council will meet a minimum of four times per year. The responsibilities of the UAW-GM Leadership Quality Council include, but are not limited to:
1.	Providing direction and support for Quality Network activities,
422
2.	Establishing annual objectives and goals,
3.	Utilizing appropriate common measurements to monitor progress toward accomplishing the annua! Quality Network Objectives and Goals as agreed to by the Council,
4.	Reviewing Group/Divisional status reports on gap closure initiatives for the annual Quality Network Objectives and Goals.
B, In addition, the UAW-GM Leadership Quality Cbuncil will review company-wide new management quality or productivity improvement programs potentially involving UAW-represented employees prior to assigning resources for development and implementation. These reviews will extend to the UAW the opportunity to provide input into management’s plans and to discuss the union’s support and involvement. It is management’s desire to implement all such quality improvement processes cooperatively with UAW leadership at all levels.
C.	Similar reviews and opportunities for involvement in new management quality or productivity improvement programs or utilization of consultants, potentially involving UAW-represented employees, will be provided at the appropriate Quality Council level. This review will assure the UAW opportunity to comment on management’s plans and to discuss the union’s support and involvement.	|i
D.	Management recognizes that UAW input to such improvement programs may create opportunities for collaboration and support. Accordingly, in an effort to avoid parallel programs, the parties agreed to establish a joint committee during the term of the 1999 National Agreement, comprised of management representatives from the Competitive Operations Engineering organization^ and the co-directors of the UAW-GM
423
Leadership Quality Council Support Staff (sec letter c milled,__1GM.-Glpbaj____Manufacturing System

Pwing the._L991, negotiations, ihe-pariies diseased the above events and the Union provided examples of £PQ.C.CSgfuj_redeployment.. processes,_____These
redeployment processes, implemented at divisions and plants, resulted, in people being retained at work and redeployed to meaningful assignments after they had been, made available as a result of quality and productivity improvements and other initiatives.
Following 1993 negotiations, the parties agreed to jointly develop guidelines for redeployment processes, similar to those reviewed by the parties, to assist plant and staff locations with planning for redeployment opportunities, Such guidelines were intended _to. assist the local parties with the development of plans that put first emphasis on redeployment of employees to meaningful assignments, which included regular productive assignments and “non-traditional” work, as well as efforts to competitively retain or insource new work.
Accordingly during these negotiations, the parties again restated their intent.to not place employees in underutilized or unproductive assignments or only contemplate utilization pf the job, security provisions, of (he National Agreement, F\irthert.Jbe parties agreed to reissue the document “Guidelines for Redeployment and

Both organizations recognize that diversity includes race and gender, as well as broader dimensions such as family status, religion, sexual orientation, education, abilities, disabilities, military status, union, non-union,
Diversity is a positive asset to an organization because only by leveraging our diversity will we be able to achieve the kind of relationship that we know is necessary if General Motors is to prosper and provide good jobs that allow employees, both union-represented and salaried, to be secure in today's
Our vision is to have a workplace that naturally enables the people of UAW-GM to fully contribute and achieve personal fulfillment.

Dear Mh Shoemaker:
The UAW and General Motors recognize the need for a focused career development process for active and dislocated employees as a key element in competitiveness and employment security. The career development process must address both internal career needs of individual employees and critical skill needs of the company. A focused approach beginning early in each employee's career and continuing throughout their career could provide the employee with the skills and knowledge required by changing business conditions.
The parties have, therefore, agreed to continue to refine the pilot program containing the following principal elements;
1.	Voluntary individual employee assessments to determine interests, abilities and career development needs which may be met internally through a broader variety of on-the-job training, classroom technical training, training in basic computational skills and reading and writing, classroom training leading to a special certification, associate or baccalaureate degree.
2.	A career development process for hourly employees which may provide for broad job experience.
3.	Cooperation with community college, college, university and other educational and training facilities in the community in the development of career focused classroom and cooperative training programs for active and dislocated GM workers.
450
451
CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
4.	Exploration of the development of career focused classroom and cooperative work programs for dislocated workers which would lead to comparable employment.
The parties agree that the evaluation of the initial pilot location resulted in recommendations for several changes in the program. The recommended changes, deemed to be appropriate by the parties, will be made to the program. The revised program will then be offered at an additional location(s) and the parties will continue to evaluate its success. Thereafter, an implementation strategy will be developed and presented to the UAW-GM Joint Skill Development and Training Committee for their approval.
The above program will be supported by a combination of national, local and plant training funds and will be jointly administered by the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources and the Local Joint Activities Committee(s).

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course of these negotiations, General Motors and the International Union, UAW agreed that the letter of November 22,1976 regarding expeditious grievance handling would again be published. During these negotiations, the Union cited various examples of situations where continuing liability cases were not processed in a timely manner. In this regard, the parties emphasized that full implementation of this document would result in the timely processing of continuing liability cases. Accordingly, the parties reemphasize the following:
"During 1976 negotiations, General Motors and the International Union again discussed at length problems encountered in the administration of the Grievance Procedure at some locations. The parties reaffirmed their mutual determination that the purpose of the Agreement as stated in Paragraph (5) is 'to provide orderly collective bargaining relations between the Corporation and the Union, to secure a prompt and fair disposition of grievances, to eliminate interruptions of work and interference with the efficient operation of the Corporation's business.' In addition, the Union and the Corporation agreed that the delaying or holding of grievances at any step of the Grievance Procedure was contrary to the best interests of the employees
and the parties.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations the parties discussed at length the need to focus our current joint program representatives on specific programs designed to assist our employees and the management in implementation of an improved working environment.
Over the years, we have agreed to a number of different joint program representatives appointed by the Vice President and Director of the GM Department, UAW, and, in some cases, by the local management and union leadership at the direction of the Co-Chairman, Executive Board - Joint Activities to carry out and administer certain negotiated agreement programs in the following functions:
Health and Safety Joint Activities Accommodating DisAbled People in Transition
Work/Family Program
Human Resource Development Joint Training Quality Network
Each plant in General Motors, depending on employee population, may have employees assigned to the above functions.

JOINT PROGRAM REPRESENTATIVES parties recognize that over the years priorities have shifted and, as a result, there is a need to carefully analyze the programs that currently require increased emphasis, such as, work/family, health and safety, etc. As a result, the parties have concluded that these well-trained resources can now be deployed or reassigned to programs requiring special attention.
It is recognized that each plant location has its own unique culture and needs; therefore, the local joint leadership group (Plant Manager. Personnel Director, Local Union President and Chairperson of the Shop Committee) will determine where their current full time representatives will be allocated to best serve the employees of the organization. It is recognized that at some locations additional representatives may be required to perform tasks associated with the newly determined local focus and at others less. In any event, the total number of new and current full time joint program representatives shall not exceed the number provided for below:

In the case of bargaining units between 1,001 to 5,000 and 5,001 and above, the number of representatives in a given bargaining unit will be determined by the number of represented employees (active, temporary layoff and Protected) divided by the appropriate ratio number. Where the fraction of the result is .5 and above, the number will be rounded up to the next highest whole number and where the fraction is less than .5, rounded down to the whole number.
Nothing in this agreement limits or is intended to interfere with any local mutually agreed upon projects or initiatives tailing outside the scope of this document




that may provide additional staff resources to meet the specific objectives of the local parties.
Each plant has submitted a plan for deployment of these resources in accordance with specific guidelines issued by the National parties. All such representatives will be appointed by the Vice President and Director of the GM Department, UAW. Such plan will include the names and assignments for each of the local representatives assigned to Joint Programs and will be forwarded to the National parties for approval prior to implementation. Likewise, as individual plant needs and priorities change, the local parties are afforded the flexibility to submit revised plans for National approval.
When plant population changes occur which would increase or decrease the number of representatives, such population changes must be in effect for a period of six consecutive months before such adjustment is made in the number of representatives, in which case such adjustment will be made at the conclusion of the six month period. In the event such population change results from the discontinuance or addition of a shift, the opening of a plant, or the cessation of a plant's operations, the adjustment in the number of representatives will be made within the first twenty working days following the first day such population change occurs. Other situations involving a sudden significant change in the number of employees at a location may be discussed by the Corporation and the GM Department of the International Union.
When a reduction or increase in plant population calls for a change in the number of representatives, the local parties will be required to submit a revised deployment of resources plan for approval. All representatives in either case will also be appointed by the Vice President and Director of the GM Department, UAW.
It is understood that the Representatives re-deployed in these locally determined areas of special focus and attention may require additional training. It is agreed that such training will be provided through the UAW-

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During current negotiations, the parties reaffirmed their
intent to continue the interpretation regarding Paragraph (76) expressed in the Louis G. Seaton letter addressed to Personnel Directors dated February 13, 1969. The text of this letter is as follows;
"As a result of a series of discussions between the International Union, UAW, and the Corporation, it has been agreed that the provisions of Paragraph (76) of the 1967 GM-UAW National Agreement will be applicable to temporary employees with more than thirty (30) days' of employment who are released or discharged. This provision, of course, is not applicable to any employee laid off due to fluctuations in manpower requirements,
"The parties also agreed that this interpretation is not retroactive. Accordingly, cases currently in the procedure involving temporary employees should be processed on their merits without regard to the procedural requirements of Paragraph (76)."
The provisions of Paragraph 76 will apply to employees hired pursuant to Appendix A as of the date of hire.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director Genera) Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course of the current negotiations, the parties reviewed the Grievance Procedure provisions of the National Agreement for the purpose of identifying certain problems that have been encountered under those provisions in processing grievances to arbitration. Generally, it was recognized that the procedure, as currently constituted, has worked well. At the outset of the 1979 negotiations, the number of open cases on appeal to arbitration was at the lowest level in many years despite the fact there had been an
increase in the number of grievances filed. However, the Union stated that some instances have occurred wherein grievances protesting an employees loss of seniority, discharge or a series of disciplinary layoffs leading to a discharge, have met with delay in the procedure following their consideration at the Third Step and their resolution at the Umpire Step.
In view of the above, the Corporation agreed to provide the Union with a monthly summary of appeal cases open on the Umpire's docket protesting the loss of seniority, the discharge of employees and also those protesting progressive disciplinary actions which involve an employee whose discharge is also under protest in an open appeal case. This information will enable both the International Union and Corporation Umpire Staffs io monitor the number oi such cases on appeal to the Umpire at any given time and to take remedial action on any particular cases which may be subject to undue delay.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed the situation where the duration of an impending disciplinary layoff would encompass or abut a specified holiday.

Additionally, there was discussion concerning the variations in state laws relating to garnishments and the resulting inconsistencies between plant locations in the application of corrective discipline to garnishments.
In order to assure uniformity between plants in the handling of this matter and to insure compliance with applicable State and Federal laws on this subject, the Corporation informed the Union that, as a matter of policy as of the effective date of the 1979 National Agreement, formal disciplinary action will no longer be taken for future violations of the Shop Rule regarding garnishments.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
D&rr Mr. Shoemaker;
During the cunent National negotiations, the parties acknowledged the desirability of ensuring prompt, fair and final resolution of employee grievances. The parties also recognized that the maintenance of a stable, effective and dependable grievance procedure is necessary to implement the foregoing principle to which they both subscribe. Accordingly, the parties view any attempt to reinstate a grievance properly disposed of as contrary to the purpose for which the grievance procedure was established and violative of the fundamental principles of collective bargaining.
However, in those instances where the International Union, UAW, by either its Executive Board, Public Review Board, or Constitutional Convention Appeals Committee has reviewed the disposition of a grievance and found that such disposition was improperly effected by the Union or a Union representative involved, the General Motors Department of the International Union may inform the Corporation's Industrial Relations Staff in writing that such grievance is reinstated in the Grievance Procedure at the step at which the original disposition of the grievance occurred.
It is agreed, however, that the Corporation will not be liable for any claims for damages, including back pay claims, arising out of the grievance that either are already barred under the provisions of the National Agreement at the time of the reinstatement of the

During current negotiations. General Motors informed the International Union, UAW that it was its intention to rppublish the Corporation s letter concerning Furnishing Work Elements - Standards Cases. The text of that letter is as follows:
"During past negotiations the parties discussed at length the Union s charges that there were occasions when the work elements of a job requested by the Committeeperson pursuant to Paragraph (79) were not furnished in a timely manner.
"The Corporation and the Union have reaffirmed their mutual determination to adhere to the spirit and intent of Paragraph (79). In addition, there is agreement that in nearly all cases a more expeditious settlement of grievances can be reached when there is prompt and full exchange of pertinent information. In this regard the text of Paragraph (79) of the GM-UAW National Agreement provides that the work elements of a job in dispute will be furnished 'without undue delay.' It is recognized by the Union that there will be occasions when due to production acceleration, volume of production standards grievances filed, etc., the information requested by the Committeeperson cannot be furnished as promptly as under normal circumstances.

As a part of the current negotiations General Motors informed the International Union, UAW that it was the Corporation's intention to republish Mr. L. G. Seaton's letter of December 15,1967 regarding the transfer or reassignment of employees who complained about production standards or discipline. The text of that letter is as follows;
"During the negotiations resulting in the 1967 GM-UAW National Agreement, the parties discussed the claim raised by the Union regarding employees being transferred or re-assigned to 'less desirable' jobs because they initiated complaints regarding production standards or discipline. In addition, in the case of probationary employees, the Union stated that some were separated because they initiated production standards complaints.
"It is important for General Motors to retain its right to transfer employees in order to maintain and improve efficiency in our operations. It is also important to respect the right of employees to file legitimate grievances regarding production standards or disciplinary action.
"The International Union has been advised that we do not consider it proper to transfer, re-assign or separate employees because they file such grievances.

During current negotiations, General Motors and the International Union, UAW have reaffirmed the informal procedure dealing with the implementation of production standards settlements as outlined in Mr. Earl R. Bramblett's letter of October 5,1964. The text of that letter is as follows:
"In the course of current negotiations the Union has alleged that in some cases the solution agreed upon in settlement of production standards grievances was not implemented in a timely fashion. The Union has also alleged that in certain cases settlements agreed upon were violated.
"In the course oi these negotiations we have reaffirmed our mutual determination to avoid misunderstandings in this area in the future. In that connection, we have adopted the following informal procedure for use in cases in which it is alleged that a settlement of a work standards grievance, reached during negotiations in which a member of the GM Department of the UAW and a representative of the Central Office Labor Relations Staff of a multi-plant car or body division, and/or the Corporation Personnel Staff participated, has not been implemented in a timely manner, or that after implementation the settlement has been violated:

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The relief time in automobile manufacturing plants on operations on which the employees' manual operations are continuous and which cannot be left unattended and for which the Corporation provides "tag" relief, and on certain other operations that the Corporation determines are likewise of such a nature as to give the employees no control over their work pace, shall be twenty-three (23) minutes before lunch and twenty-three (23) minutes after lunch on a regular eight (8) hour shift, making a total of forty-six (46) minutes. This will not affect relief allowance now in effect on certain specific operations due to environmental job conditions. The amount of such relief shall be modified accordingly for a shift other than a regular eight (8) hour shift. The Plant Management may, by mutual agreement with the Local Union, allocate the relief before and after lunch to not more than two (2) periods before lunch and two (2) periods after lunch.
Sufficient labor will be provided to enable employees to obtain the above relief taking into consideration that the first hour at the start of the shift and the first one-half hour after lunch are not ordinarily required for relief except in emergencies.
The parties have agreed to continue the following informal procedure to address complaints regarding this subject.
1.	The complaint may be raised by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee directly with the Plant Personnel Director.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations the UAW complained that procedures set forth in Paragraph (183)(d) are not being satisfactorily implemented by Management in many instances.
This letter is intended to clarify the intent and purpose of this provision:
1.	The "advance discussion" except where time and circumstances prevent it. will take place "prior to letting the contract for the performance of maintenance and construction work," before any decision has been made as to whether the work should be contracted out. The "advance discussion" will include information as to "why Management is contemplating contracting out the work." It is evident that except as noted above, since Management is only "contemplating contracting out the work" when the "advance discussion" takes place. Management should not have made any decisions concerning whether or not to contract out the work before such "advance discussion" is held.
2.	Management should advise the local Union of the "nature, scope and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reason or reasons (equipment, manpower etc.), why Management is contemplating contracting out the work." This information is related to the letter dated December 14,1967, to the International Union






SUBCONTRACTING - IMPLEMENTATION PARAGRAPH (183) (d)
signed by Mr. Louis G. Seaton. That letter makes reference to "manpower, skills, equipment and facilities" and also as to whether the Corporation "can do the work competitively in quality, cost and performance and within the projected time limit." Since any or all of these conditions may be entailed in the determination as to whether a particular contract should be let out or not, it is necessary that Management advise the local Union in the "advance discussion" concerning the item or items which are relevant to the decision-making.
3.	It in the "advance discussion" it is clear that Management is only "contemplating contracting out the work" and if in addition all the pertinent information as noted above is supplied to the local Union, then local Union representatives will be given a better opportunity "to comment on Management's plans" and will also give an opportunity to Management "to give appropriate weight to those comments in the light of all attendant circumstances."
4.	These advance discussions should include a Management representative of the Plant Engineering or Maintenance activities knowledgeable of the issues.
In addition the Union complained that in certain instances plant Management requested and contracted for maintenance service on leased equipment, and extended warranty arrangements or service contracts were being purchased which impacted the job security of seniority employees in skilled trades classifications. Management stated that, while Paragraph (I83)(b) covers the "fulfillment of normal warranty obligations by the vendor", warranty arrangements that extend beyond those customarily provided or the obtaining of service contracts are not covered by these provisions. Rather, such arrangements or service contracts covering work normally and historically performed by represented skilled trades employees are to be considered in the same manner as contracts for the performance of maintenance work and such decisions

ADVANCE DISCUSSION - DIE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
During the current negotiations the parties held lengthy discussions of subcontracting the construction of sheet metal dies and die tryout to non-General Motors sources and its effect on the job security of seniority employees in skilled trades classifications.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
The Union complained that the current provisions of the National Agreement do not provide for the Union to have sufficient advance knowledge of possible impact of such subcontracting on the job security of seniority employees engaged in the construction of sheet metal dies and die tryout associated with major body sheet metal parts.
During the discussions the parties recognized that a large amount of such work is the responsibility of the Die Management Group-Metal Fabricating Division. The Die Management Group has substantial die construction capacity, however it has historically been necessary for them to subcontract portions of each annual model program because of, among other things, the efficiencies and economies involved, the need for specialized tools and equipment, special skills and the necessity of meeting production schedules, model change and plant rearrangement deadlines, the complicating effect of design modifications and bottleneck operations such as machining limitations and the unavailability of presses to perform the necessary tryout work.
AJRSOJKCS DISCUSSION - DIE CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMS
. tn sxugnition of the Union's desire for advance Jtaiswtedgo of such subcontracting, the Corporation cjjzccd that when a Local Plant Management at these temaaaa u> contemplating a decision to subcontract ryth dte> work to non-General Motors sources, Local UsDagomoot will, except where time and acnxEXJtances prevent it, have advance discussion with Sanai Union representatives concerning the nature, anp and approximate dates of the work to be performed and the reasons why Management is amtomplating contracting out the work. At such times, t&magament representatives are expected to afford the Union an opportunity to comment on Management's piano and to give appropriate weight to those ccmroonls in light of all attendant circumstances.
Tho International Union, UAW, expressed a desire to havo knowledge of the overall scope of contemplated dk> construction programs and plastic body parts programs.
Accordingly, in addition to the above, the Corporation stated that Divisional Headquarters representatives have expressed a willingness to meet with representatives from the GM Department of the International Union from time to time to discuss the general nature and scope of die construction work and work normally done in the bargaining unit involving plastic body parts that is contemplated being contracted out by its Headquarters Offices.
In addition, the parties recognized that subcontracting in connection with major tool, die and engineering projects within other Divisions of the Corporation and at the Technical Center is an extremely complex subject. The different types of such work being subcontracted, time constraints imposed upon completion, facilities limitations and the variety of ways such work is handled among such other Corporation Divisions all add to the complexity of this subject. The Corporation stated that tool, die and engineering shops in other Divisions are primarily equipped and staffed to provide maintenance and service Io productive operations. To provide individual

notice oi each subcontract would be complex and burdensome, therefore, the parties focused their discussions on broader information concerning annual model programs and the introduction of major new products.
Accordingly, Headquarters representatives of such other Divisions and representatives of Technical Center facilities have expressed a willingness to meet with representatives of the GM Department of the International Union from time to time to discuss the nature and scope of major new product programs or annual model programs including major tool, die and engineering work oi the type normally and historically performed by represented employees that the Division anticipates subcontracting to non-General Motors sources. In the event a plant is responsible for its own major new product programs or annual model program plans, Local Management will meet with affected Local Union representatives for the purpose of reviewing such plans and provide summary minutes of the meeting.

During the current negotiations the parties discussed pre-apprentice training as one method of achieving our common goal of bringing a greater number of members oi minority groups and females into the apprentice training program. It is evident that we share a serious concern about the establishment of effective methods of achieving this desirable goal.
Accordingly, the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee, upon determining that a plant's skilled trades workforce is under-represented by minority groups and females, will consider matters pertaining to pre-apprentice training as it relates to achieving the above objective as well as approve any such training program for which points can be awarded under the GM-UAW Apprentice Selection Procedure.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During ihfi 1990 Negotiations, the Union expressed concern that in some instances the Management members of the Local Apprentice Committee did not possess sufficient skilled trades knowledge or experience to adequately discuss Apprentice training concerns. The Corporation advised the Union that most Local Apprentice Committees contain a Management member who has skilled trades experience.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
Subject: Job Security - Apprentice Training and Joumeyman/woman Development
During these negotiations, the Union and the Company acknowledged that skilled trades personnel provide vital support to operations, and that there is a direct relationship between the effectiveness oi skilled trades personnel and the success and viability of the operations they serve. Establishing new levels oi competence within the apprenticeable trades through training and retraining will permit the Union and the Corporation to pursue the critical objective of continuous improvement in quality, flexibility, operational effectiveness and, in turn, enhance job security.
Consistent with these discussions and in response to current skilled trades demographics, potential future retirements, and attrition, the Corporation has agreed to continue to place primary reliance on the GM-UAW Apprentice Program as the training source for future skilled tradesmen/women. Exceptions to this must be approved by the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee. Integral to this job security-related commitment would be actions to enhance the flexibility of both future apprentice graduates and cunent journeymen/women.
With regard to the expansion of the Apprentice Program, GM intends to continue to indenture apprentices Corporation-wide in the basic

apprenticeable trades. These additional apprentices will be added during the term of the 2003 National Agreement provided that qualified candidates can be found who meet all the selection criteria and affirmative action goals can be met. While the placement of apprentices will depend on a variety of business condition factors such as attrition, technological changes, business sector performance, future product plans and product allocation, the general economy, and sales and market trends, General Motors intends to pursue the objective to indenture (2,250) apprentices during the term of the 2003 National Agreement, and will make a good faith effort to increase the aggregate to (2,800). Requests for apprentices, the rate of placement, and forecasted requirements will continue to be reviewed by the National Parties consistent with other understandings regarding skilled trades job security.
It is understood that in cases where the above goals cannot be met, or there is an immediate need for Journeymen/women skills at a particular location, it may be necessary to hire Journeymen/women in place of the apprentices agreed upon in this letter. In that case, the Corporation will inform the International Union of the number of Journeymen/women hired and the reasons. Also, in these discussions the parties reviewed the need to give priority consideration to the placement of laid off skilled tradesmen/women (Journeymen/women, E.I.T.S., and Apprentices) as well as those currently assigned to Protected Status.
Furthermore, where changes in the type of operation, volume, product life cycle, or other reasons, have caused an excess number of Joumeymen/women in a particular Skilled Trade/classification and placement in their trade/classification is not possible, the parties will pursue, where feasible and practical, the retraining of Joumeymen/women to qualify them in another apprenticeable Skilled Trade in either their home plant or another GM facility, consistent with established Employee Placement Procedures. Such retraining could

It is anticipated that progress in the goals set forth in this letter will be reviewed periodically in regular atootingg of the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee. Progress will be reported annually to the Director of the GM Department of the UAV^and the Vice President - Labor Relations for General Motors, for review and adjustment where necessary.

Inter-Organization
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
Date: September 18,2003
Subject: Apprentice Work Assignments
To:	All Personnel Directors
Plants Covered by the GM-UAW National Agreement
During the current negotiations, the Union raised the question of apprentices being assigned to work alone. The parties agreed that good judgment and a rule of reason should be used when making these assignments.
As a result of these discussions it was concluded that, consistent with existing training methods and facilities in the plant, apprentices should not be assigned to perform work without a joumeyman/woman being present unless the apprentice has been trained to do the job: has been instructed in the proper safety procedures; and is considered competent to perform the assignment. Experienced journeymen/women will generally be available to assist the apprentice in many of the normal floor assignments until that level of competence has been reached. This will not change or restrict any mutually satisfactory local practices.
Specifically, during 2003 Negotiations, the Union raised concerns regarding apprentices assigned to work alone on "high risk" jobs, In this.regard.it is the Corporation's intent to assign work to apprentices consistent with the policy outlined above and, therefore, "high risk" jobs would not be an appropriate assignment to be performed alone. However, the definition of such "high risk" jobs is subject to the, approval of the respective Plant Safety Review Board.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
This will confirm the understanding reached during the current negotiations that within a reasonable period after a laid off apprentice, Employee-In-Training or Employee-In-Training-Seniority has been recalled to work at any General Motors Plant, such employee will be paid an incentive bonus in recognition of satisfactory completion of any related training courses, required pursuant to Paragraphs (145) and (180), in which the employee was enrolled at the time of layoff. In the event the employee is not recalled within a reasonable period of time, such employee may apply to the home plant for the related training bonus.
In addition, with prior Management approval and arrangements with the school, apprentices whom Management anticipates recalling to the apprentice classification prior to the expiration of the school term may be enrolled tor one term and become eligible for an incentive bonus on the same basis.
This incentive bonus will amount to a figure to be arrived at by multiplying the number of class hours in each course times the employee's straight-time hourly rate less the amount, if any, paid to the employee for such related training prior to layoff.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
During the current negotiations the parties discussed at length a problem encountered at some plant locations where employees-in-training and apprentices are in training to become journeymen/women in the same skilled trades classification and there is either a need for a reduction or increase in the number of such employees in a skilled trades classification.
The parties recognize the desirability of providing opportunities and training for employees through both the GM-UAW Standard Apprentice Program and the Employee-In-Training Program consistent with the needs of the business. To preserve the continuity of the Apprentice Program, which has generally been viewed as the long run source of skilled trades personnel in the apprenticeable classifications, the parties have negotiated appropriate provisions in the National Agreement to avoid unnecessary interruptions of the program. The Employee-In-Training Program is equally necessary and has been continued by the parties to supplement the journeyman/woman work force at times of increased work load and during shortages of skilled trades personnel. Importantly, the Employee-In-Training Program also provides opportunities for persons to upgrade their skills and provisions have been negotiated enabling employees-in-training to continue their training and achieve journeyman/woman status.
Employees-in-training may be reduced due to a reduction in force or displaced by a joumeyman/woman in accordance with Paragraph (174) or by an employee-

in-training-seniority in accordance with Paragraph (175). Apprentices may be reduced due to a reduction in force or displaced by journeymen/women in accordance with Paragraph (140a). In addition. Paragraph (140b) provides that in the event of a drastic reduction in the level of work resulting in a heavy reduction in the skilled trades work force, additional apprentices may be reduced pursuant to a mutually acceptable layoff and recall plan agreed upon by the local parties. Likewise, temporary layoff situations are governed by locally negotiated provisions pursuant to Paragraph (177).
Except for those situations covered by National Agreement provisions, the following procedure will apply to the reduction of employees-in-training and/or apprentices when neither journeymen/women nor employees-in-training-seniority are reduced from the classification:
Employees-in-training who have accumulated less than (2) years credited work experience in the classification in that plant will be reduced before any apprentice is reduced;
Employees-in-training who have accumulated (2) or more years of credited work experience in the classification in that plant will not be reduced before all apprentices who have not completed (4) periods of the shop training schedule have been reduced from that classification;
All employees-in-training in the classification will be reduced before any apprentice who has completed (4) periods of the shop training schedule is reduced.
The completion of (4) periods of the shop training schedule for apprentices and the credited work experience in the classification in that plant for employees-in-training for purposes of this procedure shall be based on a calculation made as of the last Monday of the month preceding the month during which such a reduction occurs.
LAYOFFS - APPRENTICES AND EMPLOYEES-IN-TRAINING
Similar consideration is to occur when there is a need to recall a number of employees to a classification where there are both employees-in-training and apprentices reduced from the classification.
Any complaints regarding the application of this procedure in any plant may be taken up with Local Management of that plant by the Local Shop Committee and if not resolved may be reviewed by the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee.

The Union recognizes that the work center will be for the use of designated Union representatives for the purpose only of handling internal Union affairs required by the National Agreement as they relate to the duties of their office. It is further understood that other employees may contact Union representatives in the work center during the non-work time of such employees,
"The size and location of the work center should be consistent with the use for which it is intended and shall be determined by the local management after consultation with the Chairperson of the Shop Committee.

We are interested as you are in providing facilities which enable all of these representatives to carry out their resjjonsibilities. As soon as practical after the effective date of this agreement, in the locations where there is insufficient room to accommodate these union representatives in the present facility local Management will expand it to make this accommodation. It is understood that at some of these locations where plant layout considerations are involved local Management may accommodate the need for additional room by relocating the facility or by providing a separate space in a suitable location for some of these union representatives. In that regard, at locations employing 600 or more employees a second desk and chair will be provided for benefit plans representatives. We will work with you and our divisions on any problems in this regard brought to our attention.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18, 2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
This will describe the methods to be used by NAO Compensation in regard to withholding of Federal income tax from employee's wages attributable to grievance awards, vacation pay and pay in lieu of vacation from employee's wages.
Grievance awards in excess of $500.00, but involving periods less than one calendar year, will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be calculated using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
Likewise, pay in lieu of vacation also will be treated as supplemental wages and income tax withholding will be withheld using the Federal income tax regulations regarding supplemental earnings.
It should be noted that the tax withholding referenced above only covers the Federal withholding amount. An amount for F1CA taxes and state or local income taxes, where applicable, will be in addition to the amount withheld for Federal income tax.
Grievance awards which are less than $500.00 will be aggregated with the regular payroll and the income tax withholding will be calculated on the total amount.
If a grievance award is made for a period of more than one calendar year, the income tax withholding will be calculated as if the payment were for a single annual period. Thus, in such situations, NAO Compensation
520
a:
will use the annual percentage table to calculate the income tax withholding for such awards. This method would be the same as considering the award as having been paid equally over the preceding 52 weeks.
For vacation payments made for time away from work, such payments will continue to be treated as a regular wage payment; i.e., income tax withholding will be calculated as if the vacation payment represented a regular weekly wage payment.
The above methods are dictated by Federal Income Tax Regulations. Therefore, any change or amendment to such Regulations will, of necessity, have to be reviewed for compliance with the above changes.
Formal procedures to effect these changes are being communicated to NAO Compensation by separate letter, with instructions to make these changes as soon as practical.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course of current negotiations, General Motors and the International Union, UAW reaffirmed the matter of Mr Earl R. Bramblett s letter of November 11,1970 regarding the problem of major plant arrangements and its possible impact on local agreements covering bargaining unit employees. The text of that tetter is as follows:
"During the course of the present negotiations, the International Union raised the problem of major plant rearrangement and its possible impact on local agreements covering bargaining unit employees.
"The International Union specifically cited the alterations and rearrangements which took place at Saginaw Manufacturing, Saginaw, Michigan and Fisher Body Euclid Plant at Cleveland, Ohio. At the Saginaw facility the total plant layout was rearranged, new machinery was added and the character of the plant was completely altered. The Fisher Body Plant at Cleveland experienced a drastic transition changing from an auto assembly plant to a trim manufacturing plant.
"In each of the above cited examples, work assignments, seniority rights and wage rates, were drastically affected. In one case it required the local parties to negotiate a new wage agreement, seniority agreement, shift preference and

'Wbsro there are such major changes in facilities, both parties agree that it is in their mutual interest torovfow the potential impact on local agreements with Uto objective of minimizing misunderstandings and reducing or eliminating possible disputes as far In advance of the event as practicable. Accordingly, tbo Corporation will discuss such situations with the International Union as far in advance as

OVERTIME POLICIES
Inter-Organization
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
Date:	September 18, 2003
Subject: Overtime Policies
To:	All General Managers
All Personnel Directors
As part of the current negotiations. General Motors informed the International Union, UAW that it is the Corporation's intention to continue its previous policy regarding overtime practices. This policy will be applicable only to those employees who are not covered by the provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Overtime.
There was considerable discussion in these negotiations about the claims of the International Union, UAW that too many employees who are required to work overtime over extended periods are not excused from overtime work assignments even though they have legitimate reasons to be excused.
The Corporation pointed out that overtime serves a number of functions essential to the effective operation of General Motors tightly integrated and interdependent manufacturing system. In many instances overtime must be worked at one or more plants in order to permit other plants to meet their schedules. Emergency overtime to repair breakdowns in essential equipment is often necessary to prevent or minimize interruptions in plant operations and resultant short work weeks for many employees. Overtime is also necessary on bottleneck jobs and also during certain times of the year in order to meet model change deadlines and to satisfy fluctuations in customer demand for General Motors products.
Both the International Union and the Corporation recognized that the nature of the business requires overtime work assignments. In many instances, however, less than a full complement in a supervisors group is needed to fill the jobs which are working
OVERTIME POLICIES
overtime. When less than a full complement of employees is needed it is usually practicable for the supervisor to excuse employees who do not wish to work and confine the overtime assignments to those employees who do wish to work.
In situations where there are sufficient employees available who wish to work overtime and who are capable of doing the overtime work assignments, employees who do not wish to work overtime are to be excused from doing so, insofar as practicable.
Employees who are required to work overtime should be given as much advance notice as is practicable so that they can make any personal arrangements that may be necessary.
An individual employee's personal problems in connection with working overtime should be given careful consideration and such individual needs should be recognized. The individual employee's request to be excused from an overtime work assignment, when made a reasonable period of time in advance, should receive every possible consideration. When the request is granted the employee will be notified as far in advance as possible so that the employee can make personal plans accordingly. Thereafter, any cancellation or change in the arrangements to excuse the employee will only be made by mutual consent. Except in situations of an emergency or crisis nature, an employee who is not assigned to a necessary continuous seven-day operation and who has worked thirteen consecutive calendar days will be excused from work on the next following Sunday provided the request for the day off has been made before the end of the employee's shift on the previous Friday.

2,	With respect to a day during which the plant attempts to operate but is forced to shutdown because of the absenteeism of employees, and forty percent (40%) or less of the employees scheduled to report for work on the shift have not reported to work prior to the shutdown, a SUBenefit shall be paid to otherwise eligible employees who reported for work but were sent home when the plant suspended operations; provided, however, that if the amount of such SUBenefit payable plus the pay for hours worked on such day equals less than the equivalent of 4 hours' pay, such employees shall be paid 4 hours' pay by the Corporation for such day (including pay for any hours worked) in lieu of such SUBenefit, as provided below. In calculating the SUBenefit, credit should be taken as Available Hours for any period between the starting time of the employees' regular shift and the time they reported for work.
526
(a)	Employees who report for work during the first 4 hours of their regular shift on a day the plant has attempted to operate and subsequently shuts down, shall receive a SUBenefit for any hours not worked or made available during the period between the time they reported for work and the end of their regular shift; provided, however, that if the amount of such SUBenefit payable plus the pay for any hours worked on such day equals less than the equivalent of 4 hours' pay, the employee shall be paid 4 hours' pay by the Corporation for such day (including their pay for any hours worked) in lieu of such SUBenefit.
With respect to an otherwise eligible employee who reports for work during the last 4 hours of their regular shift, a SUBenefit shall be payable for any hours not worked or made available during the period between the time they reported for work and the end of their regular shift and the minimum 4 hours' pay provisions shall not apply.
(b)	In addition to the provisions of 2(a) above, if overtime hours occur during the week in which the only day(s) of layoff is a day on which the plant attempted to operate but subsequently shutdown due to employee absenteeism, the SUBenefit for otherwise eligible employees shall be calculated with respect to the week. The SUBenefit amount, if any, plus the pay for any hours worked on such day(s) shall be measured against the minimum 4 hours' pay provision, if applicable, for such day(s).
However, if overtime hours occur during a week having 2 or more days of layoff, including at least one such day on which the plant attempted to operate but subsequently shutdown due to employee absenteeism, the overtime hours may only be applied to reduce
527

WEATHER CONDITIONS 4 RIOT LETTER
hours of layoff on days other than such days on which the plant attempted to operate.
Consequently, a separate SUBenefit shall be calculated for each such day on which the plant attempted to operate, and the amount of such SUBenefit, if any, plus the pay for any hours worked on such day shall be measured against the minimum 4 hours’ pay provision, if applicable. If a SUBenefit is payable for such day, it shall be included and paid with any SUBenefit otherwise payable for the remainder of the week; provided, however, that the sum of such SUBenefits cannot exceed the SUBenefit, if any, that would otherwise be payable under the Plan for the Week.
(c)	A SUBenefit shall not be paid to employees for a day when the plant was attempting to operate if such employees failed to report for work at any time during such day. The total number of hours of the employees' regular shift for such day (8 hours in most cases) will be included as hours made available but not worked in the calculation of any SUBenefit otherwise payable for the week.
3.	With respect to a day during which the plant attempts to operate but is forced to shutdown because of the absenteeism of employees and more than forty percent (40%) of the employees scheduled to report for work on the shift have not reported to work prior to the shutdown, the facts and circumstances of the local situation will be reviewed with the Employee Benefits Section of the Personnel Administration and Development Staff and a determination shall be made by the Personnel Administration and Development Staff with respect to any additional SUBenefit eligibility beyond the eligibility provided under item "2." above. Where no additional SUBenefit eligibility is authorized, the provisions and procedures under item "2.” above
528
WEATHER CONDITIONS & RIOT LETTER
will be followed. If additional SUBenefit eligibility is authorized, the following will apply.
(a)
(b)
Employees who report to work at any time during their shift shall have all hours worked or paid for such day disregarded in calculating Compensated or Available Hours for the Week and shall be deemed to be on qualified layoff for the shift.
Employees who did not report for work at any time during their shift shall be deemed to have been on qualified layoff for all of the day in calculating any SUBenefit otherwise payable for the Week.
The minimum 4-hours' pay provisions shall apply to all employees who report to work during the first four hours of their shift.
The foregoing SUB Plan determinations with respect to a day when the plant attempts to operate during severe weather conditions or during an actual or threatened riot apply only in situations where the plant is subsequently forced to shutdown because of employee absenteeism. If the plant shuts down early or employees are sent home for any reason other than employee absenteeism, eligible employees should be paid SUBenefits with respect to any period of qualified layoff to which they may be entitled under the Plan and the minimum 4 hours' pay provisions shall not be applicable.
4.	With respect to a day during which the plant operates in an area in which severe weather conditions or an actual or threatened riot have occurred and more than forty percent (40%) of employees scheduled to report for work on the shift do not report to work at any time during their shift, the facts and circumstances of the local situation will be reviewed with the Employee Benefits Section of the Personnel Administration and Development Staff and a determination shall be made by the Personnel Administration and Development Staff with respect to any SUBenefit eligibility for any

employee for such day. If the determination does not authorize any SUBenefits then no SUBenefit eligibility will be determined under the provisions of this letter. If a determination is made to authorize SUBenefit eligibility for the shift, such eligibility and SUBenefit calculation shall be made in accordance with item "3." above.
In determining whether a plant shall attempt to operate during such severe weather conditions or during a riot occurring in the plant area, consideration should be given to the severity of the condition, actions of other employers in the area, and instructions, advice or proclamations issued by local or other authorities. Employees who are unable to get to work due to a "BAN" on driving will be considered on Qualified Layoff for 8 hours for the day. "BAN" means that under a local law/ordinance which is proclaimed to be in effect through a public safety announcement, that persons caught driving in a specified area (through which employees had no alternative but to travel to get to work on regular shift) will be ticketed, fined and/or jailed. Documentation of such public safety announcement is required from, and on behalf of, the employee(s) involved.
During the 1967 negotiations, it was understood by the parties that the Union's agreement with the Company SUB Plan determination to be followed with respect to a plant shutdown in an area in which severe weather conditions or an actual or threatened riot have occurred, as set forth in this letter, will in no way jeopardize or limit employee s right of appeal under the Plan to any such Company determination.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:

General Motors Department
Detroit, Michigan 48214
During these negotiations, the parties discussed at length issues that have arisen regarding the application of Local Wage Agreements in the Corporation's passenger car and truck assembly plants. The parties reviewed differences that currently exist in the Local Wage Agreements at such plants resulting from the different history of these plants, such as whether the plant was initially a BOP Division bargaining unit or separate Fisher Body and Chevrolet bargaining units that were subsequently merged into a single GM Assembly Division bargaining unit. These historical differences have resulted in some wage rate variations which the parties have attempted to address in previous negotiations. Likewise, plants engaged in various manufacturing operations have different Local Wage Agreement histories which resulted in classification structures that are not compatible with modem manufacturing methods and organizational
In recognition that continuing improvements in the employee's quality of work life, quality of the product, and operational efficiencies are necessary and desirable, the parties have explored various methods to improve the wage structure at the Corporation's plants of the Car and Truck Groups and other operating
The parties agreed that innovative wage agreements could be instrumental in attaining these objectives and,
INNOVATIVE WAGE STRUCTURE
accordingly, the National parties have agreed to work with and support any plant where there exists a mutual desire to explore such a concept.
Although not meant to restrict the full range of ideas and concepts which could be explored, the parties examined the concept of establishing three (3) nonskilled rates in an assembly plant; sanitation/maintenance, production, and utility. It was understood that appropriate transfer, seniority, shift preference, and other modifications are desirable and necessary to support such an innovative wdge structure. This concept would be only one of the options available to a plant that desired to explore innovative wage structures. "Levels of Learning" or "Pay For Knowledge" systems would also be options to be considered.
If at any local plant there is a mutual desire on the part of Management and Union to explore any such innovative wage agreement concepts, they are specifically encouraged and authorized to discuss and propose such modifications. The National parties will provide any necessary assistance to the local Union and the local Plant Management. Any final agreement shall continue to be subject to the approval of the National parties, who will review these proposals in line with the concepts outlined in this letter.

GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18, 2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
During the current negotiations. General Motors and the International Union, UAW, discussed the problem of "seniority slippage" under Paragraph (69) which inhibits bargaining unit employees from accepting assignments to fill supervisory positions. It was recognized that in many instances it would be of mutual benefit to the parties for these employees to function in such positions.
Accordingly, this letter serves to confirm the agreement reached between the National parties that:
1.	The transfer of any employee from a job classification in the bargaining unit to a supervisory position will result in the recall of a seniority employee from layoff status, if available, consistent with the provisions of the J.O.B.S. Program, and/or;
2.	The transfer of an employee from a supervisory position back to the bargaining unit does not result in the layoff of a seniority employee;
Paragraph (69) of the National Agreement will be modified in the following manner;
(69) Any employee who has been transferred from a supervisory position to a job classification in the bargaining unit shall be credited with the seniority the employee had established prior to March 1,1977, all time worked in the bargaining unit subsequent to March 1, 1977, and all time worked in a supervisory


position subsequent to the effective date of this agreement provided:
(a)
(b)
They previously worked on a job classification in the bargaining unit. This shall also be applied to employees who were promoted prior to certification of the Union.
Their employment with the Corporation has remained unbroken.
Such employee may be placed on the job to which the employees seniority would entitle the employee under the local seniority agreement, beginning with the last previous job the employee held in the bargaining unit; provided however, that if such last previously held job is no longer in existence, the employee may be placed in accordance with Paragraph (59). In no’event shall such employee be transferred to a bargaining unit job at a time when the employee has insufficient seniority to be so placed.
In order to assure accurate and timely administration oi the conditions stated above in Paragraph (69) of the 1984 GM-UAW National Agreement, the following procedures will be instituted:
1.	When any employee is transferred from the bargaining unit to a supervisory position, the Chairperson of the Local Union's Shop Committee will be given a letter specifying the employee's name and the name of the seniority employee who is recalled from layoff status.
2.	When such supervisory employee, specified above, is returned to a job classification in the bargaining unit, the Chairperson of the Local Union's Shop Committee will be given a letter, notifying the Chairperson of such transfer back into the bargaining unit.

MODIFICATION TO PARAGRAPH 69
Any complaints regarding the administration of this procedure may be raised by the Chairperson of the Shop Committee directly with the Plant Personnel Director.

If the leftmost oi the digits discarded is less than 5, the preceding digit is not affected. For example, when rounding to four digits. 130.646 becomes 130.6.
If the leftmost of the digits discarded is greater than 5, or is 5 followed by digits not all of which are zero, the preceding digit is increased by one. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.557 becomes 130.6.
If the leftmost of the digits discarded is 5, followed by zeros, the preceding digit is increased by one if it is odd and remains unchanged if it is even. The number is thus rounded in such a manner that the last digit retained is even. For example, when rounding to four digits, 130.5500 becomes 130.6 and 130.6500 becomes 130.6.

The Union was concerned that if an employee was credited with a full week of vacation time off under this situation, the employee would not be able to receive the employee's full vacation time off as contemplated in the Vacation Entitlement Section.
The Corporation recognizes the desirability of providing vacation time off up to the employee's eligibility for vacation entitlement as of the end of the cunent eligibility year. Accordingly, the Union was advised that in situations described above an employee would be eligible for an additional day of absence for vacation purposes to be scheduled in accordance with local practice.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the discussions that led to the 1990 Collective Bargaining Agreement, the parties held lengthy discussions regarding the grievance procedure and its proper implementation. Both parties acknowledged that the Grievance Procedure has worked well over the years in resolving problems when it was properly administered as outlined in the National Agreement.
The Union claimed that in some instances, the Grievance Procedure provisions have not been properly applied relative to the intent ot the National Agreement. Specifically, the Union remarked that at some locations, grievances were allowed to accumulate at the various steps of the Grievance Procedure and/or were not answered in a timely manner at the lower steps of the procedure. The Union further claimed that in some cases Management representatives were not available for or were unwilling to schedule regular grievance meetings. The Corporation stated their concern that at times, Union Representatives demanded answers to grievances before Management had an opportunity to investigate the charges contained in the grievance.
As a result of the foregoing, the parties reviewed the contents of Document No. 44 and Document No, 45 and reaffirmed their mutual desire and intention to assure that grievances will not be unduly delayed nor allowed to accumulate at any step in the Grievance Procedure in any plant. Furthermore, it was recognized that both parties have the responsibility to meet regularly on

grievances in accordance with the terms of the National Agreement and that such meetings should not be postponed or delayed unnecessarily. In this regard, the parties agreed that complaints in this area will be handled under the provisions of Paragraph (5a) of the National Agreement, Before such problems are referred from the plant, however, the situation will be discussed between the Chairperson of the Shop Committee, the President of the Local Union and the Regional Servicing Representative, and the Plant Manager and Personnel Director.

During the course of the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern that some disciplinary interviews escalated into confrontation because tempers flared. The Union suggested that in these situations a "Cooling Off" period would be beneficial to all concerned.
The Corporation and the International Union agreed that contemplated discipline should be discussed in a calm manner allowing for an objective evaluation of the facts. In those situations where emotions preclude this from happening, the parties agreed that as a matter of practice and when possible such discussions should be postponed until such time that, in the opinion of Management, a constructive exchange of information could occur.
Notwithstanding the foregoing the parties recognized that certain actions such as assault, or other serious acts of misconduct would render the "cooling off" period totally inappropriate.
Additionally, it was mutually recognized that providing or not providing a "cooling off" period will be without prejudice to either party in the application of any terms

SUBCONTRACTING COMMUNICATIONS
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18, 2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr, Shoemaker:
During the recent negotiations, there were discussions concerning subcontracting which resulted from inadequate communication about such matters. As a result of these talks. Management reaffirmed the commitment which was made in an A. S. Warren, Jr. letter to General Managers in 1987 that reads as follows:
"During the current agreement we have experienced many labor relations problems in the plants in handling subcontracting matters. There were several five day letters and strikes and other major problems finally settled just short of the issuance of five day letters by the UAW.
"In many of these instances the root cause of the problem is lack of communication. Inadequate communication has occurred at the Group level with International Union representatives and at the Divisional and local plant level as well. The GM-UAW National Agreement currently requires timely meetings in advance of the decision to subcontract work normally and historically performed by General Motors skilled trades employees. I am informed, however, that some meetings relative to major die construction and die tryout are not held at all or not in advance of the subcontracting associated with the program.
'In addition, plant level meetings with local union representatives relative to routine maintenance
553


554

&&&&&
SUBCONTRACTING COMMUNICATIONS
contracting are often held after the contract has been let and insufficient useful information is provided to the union for them to consider and make appropriate comments relative to Management's plans.
"The Corporation intends to achieve world wide competitive status utilizing not only the skills of our employees but also the suggestions and ideas of the people and the unions as to how work can best be accomplished at the lowest possible cost with the highest possible quality and on time.
"This approach to managing the business should be utilized throughout the Corporation at all levels: production, skilled and technical. Obviously such discussions should be held in a timely manner with appropriate management and union personnel.
“Accordingly, please assure that an appropriate representative of management in each personnel department is responsible for having adequate information about each subcontract for the performance of skilled trades work covered by the subcontracting provisions of the agreement. After determining that required discussions have been held this representative would approve the contract prior to its being let to an outside firm. This will require complete understanding and cooperation of our contractual requirements by the plant's engineering and purchasing personnel.
“The restructuring of General Motors has resulted in different people and a variety of teams now having responsibility for advance model die construction. Please assure that all executives or others involved with product teams are made aware of our contractual requirements. A specific member of each team should be given the responsibility of informing the personnel director well in advance of the actual beginning of die construction. The objective is to enable the personnel director to inform the union in advance of any impact on the bargaining unit in accordance with Document 59 in the National Agreement.

SUBCONTRACTING COMMUNICATIONS
"There are numerous examples where complete, advance communications with the union and the skilled trades employees has resulted in important projects being completed on a competitive basis in terms of quality, cost and timeliness. The result has been a feeling of pride of accomplishment shared by the union, employees and the managers.
"Plant relationships can only be improved by open, frank communications in all areas, particularly in carrying out our subcontracting responsibilities.
“Mr. Stempel and the Executive Committee are in complete agreement that extraordinary attention must be given to our managerial responsibilities in this area. ■ I have been assured by the International Union that we will have the full assistance of the GM Department Staff in bringing about improved plant relationships when we have installed full, advance communications relative to business decisions involving subcontracting."
Furthermore, with regard to tool, die and represented engineering work, including prototype, pre-prototype and Die Engineering Services work, several local Managements and Unions have implemented a process of advanced notification, review, and competitive analysis which has enabled the parties to consider and serve the interest of skilled tradespersons in job security, as well as Managements' needs for competitive and timely performance of this kind of work. Therefore, the Corporation and the International Union are in agreement that they will encourage other locations to implement this approach in order to avoid conflicts over the subcontracting of such work.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The following is the text of General Motors written and published policy regarding sexual harassment.
"General Motors has had for many years a written and widely distributed policy on equal opportunity employment. Sexual harassment, as in the case of harassment based on age, race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation has long been regarded as a violation of this policy.
"All employees are expected to deal fairly and honestly with one another to ensure a work environment free of intimidation and harassment. Abuse of the dignity of anyone, through ethnic, racist or sexist slurs or through other derogatory or objectionable conduct, is offensive employee behavior. Sexual harassment also includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.
"All GM employees are entitled to a work environment in which words and actions do not have even the appearance of disrespect. Sexually-oriented jokes, cartoons, pictures, language, certain gestures and touching may be offensive to people and, therefore, may result in a hostile work environment. This type of conduct will not be tolerated in the workplace. General Motors facilities must be free of hostility resulting from sexually-oriented behavior. It is the responsibility of management and each employee to maintain an environment free of hostility.
GM POLICY REGARDING SEXUAL HARASSMENT
*As in the case of other unfair employment practices, if you believe you have been subjected to sexual harassment, you may bring your concerns to the attention of either your immediate supervisor, personnel director, representative, or union representative, or you may utilize appropriate and existing internal complaint procedures."
General Motors and the UAW are in agreement that complaints of sexual harassment should be dealt with promptly and fairly under existing internal procedures as provided under Paragraph (6a) of the National Agreement.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations the Union complained there has been inconsistent administration of the "normal warranty" provisions of Paragraph 183(b) of the National Agreement. The Union indicated that plant managements insist on warranties beyond normal periods of time and that our skilled employees are not assigned to the new equipment or machinery until long after it has been in the plant. This does not provide the opportunity for our own skilled trades to learn how to keep such equipment operating effectively.
The Corporation informed the Union that good business practice includes the use of warranty arrangements sufficient to assure that the equipment purchased by the Corporation performs according to specifications required by the purchase contract.
The parties agreed that many locations through cooperative efforts such as assigning UAW-GM employees with vendors during installation and servicing, progressive training arrangements both onsite and offsite, etc. have resolved all their problems attendant to this issue. The Corporation and the International Union encourage each local union and local management to pursue such reasonable working agreements.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course of national negotiations, the parties held extensive discussions on issues involving the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). One of the issues discussed concerned utilization of TAP benefits to obtain educational credit for certain in-plant training. In this regard the parties agreed as follows:
In instances where employees, by virtue of their job assignment, are being provided with technical or professional training, the parties will jointly work with local recognized degree granting institutions to determine the possibility of obtaining credit for such training. Such credit would be applied toward recognized degree requirements only if the employee so desires. Additionally it is anticipated that costs for such credits will not normally equate to full credit hour charges at the institutions involved. Some examples of circumstances under which this understanding would be utilized are training programs associated with Health and Safety or Employee Assistance Program assignments and applicable Center for Human Resources Developed Training Courses.

September 18,2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations the parties discussed the need for basic educational opportunities and training through existing in-plant or other dedicated, accessible and adequate facilities approved by the Local Joint Activities Committee. The parties agreed to continue their emphasis on basic educational opportunities and training while ensuring that employees and their spouses and retirees continue to have access to education and training opportunities for basic skills in areas such as math, reading, problem solving or language. The parties are expressly interested in assisting employees and their spouses and retirees who want to master new skills and achieve personal goals in basic education. In this regard, it was agreed that the National Joint Skill Development and Training Committee will continue to identify basic education curriculum in six main areas of educational counseling and learning opportunities:
•	Adult Basic Education - provides an emphasis on skill building in the areas of reading, writing, language and mathematics.
•	General Education Development - provides the opportunity to prepare for a high school equivalency exam for those who have not earned a high school diploma.
° Educational Enrichment Services - provides the opportunity to sharpen skills in areas such as

SKILL CENTERS - TRAINING IN PLANT
math, writing, reading comprehension, communication, problem solving and science, which can assist participants in technical training, college courses, or other personal goals.
•	High School Completion - provides the necessary instruction in subject areas required to complete a high school diploma.
•	English as a Second Language - provides instruction in speaking and writing the English language for participants whose native tongue is not English.
•	Academic Advising Services - provides individualized academic advising services to participants to assist them in identifying and pursuing basic education goals through project educational staffs.
The basic education curriculum and any enhancements would continue to be developed through the coordinated efforts of Local Joint Activities Committees (LJAC) along with local education providers and approved by the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources.
It is essential that training and educational services offered in Skill Centers will be jointly monitored, analyzed, and extensively researched to better meet the needs of the workforce and keep the curriculum current.
In this process, the parties agreed to develop changes or enhancements in the curriculum to meet the needs of the workforce. Additionally, the parties agreed to insure that employees and their spouses and retirees have access to education and training opportunities offered in Skill Centers to meet the challenges of the information age.
In developing these changes the parties will solicit ' input from plants, Groups/Divisions, Local Educational ■ Agencies, and other sources external to UAW-GM, regarding what changes are deemed appropriate in the'' . Skill Center curriculum and administration.

569

SKILL CENTERS - TRAINING IN PLANT
The program design may vary from one UAW/GM location to another, but generally will focus on the individuals, adapting to the different interests, abilities, and work schedules of the participants including:
*	Individual Needs Assessments
•	Individual Instructional Plan
•	Individual and Small Group Instruction
•	Computer-Aided and Computer-Managed Instruction
•	Instruction in Diverse Subject Area, and
•	Participant Anonymity
Hardware, software and training materials used in the above mentioned computer-aided and computermanaged instruction are subject to approval by the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources.
These Skill Centers create an environment which allows education opportunities to be more accessible within a positive environment. Project services would be integrated and coordinated with other personal development, educational and training activities in each location. Project staff will be made available at times that are convenient for workers including before and after shifts, breaks and lunchtimes.
The above educational pursuits will be supported by a combination of national, local and plant training funds and will be jointly administered by the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources and the Local Joint Activities Committee. In addition, these facilities may be used for other appropriate training approved by the Local Joint Activities Committee.
If a plant constituting a local bargaining unit is scheduled to be idled or closed, the local parties will notify the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources of their proposed plan to alter Skill Center services for participants enrolled in the plant's Skill Center.

The Corporation advised, however, that they intend to rely on the apprenticeable skilled trades classifications as the basis for our skilled classification structure moving forward.

Given recent improvements in the area oi job security, the need tor such stringent work rules and delineation oi job responsibilities has been reduced.
Therefore, the National parties concur that local Management and local Unions will be strongly encouraged to review existing work rules and practices, especially in the area of Lines of Demarcation, to insure that only those necessary to protect the safety of employees, the integrity of the skilled trades, and the efficiency of operation in today's competitive environment are carried forward. Incidental, overlapping, and other minor access type work is atrongly encouraged, and should be discussed and handled locally consistent with sound business judgment. To accomplish this task, the local parties will establish a Lines of Demarcation Committee, to meet on a regular basis, to address the issues outlined in this paragraph.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the 1990 Negotiations, the Union expressed concerns relative to the assignment of work at certain locations by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which the Union felt should have been assigned to the respective UAW bargaining unit. In this regard, the Corporation agreed to reissue the B. P. Crane. Jr. letter dated February 20, 1986, the text of which follows:
"General Motors and Electronic Data Systems entered into a contractual agreement which defines the business relationship between the two entities. Under the terms of this agreement, EDS has assumed world wide responsibility for the management, operation, provision and maintenance of computer and information processing services, communication services and health care administration activities for GM. EDS remains and continues to be operated as an independent subsidiary of GM. It is also the intent of the parties that the GM User Organization continues to be the customer of EDS.
"As such, it is of particular importance to bear in mind that EDS, under the terms of this business agreement, remains separate and distinct. It becomes, in part, our responsibility to offer assistance in the successful operation of this relationship. Specifically, this relates to our acknowledging the fact that EDS is not a party to our National and Local agreements with the unions
582

EDS WORK ASSIGNMENTS
representing General Motors employees. EDS does recognize the historical nature of GM job functions and agrees that those job functions associated with manufacturing processes, which have been historically performed by GM hourly personnel, should continue to be performed by bargaining unit employees.
"We can relate this to a case in point • the installation and maintenance of the new voice communication system. The role that EDS plays in this situation is the traditional role of the local telephone company. Structural preparation remains the responsibility of General Motors and is most often accomplished utilizing bargaining unit employees. The other job functions associated with this voice communication system, in most cases, are not functions historically performed by our bargaining unit and are, therefore, the responsibility of EDS.
"Also, our understanding concerning bargaining unit work does not limit the fulfillment of warranty obligations by vendors. Such warranty obligations and/or other work performed by employees of an outside contractor, including EDS employees will be handled pursuant to the provisions of the collective bargaining agreements pertaining to outside contracting, where applicable.
"In summary, we have had several meetings with EDS to discuss our mutual concerns. We have arrived at an understanding assuring the continuation of historical practices as they relate to General Motors job functions associated with manufacturing processes. We feel that this position is lair and will best accomplish our joint goals and recognizes the traditional role of bargaining unit employees.
"As always, I appreciate your comments and. suggestions. Please refer any questions to your contact person on the Labor Relations Staff."
583

EOS WORK ASSIGNMENTS

During the 1993 Negotiations, the Union raised several instances wherein they felt that EDS misapplied the concepts outlined in the above letter, oftentimes when there was a change in local Account Managers, and specifically with regard to the applicable notification requirements outlined in the subcontracting provisions oi the National Agreement. The Corporation observed that much of the work at issue is non-core in nature, but reiterated its intent to continue the concepts outlined in the B. P. Crane, Jr. letter.
Furthermore, necessary arrangements will be made to review these concepts and contractual commitments with all EDS Account Managers.
During the 1996 Negotiations, the parties discussed the ongoing relationship between GM and EDS. The Corporation confirmed that EDS is no longer an independent subsidiary of GM.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed and noted that in many instances the early indicators of an employee suffering from medical and personal problems such as those associated with substance abuse, for example, are manifested in disciplinary situations involving violations of the Shop Rules. In those initial stages it is generally the first line supervisor and the district committeeperson who are first exposed to the potential of such underlying causes behind employee behavioral problems.
Although the parties acknowledge Management's responsibility to maintain discipline and to invoke disciplinary measures where violations of the Shop Rules occur, it is also recognized that local management and union representatives at all levels are necessarily charged with the responsibility to exercise their best efforts toward the objective of early identification of employees whose behavioral problems may be linked to medical and personal causes and to strongly encourage them to seek assistance. In many cases this could be accomplished through referral to the local Work/Family Program Committee.

Dear Mr, Shoemaker:
Subject: POW7MIA Flags
During the current negotiations, the Union requested that General Motors facilities fly POW/MIA flags. As discussed, flying of flags at General Motors locations is a matter of Corporate policy.
In view of the special sensitivity associated with Vietnam era MIA and POW issues, the Corporation indicated a willingness to consider exceptions to its normal policy on flags when so requested by a Local Union. These exceptions may include: individual special requests, special days recognized by the U. S. government to honor or remember POWs or MI As, or other appropriate holidays such as Memorial Day and Veterans Day.
It is understood that this matter is one of Corporate policy and if revisions to the policy are made, the Union will be notified.

GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the 1390 negotiations the parties discussed both the Union's and Management's concerns about the scheduling of overtime work in Genera] Motors.
1%
On the one hand Management recognized the legitimacy of the Union's concern that production not be scheduled on a sustained basis on overtime rather than recalling laid off employees or hiring new employees. On the other hand, the Union recognized that the scheduling of overtime serves an essential purpose in many situations in order to meet temporary or seasonal increases in sales, at new model start-up. and to make up (or production lost due to factors beyond the parties' control, such as interruptions in the supply of parts. Also the parties recognize the need for overtime on vital tooling and maintenance projects which often must be accomplished quickly on tight time schedules in order to avoid interruptions or delays in production and layoffs of production employees.
.As a result of these discussions, the parties agreed to establish a procedure for regularly reviewing overtime work schedules. This review will be accomplished between representatives of General Motors Corporation ' and the International Union, UAW and will be designed to focus on those plants and facilities that establish a pattern ol high overtime scheduling on a sustained basis. The review is intended to assure that overtime work is not scheduled at a plant on an ongoing basis in cases where there are practical and economical
OVERTIME
alternatives. The alternatives to overtime considered by the parties may include employment increases, innovative shift arrangements, or improvements or additions to the plant's equipment which could eliminate a bottleneck; or the parties may conclude that the reasons for the overtime are temporary or unavoidable and that there are no practical or economical alternatives.
The purpose of this review procedure is to assure a timely and thorough review of overtime work schedules and provide for a balanced consideration of the interests of both parties.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker
This is to confirm our understanding that the Pre-Retirement Leave Program set forth in Document No. 117 in the National Agreement and as implemented in the March 25,1991 implementation document, shall be renewed for the duration of the 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The renewal shall be on the same terms and conditions except that eligibility shall be limited to employees who would be eligible for a regular early retirement based on attaining 30 years of service within twenty-four (24) months of participating in a pre-retirement leave. Upon attainment of 30 years of service, the participating employee will retire. The National JOBS Committee is authorized to make jointly approved modifications to the program, as necessary.
Employees on pre-retirement leaves are considered to be Protected employees under the JOBS Program and will receive the same insurance benefits.

During these negotiations, the parties agreed that the principle of replacing attritions of eligible employees would be continued in this Agreement as the general rule. In addition, it was recognized that exceptions to this concept are appropriate in unusual situations. For example, if a location has a large number of Protected employees who cannot be effectively utilized, yet more Protected employees would be required because of the replacement concept, it may be appropriate not to do so.
Accordingly, this will confirm our understanding that the National JOBS Committee is specifically empowered to investigate unique situations and evaluate requests for full attritional credit at a particular location, and implement mutually satisfactory adjustments to Appendix K, Section II (El-

jointly sponsor conferences, workshops, seminars and meetings to promote cooperative efforts on related subjects, and where appropriate, invite academic, prtufessional, government, labor and industry representatives to attend and participate. In addition, we understand that while these funds are intended for education, training and development of UAW bargaining unit employees, there are situations where - it will be natural for some salaried employees to receive the same training or participate in the same program. Such expenses for non-bargaining unit X—employees may be funded with joint funds provided the parties agree.
Further, the jointly sponsored projects, programs and activities are designed to promote public awareness of General Motors products (including the quality and reliability of such products), General Motors workforce and its role in producing high quality products, and the relationship between General Motors and the collective bargaining representatives for General Motors _ employees.
"-^£2. We also recognize that as representatives of organizations such as the UAW and General Motors, which are viewed by most as key to the vibrancy of many local economies and the national economy, we are expected to be responsible citizens and caring neighbors. Therefore, from time to time we have agreed to use these funds to assist the victims of disaster or the less fortunate in the communities where our employees live and work. We have also supported research projects or efforts by other training, educational or cultural institutions which will through education and exposure promote our goals of labor and management cooperation in the workplace.
We have pledged that these joint funds will continue to be used to enhance all our employees involvement in.

We have managed to find common ground on many of the issues involved in these negotiations. Nowhere has that been more evident than in our mutual treatment of J issues involving education and training and other programs of joint interest to better our employees and enhance their job security by strengthening the	,
competitive position of General Motors. Our	1

In this regard, cooperative labor relations with respect to the joint arena can be accomplished only when activities are jointly approved, developed.	!
implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Furthermore, decisions must be arrived at in a setting which is characterized by the parties working together in an ( atmosphere of trust; making mutual decisions at all j levels of administration which respect the concerns and —' interests of the parties involved; sharing responsibility for the problem solving process; and sharing the rewards of common goals.
In these negotiations, we have provided funding for our joint programs which reflect this national policy of cooperative labor relations. We should continue to ensure that the projects, programs and events which are supported in whole or in part with these joint funds do in fact keep us communicating on all levels, consistent with this objective.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
Subject: Compliance with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993. The Corporation assured the Union that it will comply with the provisions of the FMLA.
As part of its compliance, the Corporation has established a category of unpaid leave called "FMLA Leave." In some instances, FMLA Leaves will be concurrent with leaves of absence covered by the National Agreement. Accordingly, in those cases where the employee is eligible for leave under the National Agreement and the leave also qualifies under the FMLA, the Corporation intends to comply with the requirements of the FMLA as well as the separate provisions of the National Agreement regarding covered leaves of absence.
Pursuant to the Corporation's present plan for compliance with the FMLA, the Corporation's rights under the Act will be modified to:
•	Provide that an employee on FMLA Leave will continue to accumulate seniority in the same manner as an employee on a Personal Leave of Absence;
•	Permit but not require employees to substitute vacation and/or excused absence allowance for unpaid FMLA Leave;
COMPLIANCE WITH FMLA
Provide that employees who are married to each other will be each entitled to a maximum of 12 weeks of qualifying leave under the Act;
Provide that, when a third opinion is necessary under the medical certification and dispute resolution sections of the FMLA, the neutral provider will be selected jointly by the Corporation and the Union, with the consent of the employee, from a list, provided by the appropriate local or state professional medical association, of board-certified specialists in the field of medicine in which the point of controversy exists;
Continue Corporation-paid Group Life, Accidental Death and Dismemberment, and Disability Insurance during all FMLA Leaves that are not also Medical Leaves as if such leaves were Personal Leaves of Absence.
•	Not automatically designate and apply absence time that is compensated under the Sickness and Accident Insurance provisions of the Life, Disability and Health Care Benefits Program against an eligible employee's FMLA entitlement:
•	Use. a calendar year as the I2-month period of the leave entitlement (for example: in 2000, an employee would be eligible for 12 weeks leave from January 1, through December 31, 2000);
•	Require repayment of the cost of health care coverage provided during the leave from employees who fail to return from FMLA Leave to the extent permitted by law.
Tbo Corporation may make changes in its compliance piano to reflect changes in regulations and/or aabaoquenl court decisions and the gaining of additional administrative experience but without csArcing leaves provided by the Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker ! Vice President and Director ’ General Motors Department j International Union, UAW 18000 East Jefferson Avenue • Detroit, Michigan 48214
( Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The parties to this agreement recognize the critical impact outsourcing proposals have on the parties' relationship at both the National and local level. In this regard, when potential outsourcing is under consideration, the local parties should have sufficient time to evaluate the proposal to insure that they have the opportunity to develop a plan to retain the work. During the discussions leading to the current Agreement, the sourcing process was modified to provide a more meaningful role for the Union in sourcing decisions through involvement in the request for quotation process. Under this process, which provides for earlier involvement, the Union will generally have as much time to evaluate methods to retain the work as the 150 day notification process provided under the 1993 National Agreement. In those instances where it is anticipated that less than 150 days will be required to complete the sourcing process, the Chairperson of the Shop Committee will be so advised.
SOURCING EVALUATION
However, in such instances where the Union believes that insufficient time has been provided for input into a pending sourcing decision, the matter should be referred to the National Sourcing Committee for further discussion.

Retirees will be required to complete the proper registration process (physician consent form, liability waiver, etc.) that active employees are required to complete in line with UAW-GM fitness center guidelines.
It is also understood that nothing contained herein or in existing or future statements concerning employee fitness centers or steps taken to implement its programs and related services shall be construed or interpreted as constituting a waiver of either the Corporation's or the Union's rights or responsibilities under the National Agreement, nor are the centers intended in any way to create for any employee or retiree an enforceable obligation against the Corporation, the Union, or their representatives.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
Subject: Supplier Corporate Citizenship
During these negotiations, the UAW stated its interest in having the Corporation continue to recognize the importance of using suppliers which are good corporate citizens and which can be relied upon for quality products and reliable delivery. The UAW further pointed out that the Corporation's selection of and relationship with suppliers have a significant bearing on its relationship with the Union. In this regard, the Union stressed repeatedly the importance of the Corporation's use of high quality, reliable suppliers which maintain good, fair and equitable relations with their employees, and which satisfy the Corporations need for a continMOug.
supply of qualify carts and materials.
General Motors fully understands the Union's concerns in these matters, because quality products, uninterrupted delivery and good corporate citizenship — by the Corporation and its suppliers — contribute significantly to the Corporation's success in the marketplace, and all of these factors have a direct bearing on the job and income security of UAW members. G-en£ral_M9toi§ .assured, the.Unionuthat.it would not take retaliatory action, such as canceling or refusing to renew contracts with suppliers, based on a decision of that supplier's employees to ioin a labor umoHu. Ths Corporation further stated-that .cll_suoh dsciaioos willsontinus-to-bo basadon quality* ssrase. technology and wstLUra Corporation, similarly recognizes the value of suppliers that have successful
SUPPLIER CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP relations with their employees and employsea representatives. General Motors agrees that its relationship with the Union is of paramount importance to the Corporation's long-term success. The Corporation has told its suppliers and the business community in the past of the positive aspects of its relationship with the UAW and will continue to do so in the future. General Motors, therefore, has no interest in embarking on a purchasing strategy that would detract from that relationship.
Correspondingly, the Union has, from time to time, expressed to the Corporation its concern about certain aspects of the Corporation s relationship with particular suppliers in the area of quality, continuity of supply, and overall performance as a supplier including the maintenance of good relations by the supplier with its employees. The Union recognizes that the Corporation has expressed its views and made suggestions to its suppliers as a result of the Union's concerns, all within the bounds of applicable legal principles.
The parties recognize that instances in which these matters arise are inherently dependent upon the particular facts that are present in each situation and plan to continue to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis as they have in the past, and in compliance with applicable laws.
In particular, the Corporation will continue to urge its suppliers to treat their employees in a good, fair and equitable manner to provide them wages and benefits competitive within their industry, to provide a safe workplace and to avoid conduct which violates national or state labor and employment laws. In addition, the Corporation will, in a manner which is in compliance with applicable laws, notify suppliers of the importance the Corporation places on harmonious relationships between suppliers, their employees and any union that may represent them.
The Corporation will send or transmit to each of its cunent suppliers a letter, in the form attached hereto

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the cunent negotiations, the parties discussed the need for joint programs to be made available to employees who are in transition centers as a result of a plant closing or a reduction in the workforce where recall or future GM placement is unlikely. Specifically, the discussions included programs as follows: Basic Skill Enhancement, College/Vocational Skill Enhancement, Financial Planning, Pre/Post-Retirement, Employability Skills and Layoff Services.
It was agreed that where a transition center(s) is jointly established, the Local Joint Activities Committee with the assistance of the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources will develop a plan for the implementation of joint programs. When developing the plan, the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources will seek input from the respective Group/Division Labor Relations Director and UAW-GM Department Servicing Representative. Thereafter, a transition team will be formed to implement the plan.
Upon approval of the plan, the transition team will organize and administer the joint programs through the Transition Center. The transition team will be trained by the UAW-GM Center for Human Resources and/or its designated representatives.
Costs for these programs will be provided through government funding, if available, and/or Joint Funds, where appropriate.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed situations in which employees are laid off prior to the Independence Week Shutdown period and thereby, become ineligible for the four (4) days of the Independence Week Shutdown pay.
As a result of these discussions, the Corporation agreed that seniority employees who work in the fourth work week prior to the Independence Week Shutdown period, and who are laid off either temporarily or permanently during that week, or during the first, second, or third work week prior to the Independence Week Shutdown period, shall be considered as meeting the requirements of Par. 202d(2) of the National Agreement. Therefore, these employees will, if otherwise eligible, receive the four (4) days of Independence Week Shutdown pay.
This letter does not change or modify the Holiday Pay provisions of the National Agreement.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations, the parties discussed situations where employees were not advised of their individual work schedules for the independence Week and Vacation Shutdown period in a timely manner.
Management expressed their desire to provide employees with as much advance notice as possible.
Therefore, after the announcement in February detailing which operations will be affected by the shutdown, all employees will be notified by local Plant Management, as soon as is practicable, as to whether or not they are scheduled to be working during the shutdown period. Should the circumstances change after an employee is informed, the new schedule as well as the changed circumstances will be communicated to the employee as soon as possible.
In addition, when business conditions change and a plant is required to work after originally scheduled to be down, the plant will first try to meet their needs through the use of volunteers. Any problem in this area should be raised with the Group/Divisional Director of Labor Relations or the Corporation for review.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
Subject: Worldwide Facilities Group
During the 2003 Negotiations, the parties discussed extensively the necessity to work together to narrow the competitive gap in the area oi indirect labor functions. It was acknowledged that the Worldwide Facilities Group (WFG) has assumed greater responsibility to manage these functions at our plant sites and closed facilities,
Further, the National Parties have established a Joint Task Team at the GM-Intemational UAW level under the direction of the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee to assess and develop best practices, establish targets (including cost savings targets) and share information in this regard between locations. These efforts will be directed at reducing costs and improving efficiencies. Suggested areas to assess include, but are not limited to non-technical maintenance, specialty maintenance, and building construction and maintenance activities! Other jointly identified studies may be utilized to assist in this project. Costs incurred by the Joint Task Team efforts will be reimbursed by Joint Training Funds,
It is recognised that th? GM-UAW Skilled Trades and ABprenlice Committee with the-dssistance of the WFG Quality Council mav evaluate the proaress/accompiishments of the joint teams relative to targeted goals and make appropriate decisions.
629
WORLDWIDE FACILITIES GROUP
National and local efforts in this regard will not supersede other existing provisions of the National Agreement. The parties also recognize the significance of this activity with potential of having major impact on the competitive position of GM. Therefore, where a plant continues to attain jointly established targeted improvements, reduce costs and increase efficiencies, the Worldwide Facilities Group (WPG) commits to not having outside contractors perform the activities, manpower permitting. The Union, for its part, commits to assisting in implementing best practices and other results of studies beneficial to our locations.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
Very truly yours,

Group Vice President
Manufacturing & Labor Relations
During the current negotiations, the joint parties discussed the importance of reporting, investigating, evaluating, and determining corrective actions for "Near Miss" incidents which occur in the workplace. The joint parties recognize that the foundation of any successful safety process rests with a cultural atmosphere that allows employees to bring potentially hazardous situations to the attention of management in order to achieve timely correction. This line of communication can only be achieved if employees are free to discuss "Near Miss" incidents with supervision without fear of reprisal. To this end, the Corporation will instruct Management at each facility:
• On the importance of reporting "Near Miss" incidents.
To include near misses as part of the cunent incident investigation process including corrective action.
• To use counseling in lieu of discipline in those cases where an employee immediately self-reports a "Near Miss" incident involving a possible violation of safety rules.
In addition, the National Joint Committee will issue a communication in the form of Safety Talk and/or other materials to encourage employees to immediately report near misses to their supervisor.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
Subject: Product Development and Transformation
During these negotiations the parties discussed various issues related to product development and product transformation. The Corporation and the Union recognize that future jobs depend on, among other things, continuing investments in product development. Shifting markets, changing consumer tastes, new governmental regulations, international harmonization of such requirements, and a host of other factors have a direct impact on vehicle development and manufacturing, The products manufactured and services delivered must meet evolving customer preferences and demands at a competitive price.
The Corporation fully understands the Union's concerns relative to investment in new products and services, and that such investments, while absolutely necessary, may not alone guarantee good future jobs. New products require additional skills, spur changes in labor demand, and entail new sourcing decisions. The parties acknowledge that involving the Union at the earliest stages of the product development cycle is key to attaining job security while meeting the global challenges of improved quality, speed to market, product innovation, and lowering total costs. To that end, the Corporation has been, and continues to be, fully committed to working with the Union to seek and identify appropriate jointly developed technical training programs that will match new skill requirements with evolving technologies, products and
services, along with the implementation of new programs to cushion unavoidable dislocative effects of rapid product transformation and development. The Corporation recognizes that working together will help preserve and grow good paying jobs for all current and future UAW-represented employees at General Motors Corporation.
In preceding National Agreements and during these negotiations, the parties have recognized the importance of the Union's role and involvement in the product development cycle and product transformation through provisions, such as Appendix L-Sourcing which provide a mechanism for early UAW involvement in the Corporation's plans to proceed with a new or redesigned vehicle. To that end, it is understood and reaffirmed that early during the product development cycle, matters such as sourcing patterns, possible changes in assembly, sub-assembly, stamping, powertrain and other component sourcing patterns, possible insourcing opportunities, and technology which may impact the represented workforce will be reviewed with the International Union in accordance with the provisions of Appendix L-Sourcing. Such early and up-front involvement will allow the Union to continue to be provided with current and anticipated major product developments/product transformations that are having, are expected to have, or could potentially have an effect on employment levels such as projected changes in the major components for motor vehicles (e.g. shift to new propulsion technology and energy storage devices), in materials (e.g. increased use of plastics and/or aluminum in body panels, shift to aluminum castings), in assembly and design (e.g. for easier assembly/manufacturing methods and for disassembly for recycling purposes).
Further, the Union's early involvement during the product development process allows for discussions relative to issues such as the impact of a traditional gas-fueled internal combustion engine vehicle, and, for example, the comparable electric, hybrid electric, fuel cell, or dedicated and flexible altemative-liquid-fuel vehicle with respect to major components, materials,

and assembly methods. In each case, the Corporation will indicate the extent to which changes in specifications will be handled through the revamping of existing UAW-GM operations, by means of technology residing in other divisions of the Corporation or by outside sourcing arrangements.
Finally, it is recognized that Appendix L-Sourcing provides an avenue for discussions as early as practicable in the product development cycle relative to projected production volume of new materials, components, and products, and the potential impact, if any, on UAW-represented jobs.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PARAGRAPH (76a)
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union. UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties had lengthy discussions regarding the implementation of Paragraph (76a) of the National Agreement. The Union asserted that Management was repeatedly suspending employees without providing them with the opportunity to answer the charges that gave rise to the situation for which discipline was being considered. Management responded that the intent of Paragraph (76a) was to provide for this opportunity except in those cases where the employee being interviewed were either unavailable or incapable (physically or emotionally) to effectively respond to the charges.
The parties also recognize that more than one interview pursuant to Paragraph (76a) may be appropriate where additional facts or information has been discovered.

TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES


Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
During the current National negotiations, the issue of temporary employees was discussed at length between the Parties. The Union raised its concerns regarding abuses at many locations in connection with the use of temporary employees.
This letter confirms our discussions related to employees hired as temporary. In the event that a plant hires temporary employees without National Parties approval in accordance with Appendix A, Section VII, or in the event that a plant retains temporary employees past the approved period, such employees will become seniority employees. Temporary employees who become seniority employees under this provision will be given credit for time worked as a temporary.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations the Union cited several instances where Management delayed in providing information requested by the Union during the processing of a grievance. In response, Management assured the Union that they fully support the principle of full disclosure. The principle of full disclosure has been discussed in several Umpire decisions dating back to 1941. Management fully supports the principles outlined in those decisions.
Very truly yours.

WAGE PROGRESSION
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18,2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the Union expressed concern about the application of Paragraph (98) wage progression to certain employees returning to nonskilled classifications.
This will confirm our understanding that a seniority employee who did not complete wage progression to the full base rate of the job classification pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph (98) and
entered into the apprenticeship program but returned to a non-skilled classification before completing said apprenticeship shall be given credit for non-skilled wage progression purposes for the weeks worked while in the apprenticeship program, or
accepted and worked a temporary salaried assignment and returned to an hourly non-skilled classification shall be given credit for non-skilled wage progression purposes for the weeks worked as a temporary salaried employee.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the current negotiations, the Union expressed concern regarding payroll related matters. In resolution of these payroll matters, the Corporation agreed to implement the following:
At those facilities where the Local Union so requests, employees who are scheduled to work on a payday during (i) the Christmas Holiday period or (ii) a model changeover, or (iii) vacation shutdown will receive their paycheck in the work place during such period, except for employees who receive their regular pay by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). In order to provide sufficient time for the processing and handling of these checks, the local Payroll Department must receive a list of such employees from that plant's management no later than the last scheduled workday prior to the Christmas Holiday Period or such model changeover.
Very truly yours,

An employee, who has received the hire rate and rate progression set forth in Paragraph (98), (98a), or (98b) of the new Agreement and who, at the expiration of one hundred and fifty-six (156) weeks of employment, is assigned or continues to be assigned to a job classification that has an extended training period, but has not completed the required time in such classification to receive the maximum base rate, will continue at the current rate or the rate specified in the local wage agreement for time worked in such classification, whichever is higher. Thereafter, such employee will receive a rate in accordance with the provisions of the local wage agreement.
For the purpose of applying the provisions of Paragraph (98), (98a), or (98b) of the new Agreement to the administration of a "Levels of Learning" or "Pay for Knowledge" system, the “maximum base rate of the job classification" shall be the locally negotiated base rate for Level I. In the event an employee is transferred to a level higher than Level I, the maximum base rate of the job classification will be the rate for the level to which the employee is assigned.
For the purpose of determining the respective rates specified in Paragraph (98), (98a), or (98b) of the new Agreement, the Engineering Method of Rounding specified in the current Troy A. Clarke letter regarding COLA-Calculation shall apply.

actively employed at GM and employees with unbroken seniority who are on lay off or leave of absence from GM business units. “Delphi Employee,” as used herein, refers to the UAW hourly represented employees actively employed at Delphi and employees with unbroken seniority who are on lay off or leave of absence from Delphi business units (see Attachment A).
Employee Placement
It is recognized that the ability to move from GM to Delphi and from Delphi to GM is a concern of employees. The parties have developed the following procedures to address this concern.
A. Eligibility
GM and Delphi employees who were hired on or before the expiration date (October 18, 1999) of their respective 1996 GM-UAW or Delphi-UAW National Agreements will be covered by this Flowback Agreement.
B. Application Process
1.	GM or Delphi employees who wish to apply for job openings at the other Company must file an Area Hire and/or Extended Area Hire Application using the GM Employee Placement System (EPS). Employees may file an application to the other Company through December 31, 2006.
2,	Employees who have filed an Area Hire and/or Extended Area Hire Application pursuant to this Flowback Agreement, will be permitted to designate one or more plant locations and to change their selection of plant locations during and after the close of the application period.
C. Placement Process
1.	Area Hire Placement
Area Hire placement

When there are applicants for Area Hire placeman, between Companies, the following priority will apply in
tilling openings:
a)	Plant recall
b)	Plant rehire
c)	Laid off employees from the Company with the job opening, who volunteer, will be made job offers in seniority order.
d)	Applicants from the other Company will be made job offers in seniority order.
e)	The balance of Area Hire job offers will be made in accordance with the provisions of Appendix A of the Company with the job opening.
0 When the number of applicants to be made offers exceeds the number of applicants that could be immediately released, the UAW, GM and Delphi will develop an employee transfer plan that protects the effectiveness of the on-going operations and accommodates timely employee placement.
g)	Employees will remain eligible for Area Hire job offers between Companies until they are placed or refuse an Area Hire job offer.
2.	Extended Area Hire Placement
a)	Eligible applicants for Extended Area Hire placement between Companies will be eligible for a maximum of three (3) Extended Area Hire job offers to openings. These Extended Area Hire job offers will be made

to such applicants in seniority order for their first Extended Area Hire opportunity. After the initial offer, all Extended Area Hire applicants will be combined and job offers will be made in seniority order. To fulfill contractual requirements to hire new employees at one Company, applicants from the other Company will be made job offers in
seniority order. When the number of applicants to be made offers exceeds the number of applicants that could be immediately released, the UAW, GM and Delphi will develop an employee transfer plan that protects the effectiveness of the ongoing operations and accommodates timely employee placement.
b)	Employees will continue to be eligible for Extended Area Hire job offers between Companies until they are placed or refuse three (3) such Extended Area Hire job offers.
3.	When a contractual requirement to hire new employees exists at a GM or Delphi plant, the appropriate applicant from the other Company will be made a job offer. The placement of the applicant will result in a new hire backfill at the sending plant. An applicant so placed will satisfy the contractual new hire requirement.
For the period of 10-1-03 through 9-14-07 contractual requirements to hire new employees will be filled in a ratio of 2:1 (i.e., 2 Flowbacks and 1 New Hire).
When it is otherwise necessary, i.e. a noncontractual requirement, to add new employees at a GM or Delphi plant, the appropriate applicant from the other Company will be made a job offer. The placement of the
676
applicant will result in a backfill at the sending plant in the following order: (1) a Protected Status employee being placed on active status, (2) recalling an employee from layoff, or (3) by hiring new employees.
4.	The provisions of this Flowback Agreement provides for one Company to Company placement per employee.
5.	Employees who have broken seniority pursuant to Paragraphs 64(a) through 64(d) or Paragraph 111(b) will be eligible to file an Area Hire and/or Extended Area Hire Application to the other Company under this Flowback Agreement.
Employees on leaves of absence from either Company must return to active status at the plant from which they arc on leave in order to be eligible for placement pursuant to the terms of this Flowback Agreement.
F. Skilled Trades
1.	Skilled Trades employees with unbroken GM or Delphi skilled trades seniority, who apply for transfer between Companies, will be given the opportunity to file Area Hire and/or Extended Area Hire Application for a skilled trades job opening and/or a non-skilled job opening.
677



2.	Skilled Trades employees with unbroken GM or Delphi skilled trades seniority, who apply for transfer between Companies, currently working as a non-skilled employee may file an Area Hire and/or Extended Area Hire Application for a skilled trades job opening and/or a non-skilled job opening.
G.	Apprentices
It is understood that Paragraph (113a) and Document 20 will apply between GM and Delphi.
H.	Employee Placement System and Placement Process Impact
During the implementation of this Flowback Agreement, it is recognized that an increase in placement activity may occur. Any issues related to the implementation of this Flowback Agreement will be addressed promptly by the GM and UAW National Parties and/or Delphi and UAW National Parties.
It is further understood that the National Parties may also mutually agree to deviate from this process.

685
During negotiations the International Union has chimed that certain work which is performed at some plant locations where the UAW is the certified bargaining representative of certain employees has been improperly assigned to non-represented employees of General Motors.
The Corporation is mindful of the Union’s concern regarding the scope and work content of job 'classifications of employees in the UAW bargaining unit atd how such may be affected by advancing technology. Accordingly, the GM-UAW Skilled Trades and Apprentice Committee will meet periodically to discuss caauers concerning new or advanced technology that cannot be resolved locally and are referred to it by local onions or local managements as well as claims of . erosion of the bargaining unit.
Since the first National Agreement of June 24, 1940, many necessary changes in methods and processes have had an impact upon the scope and work content of job classifications of both represented and non-represented employees.
Advancing technology has created, and will continue io create, new and more complex problems bearing upon the work content of job classifications of employees represented by the Union.

I( is not the Corporation’s policy to assign to nonrepresented employees work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at a particular plant location. The Corporation recognizes that mere novelty or the wphistication of new technology alone is not grounds (or withdrawing work from represented employees. Similarly, the Corporation does not believe that the





perimeters of the bargaining unit at a particular plant location should be expanded simply by the introduction of new technology.
It is recognized that advances in technology may alter, modify or otherwise change the job responsibilities of represented employees at plant locations and that a change in the means, method or process of performing a work function including the introduction of computers, energy management systems, modem, art to part, tool cutting paths and fiber optics, CAM, CMM, CAE, 3D Visualization or other new or advanced technology will not serve to shift the work function from represented to non-represented employees. Therefore,
1.	Where a work function at a plant location preceded the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was assigned at the time of certification, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
2.	Where a work function was introduced at a plant location following the certification of the Union, the work function will be assigned as it was originally assigned, unless there has been a written agreement otherwise.
The Corporation and the International Union arc in j agreement that the assignment of represented or non- [ represented employees depends upon the work function c involved and not necessarily upon the work tasks required to accomplish such work function.	|
E3
Notice and Discussion
The Corporation agrees to advanced written g notification to local unions at locations planning the •=’ introduction of new or advanced technology so as to permit meaningful discussion of its impact, if any, upon skilled or non-skilled employees.
1/
The Chairperson of the Shop. Committee, the i-.-AjLe&lpr,, _apd/gL.-Ui£ir. -designated tiyes will comprise a Plant New Technology Committee, The Local Management will describe for .the Ekni.Ngg Tcdwtogy. Comm&ss the extent to fwhich such technological changes may affect the work performed by represented employees at the plant location involved. The Chairperson of the Shop ! Committee and the International Union will be provided a written description of the technology involved, the equipment being introduced, its intended use and the anticipated installation date(s). During the discussions ? the Chairperson of the Shop Committee may include as J members. Qt tbs Plant New TcchDQlogy-Csmmiuee. J other Local Union representatives such as the Health r and Safety Representative, a representative from the Local Joint Skill Development and Training Committee, f a member of the Local Apprentice Committee, or other employees, as necessary, in order to review the various matters of concern relative to the introduction of the । new technology involved. Accordingly, the parties j agreed upon the following examples of situations where I notification should be given:
A)	The first introduction of a technology as compared to previously existing plant technology.
B)	Introduction of a new, more advanced generation of existing technology having a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
C)	Introduction of a new application of existing technology which has a significantly different impact on the bargaining unit.
The parties also highlighted that the National Agreement provides for notification to take place as far in advance of implementation of the technological change as is practicable. This is not only to enable the Plant New Technology Committee to discuss the impact
such introduction of technology has on the bargaining unit, but also to discuss timely implementation of employee training to prepare them to perform their
appropriate functions.
Training
The Union has also voiced concern about the possibility that new, technologically impacted bargaining unit work will not be awarded to represented employees because they are insufficiently trained to perform it. In view of the parties* interest in affording maximum opportunity for employees to progress with advancing technology, as part of the advanced discussion, the parties shall seek to identify appropriate specialized training programs, to be made available as far in advance of the technology’s introduction to the plant as practicable, so that employees will be capable of performing new or changed work normally performed by represented personnel.
Dispute Resolution
The following paragraphs set forth a means of resolving disputes concerning particular problems occasioned by advancing technology.
Where the initial introduction of new or advanced technology at a plant location occasions a question of whether:
1)	certain new work should be assigned to represented employees,
2)	affects the job responsibilities of represented employees, or
3)	otherwise impacts the scope of the bargaining unit,
The Plant New Technology Committee will attempt to resolve the matter without resorting to the grievance
procedure. Local Management will cooperate in the Plant New Technology Committee's investigation and evaluation of impact issues raised due to the introduction of new or advanced technology. Comments by the Committee will be carefully evaluated by the Local Management in accordance with the Corporation's policy relative to the assignment of work which comes within the scope and content of that normally assigned to represented employees at the plant location. If the issue remains unresolved either party may request involvement of the.GMtUAW Skilled Icadg^-aiKLApprentiQg-GomniitLcg^ Any lemaining unresolved issues may be introduced into the second step of the grievance procedure as provided in Paragraph (31) of the National Agreement.
Settlements made by the local parties concerning the assignment of work functions as between represented and non-represented employees in relation to the new or advanced technology discussed will be forwarded to the International Union and the Corporation and will be reviewed by the GM-UAW Skilled Trades & Apprentice Committee within thirty (30) days of receipt of the settlement.

EXHIBIT A SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT (Pension Plan)
ru oout. I
SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT (PENSION PLAN)
On this 18th day of September 2003. General Motors Corporation, hereinafter referred to as the Corporation, and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, hereinafter referred to as the Union, on behalf of the employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement of which this Supplemental Agreemept becomes a part, agree as follows:
Section 1.	Establishment of Plan
Subject to the approval of its Board of Directors, which occurred on October 7. 2003. the Corporation established an amended pension plan, hereinafter referred to as the Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A-l and made a part of this agreement to the extent applicable to the employees represented by the Union and covered by this agreement as if fully set out herein, modified and supplemented, however, by the provisions hereinafter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the provisions of this agreement, the provisions of this agreement will supersede the provisions of the Plan to the extent necessary to eliminate such conflict.
The Plan, as set forth in Exhibit A-l, and the Plan as it may be modified and supplemented by superseding provisions of this agreement, as above provided, are both contingent upon and subject to obtaining and retaining such approval of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as the Corporation may find necessary to establish the deductibility under Section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code for income tax purposes of any and all contributions made by the Corporation to both plans and to establish the plans and related trust as being qualified and tax exempt under Sections 401 and 501(a) or other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue
(1)
A, OUU1. >
Code. Any modification or amendment of either the Plan, or the Flan as modified and supplemented by this agreement, may be made retroactively by the Corporation with the consent of the Union, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the Plan as a plan and trust meeting the requirements of Sections 401 and 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder, provided that pension benefits under the Plan are not diminished.
Until the Plan is approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors and by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, all as hereinbefore provided, the benefits payable shall be only those determined under the Plan as constituted prior to October 1. 2003: provided, however, that following approval by its Board of Directors and its receipt of the favorable ruling from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as set forth above, the Corporation or the trustee will pay to retired employees and surviving spouses any excess amounts equal to the difference between the monthly pension calculated in accordance with the terms of the Plan, attached hereto as Exhibit A-l, and the monthly pension paid or payable in accordance with the terms of the Pension Plan which was attached as Exhibit A-l to the Supplemental Agreement (Pension Plan) between the Parties dated September 28, 1999. Any such excess amounts payable for months prior to the receipt of the aforementioned Board of Directors and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue approvals, shall be payable the first of the month following the date upon which the last of these two approvals is received by the Corporation, and any such amounts payable thereafter shall be paid on the first of the month at the same time as the related pension is paid.
(2)
»
In the event that the Plan is disapproved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Corporation within thirty days after any such disapproval will give written notice thereof to the Union and this agreement shall thereupon have no force or effect. In that event the matters covered by this agreement shall be the subject of further negotiation between the Corporation and the Union.
Section 2.	Financing
(a)	A trustee or an insurance company, or both, shall be designated by the Corporation, and a trust agreement or contract, or both, executed between the Corporation and such trustee or insurance company, or both, under the terms of which a pension fund or insured fund, shall be established to receive and hold contributions payable by the Corporation, interest, and other income, and to pay the pensions and supplements provided by the Plan.
(b)	The Corporation agrees to pay over irrevocably to the trustee or insurance company during the period of this agreement, contributions or payments for the Plan equal to the sum of (i) and (ii) below as determined and certified as of each anniversary of the effective date of the Plan by one or more actuaries chosen by, but independent of, the Corporation, and qualified through Fellowship in the Society of Actuaries and enrollment with the Joint Board for Enrollment of Actuaries (hereinafter referred to as the Actuary). Such contributions or payments for any year may be made not later than the date on which such contributions are required by law to be made for the purpose of crediting such contributions to such year under the minimum funding standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974:
(i) the annual “current service” or “normal



A, Sect -4DMIJ
in respect of assumed continuous service after each such anniversary date, and
(ii)	the “prior service contribution” computed as that part of the present value, at each such anniversary date, of the prospective pensions payable under the Plan for employees, pensioners and former employees who are entitled to a deferred pension then covered by the Plan which is in excess of:
(an) the value of the trust fund, as. then comprised of any contracts and total other assets, invested and uninvested, such total assets being valued on a basis at least equal to the total cost thereof, plus
(bb) the then present value of the prospective “current service” or “normal cost” contributions determined by the Actuary in accordance with (i) above, such excess part being amortized according to the following schedule:
(1)	in respect of the portion of such excess part attributable to the level of benefits in effect prior to October 1, 1979 - the fifty-ninth anniversary of the Corporation’s pension plan (October 1,2009), and
(2)	in respect of the portion of such excess part attributable to the increase in the level of benefits established by amendments to the Corporation’s pension plan effective on or after October 1, 1979 - the thirtieth anniversary of the date on which such increase in the level of benefits becomes effective.
(c)	The Corporation may contribute or pay additional amounts to the trustee or insurance company, or both, under (b) above in any year without such additional amounts being construed to reduce any thirtyyear period for the completion of the “prior service contributions” of subsection (b)(ii) above. If the Corporation has contributed any such additional
(4)
A, sect 2(c)
amounts prior to any anniversary date of the Corporation’s pension plan or shall contribute any such additional amounts prior to any anniversary date of the Plan falling within the duration of this agreement, the Corporation may as of such anniversary, contribute a lesser amount than otherwise determined by (b) above for such anniversary, provided that the value of any contracts and total other assets as valued in accordance with (b)(ii)(aa) above at such anniversary shall not be less than the amount estimated by the Actuary to be the value as if contributions and payments up to and including such anniversary date had been made as provided in (b) above and no additional amounts had been contributed or paid prior to such anniversary.
(d)	The Corporation by payment of the contributions or amounts as hereinbefore provided in this section shall be relieved of any further liability, except as provided under the Internal Revenue Code, and pensions and supplements shall be payable only from the trust fund or the insured fund or both.

CREDITED SERVICE
Section 1. Credited Service Subsequent to October 1,1950
(a) (1) Credited service shall be computed for each calendar year for each employee on the basis of total hours compensated by any plant or Division of the Corporation during such calendar year while the employee has unbroken seniority. For purposes of this Article III* Section 1, effective October 1, 1996, seniority shall mean longest unbroken plant seniority, or Corporate seniority, if greater. Employment while covered under The GM Special Pension Plan shall not be credited hereunder, except for an employee with seniority on March 1,1988, who has not received a cash payment representing such employee’s accrued benefit under The GM Special Pension Plan. Any calendar year in which the employee has 1700 or more compensated hours shall be counted a full calendar year. Where the employee’s total hours compensated during a calendar year are less than 1700 hours, a proportionate credit shall be given to the nearest 1/10 of a year.
(2)	For the purpose of computing credited service, hours of pay at premium rate shall be computed as straight time hours.
(b)	For the purpose of computing compensated hours under subsection (a) of this Section 1:
(1)	An employee with seniority on or after January 1, 1968 who is absent from work during any calendar year thereafter because of layoff or while on a Corporation approved sick leave, shall be credited with 40 hours for each complete calendar week of such absence during such year in addition to any other hours credited, provided that such employee shall have
41
Art tl), HDJO)
received pay from the Corporation during that year for at least 170 hours, and provided further that if such absence commences in calendar year 1970 or later, and such layoff or sick leave continues into the following year, the employee shall be credited with 40 hours, hereinafter referred to as “bank hours”, for-each complete calendar week of absence in the following year, not to exceed 1530 ”bank hours” of credit for all such absence related to receipt of such pay from the Corporation in the first year.
An employee who is recalled from permanent layoff and returns to work on or after October 1. 2003 shall become eligible for the 1530 “bank hours" of credit hereunder, applicable during a sick leave or layoff, on the later of: (1) receipt of pay from the Corporation for at least 170 hours, or (2) the day next following the 12th week of pay from one or more GM plants within a calendar year. If the employee receives pay from the Corporation for 170 or more hours prior to the 12th week in (2) immediately above, the employee shall become eligible for “bank hours” equal to the number of hours worked since recall, plus any “bank hours” to which the employee was entitled immediately before such return to work, but in no case to exceed 1530 “bank hours”.
An employee who returns to work on or after October 1, 1979 and receives pay for a period of less than 170 hours and who thereafter returns to such layoff or sick leave, shall not be disqualified, solely because of the receipt of such pay, from receiving any such credit for which the employee otherwise would be eligible hereunder. For the purposes of this subsection only, an employee who is laid off subsequent to October 1, 1979 and whose first day of absence due to such layoff is the first regularly scheduled work day in the January next following the last day worked shall be deemed to have been laid off on December 31 of the year in which the
42
ah. ti>,
employee last worked. A part-time employee shall be credited for any week of such absence in the same percentage relationship as such employee’s regular part-time schedule is to 40 hours.
An employee who (i) is at work on or after October L 2003: (ii) has 10 or more years of seniority at time of layoff commencing on or after October 1. 2003: (iii) while on such layoff has received the maximum of 1530 “bank hours” of credit for periods of absence due to layoff or Corporation approved sick leave in accordance with the preceding paragraph of this Section 1(b)(1); and (iv) continues thereafter to be absent due to such layoff shall be credited with 40 “bank hours" for each complete calendar week of absence due to such layoff up to a maximum of 1700 hours of credit.
(2)	An employee who is absent from work because of occupational injury or disease incurred in the course of such employee’s employment with the Corporation, and on account of such absence receives Workers Compensation while on Corporation approved leave of absence shall be credited with 40 hours for each complete calendar week of such absence after September 1,1961.
(c)	Any salaried employee transferred to an hourly-rate job who thereby becomes an employee covered by the Plan shall have credited to the nearest 1/10 year any credited service the employee had as of the date of such transfer under any Corporation retirement plan for salaried employees.

AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTING SECTION 3(C)
OFTHE SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT, PENSION PLAN, DATED SEPTEMBER 18.2003

BETWEEN GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION AND THE UAW
ESTABLISHED BY BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION
Pursuant to Section 3(c) of the Supplemental Agreement Pension Plan, dated September 18. 2003. between General Motors Corporation and the International Union, UAW, the following provisions are hereby established by the Board of Administration, hereinafter referred to as the Board:
A.	PENSION COMMITTEES
1.	There shall be established for each location having a bargaining unit or units covered by the terms of the National Agreement between the parties dated September 18.2003, a Pension Committee consisting of members appointed by the GM Department of the International Union and members located at a Pension Administration Center, hereinafter referred to as the Center, as delegated by the GM Employee Benefits Staff of the Corporation.
2.	The Pension Committee Union members shall have an alternate. Meetings or participation through conference calls of the Committee shall be arranged by mutual agreement, and in the event a member is absent, the alternate may attend and when in attendance shall exercise the duties of the member.
3.	The individual appointed by the Union as a member or alternate shall be an employee of the Corporation, having at least one year of seniority, and working at the plant where, and at the time when, such employee is to serve as a member of the Pension Committee.
91
Appendix D, A(4)
4.	Either Employee Benefits or the International Union at any time may remove a member or alternate appointed by it and appoint a member or alternate to fill any vacancy among members or alternates appointed by it.
5.	The names of the Union members and alternate members of the Pension Committees shall be given in writing by the GM Department of the International Union to Employee Benefits of the Corporation. No such member of the Committee or such alternate member shall function as such until such written notice has been given.
6.	The names of the Corporation members appointed by Employee Benefits and alternate members of the Pension Committees shall be given in writing by Employee Benefits to the GM Department of the International Union.
7.	Under usual circumstances, in plants employing 600 or more employees, the union benefit representative who functions in the Benefit Plan district in which a retiring employee or an employee who raises a problem works will serve as the Union member of the Pension Committee with respect to that employee’s case.
8.	A Union member of the Pension Committee shall, after reporting to such Union member’s supervisor, be granted permission to leave work during working hours without loss of pay to:
(a)	attend meetings or participate in conference calls of the Pension Committee,
(b)	confer in the plant with an employee who requests the presence of the Union member of the Pension Committee to discuss matters with respect to eligibility for retirement or the computation of pension
92
benefits in connection with such employee’s pending retirement and to discuss any disputes relative to credited service, or
(c)	confer in the plant with a retired employee or surviving spouse who requests the presence of the Union member of the Pension Committee to discuss matters with respect to such person’s eligibility for benefits or the computation of such benefits.
Such permission shall be granted with the understanding that the time will be devoted to the prompt handling of such matters.
With respect to a request made in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) above, permission shall be granted in a timely manner consistent with the circumstances and nature of the request.
Consistent with the purpose of this procedure, a rule of reason should be applied in determining whether an employee should be excused from a job in order to confer with the Union member of the Pension Committee. A rule of reason should likewise be applied when, due to production difficulties, excessive absenteeism, or other emergencies, it will not be possible to immediately relieve the employee from a job. On many jobs, discussion between the employee and the Union member of the Pension Committee is entirely practical without the necessity for the employee being relieved. On the other hand, an employee working on a moving conveyor, in an excessively noisy area, or climbing in and out of bodies, should be permitted a reasonable period of time off the job and a suitable place in which to discuss the pension question as set forth in (b), above, with the Union member of the Pension Committee. A suitable place in which to discuss such issues also should be permitted a retiree or surviving spouse. This shall not interfere with any local practice which is mutually satisfactory.
93
Appenuix u, o
B.	RETIREMENTS
1.	Normal Retirement or Early Retirement (Employee Option)
Application for a- pension benefit under the provisions of the Pension Plan for normal or early retirement at the option of the employee shall be made by contacting the Center for a retirement package.

2.	Early Retirement Under Mutually Satisfactory Conditions
(a)	When an employee is to be retired under mutually satisfactory conditions, the retirement package will be prepared by the Center and sent to the Union member of the Pension Committee or Personnel Director, as requested, in accordance with the procedures in Section D.
(b)	Retirement under mutually satisfactory conditions will be determined based solely on the Standards as set forth in the Pension Plan applicable to such retirement, only upon the written approval of the Personnel Director or the designated representative of the Personnel Director, and acknowledged in writing by the employee on form HRP-9M.
(c)	Neither the Pension Committee nor the Board shall have any jurisdiction with respect to any questions as to whether any employee retired at the employee’s own option or under mutually satisfactory conditions under, the Standards set forth in the Pension Plan.
94
3.	Total and Permanent Disability Retirement
(a)	Employees with seniority may apply for a total and permanent disability retirement (T&PD) on form HRP-15, “Application for Total and Permanent Disability Benefits”. Such forms will be available through the Center or the Union member of the Pension Committee.

(c)	An employee with seniority who has a terminal condition may apply immediately for T&PD retirement as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) above. In the event such employee has been on leave at least one month and the cause of death is directly or indirectly a result of the terminal condition which gave rise to the disability leave of absence (for example, excluding death as a result of homicide, suicide, or accidental death), and who has applied for retirement prior to death, shall not disqualify an otherwise eligible surviving spouse from receiving a benefit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective October 1, 1999, (a) in the case of an occupational injury or disease incurred in the course of employment with the Corporation resulting in death, neither the one-month period nor the leave of absence requirement shall apply, and (b) in the case of a terminal condition as such term is used and qualified in this paragraph, the one-month period shall not apply.

(e)	When it becomes necessary to determine whether an employee is totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of the Pension Plan, the following procedure shall govern:
(1)	The Corporation will make such determination upon the basis of medical evidence satisfactory to it within 45_days of .receipt oLthe employee’s application for T&PD retirement (unless special circumstances require an extension of tim^ and written notice of the need of an extension is provided).

The information will include, among other relevant information, a narrative report that details what has improved and why the condition under which such retiree was determined to be T&PD no longer exists or no longer disables the retiree. Documentation will include appropriate lab reports and/or test results.
(2)	If necessary, the Plant Medical Director may examine the retiree to determine if the retiree has recovered.
(3)	If the Plant Medical Director determines the retiree has recovered and is able to engage in regular employment on a job within the plant, the Plant Medical Director will review the matter with the Corporation. If the Corporation agrees, the retiree is to be removed from T&PD status and seniority will be treated as set forth in Exhibit A, Section 4(b) of the Supplemental Agreement (Pension Plan), and the retirement is to be cancelled. The Plant Medical Director will advise the retiree, the Union Benefit Representative (UBR), and the Center.
(4)	If the Plant Medical Director determines
102
that the retiree has not recovered and should remain on T&PD retirement, the retiree will continue in T&PD status under the Pension Plan. The Plant Medical Director will advise the retiree, the UBR and the Center.
(5)	If the retiree disagrees, the retiree may contact the UBR. If the UBR disagrees with the Plant Medical Director’s determination, the UBR will forward the case, with all pertinent medical information, to the International Representative in the UAW-GM Department. The International Representative may forward the case to the GM Employee Benefits (EB) Staff. After reviewing the case with the Corporate Medical Director, the GM EB Staff will provide the International Representative with the Corporate Medical Director’s decision of why the retiree has not recovered and is not able to engage in regular employment on a job within the plant. If the International Representative disagrees with the determination of the Corporation, the International Representative and the GM EB Staff may agree to schedule an exam with an impartial specialist physician selected by the Plant Medical Director or, in the absence of such agreement, the GM EB Staff will advise the Plant Medical Director to schedule an exam with an impartial clinic in the area which is on the approved list (Appendix D-l). However, in all cases where the retiree has been retired for five or more years, the retiree will be sent to an impartial specialist approved by the GM EB Staff and the International Representative. The impartial clinic or physician will determine whether the retiree has recovered and is able to engage in regular employment on a job within the plant The decision of the impartial clinic or physician is final and binding on the retiree, the Union and the Corporation,
■ If the impartial clinic determines the. retiree remains totally and permanently disabled, the former employee remains retired and cannot reapply to return to
103
work unless there is a substantial change in the retiree's medical condition subsequent to the initial request to return to work. If the impartial physician determines the retiree has recovered and is able to engage in regular employment on a job within the plant, the retiree is to be removed from T&PD status and seniority will be treated as set forth in Exhibit A, Section 4(b) of the Supplemental Agreement (Pension Plan). The Plant Medical Director will advise the retiree, the Union Benefit Representative and the Center of the determination.

STANDARDS FOR APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS REGARDING RETIREMENT UNDER MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY CONDITIONS
GENERAL MOTORS HOURLY-RATE EMPLOYEES PENSION PLAN
Article n, Section 2(b) of the General Motors Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan provides that an employee may be retired early under mutually satisfactory conditions providing such employee is otherwise eligible. The following standards have been adopted by the Corporation as a guide in the application of this provision.
Standards
A.	An employee who is unable to work efficiently by reason of permanent disability:
The retirement must be in the best interest of the Corporation. It is also intended to benefit employees who are unable to work efficiently by reason of permanent disability. It contemplates that the efficiency of operation will be improved by reason of the retirement which may be the case in any of the following situations:
(1)	The employee is no longer physically or mentally capable of performing such employee’s work in an efficient and satisfactory manner.
(2)	The employee, though still capable of performing such employee’s work satisfactorily, is prevented by chronic physical illness or physical disability (less than total) hum working regularly to the extent that efficiency of operation is interfered with.
(3)	The employee’s condition, based on medical evidence satisfactory to the Corporation, is such that,
122
although able to perform the duties of such employee’s job efficiently and satisfactorily, such employee would thereby be jeopardizing personal health or that of fellow employees.
(4)	The employee is on disability leave or is laid off because such employee is unable to do the work offered by the Corporation efficiently and satisfactorily although able to perform efficiently and satisfactorily other work in the plant to which the employee would have been entitled if such employee had sufficient seniority, and the employee's condition, based on medical evidence satisfactory to the Corporation, is expected to be continuous until normal retirement age.
B.	An employee who is laid off from their last GM employment:
Retirement under mutually satisfactory conditions will be available to an employee who is laid off
(i)	as a result of a plant closing or discontinuance of operations, or
(ii)	whose layoff appears to be permanent,
and in either case has not been offered suitable work by the Corporation in the same labor market area in which the employee was last employed by the Corporation.
123

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties recognized the need to move ahead with the development of technological applications to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees.
1.	The parties recognized the need to provide the necessary tools to Local Union Benefit Representatives so that they may improve the service they are providing to hourly employees. Local Union Benefit Representatives require basic information that can be accessed quickly in order to confidently and accurately answer many of the questions they receive. Therefore, the parties have designed a process, the Benefits Data Access System, whereby Local Union Benefit Representatives have access to certain data elements from several benefit data systems. The Benefits Data Access System provides inquiry only access to Local Union Benefit Representatives who complete a computer training program. Access is limited to information for UAW hourly employees at their particular location.
2.	The parties jointly will develop and implement a new benefit documentation feature to the existing Benefits Data Access System that will be available to Local Union Benefit Representatives. The system will include benefit plan booklets,

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties agreed that the term "80% Date" means the first of the month in which a retiree is or would have been eligible to receive a Social Security retirement benefit equal to 80% of the retiree's Social Security full retirement benefit. The parties further agreed to provide for extended early retirement supplements, interim supplementsand temporary benefits for current retirees bom in 1941.
1942.1943.1944 Qi 1945 who attain qge 62durin.g the 2003 Agreement, and to future retirees bom in those years who, during the term of the 2003 Agreement
(11 retire prior to attaining age 62 under Article II, Section (2) or Section (3) of the Pension Plan, and
(ii) attain age 62.
Any such supplements or temporary benefits payable will be extended until the month prior to the retiree's mPate".
Purina these negotiations the parties also agreed to provide early retirement supplements (notwithstanding the.age limitations within.Article II. Section .6(g)(1)), interim supplements (notwithstanding.ihe.qge limitations of Article H.,Section 6(a)(2)) and temporary benefits (notwithstanding the age limitations of Article IL Section 4(c)) to those employees bom in 1941.1942, 1943,1944 or 1945 who, during the term of this
Agreement, retire subsequent to age 62 but prior to their
140
individual "80% Date". For the purpose of applying this provision, interim supplements for those employees who retire after aae 62 and were otherwise not eligible for an interim supplement will be determined as though the employee retired at age 61, In no event shall this provision serve to provide a total benefit at any time to an employee which is greater than the total benefit payable to a similarly situated employee who retirees prior to aae 62 with the same credited service.
For those retirees whose monthly basic benefit is subject to redetermination at age 62 and one month, the total amount of monthly pension benefit payable, subject to applicable increases, will be the same as that provided immediately prior to age 62 until attainment of the "80% date". For this purpose, any early retirement supplement or interim supplement payable after age 62 will be reduced by the amount of basic benefit that was increased as the.result of the redetermination. For a retiree who is receiving an early retirement supplement or an interim supplement, who also is receiving a Social Security Disability benefit, that supplement will cease at age 62 and one month, as currently. .
The parties further agree that, during the term of the 2003 Collective Bargaining Agreement, they would review the issues surrounding the changes in the Social Security "80% date" and evaluate alternatives to address this issue in the next Collective Bargaining Agreement.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the employment coding system and the resulting impact on the Workers Compensation credited service provision of the GM-UAW Pension Plan. This is to confirm that an employee who is absent from work on an approved leave of absence because of occupational injury or disease (Code A*11) and on account of such injury or disease, receives Workers Compensation payments, will receive credited service at the rate of 40 hours for each complete calendar week that the employee is on such leave.
For an employee whose initial leave is not considered an approved leave of absence because of occupational injury or disease, but the leave is subsequently changed to an approved leave of absence because of occupational injury or disease (Code A-l 1), credited service will be given for the period for which Workers Compensation benefits are payable.
In addition, in those cases where Workers Compensation benefits are no longer payable because the employee has reached maximum medical improvement or the time certain beyond which benefits are not payable, the employee also will be given credited service at the rate of 40 hours for each complete calendar week that the employee is on an approved leave of absence if such absence is directly related to the occupational injury or disease (Code A-l 1).
142
Notwithstanding the above, should an employee who otherwise would be eligible to receive credited service break seniority under the terms of the GM-UAW National Agreement or be able to perform any job in the plant for which the employee has seniority, credited service shall cease to accrue as of that date.
To the extent an employee has not received credited service consistent with these provisions because of employment coding errors, credited service will be corrected if the error is brought to the attention of the Pension Administration Center.

22
Art. II, 6(d)(2)
(2)	If the second absence results from a different kind of sickness or injury, the first absence does not affect any possible future benefits.

For purposes of such reduction, the weekly equivalent of benefits paid on a monthly basis is computed by dividing the monthly benefit rate by 4,33.
Any Disability Insurance Benefits or Retirement Insurance Benefits which are awarded retroactively shall be treated as having been received by the employee during the entire time period for which such benefits were payable and any overpayments of Sickness and Accident Benefits shall be calculated accordingly.
The Carrier shall have the right to periodically request recipients of Sickness and Accident Benefits to complete an authorization form allowing the Social Security Administration to advise the Carrier of the status of a claim for Social Security benefits.

(3)	No legal action shall be brought by any employee to recover from the Carrier prior to the expiration of 60 days after proof of claim has been filed in accordance with the requirements of the Plan, nor shall such action be brought at all unless brought within three years from the expiration of the time within which proof of claim is required by the Plan.
(j)	Payment of Claim
(1)	Subject to due proof of claim, the weekly benefits will be paid to the employee each week during any period of disability for which such benefits are payable and any balance remaining unpaid at the termination of such period will be paid immediately upon receipt of proof.

(k)	Waiver
In order to receive pension benefits under the provisions of the General Motors Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan an employee may waive irrevocably any right such employee may have to receive Sickness and Accident Benefits with respect to any period of disability by completing a waiver form furnished by the Corporation for that purpose. No Sickness and Accident Benefits shall be payable for any period of disability covered by such waiver.
25
Art. II, 7
Section 7.	Extended Disability Benefits
(a)	Eligibility
Extended Disability Benefits coverage shall be provided while an employee is covered for Sickness and Accident Benefits.
An employee who is covered for Sickness and Accident Benefits and who, at the date of expiration of the maximum number of weeks for which such employee is entitled to receive Sickness and Accident Benefits and during a continuous period of disability thereafter, is totally disabled shall receive monthly Extended Disability Benefits for the period described in subsection (c) below.
For an employee to be deemed totally disabled, such employee must not be engaged in regular employment or occupation for remuneration or profit and be wholly prevented from engaging in regular employment or occupation with the Corporation at the plant or plants where the employee has seniority for remuneration or profit as a result of bodily injury or disease, either occupational or non-occupational in cause.
(b)	Amount of Benefit
(1)	The monthly Extended Disability Benefit is the applicable amount shown in the Schedule of Benefits in Section 5 of this Article, reduced by an amount equal to the monthly equivalent of the total of the following benefits for which the person receiving Extended Disability Benefits is eligible:
(i)	All benefits under any pension plan or retirement program then in effect to which the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries has contributed;
(ii)	Lost time benefits under Workers Compensation Laws or other laws providing benefits for occupational injury or disease, including lump-sum
26
AH. 11, /(DHI)yi)
settlements, but excluding specific allowances for loss, or 100% loss of use, of a body member or permanent partial disability payments for a work-related disability unrelated to the disability for which benefits under this Plan are payable, and excluding benefits for total disability due to pneumoconiosis, as defined on September 21,1973, under the Federal Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972;

(iv)	Benefits under any state or federal law providing benefits for working time lost because of disability.
(2)	In determining the amount by which Extended Disability Benefits are reduced:
(i)	The monthly equivalent of benefits paid on a weekly basis is computed by multiplying the weekly benefit rate by 4.33.
(ii)	Lump-sum settlements under state Workers Compensation Laws result in reductions equal to the monthly equivalent of the amount of the Workers Compensation benefit to which the employee would have been entitled under the applicable law had there been no lump-sum payment, but not to exceed in total the amount of the settlement. The amount of such settlement shall be allocated to days of disability for which compensation has not previously been paid, in chronological order until such amount has been fully allocated, at the rate of one-seventh of the weekly Workers Compensation benefit which would have been applicable under the state law if the claim had been allowed and if there had been no lump-sum settlement.
27
Art. II, 7(b)(2)(iii)
(iii)	The amount of a person’s benefit under subsections (b)(l)(ii), (iii) or (iv) above shall not be increased subsequent to the first day for which Extended Disability Benefits are payable, except that the amount of such increase shall not be disregarded if it represents an adjustment in the original determination of the amount of such benefit.
(iv)	The amount of monthly Extended Disability Benefit shall not be reduced by any increase in an employee’s benefit under subsection (b)(l)(i) above that is effective subsequent to the first day for which an employee’s Extended Disability Benefit is reduced because of receipt of such benefit. However, the amount of Extended Disability Benefit shall be reduced by any such increase which represents an adjustment in the original determination of the amount of the employee’s benefit under subsection (b)( 1 )(i).
(3)	Extended Disability Benefit computations presume eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits and pension plan and retirement program disability retirement benefits. However, such presumption of pension plan and retirement program disability retirement benefits shall not be made with respect to any Extended Disability Benefit payments due for the 24-month period immediately following the date of expiration of the maximum number of weeks for which the employee is entitled to receive Sickness and Accident Benefits. Amounts deducted from Extended Disability Benefits on this basis are paid upon presentation of satisfactory evidence that these benefits were applied for and denied; provided, however, that a reduction in Extended Disability Benefits is made in an amount equal to Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits that would have been payable except for refusal to accept vocational rehabilitation services.

Further, the Carrier shall have the right to periodically request recipients of Extended Disability Benefits to complete an authorization form allowing the Social Security Administration to advise the Carrier of the status of a claim for Social Security benefits. Failure to complete and return such authorization within two weeks of die date of such request, will result in the suspension of Extended Disability Benefit payments until receipt of the authorization.
(6)	Any benefits described in subsection (b)(1) above which are awarded retroactively shall be treated as having been received by the employee during the entire time period for which such benefits were payable and any overpayments of Extended Disability Benefits shall be calculated accordingly.
(c)	Commencement and Duration of Benefits
(1)	Extended Disability Benefits to an eligible applicant shall be for the period commencing the day following the last day of disability included within the period for the maximum number of weekly Sickness and Accident Benefits, including weeks in which such Sickness and Accident Benefits were partially or wholly offset because of receipt of Workers Compensation benefits.
(2)	The maximum period during which Extended Disability Benefits may be payable shall be:
(i)	in the case of an employee who has ten or
29
Art. II. 7(c)(2)(f)
more Years of Participation as of the day on which disability commenced, the number of months commencing with the month in which the date of the expiration of the maximum number of weekly Sickness and Accident Benefits occurs and terminating with the end of the month in which the employee attains age 65; and
(ii> in the case of an employee who has less than ten Years of Participation as of the day on which disability commenced, the number of months by which the employee’s Years of Participation at commencement of disability exceed the maximum number of weeks for which the employee is entitled to receive Sickness and Accident Benefits.
In any event, Extended Disability Benefits shall not be payable beyond the date of the employee’s death, the end of the month in which the employee attains age 65, or the date the employee no longer satisfies the disability requirement, except that if the employee becomes disabled at or after age 63 and subsequently becomes eligible for Extended Disability Benefits, such benefits will be payable in accordance with the following schedule:

30
rui. ii, / WtC/
engages in some gainful occupation or employment other than one for which the employee is reasonably qualified by education, training or experience, the employee’s satisfying of the disability requirement shall not be deemed to end, but Extended Disability Benefits shall be suspended for the period of the return to work or the period the employee engages in such occupation or employment.
(3)	If monthly Extended Disability Benefits payable to an employee are discontinued because the employee no longer satisfies the disability requirement, and within two weeks of the effective date of such discontinuance and before the employee returns to work with the Corporation, the employee again becomes disabled so as to satisfy the disability requirement, monthly Extended Disability Benefits will be resumed.
(4)	For purposes of applying the maximum period for monthly Extended Disability Benefits, a month in which such benefits are partially or wholly offset by benefit payments from sources listed in subsection (b)(1), suspended under subsection (c)(2), or not paid between periods of disability under circumstances described under subsection (c)(3), is counted as a full month. Fractions of the first and last month are counted as fractions of a month.
(5)	The cumulative total number of months during any previous periods of eligibility for Extended Disability Benefits, regardless of whether for the same or related disabling condition, reduces the maximum number of monthly benefit payments for which the individual is otherwise eligible under subsection (c)(2)(ii) when Extended Disability Benefits again commence.
(6)	If disability is due to or accompanied by mental incapacity, all or any part of such monthly Extended Disability Benefits may, at the option of the Carrier, be paid to the beneficiary of record of the
31
Art. II, 7(c)(6)
employee or to any other person or institution then in the judgment of the Carrier contributing toward or providing for the care or maintenance of the employee.
(d)	Rehabilitation

ARTICLE IV
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 1.	Amount of Coverage Depends on Base Hourly Rate
(a)	Amounts of Basic Life, Extra Accident, Sickness and Accident, and Extended Disability Benefit coverages are determined by the base hourly rate on the date the employee becomes covered under the Program.
(b)	If the employee is working on an incentive method of pay, the employee’s average earned hourly rate for the four pay periods (or the period of employment, if less) which include and immediately precede the applicable date as set forth in the preceding paragraph is substituted for the base hourly rate specified in the preceding paragraph in determining the amounts of coverage.
(c)	Neither base hourly rate nor average earned hourly rate, as used in this Section, shall include overtime or night shift premiums or any Cost-of-Living Allowance.
(d)	An employee retired under the General Motors Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan, other than on disability retirement, who returns to work while still covered, shall have the amount of such employee’s coverages determined on the employee’s base hourly rate on the date the employee returns to work, subject to reduction as set forth in Article n, Section 2(b).
Section 2.	Amount of Coverage Subsequent to Becoming Covered Under the Program
(a)	Subsequent to the date an employee becomes covered under the Program the amounts of Basic Life, Extra Accident, Sickness and Accident, and Extended
82
Disability Benefit coverages for which such employee is covered shall be based on the employee’s current base hourly rate, except that if the employee is not actively at work on the date when the amount of coverage would change, the employee shall be covered for such changed amount when the employee returns to work.
(b)	Changes in amounts of Basic Life, Extra Accident, Sickness and Accident, and Extended Disability Benefit coverages due to transfers from salaried to hourly payrolls shall become effective on the date of transfer, provided the employee is then actively at work. If the employee is not actively at work on such date, the change will be effective on the date of the employee’s return to work.
(c)	Irrespective of the foregoing, in the event of death or commencement of total disability, if an employee’s base hourly rate on either of the two quarterly review dates (January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1) immediately preceding such employee’s last day worked [or in the case of an employee working on an incentive method of pay, the employee’s average earned hourly rate for the four pay periods in which such employee worked full weeks (or the period of employment, if less) which include and immediately precede the employee’s last day worked] would entitle the employee to larger amounts of Basic Life, Extra Accident, Sickness and Accident, and Extended Disability Benefit coverages than those which were in effect on the date of death or total disability, payment of benefits shall be on the basis of such larger amounts.
(d)	An employee who returns from an occupational disability absence and because of a continuing physical limitation connected with such occupational disability is placed on a job paying a lower base hourly rate than the job such employee held immediately prior to the employee’s disability absence, will have amounts of
83
Art. IV, 2(d)
Basic Life, Extra Accident, Sickness and Accident, and Extended Disability Benefit coverages determined in accordance with the higher base hourly rate of the employee’s former job, as determined by the Schedules of Benefits in Article n, Sections 1 and 5, for as long as the employee receives payments under any applicable Workers Compensation Law in reimbursement for the loss in pay occasioned by such physical limitation.
Section 3.	Benefits for Part-Time Employees
For a part-time employee the benefit amounts set forth in Article II, Sections 1, 5, and 8 shall be payable in the same percentage relationship as the established working hours for such employee’s job is to 40 hours.
Section 4.	Recovery of Benefit Overpayments
(a)	If it is determined that any benefit(s) paid to an employee under Article II should not have been paid or should have been paid in a lesser amount, written notice thereof shall be given to such employee and the employee shall repay the amount of the overpayment to the Carrier; provided, however, that no repayment shall be required if notice has not been given within one year from the date the overpayment was established and the overpayment was caused solely by Carrier error.
(b)	If the employee fails to repay such amount of overpayment promptly, the Carrier shall arrange to recover the amount of the overpayment by making an appropriate deduction or deductions from any future benefit payment or payments payable to the employee under Article II, or may request the Corporation to make or arrange for an appropriate deduction or deductions from any monies then payable, or which may become payable, by the Corporation, or on the Corporation’s behalf, or otherwise, to the employee in the form of wages or benefits.

84
recovering such overpayments from any such present or future wages or benefits which are or become payable to such employee.
(c)	At the direction of the Corporation, the Carrier shall make an appropriate deduction or deductions from any future benefit payment or payments payable to the employee under Article II for the purpose of recovering overpayments made to an employee under any General Motors employee benefit plan.
Amounts so deducted shall be remitted by the Carrier to the applicable benefit plan. The Carrier, by such remittance, shall be relieved of any further liability with respect to such payments.
(d)	If the benefit overpayment is caused by a retroactive award under any state Workers Compensation Law or Act or any Occupational Disease Law or Act and applicable state law allows coordination of benefits resulting in a reduction of such award payable, the Carrier in its sole discretion, may waive part or all of the overpayment in consideration of such benefit coordination.
Section 5.	Recovery of Disability Benefit Advances
If the Corporation makes advances to an employee on account of a claim for disability benefits under the Program and subsequently it is determined that no such benefits are payable or a smaller amount is payable than was anticipated, the employee shall be obligated to repay in cash the amount of such advances or overpayment, as the case may be, upon notice of the amount to be repaid, and, if such repayment is not made within 60 days after request is made by the Corporation for repayment thereof, the amount may be deducted by the Corporation from any wages thereafter payable to the employee.

(b)	Any individual policy of life insurance so issued shall become effective at the end of the 31-day period during which application for such individual policy may be made. If, however, the employee dies during such 31-day period, the insurance company shall pay to the employee’s beneficiary of record, whether or not the employee shall have made application for such i individual policy, the maximum amount of life insurance for which an individual policy could have been issued, excluding any increase in such amount
86
because of Survivor Income Benefit Insurance. In addition, if the employee dies during such 31-day period, the insurance company shall pay any Survivor Income Benefit Insurance which would otherwise be payable in accordance with Article II, Section 8.
Section 7.	Recovery of Loans Not Repaid Under the Guaranteed Income Stream Relocation Loan Program
If an employee fails to repay any loan made to such employee under the Guaranteed Income Stream Relocation Loan Program, benefit amounts due to the employee under the General Motors Life and Disability Benefits Program for Hourly Employees may be withheld and applied to repay to the Corporation the full amount of any loan (including interest) not repaid under the Guaranteed Income Stream Relocation Loan Program, pursuant to written authorization and direction acceptable to the Corporation.

Items Agreed To September 18,2Q03
As discussed during these negotiations General Motors will implement the following procedures:
I.	Subject to the completion of a Reimbursement Agreement form provided by the Corporation, General Motors Disability Advances shall be paid with respect to all claims for Sickness and Accident Benefits involving an alleged work-related injury when General Motors does not voluntarily accept liability under any Workers Compensation Law or Act for an occupational accident if medical evidence of total and continuous disability, satisfactory to the Carrier, is submitted. Such payments shall cease if the Carrier subsequently finds that the claimant is not eligible for Sickness and Accident Benefits.
2.	The Claims Administrator may authorize payment of Sickness and Accident Benefits on a claim previously denied by the Carrier if the claimant submits medical evidence which, in the judgment of the Claims Administrator, would be satisfactory to support payment of the claim.
3.	Sickness and Accident Benefits payable after the seventh day of disability involving an alleged accident shall not be delayed pending a determination by the Carrier as to whether benefits are payable for all or part of the first seven days of disability.
4.	If a dispute arises with respect to whether Sickness and Accident Benefits are payable for all or part of the first seven days of disability for an alleged accident, and a state governmental agency responsible for administration of workers compensation or disability benefits determines that such disability was due to an accident, benefits will be paid in accordance with such determination.
95
Mise, [items Agreea io, aj
5.	The Corporation will encourage medical examiners under the Impartial Medical Opinion Program to discuss their findings concerning a claimant’s disability with the attending physician if there is a question as to the employee’s ability to return to work.
6.	For purposes of coverages provided under Article II of Exhibit B-l to the Supplemental Agreement (Life and Disability Benefits Program) between the parties dated September 18. 2003. and the Corporation contributions for such coverages, an employee who is on an approved vacation in accordance with the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Corporation and the Union dated September 18. 2003. will be considered to be in active service with earnings from the Corporation while on such vacation.
7.	The following outlines the procedures for reducing Sickness and Accident and Extended Disability Benefits by certain Social Security Benefits as provided in Article II, Sections 6(h) and 7(b)(l)(iii) of the Supplemental Agreement Covering Life and Disability Benefits Program.
(a)	In the twenty-fourth week of disability, an employee will be notified of the eligibility requirements for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (DIB). The employee will be advised that, effective with the payment for the twenty-sixth week of disability, Sickness and Accident (and monthly Extended Disability) Benefit computations will presume eligibility for DIB except as provided below. Hie employee will also be advised that, subject to the employee’s completion of a Reimbursement Agreement, the employee may receive unreduced Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefit payments, commencing with the twenty-sixth week of disability, while the employee is otherwise eligible. Further, the employee will be instructed that, if the employee's physician
96
ivh^v, irio'H*	IU)
anticipates that the employee’s disability will not extend beyond twelve months, the employee’s physician should complete a statement indicating such a prognosis. Where such a statement is provided, a reduction of Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefits, based on presumed eligibility for DIB, will not be instituted in the twenty-sixth week of disability.
(b)	In the thirtieth week of disability, any employee whose physician has not completed the statement referenced in (a) above, will be advised to apply for DIB and instructed to complete an authorization form allowing the Social Security Administration to advise the Carrier of its determination. An employee’s failure to complete the authorization form within two weeks from the date of the notice instructing such employee to do so will result in the suspension of an amount of Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefits equal to the presumed amount of DIB until the employee provides satisfactory proof that the authorization form has been completed. The employee also will be advised that the employee may authorize release of information in the Sickness and Accident (and Extended Disability) Benefit claim files to the Social Security Administration.
£fil By the sixtieth week of disability, an employee must submit to the Carrier a notice of award or disallowance of DIB, as applicable. Failure to do so will result in the suspension of an amount of Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefit payments equal to the presumed amount of DIB until the employee provides satisfactory proof of such notice. Upon receipt of a notice of award of DIB. Sickness and Accident and Extended Disability Benefits will be reduced as provided in Article IL Sections 6(h) and WDfiiiL
97
Mise. [Items Agreed lo, /(djj
(d)	Upon receipt of an initial determination of disallowance of DIB, a notice will be sent instructing the employee that within two weeks from the date of the notice the employee must (1) request a Reconsideration, and (2) complete an authorization form allowing the Social Security Administration to advise the Carrier of its determination. Failure to comply with this instruction, request such Reconsideration or complete the authorization form will result in the suspension of an amount of Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefit payments equal to the presumed amount of DIB until the employee provides satisfactory proof that such request has been filed and the authorization form has been completed.
(e)	Upon receipt of a Reconsideration determination of disallowance, the Carrier will review the employee’s disability claim and may send a notice to the employee instructing the employee that within two weeks from the date of the notice the employee must file for a Hearing before an administrative law judge of the Social Security Administration and complete an authorization form allowing the Social Security Administration to advise the Carrier of its determination. Failure to comply with this instruction will result in the suspension of an amount of Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefit payments equal to the presumed amount of DIB until the employee provides satisfactory proof that such request has been filed and the authorization form has been completed.
(£) In the event of a Reconsideration or an administrative law judge Hearing determination denying DIB, and provided any subsequent review does not reverse such determination, the employee will not be required to repay any Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefits otherwise payable, unless such denial of DIB resulted from the employee’s refusal to accept vocational rehabilitation. Where such denial occurs, the
98
rvnoirt	rtyltrtJV <U, /(>/]
employee is obligated to repay Sickness and Accident (and Extended Disability) Benefits in an amount not to exceed the amount of DIB (Primary Insurance Amount only) to which the employee would otherwise have been entitled for the same period or periods of disability.
(g)	In the event an employee files for a Hearing before an administrative law judge pursuant to instructions issued under subsection (e). above, and the administrative law judge determination denies DIB, an amount equal to any reasonable expenses which an employee incurs in conjunction with the Hearing before the administrative law judge will be paid to the employee by the Carrier upon submission of satisfactory proof of such expenses.
(h)	Upon receipt of a notice of award of DIB, any overpayment of Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefits caused by the retroactive award of DIB is to be repaid. The amount of the overpayment will be based on the actual amount (Primary Insurance Amount) of such award.
(i)	In the event of a DIB award resulting from a Reconsideration or Hearing before an administrative law judge, the amount of Sickness and Accident (and Extended Disability) Benefits to be repaid will be reduced by an amount equal to any attorney fees associated with the award, provided the employee makes such repayment within 30 days of the date the employee is notified of the amount to be repaid. This reduction applies only to attorney fees associated with a successful appeal of a denial of DIB and includes only that portion of the attorney’s fee associated with the period of time the employee was entitled to receive Sickness and Accident (and Extended Disability) Benefits. This reduction for such attorney fees may not exceed 25 percent of the repayment due. Attorney fees for services prior to denial of the initial application for DIB will not reduce the amount of repayment due.

(j)	As an alternative, or in addition, to the DIB procedures set forth above, the Carrier may authorize an organization to evaluate an employee’s claim for DIB and represent the employee in the filing of a claim or an appeal for DIB. The cost of such representation will not be paid by the employee. Failure on the part of an employee to comply, in a timely fashion, with reasonable requests from such an organization in conjunction with its representation of the employee, will result in the suspension of an amount of Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefit payments equal to the presumed amount of DIB until the employee complies with such requests.
(k)	An employee age 65 or older may be entitled to Retirement Benefits as early as the first day of total disability. No reduction of Sickness and Accident Benefits shall be made until the employee provides evidence that the employee is receiving Retirement Benefits.
(I)	In addition to the requirements set forth in (b), (d) and (e) above, the Carrier shall have the right to require the employee to complete an authorization form allowing the Social Security Administration to advise the Carrier of the status of a claim for DIB. An employee’s failure to complete such authorization form within two weeks from the date of the notice informing such employee of such requirement will result in the suspension of an amount of Sickness and Accident (or Extended Disability) Benefit payments equal to the presumed amount of DIB until such time as the authorization form is completed.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties agreed that, provisions of the National Agreement between the parties dated September 18.2003 to the contrary notwithstanding, a laid-off employee who had seniority on the last day of work prior to layoff, and who either broke seniority during the term of the 1979 or subsequent National Agreements, under the provisions of Paragraph 64(e), and who is rehxred at the same plant during the term of such 2003 National Agreement, but more than 24 months following such employee's last day worked, and who reacquires seniority and receives an adjusted seniority date upon completion of the employee's probationary period, will have eligibility for coverages and the amount and type of coverages provided under the Life and Disability Benefits Program determined on the basis of such adjusted seniority date, but the effective date of such coverages shall be no earlier than the date on which the employee is actively at work after completing the employee's probationary period.
For the purpose of determining the effective date of coverages for an employee who had acquired seniority during the term of the 1979 or subsequent National Agreements, the eligibility provisions of the respective Program, rather than the 2003 Program, will apply.
For the purpose of determining eligibility for Basic Life, Extra Accident, Survivor Income Benefit, Sickness and Accident and Extended Disability Benefit coverages, an employee's adjusted seniority date shall be deemed to be such employee's most recent date of hire.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties recognized the need to move ahead with the development of technological applications to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees.
1.	The parties recognized the need to provide the necessary tools to Local Union Benefit Representatives so that they may improve the service they are providing to hourly employees. Local Union Benefit Representatives require basic information that can be accessed quickly in order to confidently and accurately answer many of the questions they receive. Therefore, the parties have designed a process, the Benefits Data Access System, whereby Local Union Benefit Representatives have access to certain data elements from several benefit data systems. The Benefits Data Access System provides inquiry only access to Local Union Benefit Representatives who complete a computer training program. Access is limited to information for UAW hourly employees at their particular location.
2.	The parties jointly will develop and implement a new benefit documentation feature to the existing Benefits Data Access System that will be available to Local Union Benefit Representatives. The system will include benefit plan booklets, administrative manuals (where applicable), relevant contract provisions and appropriate process descriptions. Upon approval by the

Under such pilot program, the Social Security Administration will eliminate the Reconsideration level in the current appeal process and add (at the discretion of the initial claims examiner) a claimant conference to the initial application review level.
In regard to such changes, the Parties agreed that implementation of this pilot program, and possible future expansion of these changes, necessitates a revision to the procedures set forth in Miscellaneous [Items Agreed To, 7(d) and (e)l The Parties further agreed, where no Reconsideration level is available, the claimant will be encouraged to participate in any conference offered by the Social Security Administration as part of the initial application process. As outlined in the current DIB procedures referenced above, the Carrier will determine if the claimant is required io file for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge following an initial determination of disallowance.
If the final process revisions released by the Social Security Administration or any future changes vary substantively from those assumed in this letter or from the process set forth in Miscellaneous [Items Agreed To, 7], the parties will meet to determine any required action.
Very truly yours,

In that event the matters covered by this Agreement shall be the subject of further negotiation between the Corporation and the Union.

(2)	With respect to any period of continuous layoff, changes in an employee’s seniority subsequent to the date layoff begins shall not change the number of months of Corporation contributions for which such employee is eligible.
(3)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Article HI, Section 3(b) of the Program with respect to the requirement of unbroken seniority for continuation of coverages while on layoff, such provisions shall not prevent the continuation of coverages during a period of layoff for which the Corporation would otherwise contribute the full cost of coverages under this subsection (b).
(4)	The months of continuation as determined herein are subject to adjustment under the “Regeneration” provisions of Article HI, Section 3(b).
(c)	Unless otherwise specifically provided herein,

(b)	The options afforded the Corporation to provide coverages supplementary to any Federal coverages or to substitute coverages for the coverages provided by the Federal laws as provided in Article I, Sections 4(a) and (b), respectively, of the Program shall be exercised only by mutual agreement between the Corporation and the Union.
(c)	The options afforded the Corporation to provide or withdraw coverages, to select carriers, or to change any other terms or conditions as provided for in the Program shall be exercised only by mutual agreement between the Corporation and the Union.
(d)	If, in any locality a carrier fails to provide health care coverages set forth in the Program in reasonable conformance with the Program provisions, by mutual agreement between the Corporation and the Union, supplementary or replacement coverages shall be provided through another carrier.

If such benefits exceed the benefits provided under the Program and the Corporation’s contributions for such benefits under the Program, the Corporation may require from such enrollees such contributions as it may deem appropriate for such excess benefits.
If, as a result of such laws, the level of benefits provided for any group of enrollees is generally lower than the corresponding level of benefits under the Program, the Corporation may, at its option and to the extent it finds it practicable, provide a plan of benefits supplementary to the Federal benefits to the extent necessary to make total benefits as nearly comparable as practicable to the benefits provided under the Program.
(b)	Substitution of Applicable Provisions of the Program for Benefits Under Federal Laws
The provisions of subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, the Corporation may, if Federal laws permit, substitute a plan of benefits for the benefits provided by the Federal laws referred to in subsection (a) above, and modify the provisions of the Program to the extent and in the respects necessary to secure the approval of such substitution from the appropriate governmental authority and may make such plan available to enrollees.

Art. 1, 4(c)
(c)	Reduction of Health Care Benefits Because of Benefits Under Federal Law
Health care benefits, separately or in combination, provided enrollees under the Program may be reduced by the amount of such benefits provided under any Federal health security act or any other law which may be amended or enacted. In cases where the enrollee exercises an option under the Federal Social Security Act or similar law to take cash payments in lieu of health care benefits, the equivalent of such payments will be required as a contribution toward the health care coverages provided under the Program, but not to exceed the cost to the Corporation of such coverages. Such contributions may be deducted, in accordance with any applicable Federal laws, from any monies then payable to the enrollee in the form of wages or benefits payable under any General Motors benefit plan or program.
Section 5.	Treatment of Existing Coverages on Effective Date
(a)	Protection of employees currently covered under the Program shall be terminated on the effective dates of the provisions of the amended Program as to employees working on such effective dates, and the benefits provided by the Program shall be in lieu of and substitute for any and all other plans and benefits thereunder providing for health care benefits of any kind or nature, in which the Corporation participates.
(b)	All employees currently covered under the Program who are not eligible to become covered on the effective date of the Program, as amended, or to whom any provision of the Program, as amended, is not applicable, shall be covered in accordance with the conditions, provisions, and limitations of the Program as constituted on the date each such employee was last actively at work as if such Program were being

(a)	Except as set forth below, the Investment Funds Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors shall be the Named Fiduciary with respect to the Program. The Investment Funds Committee may delegate authority to carry out such of its responsibilities as it deems proper to the extent permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. General Motors Investment Management Corporation (GMIMCO) is the Named Fiduciary of the Program for purposes of investment of Program assets. GMIMCO may delegate authority to carry out such of its responsibilities as it deems proper to the extent permitted by The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Section 7.	Coordination of Benefits (COB)
(a)	General Provisions
Health care benefits paid under this Program shall not duplicate benefits from other sources (e.g., group
13
Art. I, 7(a)
plans, comprehensive plans, pre-paid plans, governmental plans, etc.), nor serve to relieve other persons or organizations of their liability (contractual or otherwise). Consistent with these objectives, the Corporation may establish systems and procedures for coordination of benefits, and the carriers shall implement such systems and procedures.
(b)	Applicability
(1)	The provisions of this Section shall apply to all coverages provided under the Program. Unless precluded by law, these provisions apply whether the coverage is self-funded, or provided through pre-paid options such as health maintenance organizations.
(2)	This Program shall not coordinate with individual or family policies of insurance purchased by the enrollee or with any group policy covering the enrollee for which the enrollee pays more than one-half the cost.
(3)	The provisions of this Section shall not apply to expenses for services provided to or for an enrollee in relation to any condition, disease, illness or injury arising out of or in the course of employment, as such expenses are specifically excluded from the Program.
(4)	The provisions of this Section shall not apply to Federal or State Medicare or Medicaid. However, they do apply to complementary coverage carried to supplement benefits available under such Federal or State programs and to other employers’ plans or programs which may be primary to Medicare by virtue of Federal law.
(c)	Enrollee Obligations
(1)	Primary enrollees shall furnish to the Corporation the social security numbers of all secondary enrollees for whom they are claiming eligibility and for
14
Art 1,7(c)(1)
whom they are required to provide a social security number to claim an exemption on the primary enrollee’s Federal income tax return. If the secondary enrollee has not been assigned a social security number at the time of enrollment, a social security number shall be obtained promptly and reported to the Corporation. Failure to do so shall result in cancellation of coverages for such secondary enrollee.
(2)	Any enrollee claiming benefits under this Program shall furnish the Program or the carriers) any information necessary for the purpose of administering these provisions.
(d)	Release of Information
(1)	The Program or carriers may release to other plans or carriers information necessary to adjudicate claims under these provisions, as permitted by applicable regulations,
(2)	The Program, or carriers under this Program* may participate in organizations which are established to facilitate the COB process and may exchange information relating to enrollees for such purposes.
Such organizations must agree not to release any information obtained other than for the purpose of effectuating COB.
(e)	Determining Priority
(1)	The program which, under the rules of this subsection, has the first obligation to pay benefits is termed the “primary” program, and the coverages it provides are “primary.” The other program (and the coverages it provides) is termed “secondary.”
(2)	When the other program does not contain a COB provision, that program is always primary.
15
Art. 1,7(e)(3)
(3)	When the other program contains a COB provision and the order of benefit determination under both programs' COB provisions establish this Program as primary, the provisions of this Program determine this Program’s liability, regardless of any payment the other program may have made.
(4)	When the other program contains a COB provision, the following order of benefit determination will be used.
(i)	The program covering the enrollee as an employee will be primary over the program covering the enrollee as a dependent.
(ii)	When the enrollee is a dependent child whose parents are not divorced or separated, the program covering the enrollee as a dependent of the parent whose birthday occurs earlier in the calendar year will be primary over the program covering the enrollee as a dependent of the parent whose birthday occurs later in the calendar year. If the two parents’ birthdays fall on the same day, the program which has covered the parent for the longer period of time will be primary,
(iii)	When the enrollee is a dependent child whose parents are divorced or separated, and if there is a court order establishing financial responsibility with respect to health care expenses of the child, the program which covers the child as a dependent of the parent with such responsibility shall be primary.
If there is no court order, and the parent having custody of the child has not remarried, the program covering the child as a dependent of the parent with custody shall be primary. If there is no court order and if the parent having custody has remarried, the program covering the child as a dependent of the parent having custody shall be primary, any program covering the child as a dependent of the stepparent shall be
16
Art. 1,7(e)(4)(iii)
secondary, and the program covering the child as a dependent of the parent without custody shall determine its liability last.
(iv)	When rules (i), (ii), and (iii) above do not establish an order of benefit determination, the program which has covered the enrollee for the longer period of time will be primary. However, if one program covers the enrollee as an active employee (or dependent of such employee) and the other covers the enrolleeas a laid-off or retired employee (or dependent of such employee), the program covering the enrollee as an active employee (or dependent of such employee) shall be primary. Also, if the other program does not have a provision regarding laid-off or retired employees, and as a result both programs take a secondary position under their respective rules, the provisions of this subsection (iv) shall not apply and the rules of the other program shall determine which program is primary,
(f)	Payment of Benefits
(1)	If this Program is primary, a carrier may reimburse a secondary program for any amounts paid by such program which should have been provided by this Program.
(2)	If benefits under this Program are overpaid by a carrier for any claim involving COB, the carrier shall have the right to recover such overpayment from the hospital, physician, or other provider of service, from the other program, or from the primary enrollee, as appropriate. Alternatively, the Corporation may recover on its own behalf, under Section 9 below.
(3)	With regard to any claim for which this Program has secondary liability, benefits provided under this Program shall not exceed the amount of benefits payable if this Program had been primary.
17
Art I, 7(f)(4)
(4)	“Benefits paid or payable” under another program include the benefits that would have been payable had a claim been made under the primary program, or which would have been payable by the primary program but for the enrollee’s failure to comply with the provisions of such program. When a program provides benefits in the form of services rather than cash payments, the reasonable cash value of each service rendered will be deemed to be a benefit payable by such program.
. (5) When this Program is secondary,
(i)	sanctions provided under this Program (e.g., for failure to obtain predetermination, for failure to obtain a required second opinion, for failure to obtain services from a panel provider, etc.) will not apply,
(ii)	payment will be made only to the level which would have been paid by this Program had it been primary, and
(iii)	no payment will be made for services which are not covered under this Program.
Section 8.	Reimbursement for Third Party Liability
(a)	If health care benefits are paid to, or on behalf of, an enrollee and if the enrollee makes recovery from a third party, individual or organization for any covered expenses for which benefits were paid, the Program shall be entitled to reimbursement in an amount equal to the benefits paid to, or on behalf of, the enrollee under this Program. This shall not apply to policies of insurance issued to and in the name of such enrollee. Carriers administering the Program shall take such actions as may be necessary to preserve or assert such right of reimbursement on the Program’s behalf.
18
Art. I, 8(b)
(b)	The enrollee shall perform such acts and shall execute and deliver to the Corporation or the carrier such instruments and papers as may be necessary to secure such rights of reimbursement.
Section 9.	Recovery of Benefit Overpayments
If it is determined that any benefit(s) paid to, or on behalf of, an enrollee under this Program should not have been paid or should have been paid in a lesser amount, written notice thereof shall be given to the applicable primary enrollee and such primary enrollee shall repay the amount of the overpayment.
If the primary enrollee fails to repay such amount of overpayment promptly, the Corporation shall arrange to recover the amount of such overpayment by making an appropriate deduction or deductions from any monies then payable, or which may become payable, by the Corporation or on the Corporation’s behalf, or otherwise, to the primary enrollee in the form of wages or benefits. The Corporation shall have the right, in accordance with applicable Federal laws, to make, or to arrange to have made, deductions for recovering such overpayments from any such present or future wages or benefits which are or become payable to such employee.
Section 10.	Compliance with Federal Laws
Notwithstanding any provisions of the Program to the contrary, the Corporation shall modify administration, coverages and other terms and conditions of the Program, as necessary, to comply with applicable federal laws and regulations.
Section 11,	Protected Health Information (PHI)

ARTICLE II
HEALTH CARE COVERAGES
Section 1.	Establishment of Health Care
Coverages
(a)	Core Coverages
The Corporation shall continue its arrangements to make core coverages (hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug, and hearing aid coverages as set forth in Appendix A and mental health and substance abuse coverages as set forth in Appendix B) available. Collectively, the coverages shall be known as the Informed Choice Plan.
(b)	Non-Core Coverages
The Corporation shall continue its arrangements to make non-core coverages (dental and vision coverages as set forth in Appendices C and D, respectively, to this Program) available.
Section 2.	Uniform National Health Care Coverages
(a)	The Corporation shall provide uniform health care coverages, nationwide, as described in this Program and Appendices A, B, C, and D hereto, through arrangements with appropriate carriers.
An. ii, 2(b)
(b)	Core coverages (other than mental health and substance abuse) for enrollees shall be those provided under a national system by agreement between the Corporation and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, hereinafter referred to as the Control Plan, or by agreement with other earners.
(c)	The Control Plan shall have responsibility for assuring that the core coverages as defined in Appendix A are provided and administered uniformly for Traditional option and Preferred Provider Organization option enrollees.
All carriers agreeing to provide such coverages under the Program, shall do so in accordance with interpretations and benefit practices established by the Control Plan.
(d)	Under the national system each carrier with a written agreement with the Control Plan will provide uniform core coverages, as described in Appendix A, in the carrier’s respective geographic area. If in any geographic area a carrier fails to enter into the agreement as stated above, or fails to perform in accordance with its agreement, the Control Plan, with the approval of the Corporation, shall provide such health care coverages in the geographic area or arrange with another carrier to do so.
(e)	Core and non-core coverages may be provided through the Health Maintenance Organization option. However, the coverages provided through this option may vary from the coverages described in Appendices A, B, and D.
Section 3.	Replacement or Supplementation of Coverages
If in its judgment the Corporation considers it advisable in the interest of the enrollees in any geographic area,
24
Art. II, 3
another arrangement may be substituted in such area or areas for all or part of the coverages referred to in Section 1 above.
Section 4.	Selection of Option in the informed Choice Plan
The Corporation will make arrangements to provide an opportunity for primary enrollees to elect to have core coverages provided through one of the options available under the Informed Choice Plan. Such election also may include a choice among dental options, where applicable. The specific choices offered to a primary enrollee will depend on the availability of approved options in rhe enrollee’s geographic area and Medicare status of the primary and secondary enrollees. The options are as follows:
(a)	Preferred Provider Organization Option
This option provides core coverages, as described in Appendix A, through access to a panel of providers who have agreed to provide services under the terms of participation established by the preferred provider organization such as limits on fees, and controls on quality and utilization. In order to receive full benefits for certain covered services, such services must be obtained through the organization's panel of providers,
(1)	A preferred provider organization assumes responsibility for conducting utilization reviews, predetermination of services, or other reviews necessary to promote quality of care and control costs. A preferred provider organization may place the panel physician and other providers at financial risk through capitation, withholding of a percentage of fees, or other mechanisms, or if not, will have other means to monitor and control utilization by individual providers on a continuous basis.
cjg
25

Art. II, 4(a)(2)
(2)	A preferred provider organization assumes responsibility for selection and periodic evaluation of hospitals, physicians, pharmacists, laboratories, and other providers to ensure sufficient numbers and types of providers who are geographically distributed to allow adequate access for enrollees.
(3)	A preferred provider organization assumes responsibility for providing the scope and level of benefits set forth in Appendix A, monitoring the appropriateness of referrals to non-panel providers, taking affirmative corrective action with respect to providers when necessary, and implementing and maintaining other administrative processes as required by the Corporation.
(4)	Payment for covered services provided by non-panei providers, unless the enrollee is referred by a panel provider, will be 80% of the non-panel provider’s reasonable and customary charges for the same service or, if less, the actual charges. The reimbursement to providers by the preferred provider organization will be reduced to reflect any waiver or forgiveness by a provider of the remaining 20%.
Under this subsection, the 80% limitation on payment for charges payable to non-panel providers by the preferred provider organization shall not be applicable (i) to an individual enrollee who has incurred personal expense under this provision of $1.000 for such covered services in a calendar year or (ii) to the covered members of the enrollee’s family, if any, after the enrollee and such members have incurred a total of $2.000 in personal expense under this provision for such covered services in the same calendar year.
(5)	Preferred provider organizations may seek Corporation approval to establish special contractual relationships with providers not otherwise included under the Program (e.g., freestanding ambulatory
26
Art. Il, 4(a)(5)
surgical centers), when it can be shown that doing so will improve quality of care and enhance cost competitiveness.
(6)	Mental health and substance abuse coverage is administered in accordance with the terms and conditions of Appendix B.
(b)	Health Maintenance Organization Option
This option provides coverages to enrollees through physicians, hospitals, and other providers who have agreed to provide services under the terms established by the health maintenance organization to limit fees, assure quality, and control utilization.
(1)	The types of coverages and the scope and level of coverages provided under this option may vary among health maintenance organizations and may be different than the coverages set forth in Appendices A, B, andD.
W

'fii
(2)	Most health maintenance organizations provide health care coverages (including preventive care) that generally are managed for the enrollee by a primary care physician. The primary care physician is responsible for referring the patient to other providers of service. If such referral is not obtained, the enrollee may be responsible for charges incurred.
(3)	Under this option, if an enrollee receives services from a non-health maintenance organization provider, in a non-emergency situation or without a referral, such services may not be covered.
(4)	The Corporation pays a capitated fee to health maintenance organizations for enrollees electing coverage through this option. The fee paid is based upon a comparison of the monthly rates of the health maintenance organization and those of the base option in the rating area. When the health maintenance

Art. li, 4(b)(4)
organization’s rates are higher than those of the base option, the enrollee may be required to make a contribution.
(c)	Traditional Option
This option provides core coverages described in Appendix A with predetermination and review procedures required in order to receive full benefits for certain covered services. These procedures include but are not limited to predetermination (which includes, but is not limited to, prior authorization or assessment for non-emergency inpatient admissions, and second opinions for selected procedures), concurrent utilization review, retrospective utilization review, and focused utilization review. In some instances, special programs (such as foot surgery predetermination or predetermination of specific outpatient procedures) will be developed and implemented, as necessary and practicable, to address specific utilization problems.
(1)	Benefits for certain covered services, which require predetermination, when provided without obtaining necessary predetermination approvals will be administered according to Program standards including the provision that such services be payable at 80% of reasonable and customary charges after the first $100 of expense for such services. The reimbursement to providers will be reduced to reflect any waiver or forgiveness by a provider of the $100 or remaining 20%.
(2)	Under this subsection, the 80% payment limitation and the requirement that payment be made for the first $100 of covered expenses shall not be applicable (i) to an individual enrollee who has incurred a personal expense of $750 under this provision for such covered services in a calendar year or (ii) to the covered members of the enrollee’s family, if any, after the enrollee and such members have incurred a total of $1,500 in personal expense under this provision for such covered services in the same calendar year.

(4)	When a husband and wife both qualify as primary enrollees, each may make a separate election. However, no individual may have coverage as both a primary and a secondary enrollee, nor as a secondary enrollee under more than one primary enrollee.
(5)	If a primary enrollee’s coverage otherwise available under this Program is waived or canceled, and based upon such waiver or cancellation the primary enrollee receives some financial consideration under any other Corporation plan or program, such primary enrollee shall be precluded from coverage as a secondary enrollee under another person’s coverage, for a period of time equal to that upon which such consideration is based. This provision also applies to secondary enrollees, if any, included in the waiver or cancellation on which such consideration is based.

(2)	The provisions of this Section 9 apply with respect to enrollment of certain dependents as secondary enrollees under primary enrollees who elect “self and spouse,” “self and child,” or “self and family”
42
Art. Hl. 9(a)(2)
enrollment, in accordance with Article III, Section 1(a)(1) of the Program and to enrollment of sponsored dependents under subsection (e) below. Unless specifically provided otherwise in the Program, such a dependent has no individual or personal right of enrollment, right to select an option within the Informed Choice Plan, or right to continue coverages under the Program.
(3)	The Corporation shall have the right of determining eligibility of a dependent, consistent with the provisions of this Program.
(4)	A primary enrollee claiming initial or continuing eligibility of a dependent shall furnish whatever documentation may be necessary to substantiate the claimed eligibility of a dependent and the social security number of each such dependent for whom a social security number is required to claim an exemption on the primary enrollee’s Federal income tax return. Refusal or failure to furnish such documentation when requested to do so, or to furnish the social security number within a reasonable period of time, shall result in denial or withdrawal of eligibility for such dependent.
(5)	Unless otherwise provided, a dependent who loses eligibility in accordance with the provisions of this Program, and who once again meets the requirements for dependent eligibility, may have coverage reinstated. The effective date of coverage in such cases will be the first day of the month following the month in which a valid enrollment form and any necessary supporting documentation is received by the Corporation.
(6)	When, as a result of oversight or error, an eligible primary or secondary enrollee entitled to Corporation-paid coverage is not enrolled in a timely manner, coverage may be provided retroactive to the date of eligibility that would have been established if proper processing had occurred. However, in no event
43
Art. HI. 9(a)(6)
will the retroactivity exceed twelve (12) months from the month in which the error or omission is discovered.
This retroactive enrollment provision shall not apply to surviving spouses who are not entitled to Corporation-paid coverage. Such surviving spouses electing to continue coverages on a self-paid basis must make such election as stipulated in Article HI, Section 8(b)(6). This retroactive enrollment provision also shall not apply to principally supported children or sponsored dependents, as discussed in subsections (d) and (e) respectively below.
(7)	The receipt of a benefit under The General Motors Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan as an “alternate payee” in accordance with the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 shall not serve to entitle such recipient to coverages or continuation of coverages under this Program.
(8)	Provisions will be made for the enrollment and administration of coverage for an individual determined to qualify for coverage pursuant to Qualified Medical Child Support Orders (QMCSO) under the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA ‘93).

44
Art. Ill, 9(b)(2)
the status as may be necessary by law and required by the Corporation.
(3)	The effective date of coverage for a spouse shall be the later of the effective date of coverage for die employee or retiree, or the date of marriage. For a common-law spouse, the effective date of coverage shall be the date of receipt by the Corporation of a completed enrollment form and any necessary supporting documentation.
(4)	A spouse’s eligibility for coverage shall cease on the earlier of:
(i)	the date the primary enrollee’s coverage ceases, except that, in the case of the primary enrollee's death, coverage shall cease on the last day of the month in which the primary enrollee dies, unless the spouse is eligible for coverage as a surviving spouse as set forth in Section 8 of this Article, or
(ii)	the date of the final decree of divorce.

Under the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA *93), a child under the age of 18 who is in the process of being adopted by an employee or retiree will be deemed to satisfy the relationship test when the child is placed and takes up residence with the employee or retiree, pursuant to the adoption process.
45
Art. Ill, 9(c)(1)(ii)
(ii)	Age. The child must not have reached the end of the calendar year in which the child becomes age 25, unless such child has been determined to be totally and permanently disabled prior to the end of that year. For the purposes of this subsection, “totally and permanently disabled” means having any medically determinable physical or mental condition which prevents the child from engaging in substantial gainful activity and which can be expected to result in death or be of long-continued or indefinite duration.
Coverage will not be reinstated for a child who first becomes totally and permanently disabled after the end of the calendar year in which age 25 is attained or who was eligible for coverage as a totally and permanently disabled child, recovers, and, after the end of such calendar year, again becomes so disabled.
(iii)	Marital Status. The child must be unmarried.
(iv)	Residency. The child must reside with the primary enrollee, as a member of such enrollee’s household or, if not a member of the household, such enrollee must be legally responsible for the provision of health care for the child (such as children of certain divorced parents, legal guardianships, children confined in training institutions, or children in school).
(v)	Dependency. The child must be dependent upon the primary enrollee, or upon the spouse of an eligible and enrolled employee or retiree. This requirement shall be waived with respect to a child (by birth, legal adoption or legal guardianship) of a divorced employee or retiree, if the divorce decree, or order of the court of proper jurisdiction, or amendment of such decree or order, stipulates that such employee or retiree is legally responsible for providing health care coverage for such child.
46
Art. HI, 9(c)(2)
(2)	An eligible surviving spouse may not enroll a child unless the child was eligible to be enrolled prior to the death of the employee or retiree or, in the case of a child bom after the death of the employee or retiree, unless such child is the issue of the surviving spouse’s marriage to the deceased employee or retiree, and was conceived prior to such employee’s or retiree’s death.-
(3)	The effective date of coverage for a child shall be the later of the effective date of coverage for the primary enrollee, or in the case of:
(i)	Birth - the date of birth;
(ii)	Legal Adoption - the date the adoption becomes final in accordance with applicable laws (or, for children being adopted and who meet the criteria of OBRA ‘93, the date the child is placed and resides with the adopting employee or retiree);
(iii)	Legal Guardianship - the date guardianship becomes final in accordance with applicable laws; and
(iv)	Stepchild - the date the child becomes a member of the employee’s or retiree’s household.
(4)	A child, as defined above, shall cease to be eligible for coverage as of:
(i)	the date of marriage of such child;
(ii)	the last day of the month in which the child ceases to be dependent upon the primary enrollee, or upon the spouse of an eligible and enrolled employee or retiree, unless the exception in subsection (c)(l)(v) applies;
(iii)	the last day of the month in which the child ceases to meet the residency criteria of subsection (c)(l)(iv) above;
(iv)	the last day of the calendar year in which
47
Art Ill, 9(c)(4)(rv)
the child becomes age 25, except in the case of a totally and permanently disabled child (in the event coverage for a totally and permanently disabled child is continued, eligibility for such coverage shall cease as of the last day of the month in which the child ceases to be totally and permanently disabled as defined by this Program); or
(v)	the date the primary enrollee’s coverage ceases, except that, in the case of the primary enrollee’s death, coverage for such dependent child shall cease on the last day of the month in which the primary enrollee dies, unless such child is eligible for coverage as a dependent child of the surviving spouse of such employee or retiree.
(5)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Program, the Program shall provide coverages in accordance with Section 4301 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA *93) and Section 609 of ERISA. The Corporation will maintain reasonable procedures related to the implementation of Qualified Medical Child Support Order and other aspects of the Federal regulations.

self-paid basis, from the carrier with whom enrolled at the time eligibility terminated.

Section 11.	Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) Continuation
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA, or the Act), as amended, provides continuation rights to certain employees or dependents who would ordinarily lose eligibility for coverage under the Program.
If amendments to the Act or the applicable regulations preclude administration in accordance with the following provisions, the Corporation will make any changes necessary to comply with COBRA.
(a)	For purposes of COBRA, this Program is considered to be a single plan offering “core coverages” (hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug, hearing aid, mental health and substance abuse) and “non-core coverages" (dental and vision), regardless of the carrier option (Traditional, Preferred Provider Organization, Health Maintenance Organization, alternative dental plan, etc.) chosen by the primary enrollee, or of the entity chosen by the Corporation to administer such coverages on the Corporation’s behalf.
(b)	The Corporation is responsible for providing notifications, as required under COBRA, to “qualified beneficiaries,” as defined therein. The Corporation may delegate the administrative functions associated with COBRA.
(c)	To the extent the Corporation makes alternative
53
Arttt. 11{c)
continuation privileges available under Article Hl of the Program that do not satisfy all the requirements for “COBRA continuation coverage,” enrollees shall have the opportunity to elect either the COBRA continuation coverage or continuation under the Program. An election of COBRA continuation coverage will terminate the enrollee’s eligibility for Program continuation.
(d)	To the extent the Corporation makes alternative continuation privileges available under Article HI of the Program that do satisfy all of the requirements for “COBRA continuation coverage,” such alternative continuation privileges will be integrated with the COBRA continuation coverage.
(e)	In the event a primary enrollee is entitled to elect between COBRA continuation coverage and alternative continuation provided under the Program, coverage will be continued beyond the point coverage as an active employee or dependent of an active employee ceases as if the primary enrollee elected alternative continuation under the Program. If the primary enrollee subsequently elects COBRA continuation during the election period and pays any required contribution, coverages will be adjusted retroactively to provide the COBRA continuation.
(f)	Unless advised otherwise by a COBRA “qualified beneficiary,” an election of alternative continuation by the primary enrollee shall be presumed to be an election for all other enrollees and/or qualified beneficiaries covered under such primary enrollee’s coverage.

Analysis of various reports displaying such data as provider/patient profiles, procedure profiles, utilization profiles and covered vision expense payment summaries to:
(1)	evaluate the patterns of utilization, cost trends and quality of care;
(2)	establish guidelines and norms with respect to profiles of practice in order to identify providers with either a high or low percentage of prescriptions issued in relation to the number of enrollees examined, with a high percentage of lenses provided under vision coverage that fail the minimum perception criteria for new lenses or other departures from the guidelines; and
(3)	establish the percentage of vision benefits that are paid to participating providers.
(b)	Price Reviews
Where possible, price reviews or other audit techniques shall be conducted to examine records, invoices and laboratory facilities and materials and to
216
Mise. (Vision Coverage, 2. (b))
verify that charges for enrollees are the same as for other patients. These examinations may include enrollee interviews and clinical evaluations of services received.
(c)	Evaluation of Services Received
On a random or selective basis, enrollees who have received services under vision coverage will be selected for subsequent evaluation and examination by consulting providers to ensure that the services reported were actually provided and were performed in accordance with accepted professional standards. Such evaluations may include (1) reexaminations to determine the accuracy of the prescription, (2) the quality of lenses and frames, (3) whether the vision testing examinations administered by providers conform to professional standards, and (4) other aspects of the services provided.
(d)	Survey of Services Received
On a random or selective basis, enrollees who have received services under vision coverage may be sent a questionnaire to:
(1)	determine the level of satisfaction with respect to these services;
(2)	determine whether services for which vision benefits were paid were actually received;
(3)	determine whether providers recommend unnecessary optional services or supplies; and
(4)	identify other problem areas.
(e)	Claims Processing
The carrier may conduct audits of claims being processed such as an analysis of enrollee histories and screening for duplicate payments in addition to the normal eligibility, benefit and charge verifications.
217
Mise. (Vision Coverage, 2. (f))
(f)	Peer Review
When the carrier or an enrollee does not agree with the appropriateness of charge or service provided, an appeal procedure involving peer review may be utilized. Peer review may also be used to resolve situations involving providers with aberrant utilization patterns. The carrier will seek to establish peer review where it does not exist.

UNDERSTANDINGS WITH RESPECT TO UTILIZATION REVIEW
AND COST CONTAINMENT
All carriers shall implement and maintain processes for predetermination, concurrent utilization review, retrospective utilization review and focused utilization review and case management consistent with the criteria set forth below and in the Informed Choice Plan. Administration Manual. The Control Plan shall have responsibility for assuring that local plans under the National Account Program have such utilization review processes in their respective local plan areas.
Definitions:
Predetermination:
The process by which the necessity for a given health care service, appropriateness of the service or the proposed setting for the service, is reviewed and approved by a carrier before the performance of such service. The review and approval are performed by qualified health care professionals, as determined by the Control Plan, employed or retained by the carriers, using accepted standards to examine pertinent medical documentation of the need, appropriateness and setting for such service.
Concurrent Utilization Review:
The process by which the continued need for inpatient treatment is reviewed while the patient is receiving inpatient care. Determination of the need for continuation of such treatment is performed by qualified health care professionals, as determined by the Control Plan, employed or retained by the carriers, using accepted standards to review pertinent medical documentation of such need.
219
Mise. (Utilization Review)
Retrospective Utilization Review:
The process by which the necessity, appropriateness, and setting of a given health care service is reviewed following the performance of the service.

Attention: Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department
Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
As we discussed during negotiations, national health care reform is an important objective for the Corporation and the Union as well. Consequently, the parties have participated in a number of joint activities at the state level and in Washington. The Corporation and Union seek to achieve health care reform that will address issues that are important to the welfare of the U.S. auto industry and specifically to the well-being of the Corporation and its employees.
The impact national health reform may have on the Health Care Program (hereinafter 'the Program”) cannot be predicted with any certainty. Because these matters are unsettled, the Corporation and Union have agreed to maintain the following understandings regarding national health insurance:
Notwithstanding Article I, Section 4 of the Program, if, during the term of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Corporation and the Union signed today, any national health insurance act (other than a Workers Compensation or occupational health law) is enacted or amended to provide any health care benefits for employees, retired employees, surviving spouses, and their dependents, which in whole ar in part duplicate or may be integrated with the benefits under the Program, the benefits under the Program shall be modified in whole or in any part, so as to integrate or so as to eliminate any duplication of such benefits
225
Mise. (NHI)
with the benefits provided by such federal law. This integration shall be designed to maintain such integrated benefits as nearly comparable as practicable to the benefits provided in the Program. Such integration shall not result in persons covered under the Program having to pay deductibles or copayments for benefits which they would not otherwise pay under the Program:
If any such federal law is enacted or amended, as provided in the paragraph above, the Corporation will pay, beginning with the date benefits under such law become available and continuing through the expiration of the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, any premiums, taxes or contributions that employees who are eligible for Corporation-paid coverages under the Program may be required to pay under the law for benefits which may be integrated with the Program;
This includes payments that are specifically earmarked or.designated for the purpose of financing the program of benefits provided by law, in addition to any premiums, taxes or contributions required of the Corporation by law. If such premiums, taxes or contributions are based on wages, the Corporation will pay only the premiums, taxes or contributions applicable to wages received from the Corporation; and
Any savings realized by the Corporation from integrating or eliminating any duplication of benefits provided under the Program with the benefits provided by law shall be retained by the Corporation.
These understandings are conditioned on the Corporation's obtaining and maintaining such governmental approvals as may be required to permit the integration of the benefits provided under the Program with the benefits provided by any such law; otherwise the Corporation and the Union shall meet and develop an acceptable alternative to accomplish the intent of this letter for the remaining term of the Agreement The parties will meet
Mise. (NHI)
promptly following the enactment of such legislation in order to assure a smooth implementation of and transition to the integrated program addressed in this letter.
Very truly yours,

UNDERSTANDINGS WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS -HEALTH MAINTENANCE
ORGANIZATIONS (HMOS), AND ALTERNATIVE DENTAL AND
VISION OPTIONS
In calculating the Corporation’s monthly contributions (and any required member contributions) toward the cost of coverage for eligible individuals electing a health maintenance organization (such term to include group practice dental and vision organizations) under Article n, Section 4 of the Program, the following method will be used:
L At the time of any change in the component premium rates (e.g., single, two-party, family) of either a health maintenance organization or the corresponding accrual rates for local carriers), the health maintenance organization’s composite premium shall be compared to an adjusted local carrier’s composite accrual rate developed by using comparable component rates of the local carrier(s) and the health maintenance organization enrollment mix of General Motors employees who are then members of the health maintenance organization. For purposes of these calculations, the rates of the local carriers) are defined as the greater of the rates for the Traditional option and the Preferred Provider Organization option, based on the adjusted composite rate.
If there are less than 30 General Motors primary enrollees in a health maintenance organization (which includes all new health maintenance organizations), the national enrollment mix of all General Motors primary enrollees in health maintenance organizations will be used in calculating its composite premium rate and comparing its rate to that of the corresponding local carriers) so as to produce more reasonable statistical results. Whenever possible, these calculations will
228
MIsc. (Contributions - Alternative Plans)
employ separate enrollment mixes for General Motors hourly and salaried employee groups, respectively.
2.	If the adjusted local carrier composite accrual rate is in excess of the health maintenance organization’s composite premium, the Corporation shall pay the full premiums of eligible primary enrollees electing coverage through such organization. See Example #1.
3.	If the health maintenance organization composite premium is in excess of the adjusted local carrier composite accrual rate, the Corporation’s contribution on behalf of a primary enrollee in such health maintenance organization shall be limited to the amount obtained by multiplying the amount of the applicable component premium rate for the health maintenance organization by the ratio derived from the adjusted local carrier’s composite accrual rate divided by the health maintenance organization’s composite premium. The health maintenance organization member contribution amount shall be the difference between the appropriate health maintenance organization component rate less the applicable Corporation contribution. See Example #2.

229
Mise. (Contributions - Alternative Plans)
The adjusted local carrier’s composite accrual rate of $88.00 is in excess of the health maintenance organization's composite premium of $83.85. Therefore, even though the health maintenance organization single and two-party component rates exceed those of the local carrier, the Corporation will pay the full premiums of all members enrolled in the health maintenance organization.

Mise. (Supplemental Methodology - Alternative Plans)
UNDERSTANDINGS WITH RESPECTTO SUPPLEMENTAL METHODOLOGY FOR
REVIEW OF HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS (HMOS), AND ALTERNATIVE DENTAL AND VISION OPTIONS
For HMO, alternative dental and vision option rates which are to be effective on or after January 1, 1989, in addition to the HMO comparison methodology referenced in the previous letter, an additional comparison will be calculated as described below.
In reviewing the Corporation’s monthly contributions (and identifying any enrollee contributions which would have been required under this supplemental methodology) toward the cost of coverage for primary enrollees electing an HMO under Article II, Section 4 of the Program, the supplemental methodology set forth below will be used.
For purposes of this review, the “local carrier’s accrual rate” is defined as the greater of the composite accrual rates for the Traditional option and the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) option(s) (where more than one PPO is available), in the same service area as the HMO. Service areas are defined by zip codes and have been grouped together using, as a basis, the Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) concept developed by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The local carrier’s accrual rate shall include all coverages comparable to those provided by the HMO and included in the HMO’s rates (e.g., hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug and mail order prescription drug, substance abuse, and vision, where applicable).
The composite premium rate of an HMO will be compared to the composite accrual rate of the local
231
Mise. (Supplemental Methodology - Alternative Plans)
carrier(s) annually, for every MSA that is within the service area of the HMO. If the HMO’s composite premium rate is in excess of the respective local carrier’s composite accrual rate, the parties will not approve or will withdraw approval of such HMO. Accordingly, current enrollees may not be allowed to continue in the HMO. Any such enrollees may be required to elect another ICP option. Before taking the final Step of discontumiBg. the. Qffcoaof an HMO, the parties will examine alternative means to reduce the HMO’s composite premium rate.
232
Mise. (General)
UNDERSTANDINGS WITH RESPECTTO HEALTH CARE - GENERAL
This will confirm our understanding with respect to the following matters under the Health Care Program, herein referred to as the Program, incorporated by reference in the Collective Bargaining Agreement:
1.	Dental Coverage
In the event arrangements are made pursuant to Appendix C, Section IX, of the Program to offer alternative dental coverage to enrollees of the Corporation, payment by the Corporation for such alternative dental coverage on behalf of enrollees who elect such coverage in Heu of dental coverage under Article II, Section 1(b) of the Program shall be no greater than the amount the Corporation would have contributed for dental coverage under Article II, Section 1(b) of the Program.
2.	Vision Coverage
If a health maintenance organization, referred to in Article II, Section 4(b) of the Program, decides it is able to provide its own vision coverage, the Corporation and the Union may arrange, by mutual agreement, for enrollees therein to be covered by the health maintenance organization's vision coverage, in lieu of the coverage referred to in Article n, Section 1 (b) of the Program.
3.	Departicipating Hospitals
The Corporation will request the Control Plan to assure that each participating carrier institutes the following procedure in the event a hospital departicipates.
(a)	A plan will give adequate notice at the earliest possible date to enrollees of a hospital’s departicipation and of the payment arrangements in such a departicipating situation.
233
Mise. (General, 3,(b))
(b)	For those enrollees already hospitalized before a hospital departicipates, full covered benefits will be paid until the end of the hospital stay or until the available days of care are exhausted.
(c)	For enrollees admitted during the first 30 days after the initial date of each hospital’s departicipation, full covered benefits will be paid for all admissions to such departicipated hospital until the end of the hospital stay or until the available days of care are exhausted. For enrollees admitted after such 30 days, the appropriate nonparticipating hospital rate shall apply, except as provided in (d), below.
(d)	Upon admission in an emergency (as determined by the plan) to a hospital that has departicipated, when the enrollee cannot be safely moved to a participating hospital, the enrollee will be entitled to full covered benefits during the first five days of the hospital stay. After five days from the date of such emergency admission, payment will be at the appropriate nonparticipating hospital rate. If at any time during such an admission the enrollee is moved to a participating hospital, payment may be made for the reasonable charges for ground ambulance transfer of up to 25 miles, upon approval of the attending physician and the plan. This approval must be based on the \ physician’s medical certification that the transfer will not endanger the enrollee’s health and of plan certification that the subsequent stay will be of sufficient j duration to justify the transfer. If transfer to a | participating hospital cannot be arranged, either because j such a transfer would endanger the enrollee’s health or f because the subsequent stay would not be of sufficient |; duration to justify transfer, full covered benefits will be f ] paid until the end of such hospital stay or until the I; available days of care are exhausted.	? |
(e)	If such a hospital regains its participating I I status within six months after departicipating, the plan f J
234
Miso. (General, 3.(e))
will retroactively make payments for the balance of the hospital's reasonable charges (as determined by the plan) for covered services for enrollees admitted during the period of departicipation. The plan shall arrange that such payments relieve the enrollees of any further financial obligation with respect to covered services received during the departicipation period, and that any portion of such balance previously paid by the enrollee shall be refunded.
4.	Nonparticipating Hospital Rates
(a)	The plan’s payment for inpatient room and board charges with respect to nonparticipating hospitals (other than psychiatric hospitals) will be up to a maximum of $230 per day and payment for inpatient ancillary charges at such hospitals will be up to $20 per day (a total of $250 per day). Upon implementation, these daily benefit rates will supersede present benefit arrangements for inpatient services in nonparticipating, non-psychiatric hospitals in all plan areas. A maximum of $35 will be paid to such hospitals for each condition for outpatient services, except as otherwise provided for treatment of certain medical emergencies and accidental injuries.
(b)	Payment to nonparticipating hospitals (other than psychiatric hospitals) for emergency admissions will be as described in 3(d) above for departicipating hospitals.
(c)	Certain covered emergency services received in the outpatient department of a non-participating hospital will be paid on the same basis as if in a participating hospital. To qualify for payment, the claim must be for services related to a medical emergency or a serious bodily injury that requires immediate medical attention to avoid placing the enrollee’s life in jeopardy, permanent damage to the enrollee’s health or significant impairment of bodily functions. Treatment must be
235
Mise. (General, 4.(c))
provided at the hospital immediately following the medical emergency or injury. Payment will not exceed the amount that would be paid to a participating hospital, and there can be no assurance that the payment will cover the entire amount billed by the hospital.
(d)	Present benefit arrangements for payments of $15 per day .shall continue to apply to admissions to nonparticipating hospitals which are classified as psychiatric hospitals.
5.	Nonparticipating Physician Rate
The plan’s payment for services provided by a nonparticipating physician will be up to the reasonable and customary charge for the same service when provided by a participating physician, as determined by the plan.
6.	; Canadian Resident Coverage
The Corporation will continue arrangements to make available bn an optional basis the hospital, surgical, medical, prescription drug, hearing aid, dental, vision, and substance abuse coverages, provided employees of GM Canadian operations, to employees and retirees of GM locations in the United States, including eligible surviving spouses of former U.S. employees, who live in Canada and for whom the Corporation contributes the full cost of their coverages.
The Canadian coverages, if elected, will be in lieu of coverages available at the GM U.S. location where employed or from which retired.
2. PPO Accreditation
All PPOs made available to enrollees will be required to attain accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance or the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission, on or before
236
Mise. (General, 7.)
September 14, 2000. Any PPO which does not have the required accreditation will be made available during the next open enrollment only by mutual agreement of the parties.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties reemphasized their commitment for the Corporation-Union Committee on Health Care Benefits to investigate, consider, and upon mutual agreement, engage in activities that may have high potential for cost savings while achieving the maximum coverage and service for the employees covered for health care benefits for the money spent for such protection. The items to be considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
1.	Work with other groups within the Corporation and the Union, as well as outside organizations, to develop and implement educational and health awareness programs having components such as:
• encouraging enrollees to obtain quality health care in a cost-effective manner;
° promoting educational programs about good health habits and early detection procedures, and furnish general information about health issues; and
« informing enrollees, providers and appropriate community members about local quality issues.
2.	Work with carriers to develop and implement pilot programs based on findings of detailed medical review of coverages provided under the Informed Choice Plan.
238

3.	Review the experience of the use of ’par" and/or contracted provider networks and provisions applicable to reimbursement for physician and other medical providers. Make a determination (based on data supplied by the carriers and other resources) as to whether the provisions are a barrier to delivery of quality and cost-effective care.
4.	Work with dental carriers to monitor utilization and to determine ii there is a potential for abuse. In addition, review and monitor dental maintenance organizations to ensure they maintain standards for coverage and quality equal to generally accepted national standards and perform as outlined in the supplemental methodology.
5.	Review and improve retiree servicing to minimize claims handling by retirees, assist in resolving problems, and expedite payments to providers. Engage in communication activities which expand retiree awareness oi health issues and understanding of our Health Care Program, Medicare, and the relationships between the two.
6.	Review the operation of the claims processing systems, and the procedure for review of denied claims, with the objectives of improving the initial adjudication of claims, enhancing enrollee understanding, discouraging filing/processing of inappropriate appeals, eliminating duplication of effort, and facilitating timely resolution of appeals.
7.	Work with appropriate carriers to evaluate and modify coverage for injectable-medications.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker.
During the 1984 negotiations, the parties agreed to the Informed Choice Plan — a three option plan under which an employee can elect a Preferred Provider Organization option, a Health Maintenance Organization option, or a Traditional option. Under those options, enrollees can receive quality health care with benefits equal to those under previous coverage if approved services are obtained in accordance with the provisions of the option selected.
Although adoption of the Informed Choice Plan resulted in improvements to the health care coverage, both in terms of quality of care and cost containment, as discussed during the succeeding negotiations, the parties agreed that continued efforts for improvement are required.
As evidence of their commitment to contain costs under the health care coverage provided, the parties have, agreed to intensify their efforts to reduce health care costs in constant dollars (adjusted for inflation in the economy by the overall CPI). The carriers for health care coverage will assume some financial risk in intensifying their efforts to reduce health care costs and they, in turn, may impose some financial risk on certain providers. It is expected such an arrangement will build upon a similar arrangement agreed to during prior negotiations.
244
Mise. (General)
The parties also have agreed that the Control Plan and carriers will continue to be required to provide data and reports with respect to the Informed Choice Plan so as to enable the parties to make appropriate evaluations.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the economic and social needs of the chronically disabled who may require long-term care. The Corporation is concerned about the complex issues, the limited
246
&
information available with respect to cost and utilization projections and availability of support services in communities.
Since the nature of these needs will encompass services which go beyond medically necessary therapeutic care covered under the Health Care Program, the parties agree that any approach which addresses such needs should be inter-disciplinary in nature.
In this regard, the Corporation-Union Committee on Health Care Benefits has developed and implemented a pilot. Such pilot is based upon guidelines agreed to by the parties, which respond to the social concern for the chronically disabled population in a cost-effective manner. This pilot will be continued for the duration of the 2003 National Agreement*

Mise. (Long-Tenn Care)
A fund of no more them 2.5?! per hour worked by employees at the pilot location will be provided for the payment of services incurred by individuals covered by the pilot program. Such funding commenced effective July 1,1989, and will continue for the duration of the pilot.

This is to confinn the understandings reached between the parties during discussions concerning necessary measures to address inadequate performance of Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs). It was mutually recognized additional study of PPOs is unwarranted and only those PPOs demonstrating high quality cost-effective care should be continued.
Consequently, the standard methodology used to assess Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) cost and contributions is used to compare PPO costs to that of the Traditional option. The results determine whether PPOs generate contributions in excess of the Corporation’s monthly contribution.
Despite the efforts of the parties to date in examining alternative means to reduce JBQ costs. manyiPPOs generate contributions. As ajesuiLthe parties have qgreed.te.woik jointly .with non-performing PPQa to identify high quality, highly efficient providers, using nationally recognized .gHaltomd safety standards and member jemcing atandardaJegunaw patientgccess. waiting times). as mutually agreed upon, and to implement network reductions as soon as practicable.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties recognized the need to move ahead with the development of technological applications to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees.
1.	The parties recognize the need to provide the necessary tools to Local Union Benefit Representatives so that they may improve the service they are providing to hourly employees. Local Union Benefit Representatives require basic information that can be accessed quickly in order to confidently and accurately answer many of the questions they receive. Therefore, the parties have designed a process, the Benefits Data Access System, whereby Local Union Benefit Representatives have access to certain data elements from several benefit data systems. The Benefits Data Access System provides inquiry only access to Local Union Benefit Representatives who complete a computer training program. Access is limited to information for UAW hourly employees at their particular location.
2.	The parties jointly will develop and implement a new benefit documentation feature to the existing Benefits Data Access System that will be available to Local Union Benefit Representatives. The system will include benefit plan booklets, administrative manuals (where applicable), relevant contract provisions and appropriate
253
Mise. (Improving Benefits Service Through Technology)
process descriptions. Upon approval by the Executive Board of Joint Activities, the cost of development, hardware and software requirements, conversion of written documentation, and installation and training, will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund. It is contemplated the benefit documentation feature will be implemented during the term of the 2003 Agreement.
3.	The parties further agreed to provide hourly employees with TCebdedmoloflyiaadditign-to-thg continued use of a Voice Response System for inquiry and transactions in the Personal Savings Plan.
4.	The parties agree to enhance the Benefit Data Access System to provide the Pension Plan survivor coverage election/rejection and the cost of such survivor option. The cost of development and implementation will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund.
In conclusion, during the term of the new Agreement, the parties pledge to carefully consider every opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency in benefits delivery.

During these negotiations, the Union and the Corporation conducted extensive discussions regarding the continued development of the Community Health Care Initiatives process. In designated communities, the Corporation and the Union work with others in the community to initiate community activities designed to improve the overall health status of area residents and improve the quality and cost effectiveness of the local health care delivery system.
The parties reaffirm that the Community Health Care Initiatives process has the potential to promote high quality, cost effective health care delivery systems for the entire community and thereby enhance the effectiveness and value of the health care benefits provided to UAW-represented GM employees under the Health Care Program. Accordingly, the Corporation and Union have agreed that as soon as practicable following ratification of the Agreement, the Corporation-Union Committee on Health Care Benefits (CUCHCB) will meet to further develop action plans, to be used in ongoing activities in Flint, ML Anderson. IN, and Wdrren/Ybungstown, OH pilots, and other communities, consistent with the principles outlined in the attached Vision-Mission Statement.
257
Mise. (Community Initiatives)
The Action Plans will identify areas for both geographical and programmatic expansions of activities designed to achieve demonstrable improvements in health status, quality and cost effectiveness of the health care delivery system over time. In addition, the CUCHCB will establish mechanisms to evaluate the process, typical mmtyiunity activities include, but are not limited to:
0 collaboration with consumers, purchasers, providers, health care plans, carriers and other interested parties to develop activities that will assist a community in utilizing all its health care resources effectively, and balancing those resources with its health care needs,
■> identification of best practices of care and delivery, and encouragement of their adoption by local health care providers,
• improvement in the health status of all members of the community through the use of community activities, such as educational and informational programs, and
® provision of environmental scans, resource and needs assessments and other data that give the community access to significant data and information to enable it to develop action planning.
The Action Plans developed by the CUCHCB will be tailored to reflect the unique environment of each community. The CUCHCB will jointly adopt specific short-term and ongoing goals for each location, monitor the activity within each community and receive regular reports from the Community Initiatives Directors. The parties agree to collaborate with other organizations involved in community health care initiatives programs to ensure maximum effectiveness of the programs.

•	a culture of “best practice’*;
•	state-of-the-art data collection and information systems; and
•	a balancing of the health care resources of the community with the community’s health care needs.
Community activity supported by information acquired through the assessment of community needs and resources and a survey of national and local “best practices”, will generate the development and implementation of action plans to ensure that health care resources in the community are used efficiently and effectively to meet its needs.
This commitment to community activity and collaboration will be ongoing and emphasize continuous improvement of the delivery system. An immediate goal will be achieving a voluntary community commitment to a moratorium on expansion that does not have a consensus of need.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
During the 1996 negotiations, the parties concluded that the delivery of vision benefits could be improved.
Therefore, the Corporation and the Union agreed that the administrator of vision coverage nationwide pursuant to Appendix D of the General Motors Health Care Program for Hourly Employees (the Program), would provide a network of participating providers, improved benefit levels, and reduced enrollee and Corporation expense.
Participating providers agree to accept reimbursement in accordance with Appendix D, Section VII., and to provide discounts on certain non*covered services. The administrator of the vision coverage will continue to assure access levels acceptable to the parties and that all participating providers meet both credentialing and quality assurance standards. In contracting with the participating providers, the administrator will continue to assure that the providers fully understand the provisions of Appendix D, including eligibility requirements and benefit levels.
During the course of the 2003 Agreement, the Corporation-Union Committee on Health Care Benefits (CUCHCB) will commission independent audits of the administrator of the vision coverage to assure that the highest quality, access, service, professional standards and express commitments set forth are maintained. The CUCHCB will monitor the administrator's performance and address any shortcomings with appropriate action up to and including changing

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the 1996 negotiations, the parties concluded that the delivery of dental benefits could be improved. Therefore, the Corporation and the Union agreed to select Delta Dental Plan of Michigan (DDPM) to administer traditional dental coverage nationwide pursuant to Appendix C of the General Motors Health Care Program for Hourly Employees (the Program).
DDPM, in conjunction with Delta USA, provides a nationwide network, or networks limited to selected states, of participating providers who agree to accept the reasonable and customary reimbursement as determined by the affiliated Delta Dental Plans as payment in full for the services covered under Appendix C of the Program.
DDPM, in conjunction with Delta USA, also provides a nationwide point-of-service preferred provider arrangement, or networks limited to selected states. Providers who participate in this arrangement agree to accept the carrier's schedule for reasonable and customary reimbursement as payment in full for the services covered under Appendix C of the Program. The preferred provider arrangement offers a panel of dentists, utilization review, improved level of benefits and reduced enrollee and Corporation expense.
The Corporation-Union Committee on Health Care Benefits (CUCHCB) may commission independent audits of DDPM to assure that the highest quality, access, service, professional standards and express

1.	Annual Review of New HMO and Medicare + Choice Offerings
The parties will continue to annually review the possibilities for adding new HMOs to the Program, with the goal of ensuring that enrollees have the opportunity to enroll in HMOs that meet the parties’ quality, access, benefit design, cost-effectiveness, and delivery of service requirements. The review will place emphasis on service areas where alternative plans are not presently available, on areas where only one alternative plan is available and on ensuring that the needs of both Medicare and non-Medicare enrollees are addressed. The annual review of new HMO offerings will be conducted in a manner to allow sufficient time to include newly-approved HMOs within the annual enrollment process.
Additionally, the parties will discuss and^if mutually agreed to. authorize ^Medicare HMQ (“Medicare + Choice^ products. asdiptions wader tte Informed Choice Plan.

2.	HMO Performance
The parties will address the overall performance and continuation of individual HMOs on the basis of quality, access, benefit design, cost-effectiveness, and delivery of services. HMOs, which do not achieve and maintain expected performance levels, or whose costs compare unfavorably to other available options, may be

Mise. (HMO, 2.)
discontinued upon agreement of the parties. Additionally, to the extent that other ongoing HMO performance problems arise during the life of this agreement, the parties agree to discuss these problems in the CUCHCB and to seek resolution.
3.	Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services
In order to address the parties' concerns over the manner in which mental health and substance abuse services are delivered in certain HMOs, the parties will monitor input from enrollees, providers, carriers, appropriate Union representatives and outside consultants. HMOs will be evaluated in comparison to the Traditional/PPO options’ mental health and substance abuse care concepts, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) Managed Behavioral Health Organization Accreditation Standards, the GM HMO Performance Expectations and other standards agreed to by the parties.
Regardless of the fact that the HMO may be accredited, the parties will work with those HMOs that arc not in compliance with the parties’ expectations. In the event that an HMO is unable or unwilling to meet the parties’ expectations, the parties may, by mutual agreement, assign the mental health and/or substance abuse coverage and services to another carrier. If such a decision is made, it is recognized that prescription drug and other provisions may need to be addressed, to assure that the HMO's enrollees continue to receive the full range of coverage. Alternatively, and also by mutual agreement, the parties may cease to offer the HMO.
4.	HMO Accreditation
All HMOs made available to enrollees will be required to attain at least provisional accreditation from the NCQA. Any HMO which does not have the required accreditation will not be made available during the next

open enrollment, unless offered or retained by mutual agreement of the parties. The parties will monitor the HMOs receiving provisional accreditation to ensure they seek to attain higher accreditation.
5.	HMO Patient Rights
The parties will request that HMOs communicate to enrollees through direct mailings or otherwise about how they may: obtain coverage and receive care; gain access to other plan services, including referrals outside the plan network; and register complaints and utilize the grievance process. Such communications shall conform to federal and state laws as applicable. The parties may recommend standard formats for providing this type of information. The parties may take such mutually agreed upon steps as they deem appropriate (including termination of the plan offering) should a plan be out of compliance.
6.	HMO Benefit Design
The parties will continue to review benefits provided by HMOs, in order to ensure adequate compliance with the agreed upon benefit design. HMOs offered to enrollees will provide a full array of preventative services, including appropriate cancer screening services and early detection and screening procedures. In situations where a prescription drug order, for an otherwise covered drug, is written by a dental service provider, or a mental health/substance abuse service provider when such services are carved out, the HMOs will recognize such prescription order as a covered service.

7.	Public Reporting of HMO Data
All HMOs shall be required to publicly report NCQA, HEDIS and any other data that may be relevant to consumer information needs, unless mutually agreed to by the parties.
8.	Shared Decision Making
HMOs offered to Program enrollees are encouraged to foster shared decision making between enrollees and physicians, based on full discussion of the benefits and risks of treatment alternatives. The parties have agreed to explore effective ways of involving patients in treatment decisions, including but not limited to the use of interactive decision-making tools, and to implement one or more pilot programs as mutually agreed to by the parties. The parties will decide upon appropriate contractual requirements for HMOs, in order to achieve similar desirable results.
9.	Confidentiality of Individually Identifiable Health Care Information
HMOs offered to Program enrollees are required to maintain confidentiality of individually identifiable clinical information, in accordance with the stated Corporation policies, accreditation requirements and applicable laws.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The Corporation and the Union hffitfi agreed on the desirability of maintaining a set of principles concerning the confidentiality of medical information. The Corporation reviewed with the Union its processes and practices in this regard. The parties acknowledged that medical information, in the context of this letter, means any record, written or electronic, identifying a participant in the UAW/General Motors Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan, Life and Disability Benefits Program for Hourly Employees or the Health Care Program for Hourly Employees (collectively, "Benefits Programs"), containing diagnostic or treatment information and used in connection with the administration of the Benefits Programs. Accordingly, the following are understood:
•	Participants in the Benefits Programs have a legitimate interest in the confidentiality of medical information pertaining to them.
•	The Corporation, third party administrators, and other parties acting on behalf of the Corporation or third party administrators in connection with the Benefits Programs ("Other Parties"), have a legitimate need to collect, maintain, and use medical information in the course of performing administrative and other fiduciary functions required by the Benefits Programs and the law (e.g., verifying eligibility and benefit status, claims adjudication, audits for payment purposes, case management, coordination of benefits).
272
Mise. (Confidentiality)
0 The Corporation, third party administrators and Other Parties have a legitimate need to collect, maintain and use aggregate medical information for purposes of analysis, evaluation, oversight and quality control.
• In addition to applicable legal requirements, access to medical information maintained by the Corporation, third party administrators and Other Parties will be limited to persons having a need to use the information in the course of performing their job duties, and where appropriate and feasible, narrowly tailored in terms of scope and detail to achieve intended business purposes. Aggregate data and/or summaries will be used by the Corporation to the extent feasible.
® Medical information exchanged with Other Parties for analysis and evaluation will be used and maintained only for the purpose for which it is provided and not redisclosed by Other Parties without the prior consent of the Corporation and the Union.
° The Corporation will establish internal safeguards concerning the exchange of medical information by the Corporation. Employees who inappropriately exchange medical information will be subject to disciplinary action. The Corporation will also require third party administrators and Other Parties to establish and enforce policies and procedures consistent with this letter.
0 Medical information may be exchanged with Other Parties for clinical, public health and academic research only if a meaningful purpose is to benefit participants in the Benefits Programs. Absent such purpose, the prior agreement of the Corporation and Union on all aspects of the research (e.g., topics, selection of researchers, distribution of results) is required.
273
Mise. (Confidentiality)
° Benefits Programs treatment interventions should not be made by employees of the Corporation other than its medical personnel in the course of their normal activities.
The Corporation, in consultation with the Union, is committed to continuing its development of processes and practices regulating the use of medical information within the Corporation and by third party administrators and Other Parties, in addition, while it is not medical information, the parties will pursue opportunities to reduce reliance on the use of social security numbers as the means of identifying enrollees for purposes of Program Administration.
Should issues arise during the course of the agreement concerning the confidentiality of medical information, the Corporation will meet with the Union to discuss mutually agreeable solutions.

Attention: Mr. Richard Shoemaker

Dear Mr. Shoemaker;
During these negotiations, the Corporation and the Union discussed initiatives presently under consideration at the federal government level to reform the health care delivery system. The proposed reforms include provisions that would impose, among other things, (i) liability on health care plans, employers, employees, agents and other entities for punitive and compensatory damages arising out of the provision of benefits, (ii) requirements for timely decisions of certain benefit claims, (iii) access to external, independent claim reviews, (iv) access to specialty care, and (v) protections for the provider/patient relationship.
The likelihood of any initiatives becoming law is unknown, and the elements and impact of any legislation cannot be predicted. Nonetheless, the parties agreed that if any national health plan reform legislation is enacted during the term of the agreement, the Corporation and the Union, through the Corporation-Union Committee on Health Care Benefits, will discuss and implement modifications to the Health Care Benefits Program that comply with federal standards as they become effective. The compliance effort will also be undertaken in a manner that achieves the following objectives:
• Minimizes litigation risk to the Program and its fiduciaries.

Mise. (National Health Reform)
o Provides greater opportunities for participants to resolve denied claims through Program appeal processes.
° Addresses the legitimate concerns of participants in awareness and understanding of health care issues and benefit terms.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker
During these negotiations, the Corporation and the Union discussed services designed to assist couples in conceiving and bearing a child and the adequacy of present coverage in light of current and evolving reproductive services technology which may produce better results.
The parties agree that as soon as practicable following the effective date of this Agreement, the Corporation— Union Committee on Health Care Benefits (CUCHCB) will gather and evaluate data relative to fertility services and determine the feasibility of delivering such services in accordance with the concepts listed below. The parties may consult with experts in the field as they proceed with such investigation, the fees for which will be charged against CUCHCB funds.
The benefit will be designed so that a common treatment approach is achieved, where appropriate. Panel providers will be credentialed who:
° are qualified in their Held;
0 agree to abide by a consistent treatment regimen in terms of diagnostic tests, drugs and protocols, where appropriate;
° maintain quality standards; and
0 are willing to meet conditions as the parties may require.
Eligibility for services under the fertility coverage may be limited to those received from panel providers. Once
277
Mise. (Fertility Services)
a pregnancy has been confirmed, the patient may continue obstetric services with her regular doctor.
To the extent feasible the coverage may be carved out from all plans and centered in a national reproductive services program and done in concert with the Union and their other employer partners.
The coverage may include, but is not necessarily limited to, counseling, treatment lor underlying conditions of sexual dysfunction, diagnostic services, pharmaceuticals, artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization, surgical intervention, cryopreservation, transvaginal ultrasound, and donor gamete. The parties may also consider adopting:
° a set number of cycles for services (because of the declining probability of success);
• a maximum number of transfers per cycle (in order to reduce the likelihood oi multiple births);
• a number of episodes of treatment that will be covered under the program or otherwise set a frequency limitation.
Based upon the results of the investigation and analysis, the parties may, upon mutual agreement, decide to implement a pilot to test the validity of the concept.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker
During these negotiations, the parties reaffirmed the use of a national network for the delivery of certain durable medical equipment and prosthetic and orthotic appliances. The National Durable Medical Equipment (DME) I Prosthetic and Orthotic Appliance (P&O) Network is consistent with the overall Health Care Program goals of quality care and cost effectiveness and maintains the same covered DME/P&O items and services as provided under Appendix A, ULI. of the Program with appropriate accessibility standards.
The Corporation and the Union agreed that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) in conjunction with Northwood National Provider Network, Inc.(NNPN) should administer the National DME/P&O Network pursuant to Appendix A, HI.I. of the General Motors Health Care Program for Hourly Employees (the Program). It is recognized that the local medical carriers will continue to be responsible for DME/P&O items received in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility. Local medical carriers will also be responsible for specific additional items, where appropriate. This includes, but is not limited to, items received through a physician's office, when NNPN determines that the local carrier should be responsible, in accordance with Program standards.
Under the National DME/P&O Network, participating providers will be required to meet both credentialing and quality assurance standards. For covered items,
290
Mise. (DME/P&O Network)
participating providers will accept the network fee schedule amount as reimbursement in full.
When covered items are received from non-network providers, reimbursement will be equal to the network fee schedule amount. BCBSM/NNPN will assure access levels acceptable to the parties and will assure that the providers understand the DME/P&O provisions of the Program.
The Corporation-Union Committee on Health Care Benefits (CUCHCB) may commission independent audits of BCBSM/NNPN to assure that the highest quality, access, service, professional standards and express commitments set forth are maintained. The CUCHCB will monitor the carriers' performance and address any shortcomings with appropriate action up to and including changing carriers. Additionally, prior to the expiration of the 2QQ3 Agreement, the CUCHCB will arrange for completion of an evaluation of BCBSM/NNPN and other potential carriers and, based on such evaluation, consider appropriate changes in carrier selection(s).

Section 9.	Non-Applicability of Collective Bargaining Agreement Grievance Procedure
No matter respecting the Program as modified and supplemented by this Agreement or any difference arising thereunder shall be subject to the grievance procedure established in the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the Corporation and the Union.
Section 10.	Recovery of Benefit Overpayments

A terminally ill employee or retiree who has a life expectancy not to exceed 12 months, may access a portion of Basic Life Insurance.

The maximum amount of the accelerated benefit is 50% of the amount of the Basic Life Insurance in force as of the date the insurance company accepts that all requirements are met.

Section 1.	Continuation and Amendment of Plan
(a)	This Agreement shall become effective on the first Monday immediately following the effective date of the Collective Bargaining Agreement of which this Agreement is a part.
(b)	The Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan which was attached as Exhibit D-l to the Supplemental Agreement (Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan) between the parties dated September 28.1999. shall be amended effective as of October 13. 2003. except as otherwise specified in this Agreement and the Plan and maintained by the Corporation as amended for the duration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement of which this Agreement is a part subject to the terms and conditions of the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan attached to this Agreement as Exhibit D-l.
(c)	Provision for payment of Benefits and Separation Payments under the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan which was attached as Exhibit D-l to the 1999 Supplemental Agreement (Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan) between the parties dated September 28. 1999. shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with the conditions, provisions, and limitations of such Supplemental
(1)
D, Sect. 1(c)
Unemployment Benefit Plan, as constituted, for Weeks prior to October 13. 2003. Benefits or Separation Payments paid or payable (or denied) under the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan for Weeks commencing on or after the effective date of this Agreement shall reflect amendments to the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan which are provided for in Section 1 of this Agreement and incorporated in Exhibit D-l hereof. In the event revisions in the Plan are made in accordance with subsection 5(d) of this Agreement which require adjustments of payments of Benefits and Separation Payments made previously under the Plan incorporated in Exhibit D-l hereof, such adjustments will be made within a reasonable time. No such adjustments (or payment) will be made in Benefits for Weeks commencing prior to, or in Separation Payments paid prior to, the effective date of this Agreement.
Section 2.	Termination of Plan prior to Expiration Date
In the event that the Plan shall be terminated in accordance with its terms prior to the expiration date of this Agreement so that the Corporation’s obligation to contribute to the Plan shall cease entirely, the parties thereupon shall negotiate for a period of 60 days from the date of such termination with respect to the use which shall be made of the money which the Corporation otherwise would be obligated to contribute under the Plan; if no agreement with respect thereto shall be reached at the end of such period, there shall be a general wage increase in the amount of the basic contribution rate then in effect, but not less than 22$ per hour to all hourly-rate employees then covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement which shall be applied to the base rates and incentive rates, as the case may be, in the same manner that the general increase is made applicable under Paragraph 101(c) of the Collective
(2)
D, Sect. 2
Bargaining Agreement, and effective as of the date of such termination.
Sections.	Obligations During Term of
Agreement
During the term of this Agreement, neither the Corporation nor the Union shall request any change in, deletion from, or addition to the Plan, or this Agreement; or be required to bargain with respect to any provision or interpretation of the Plan or this Agreement, and during such period no change in, deletion from, or addition to any provision, or interpretation, of the Plan or this Agreement, nor any dispute or difference arising in any negotiations pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement, shall be an objective of, or a reason or cause for, any action or failure to act, including, without limitation, any strike, slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, picketing, or other exercise of economic force, or threat thereof, by the Union or the Corporation.
Section 4.	Term of Agreement: Notice to Modify or Terminate
This Agreement and Plan shall remain in full force and effect without change until the termination of the Collective Bargaining Agreement of which this is a part.
Section 5.	Governmental Rulings
(a)	The amendments to the Plan provided for in Section 1 of this Agreement and incorporated in Exhibit D-l hereof and which shall be implemented for Weeks beginning on or after the effective date of this Agreement shall be subject to subsequent receipt by the Corporation of rulings satisfactory to the Corporation, if such rulings are deemed necessary by the Corporation, from the United States Internal Revenue Service and the
(3)
D, Sect. 5(a)
United States Department of Labor holding that such amendments will not have any adverse effect upon the favorable rulings previously received by the Corporation that:
(1)	contributions to the Fund established pursuant to the Plan constitute a currently deductible expense under the Internal Revenue Code, as now in effect, or under any other applicable federal tax law; and
(2)	the Fund under the Plan qualifies for exemption from Federal income tax under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code; and
(3)	contributions by the Corporation to the Fund are not treated as “wages” for purposes of the Federal Unemployment Tax, the Federal Insurance Contributions Act Tax, or Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages, under Subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code; and
(4)	no part of any such contributions or of any payments made by the Corporation under the Plan are included for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act in the regular rate of any Employee:
provided, however, that if the rulings referred to in this subsection (a) are unfavorable, and are unfavorable because of provisions of the Plan, as amended, regarding Automatic Short Week Benefits, this fact shall not delay the effective date of the other amendments to the Plan.
(b)	In the event that any ruling described in subsection (a) above as to the provisions of the Plan, as amended, regarding Automatic Short Week Benefits is not obtained, or having been obtained shall be revoked or modified so as to be no longer satisfactory to the Corporation; or in the event that any state, by legislation or by administrative ruling or court decision, in the

(c)	If an Employee is on short term active duty of 30 days or less, for required military training, in a National Guard, Reserve or similar unit and is ineligible under the Collective Bargaining Agreement for pay from the Company for all or part of such period solely because the Employee would be on a qualifying layoff but for such active duty, the Employee will be deemed to be on a qualifying layoff, for the determination of eligibility for not more than’ two Regular Benefits in a calendar year, provided, however, that this two Regular Benefit limitation shall not apply to short term active duty of 30 days or less because the Employee was called to active service in the National Guard by state or federal authorities in case of public emergency.

(g)	An Employee who attempts to return to work from sick leave of absence or military leave on or after the effective date of this Plan and for whom there is no work available in line with the Employee's Seniority and who is placed on layoff status, shall be deemed to have been “at work” on or after the effective date of this Plan.
(h)	If, with respect to a Week, or with respect to any prior Week during the Employee’s same continuous period of layoff from the Company, the Employee willfully misrepresents any material fact in connection with the Employee’s application for Benefits under the Plan, the Employee shall be disqualified for Benefits for all Weeks of layoff thereafter during the same continuous period of layoff from the Company.

(1)	if the Employee has an established and currently applicable weekly benefit rate under the State System, such benefit rate plus any dependents allowance, or
(2)	in all other cases, the State System Benefit amount which would apply to an individual having the same number of dependents as the Employee and having weekly earnings equal to the Employee’s Weekly Straight-Time Pay.
(c)	If the State System Benefit actually received by an Employee for a state week shall be for less, or more, than a full state week (for reasons other than the Employee’s receipt of wages or remuneration for such state week), because

Art. tV, 2(b)(2)
(2)	The amount of Separation Payment so computed shall be reduced by the amount of any Benefits paid or payable to an Employee with respect to a Week occurring after the last day worked for the Company.
(3)	A Separation Payment payable hereunder shall be reduced by the amount of any payment received or receivable with respect to any layoff or separation of the Employee from the Company subsequent to the last day worked for the Company under any other “SUB” plan or plans of the Company or under any Company plan or program to which the Company has contributed.
(4)	If an Employee has been paid a prior Separation Payment and thereafter was hired again by the Company within 3 years from the last day worked in the Bargaining Unit, or if the Employee received a prior Separation Payment by reason of total and permanent disability and subsequently recovers, reports for work and such Employee’s Seniority is reinstated under the Collective Bargaining Agreement,
(i)	Years of Seniority for purposes of determining the amount of the Employee’s current Separation Payment shall mean the sum of the Years of Seniority used to determine the amount of the Employee’s prior Separation Payment plus any other Years of Seniority acquired thereafter and which the Employee has on the last day on the Active Employment Roll with respect to the Employee’s current Separation Payment, and
(ii)	there shall be subtracted, from the Number of Hours* Pay based on the Employee’s Years of Seniority determined in (i) above, the Number of Hours’ Pay used to calculate the Employee’s prior Separation Payment.
(5)	The Separation Payment payable to an
24
Art. fV, 2(b)(5)
eligible Part-Time Employee shall be reduced in the same ratio as the Employee’s scheduled hours of work at time of layoff bears to 40 hours, provided, however, that if an Employee has worked as a full-time and a Part-Time Employee, the Employee’s Separation Payment shall be computed by multiplying the Number of Hours’ Pay indicated by the Employee’s Years of Seniority on the Employee’s last day on the Active Employment Roll by a fraction the numerator of which is the sum of
(i)	the number of such Years during which the Employee was a full-time Employee, and
(ii)	the number of such Years during which the Employee was a Part-Time Employee, adjusted by the ratio which scheduled hours of work in such Years bears to 40; and the denominator of which is the Employee’s Years of Seniority on the Employee’s last day on the Active Employment Roll.
Section 3.	Effect of Separation Payment on Seniority
An Employee who is issued and accepts a Separation Payment (A) agrees that such Payment is a lump sum payment allocable to an inactive period (“Allocation Period”) during which no other pay or benefits or rights of employment shall apply, (B) shall cease to be an Employee and shall have Seniority canceled at any and all of the Company’s plants and locations as of the date the Employee’s application for the Separation Payment was received by the Company (“Termination Date”) for all purposes, (C) shall not be eligible to receive a special early retirement under any Company retirement plan, (D) shall not be permitted to retire under any Company retirement plan during the Allocation Period following the Termination Date, and (E) cannot grow into retirement eligibility if ineligible as of the break in
25
Art. IV, 3
Seniority (but without prejudice to any right to a deferred vested benefit). An Employee’s Allocation Period in weeks shall equal the Employee’s Separation Payment divided by one-half of the unreduced Regular Benefit the Employee received, or would have received, for the current period of layoff.
An Employee eligible for an immediate pension benefit under the General Motors Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan, at the time of the Employee’s break in Seniority (due to receipt of a SUB Separation Payment), shall upon completion of the Allocation Period and application for a pension benefit under the General Motors Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan become eligible for post retirement health care and life insurance on the same basis as other retirees. For purposes of applying the terms of the General Motors Hourly-Rate Employees Pension Plan, such Employees shall not be treated as deferred vested by reason of their receipt of a SUB Separation Payment. However, if an Employee has been paid a Separation Payment by reason of total and permanent disability and subsequently recovers and reports for work, the Employee’s Seniority shall be reinstated as set forth in Paragraph 64(h) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Section 4.	Overpayments
If the Company or the Board determines after issuance of a Separation Payment that the Separation Payment should not have been issued or should have been issued in a lesser amount, written notice thereof shall be mailed to the former Employee and the former Employee shall return the amount of the overpayment to the Trustee.
Section 5.	Repayment
If an Employee is again employed by the Company after receiving a Separation Payment, no repayment (except
26
Art. IV, 5
with respect to an overpayment) of the Separation Payment shall be required or allowed; and no Seniority canceled previously shall be reinstated (except as otherwise provided under Section 3 of this Article).
Section 6.	Notice of Application Time Limits
The Company shall provide written notice of the time limits for filing a Separation Payment application to all who may be eligible for such Payment. The notice shall be mailed to the last address of record not later than 30 days prior to both the earliest and the latest date as of which applications may be filed pursuant to the application time limit provisions.
Section 7.	Armed Services
An Employee who enters the Armed Services of the United States directly from the employ of the Company shall while in such service be deemed, for the purposes of the Plan, as on leave of absence and shall not be entitled to any Separation Payment.

Subject: Failure to Work Forty Hours as a Consequence of Severe Weather Conditions or Riots - SUB Plans
In general, the following SUB Plan determinations apply with respect to a plant shutdown in an area in which severe weather conditions or an actual or threatened riot have occurred* Attached as a tool to aid in the application of this letter is a flow chart. Nothing inlhe flow chart changes any terms of this letter.
1.	With respect to a day for which the plant gives notification by public announcement or otherwise of a shutdown, a SUBenefit shall be paid as provided under the Plan to an otherwise eligible laid off employee.
2.	With respect to a day during which the plant attempts to operate but is forced to shutdown because of the absenteeism of employees, and forty percent (40%) or less of the employees scheduled to report for work on the shift have not reported to work prior to the shutdown, a SUBenefit shall be paid to an otherwise eligible employee who reported for work but was sent home when the plant suspended operations; provided, however, that if the amount of such SUBenefit payable plus the pay for hours worked on such day equals less than the equivalent of 4 hours' pay, the employee shall be paid 4 hours' pay by the Corporation for such day (including pay for any hours worked) in lieu of such SUBenefit, as provided below. In calculating the SUBenefit, credit should be taken as Available Hours for any period between the starting time of the employee's regular shift and the time the employee reported for work.
69
Weather Cond. & Riot Ltr.
(a)	An employee who reports for work during the first 4 hours of the employee's regular shift on a day the plant has attempted to operate and subsequently shuts down, shall receive a SUBenefit for any hours not worked or made available during the period between the time the employee reported for work and the end of the employee's regular shift; provided, however, that if the amount of such SUBenefit payable plus the pay for any hours worked on such day equals less than the equivalent of 4 hours' pay, the employee shall be paid 4 hours' pay by the Corporation for such day (including pay for any hours worked) in lieu of such SUBenefit.
With respect to an otherwise eligible employee who reports for work during the last 4 hours of the employee's regular shift, a SUBenefit shall be payable for any hours not worked or made available during the period between the time the employee reported for work and the end of the employee's regular shift and the minimum 4 hours' pay provisions shall not apply.
(b)	In addition to the provisions of 2(a) above, if overtime hours occur during the week in which the only day(s) of layoff is a day on which the plant attempted to operate but subsequently shutdown due to employee absenteeism, the SUBenefit for an otherwise eligible employee shall be calculated with respect to the week. The SUBenefit amount, if any, plus the pay for any hours worked on such day(s) shall be measured against the minimum 4 hours' pay provision, if applicable, for such day(s).
However, if overtime hours occur during a week having 2 or more days of layoff, including at least one such day on which the plant attempted to operate but subsequently shutdown due to employee absenteeism, the overtime hours may only be applied to reduce hours of layoff on days other than such days on
70
Weather Cond. & Riot Ltr.
which the plant attempted to operate. Consequently, a separate SUBenefit shall be calculated for each such day on which the plant attempted to operate, and the amount of such SUBenefit, if any, plus the pay for any hours worked on such day shall be measured against the minimum 4 hours' pay provision, if applicable. If a SUBenefit is payable for such day, it shall be included and paid with any SUBenefit otherwise payable for the remainder of the week; provided, however, that the sum of such SUBenefits cannot exceed the SUBenefit, if any, that would otherwise be payable under the Plan for the Week.
<c) A SUBenefit shall not be paid to an employee for a day when the plant was attempting to operate if such employee failed to report for work at any time during such day. The total number of hours of the employee's regular shift for such day (8 hours in most cases) will be included as hours made available but not worked in the calculation of any SUBenefit otherwise payable for the week.
3.	With respect to a day during which the plant attempts to operate but is forced to shutdown because of the absenteeism of employees and more than forty percent (40%) of the employees scheduled to report for work on the shift have not reported to work prior to the shutdown, the facts and circumstances of the local situation will be reviewed with the General Motors Employee Benefits Staff and a determination shall be made by them with respect to any additional SUBenefit eligibility beyond the eligibility provided under item "2." above. Where no additional SUBenefit eligibility is authorized, the provisions and procedures under item "2." above will be followed. If additional SUBenefit eligibility is authorized the following will apply.
71

for the Week.
The minimum 4-hours' pay provisions shall apply to all employees who report to work during the first four hours of their shift.
The foregoing SUB Plan determinations with respect to ■ a day when the plant attempts to operate during severe weather conditions or during an actual or threatened riot apply only in situations where the plant is subsequently forced to shutdown because oi employee absenteeism. If the plant shuts down early or employees are sent home for any reason other than
■> employee absenteeism, eligible employees should be paid SUBenefits with respect to any period of qualified layoff to which they may be entitled under the Plan and the minimum 4 hours' pay provisions shall not be applicable.
4.	With respect to a day during which the plant operates in an area in which severe weather conditions or an actual or threatened riot have occurred and more than forty percent (40%) of employees scheduled to report for work on the shift do not report to work at any time during their shift, the facts and circumstances of the local situation will be reviewed with the General Motors Employee Benefits Staff and a determination shall be made by them with respect to any SUBenefit eligibility for any employee for such day. If the determination does not authorize any SUBenefits, then no SUBenefit eligibility will be determined under the
72
Weather Cond. & Riot Ltr.
provisions of this letter. If a determination is made to authorize SUBenefit eligibility for the shift, such eligibility and SUBenefit calculation shall be made in accordance with item "3." above.
In determining whether a plant shall attempt to operate during such severe weather conditions or during a riot occurring in the plant area, consideration should be given to the severity of the condition, actions of other employers in the area, and instructions, advice or proclamations issued by local or other authorities.
Employees who are unable to get to work due to a "BAN" on driving will be considered on Qualified Layoff for 8 hours for the day. "BAN" means that under a local law/ordinance which is proclaimed to be in effect through a public safety announcement, that persons caught driving in a specified area (through which the employee had no alternative but to travel to get to work on regular shift), will be ticketed, fined and/or jailed. Documentation of such public safety announcement is required from, or on behalf of, the employee(s) involved.
It is understood by the parties that the Union's agreement with the Company SUB Plan determinations to be followed with respect to a plant shutdown in an area in which severe weather conditions or an actual or threatened riot have occurred, as set forth in this letter, will in no way jeopardize or limit an employee's right of appeal under the Plan to any such Company determination.

Subject: Payment of Automatic Short Week Benefits and>Staie System Benefits With Respect to the Same Week in States Using "Flexible" State System Weeks
To prevent duplication of benefits for the same period of layoff, Article n. Section 4(c) has been included in the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan which requires an Employee to repay part or all of an Automatic Short Week Benefit paid to the Employee for one or more days of a Week for which the Employee receives a State System Benefit.
Should a problem develop in applying this provision to an individual case the parties agree to modify the effect of its application as far as is necessary to achieve equity for the Employee consistent with the purpose, structure, and basic provisions of the Plan.

Outside Earnings Letter

September 18.2003
Mi. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the 1973 negotiations the parties discussed situations wherein certain Employees have claimed earnings from other employers for purposes of establishing SUBenefit eligibility under the provisions of Article I, Section 1(b)(3) of the SUB Plan. Such earnings have been suspected to be amounts not resulting from bona fide employment.
The parties agree that SUBenefit eligibility under the provisions of Article I, Section 1(b)(3) requires bona fide earnings received for bona fide employment. Therefore, in accordance with Article V, Section 1(b) of the Plan, an Employee who invokes Article I, Section 1(b)(3) in support of the Employee's application for a Regular Benefit for a Week will be required, as a condition of eligibility for such Benefit, to submit evidence establishing that the Employee's pay for services rendered during that Week resulted from bona fide employment. Such evidence may include, but is not limited to, a statement from the employer showing information concerning the number of hours of work performed, a description of such work, the location and the rate of pay for the job. If further investigation is deemed necessary, it is recognized that such investigation could properly include an on-site inspection of the work performed.
76
Mutsiue earnings uener
The above procedure will be used in cases where bona fide employment or bona fide earnings are questioned for reasons such as the fact that the employer is another individual and a relationship other than an employeremployee relationship existed prior to the time of employment or that the Employee was not in fact in an established trade or profession owned and operated by the Employee, This procedure shall not apply, however, where the earnings are reported to have been the result of employment by an employer liable for taxes or contributions or reimbursement of benefits under the law of the applicable State System.
Any term used in this letter and defined in the Plan has the same meaning in this letter as in the Plan.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the 1976 national negotiations the Union expressed some concern regarding a possible interpretation of the provisions of Article I, Section 3(b)(4)(i) of the SUB Plan which could result in denying a Benefit to an otherwise eligible Employee who is claiming a benefit under a Workers' Compensation law while not totally disabled. This is to advise you that the provisions of Article I, Section 3(b)(4)(f) of the Plan will not be interpreted to disqualify an Employee on layoff from Benefits solely because the Employee is eligible for or claiming a permanent partial or scheduled loss benefit under a Workers’ Compensation law or other law providing benefits for occupational injury or disease so long as the injury or disease does not prevent the Employee from working.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker

Dear Mr, Shoemaker:
The conditions of eligibility for a Separation Payment based on layoff, as set forth in Article IV of the Supplemental Unemployment Benefit (SUB) Plan, include the requirement that an Employee has been on layoff "...for a continuous period of at least 12 months (or any shorter period determined by the Company)...".
This is to confirm our understanding with you reached in these negotiations that during the term of the 2003 SUB Plan the Company will waive the 12 month Separation Payment layoff waiting period described above with respect to layoffs resulting from plant closings, discontinuance of operations or other circumstances or events in which layoffs appear to be permanent and the Employees involved appear to have no further opportunity for employment with the Company.

Automated SUB Application Procedure
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18.2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr, Shoemaker:
During the 1987 National Negotiations the parties discussed the desirability of expanding the implementation of an “Automated Regular SUBenefit Application Procedure" across the several States having GM SUB-covered Employees. During the 1993 National Negotiations the parties acknowledged the success of such programs in Michigan, New York and certain other plant locations. The parties agreed to continue to pursue the implementation of such procedures in other states.
The automated procedure would be applicable to laid off Employees eligible for Regular Benefits under the SUB Plan who receive a State System Benefit. The contemplated procedure described below is subject to the development of specific business process rules and the establishment of effective means of transferring potentially large volumes of information from the states to the Company.
Under the automated procedure, the Company would utilize State System Benefit payment information provided by the states to calculate the payment of Regular Benefits for each full week of layoff. For this purpose, each otherwise SUB eligible Employee's application for a State System Benefit for each week will constitute an application for a SUB Regular Benefit for the respective week. The submission of a written Regular Benefit application for each week of layoff will not be required by an Employee otherwise eligible under the automated procedure.
A laid off Employee ineligible for a State System Benefit will be required to submit an application for each week of layoff in accordance with the routine Regular SUBenefit application procedures.
82
amomaiea suo application rroceaure
A basic condition upon which the automated SUB application procedure would be implemented is the Company's ability to obtain from the states in a timely and acceptable format, all State System Benefit payment information, including but not limited to, any weekly Unemployment Compensation (UC), Trade Readjustment Allowance (TRA), Extended Unemployment Compensation and Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC), necessary for the Company's determination of an Employee's eligibility for, and the amount of, a Regular Benefit under the SUB Plan. If timely and acceptable State System Benefit information becomes unavailable from a state after an automated procedure has been implemented, the automated procedure will be suspended in that state immediately and eligible Employees will be required to submit applications in accordance with the Regular Benefit application procedures.
As noted, when these automated SUB application procedures apply, an Employee's application for a State System Benefit will constitute submitting an application (and supporting information) for Regular Benefits from the SUB Plan with the same force and effect as though the Employee had provided the application (and related information) directly to the Plan on a routine SUBenefit application form. Although information initially is provided to the State Benefit system, as it affects SUB processing, the Employee will have the same responsibility for providing accurate information as it applies for routine SUB applications (with determinations and appeals regarding possible SUB errors or misrepresentations determined solely under the present SUB review provisions).
In the event a significant number of Employees at a plant receive a State System Benefit and are determined by the Company to be ineligible for a Regular Benefit because they are not on a qualifying layoff under the provisions of Article I, Section 3(b)(2) of the SUB Plan, the Company will promptly notify the International Union and Local Unions oi such determination. In addition, the Company's determination will be posted on local plant bulletin
83
Automated SUB Application rroceoure
boards in accordance with local practices. Such posting will be deemed to satisfy the denial of benefits notice requirements as provided under Article V.
Section 2(c) of the SUB Plan. This provision is intended solely to prevent substantial and duplicative SUB administrative processing and will not be interpreted in such a manner as to preclude any Employee from filing an appeal with respect to any such Company determination.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the cunent negotiations, the Corporation and the Union expressed mutual concern with respect to the number of laid off Employees at certain locations. The parties recognized the need to increase employment opportunities for lend off GM Employees and improve the operational effectiveness throughout the Corporation.

2.	For Employees with 1 but less than 10 Years of Seniority as of their last day worked prior to layoff, 26 weeks of "Continuing SUBenefits" will be payable to such otherwise eligible Employees.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
This will confirm an understanding between the Company and the Union with respect to the 2003 GM-UAW SUB Plan.
In the event the SUB Maximum Financial Liability Cap, as adjusted by any amount shifted between the JOBS and SUB Maximum Financial Liability Caps, and including any additional amount generated by the formula (which cannot exceed $447 million) under Section 3(d) of Article VH, becomes exhausted with respect to the 2003 SUB Plan at any time during the period covered by such Plan, the applicable provisions of the 1987 GM-UAW SUB Plan (including benefit eligibility, calculation, duration and funding) shall be reinstated to provide thereunder SUBenefits for subsequent Weeks of layoff to otherwise eligible Employees. It is further understood that should the 1987 SUB Plan be reinstated, it will include (i) a book account balance equal to the SUB Plan trust Fund balance as of the 1990 SUB Plan effective date ($14,768,027.21), to be used for the payment of SUBenefits thereafter under the 1987 Plan provisions, and including usage, under the 1987 SUB Plan provisions, of the AC A and GBA contingency account balances as of the 1990 SUB Plan effective date, (ii) contributions based on hours compensated will be based on Article VII, Section 5 of the 1987 Plan, as modified by this letter, with the percentage relationship of the value of the assets of the Fund to the maximum funding of the Fund determined including the balance in the book account in determining the asset value, (iii) any balance in the book account will be treated as assets in the Fund for determining the CUCB for credit unit cancellation purposes and all other provisions in which the assets
89
affect benefits or financing, and (iv) additional contributions will be made to the Fund equal to interest on an amount equal to the balance in the book account on the same basis as if that amount were in the Fund.
As of such 1987 Plan reinstatement date, an Employee's Credit Unit balance, if any, shall be the unused balance of Credit Units (i) to the Employee's credit on October 8, 1990, if in Active Service on such date, or (ii) remaining to the Employee s credit as of the Employee's return to work date subsequent to October 8,1990, if on layoff on October 8,1990, or (iii) remaining to the Employee's credit as of the 1987 Plan reinstatement date, if the-Employee is on layoff as of October 8,1990 and does not return to work prior to such Plan reinstatement date, or (iv) suspended under the provisions of item #2 of the "Level of Benefit Entitlement" Letter Agreement attached to the 1990 SUB Plan, dated September 17, 1990.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties recognized the need to move ahead with the development of technological applications to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees.
1.	The parties recognized the need to provide the necessary tools to Local Union Benefit Representatives so that they may improve the service they are providing to hourly employees. Local Union Benefit Representatives require basic information that can be accessed quickly in order to confidently and accurately answer many of the questions they receive. Therefore, the parties have designed a process, the Benefits Data Access System, whereby Local Union Benefit Representatives have access to certain data elements from several benefit data systems. The Benefits Data Access System provides inquiry only access to Local Union Benefit Representatives who complete a computer training program. Access is limited to information for UAW hourly employees at their particular location.
2.	The parties jointly will develop and implement a new benefit documentation feature to the existing Benefits Data Access System that will be available to Local Union Benefit Representatives. The system will include benefit plan booklets, administrative manuals (where applicable), relevant contract provisions and appropriate process descriptions. Upon approval by the Executive Board of Joint Activities, the cost of development, hardware

and software requirements, conversion of written documentation, and installation and training, will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund. It is contemplated the benefit documentation feature will be implemented during the term oi the 2003 Agreement.
3.	The parties further agreed to provide hourly employees with rad? technology in addition to the continued use of a Voice Response System for inquiry and transactions in the Personal Savings Plan.
4.	The parties agree to enhance the Benefit Data Access System to provide the Pension Plan survivor coverage election/rejection and the cost of such survivor option. The cost of development and implementation will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Tiaining Fund.
In conclusion, during the term of the new Agreement, the parties pledge to carefully consider every opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency in benefits delivery.

ITEMS AGREED TO BY GM-UAW SUB BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION
COVERING
2Q03 SUPPLEMENTAL UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLAN
(These “Items Agreed To” are subject to change at any time by mutual agreement of the members of the GM-UAW SUB Board of Administration)
109
110
Items Agreed to by GM-UAW SUB Board of Administration
A.	LOCAL COMMITTEES
1.	Meetings of the “Local Committee” established pursuant to the Plan shall be arranged by mutual agreement between the Company and Union Local Committee members.
2.	Where a number of Employees are laid off in a Week and the Company has determined that SUBenefits will not be payable for such layoff, the Company member of the Local Committee will contact the applicable Union member promptly, advise the Union member of the reasons for such determination, and arrange a meeting to discuss such reason(s). Such meeting will be held no later than the Week following the Week in which the layoff occurred (unless such time limit is extended by agreement of the Company and Union Local Committee members). Additional Local Committee meetings will be held as soon as possible, where necessary, until all the pertinent available facts with respect to the layoff have been made known to the parties.
3.	Written minutes of all meetings of the Local Committee, including pertinent discussion, statements of position, and information exchanged, will be prepared and approved promptly by the parties.
4.	The Union member of the Local Committee shall, after reporting to the Union member’s supervisor, be granted permission to leave work during the Union member’s regular working hours without loss of pay:
(a)	to attend meetings of the Local Committee including sufficient time during such meeting to write the Union’s position with respect to any appeals which are to be filed with the Board of Administration,
111
>1114 Hyi. n.T,\w;
(b)	to meet with an active Employee (or with a laid-off Employee, retiree, or other person reporting to the Plant) who requests the Union member of the Local Committee’s presence in order to give the Union member of the Local Committee necessary information with respect to a problem concerning the payment, denial, or appeal of a SUBenefit or Separation Payment,
(c)	to discuss with an Employee any change in the status of the Employee’s appeal,
(d)	to conduct investigations within the plant with respect to situations where a number of Employees are laid off for reasons for which the Company has determined that SUBenefits will not be payable,
(e)	to conduct investigations within the plant concerning the reason or reasons for any Short Work Week,
with the understanding that the time will be devoted to the prompt handling of such matters.
5.	(a) An Employee having a question concerning the amount of or the reason for nonpayment of an Automatic Short Week Benefit, may request the supervisor to call the Employee’s Shop Committeeperson for the zone to discuss such question. Where applicable, the Shop Committeeperson for the zone may supply applications for SUBenefits and SUB appeal forms to the Employee to complete and file in accordance with the regular plant procedures. The Shop Committeeperson shall not process SUB appeals.
(b)	The Union member of the Local Committee in a plant with multi-shift operations or at a location with multi-plant operations may request the Shop Committeeperson for the zone where a SUB problem arises to investigate such problem when it is impracticable for the member of the Local Committee to handle such problem, and report the findings of the
112
Shop Committeeperson’s investigation to the Union member of the Local Committee. Such request may be made through the supervisor of the Union member of the Local Committee. The Union member of the Local Committee shall notify the Company member of the Local Committee that such request was made.
(c)	Consistent with the purpose of Sections A4, A5(a), and A5(b) of this “Items Agreed To”, a rule of reason should be applied in determining whether an Employee should be excused from the Employee’s job in order to confer with the Union member of the Local Committee (or Shop Committeeperson for the zone) concerning a SUB problem. A rule of reason should likewise be applied when, due to production difficulties, excessive absenteeism, or other emergencies, it will not be possible to immediately relieve the Employee from the Employee’s job. On many jobs, discussion between the Employee and the Union member (or Shop Committeeperson for the zone) is entirely practical without the necessity of the Employee being relieved. On the other hand, an Employee working on a moving conveyor, in an excessively noisy area, or climbing in and out of bodies, should be permitted a reasonable period of time off the job and a suitable place in which to discuss such problem with the Union member (or Shop Committeeperson for the zone). A suitable place in which to discuss such problem also should be permitted a laid-off Employee, a retiree, or other person reporting to the plant. This shall not interfere with any local practice which is mutually satisfactory.
6.	Where the Local Committee has agreed to use the Mass Appeal Procedure (Item E hereunder), the Union member of the Local Committee will be permitted time to prepare necessary Employee notices concerning the mass appeal procedures, and to arrange with the president of the Local Union or the Chairperson of the Shop Committee for the posting of such notices.
113
items Agr. To A. 7
7.	Where a SUB disqualifying layoff has occurred because of circumstances arising at another Company plant, the Union member of the Local Committee may request the Regional Director of the International Union (or a specified representative), for such other Company plant, for assistance. The Regional Director (or the specified representative) shall be granted permission to visit such other plant in accordance with die provisions of Paragraph (38) of the National Agreement for the purpose of investigating specific SUB appeals arising out of such circumstances. The Regional Director (or specified representative) shall report the findings of the investigation to the Union member of the Local Committee making such request.
8.	The power and authority of the Board to make determinations required pursuant to Article VI, Section 4 of the GM-UAW SUB Plan shall be, and hereby is, delegated until further notice to the Local Committees established under the Plan; provided, however, that if any Local Committee shall fail to make a determination when called upon to do so in a proper case, the case shall be referred to the Board by either the Union or management member of such Local Committee for appropriate Board action.

(d)	All appeal files submitted to the Board shall include a joint statement by the Management and Union members of the Local Committee setting forth the pertinent facts and circumstances involved, as agreed to by the parties.

Items Agr.To E
F.	APPEAL FORMS
The SUB forms attached hereto have been adopted by the Board. They are identified as GM SUB-6, 7, 7A, 7B, 8, 8A, 8B, and 9.
G.	TIME LIMIT FOR FILING
EMPLOYEE S BENEFIT APPLICATION
In any situation where an Employee has been denied a Benefit solely because the Employee failed to meet the 60-day application time limit required under the Plan, the Local Committee may extend such time limit if it determines that the Mass Appeal Procedures (Item E hereunder) apply, or that unusual and extenuating circumstances prohibited the Employee from filing the application within the allotted time.
H.	APPLICATION AND APPEAL FORMS
Management will furnish a small supply of SUB application and appeal forms to the Union member of each Local SUB Committee upon request of such members. Such forms will be used by the Union member of the Local SUB Committee only to comply with requests from individual Employees.
I.	DETERMINATION OF DATE SUBENEFIT OVERPAYMENT ESTABLISHED OR CREATED
For purposes of compliance with the 60 day time limit (pursuant to Article II, Section 4 of the Plan) for notifying Employees of any SUBenefit overpayment which results from a Company error in calculating a SUBenefit, such 60 day period shall be determined as beginning on the date of issue of the SUBenefit draft or check involved.
J.	PAIRING CONCEPT
1.	Pairing will not be applicable to a Work Week for which an Automatic Short Week Benefit is payable. Earnings and hours applicable to work for the Company,
121
items Agr. to 4.1
as used in determining eligibility for and the amount of an Automatic Short Week Benefit, shall be only such earnings and hours that are applicable to days in the Work Week.
2.	Determination of Regular Benefit eligibility shall be made with respect to the Work Week. The calculation of any Regular Benefit shall include only the hours and earnings applicable to the State Week except as otherwise provided in Article II, Section 3(a)(2). However, if an Employee works the Sunday immediately prior to the beginning of a period of layoff and solely because of such Sunday earnings is disqualified for a State System Benefit for the week or whose State System Benefit for the week is reduced, such Sunday earnings shall not be considered as Other Compensation for the purpose of calculating a Regular Benefit.
3.	The Benefit as determined under Item (2) above for any state week shall apply to the Work Week or Pay Period which has at least 4 calendar days in common with such state week.
4.	The Work Week which is selected by pairing Work Weeks and state weeks as in Item (3) above is used in applying the Employee’s registration and application requirements, the applicable disqualifications under Article I, cost-of-living allowance and Years of Seniority.
K.	BENEFIT OVERPAYMENTS
For the purpose solely of administering the provisions of Article n, 4(b)(1) and (2) of the SUB Plan, (1) the term “paycheck” will exclude payments made by the Company to a former Employee after the date such former Employee’s seniority is broken, and (2) each 40-hour increment or fraction thereof paid to an Employee under the provisions of Paragraphs (191), (192), and/or (193) of the Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be deemed to be a “paycheck”.
122
Items Agr. To L1
L.	REPLACEMENT OF TRUST FUND SUB CHECKS
1.	In those situations where either a Regular Benefit or a Separation Payment check, issued to an otherwise eligible Employee, has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a replacement SUB check promptly will be issued to the Employee claiming such loss, if, upon the submission by the Employee of a properly completed request for replacement of SUB check form, as provided by the Company:
(1)	the Trustee determines that the check identified on the request for replacement of SUB check form has not yet been presented to the Trustee for payment and the Trustee stops payment of the check; or
(2)	the Trustee determines that the check identified on the request for replacement of SUB check form has been paid by the Trustee, and the Employee has signed and submitted to the Company, a notarized forgery affidavit, as provided by the Company, certifying that the signature on the cashed check is not the Employee’s own.
2.	If a replacement check has been issued to an Employee based on the Employee’s completed forgery affidavit, and, subsequent to the issuance of such replacement check the Trustee determines that the original check was either (1) cashed by the Employee or (2) cashed by an individual against whom the Employee refuses to file criminal charges or a civil claim after having been requested to do so by the Trustee or the Company; then the amount issued to the Employee in such replacement check immediately will be determined a SUB Plan overpayment. The date the Trustee informs the Company of its determination that the original check was cashed by the Employee or an individual against whom the Employee refuses to file criminal charges or a civil claim will be “the date the overpayment was
123
Items Agr.To L2
established or created”, as provided under Article II, Section 4(a) of the SUB Plan. Any SUB Plan overpayment recovery shall be in accordance with Article H, Section 4 of the SUB Plan.
3.	If a SUB Plan overpayment has resulted from the issuance of a replacement SUB check, and utilization of the overpayment recovery proceedings provided under Article II, Section 4 of the SUB Plan has not resulted in the return of the overpayment to the Trustee, then the amount of the overpayment may be assigned to a Board of Administration approved collection agency to recover such Plan overpayment. In accordance with Article VH, Section 6(d), of the SUB Plan, the Trustee shall be authorized to pay reasonable fees to the collection agency for services rendered, and the Fund shall be authorized to receive payments from the collection agency.

(b)	The Guaranteed Income Stream (GIS) Benefit Program which was attached as Exhibit E-l to the Supplemental Agreement (Guaranteed Income Stream Benefit Program) between the parties dated September 28. 1999. shall be amended effective as of October 13. 2003. except as otherwise specified in this Agreement and the GIS Program* and maintained by the Corporation as amended for the duration of the Collective Bargaining Agreement of which this Agreement is a part, subject to the terms and conditions of the Guaranteed Income Stream Benefit Program attached to this Agreement as Exhibit E-1.
* The definitions of Section 19 of Exhibit E~1 are applicable to this Agreement as if fully set forth herein.
(1)

E, Sect. 2
Section 2.	Termination of the GIS Program Prior to Expiration Date
In the event that the GIS Program shall not become effective by reason of Section 5 of this Agreement or if the rulings described in Section 5 shall be revoked or modified in such manner as no longer to be satisfactory to the Corporation, notice of such event shall be provided to the Union within five working days, and all obligations of the Corporation under this Agreement and the GIS Program shall cease and the GIS Program shall thereupon terminate and be of no further effect.
Thereafter the parties shall negotiate, for a period of sixty (60) days or a mutually satisfactory longer period from the date of notice to the Union of receipt of such unfavorable ruling, with respect to adopting a program adhering as closely as possible to the language and intent of the provisions outlined in Exhibit E-l for which a favorable ruling may be obtained.
Section 3.	Obligations During Term of this Agreement
During the term of this Agreement, neither the Corporation nor the Union shall request any change in, deletion from or addition to the Program or this Agreement; or be required to bargain with respect to any provision or interpretation of the Program or this Agreement; and during such period no change in, deletion from or addition to any provision, or interpretation, of the Program or this Agreement, nor any dispute or difference arising in any negotiations pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement, shall be an object of, or a reason or cause for, any action or failure to act, including, without limitation, any strike, slowdown, work stoppage, lockout, picketing or other exercise of economic force, or threat thereof, by the Union or the Corporation.

Section 5.	Establishment of GIS Program
(a)	The amendments to the Program provided for in Section 1 of this Agreement and incorporated in the Program, Exhibit E-l, effective for Weeks beginning on or after the Effective Date of this Agreement, shall be subject to subsequent receipt, if available, by the Corporation of rulings, satisfactory to the Corporation, if such rulings are deemed necessary by the Corporation, from the United States Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor (DOL) holding that such amendments will not have any adverse effect upon the favorable rulings previously received by the Corporation that:
(1)	contributions to the Fund established pursuant to the Program constitute a currently deductible expense under the Internal Revenue Code, as now in effect, or under any other applicable federal tax law; and
(2)	the Fund under the Program qualifies for exemption from Federal income tax under Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and
(3)	contributions by the Corporation to, and benefits paid out of, the Fund are not treated as “wages” for purposes of the Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA), the Federal Insurance Contributions Act Tax (FICA), or Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages, under Subtitle C of the Internal Revenue Code(except when certain benefits paid from the Fund are legally required to be treated as “wages” for purposes of FUTA, FICA and Federal income tax withholding); and
E. Sect. 5(a)(4)
(4)	no part of any such contributions or of any payments made by the Corporation under the Program are included for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act in the regular rate of any Employee; and
(5)	this Agreement and the GIS Program do not constitute a pension plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which would be subject to ERISA’s requirements relating to participation, vesting and funding.
If considered necessary, the Corporation shall apply promptly to the appropriate agencies for such rulings.
(b)	Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the GIS Program, the Corporation, with the consent of the Director of the General Motors Department of the Union, may, during the term of this Agreement, make revisions in the Program not inconsistent with the purposes, structure, and basic provisions thereof which shall be necessary to obtain or maintain any of the above rulings. Any such revisions shall adhere as closely as possible to the language and intent of the provisions outlined in Exhibit E-l.
(c)	In the event that rulings acceptable to the Corporation arc not obtained, or having been obtained shall be revoked or modified so as to be no longer satisfactory to the Corporation, and it is determined by the Corporation that the GIS Program cannot become effective without such rulings, the Corporation, within five working days after disapproval, will give written notice thereof to the Union and this Agreement and the GIS Program shall thereupon have no force or effect, in which event Section 2 of this Agreement shall apply.
(d)	if any state, by legislation or by administrative ruling or court decision, in the opinion of t|ie Corporation does not permit Supplementation, then, but only with respect to Employees in such state:
(4)

E, Sect. 5(d)(1)
(1)	the GIS Program shall be amended to delete such provisions of the GIS Program which are the subject of such ruling, legislation or court decision;
(2)	GIS Benefits which would have been payable in accordance with such deleted provisions of the Program shall be provided under a separate program or programs incorporating as closely as possible the same terms as the deleted Program provisions; and
(3)	the Program shall be further amended to provide that Corporation payments under such separate program or programs shall be paid by the Corporation and applied against the Corporation’s Maximum Company Liability Account as provided in Section 15(d) of the GIS Program.

(9)
E, Sect. 6(a)(2)(viii)

(4)	Compensation and Expenses,

		(a) Was, for the entire Week, on a qualifying layoff as described in Section 3.
		(b) (1) If laid off during the terms of the 1982, 1984	1 or 1987 Collective Bargaining Agreements, had at least	! 15 Years of Seniority (10 Years of Seniority with respect solely to a Plant Closing situation), under the terms of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, on the last day the Employee Worked prior to the effective date of such layoff.

E-l, Sect.2(b)(2)
last day the Employee Worked prior to the effective date of such layoff.
With respect to a Plant Closing situation, if an otherwise eligible Employee has 10 or more Years of Seniority on such employee’s first day of layoff and such first day is within 5 years prior to any subsequent date of the Plant Closing announcement, such Employee will be deemed eligible for GIS Benefits commencing with the first full Week following the date of the Plant Closing announcement.
(c)	Has both
(1)	Exhausted all entitlement under the SUB Plan or any other “SUB” Plan of the Company and has had no SUB entitlement canceled after the qualifying layoff for GIS Benefits under the SUB Plan for willfully misrepresenting any material fact in connection with an application for benefits under the SUB Plan; provided, however, that if the Employee has entitlement under the SUB Plan or any other "SUB” Plan of the Company but the Regular Benefit would be delayed under the SUB Plan for any Week because of exhaustion of the Advance Credit Account and the Guaranteed Benefit Account under the SUB Plan, an eligible Employee may elect to begin receipt of GIS Benefits, in which event the Employee must elect that all the Employee’s remaining SUB entitlement shall thereupon be canceled under the SUB Plan and any other “SUB” Plan of the Company; and
(2)	A zero balance in the Employee’s Security Fund Account under the General Motors Income Security Plan except for an amount equal to no more than the amount of any balance of Employee contributions in the Account at the start of the Employee’s current continuous layoff from the Company; provided, however, that for Weeks of continuing layoff following the first Week of layoff for

(d)	Has not received on or after the Effective Date a Separation Payment under Article IV of the SUB Plan (or any other “SUB” Plan of the Company), unless the Employee returns to Work and thereafter Works 15 years and thereby becomes eligible for any future GIS Benefits that may be available; provided, however, that an otherwise eligible Employee hereunder who elects Separation Payment under the SUB Plan will also receive a Redemption Payment under Section 6 at the same time.
(e)	Is either
(1)	working with a subsequent employer;

(ii)	remains wholly and continuously disabled for a period of more than one Week (the period of eligibility shall not include the first Week of such disability), and
(iii)	is under a doctor’s care;
provided, however, that such eligibility while disabled shall cease when the Employee becomes eligible for a disability retirement benefit under the Retirement Plan or has been paid a cumulative total of 52 Weekly GIS Income Benefits while disabled, whichever occurs first. If the Employee’s State System Benefits are exhausted, any reporting requirements associated with State System Benefit eligibility will not apply under this paragraph.
(f)	Except when eligible while disabled under subsection 2(e) above, maintains an active registration for such Week with the applicable Public Employment Service for purposes of locating employment opportunities.
(g)	Reports on a Timely Basis as required to the Company or its designated representative:

releases and reasonable evidence that may be required by such agencies or the Company for purposes of verifying the Employee’s eligibility for and amount of GIS Benefits.
(1) such layoff was for the entire Week;
(2) such layoff was from the Bargaining Unit;
(b) An Employee’s layoff for any Week shall be deemed qualifying for purposes of the GIS Program only if:
(i) Has made an application for GIS Benefits in accordance with procedures established by the Company.

In addition, except when eligible while disabled under subsection 2(e) above, in order to be eligible for GIS Benefits an Employee must accept Suitable Employment provided for or arranged by the Company, Agent of the Company or Public Employment Service and must not have broken Years of Seniority for any reason other than that the Employee shall have been continuously unemployed by the Company and had broken Seniority under the time for time provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
Section 3.	Conditions with Respect to Layoff
(a) A layoff for purposes of the GIS Program includes any Seniority layoff except an inverse Seniority layoff resulting from a reduction in force, including a layoff resulting from the discontinuance of a Facility or an operation, and any layoff occurring or continuing because the Employee was unable to do the work offered by the Company although able to perform other work in the Facility to which the Employee would have been entitled if the Employee had had sufficient Seniority.

E-1,Sect. 3(b)(3)
E-1,Sect 3(b)(4)
(3)	such layoff was not for disciplinary reasons, and was not a consequence of:
(i)	any strike, slowdown, work stoppage, picketing (whether or not by Employees), or concerted action, at a Company Facility or Facilities, or any dispute of any kind involving Employees, whether at a Company Facility or Facilities or elsewhere,
(ii)	any fault attributable to the Employee,
(iii)	any war or hostile act of a foreign power (but not government regulation or controls connected therewith),
(iv)	sabotage or insurrection, or
(v)	any act of God;
(4)	at a time when the Employee was on an otherwise qualifying layoff for purposes of the GIS Program or after having been advised that the Employee would be placed on such a layoff in the future, the Employee did not refuse or fail to appear for an employment interview, (unless for Good Cause), or refuse any offer of employment (including employment with the Company outside the Bargaining Unit) which the Employee was then capable of performing at another Company Facility, or at the Company Facility where the Employee last worked, the acceptance of which could have avoided, delayed or reduced the period of the layoff that otherwise would have qualified the Employee for GIS Benefits except that until 2 years immediately following the Employee’s last day Worked, or if less, the last day of eligibility for a regular SUB Plan benefit, the Employee may refuse an offer which such Employee has a right to refuse under the Local Seniority Agreement(s) of the Bargaining Unit(s) in which the Employee has Seniority, and still remain eligible for a regular benefit under the SUB Plan. If the employment
8
or employment interview which was refused is at a different Company Facility which is more than 50 miles from the Employee’s address of record for purposes of the GIS Program and from the Company Facility where the Employee last worked or is currently working for the Company, the Employee shall not be ineligible hereunder; provided, however, that an otherwise eligible Employee who refuses a temporary part-time position with the Company will remain eligible for GIS Benefits; and
(5)	the Employee retains Years of Seniority under the Collective Bargaining Agreement, except that an Employee shall continue to be covered by this Program if the Employee has broken such Years of Seniority, but only if the reason therefor is that the Employee has been continuously unemployed by the Company and Seniority was broken under the time for time provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.
(c) In addition, an Employee who enters the Armed Services of the United States directly from the employ of the Company shall while in such service be deemed, for purposes of the Program, to be on leave of absence and shall not be entitled to any GIS Benefits or payments for such period of absence. However, if an Employee is on short term active duty of 30 days or less, for required military training, in a National Guard, Reserve or similar unit and is ineligible under the Collective Bargaining Agreement for pay from the Company for all or part of such period solely because the Employee would be on a qualifying layoff but for such active duty, the Employee will be deemed to be on a qualifying layoff, for the determination of eligibility for not more than two GIS Income Benefits in a calendar year; provided further, however, that this two GIS Income Benefit limitation shall not apply to short term active duty of 30 days or less for an otherwise eligible Employee because such Employee was called to
9
E-1, Sect. 3(c)
active service in the National Guard by state or federal authorities in case of public emergency.
Section 4.	Description of GIS Benefits
An Employee eligible for GIS Benefits, in accordance with Section 2 above, is entitled to a GIS Income Benefit and to GIS Health Care and Life Insurance Coverages as provided in this Section, and reduced as provided in this Section and in Section 5, until the Employee’s eligibility for such benefits is terminated or suspended as provided in Sections 7 and 8, respectively, or until the Maximum Company Liability Amount, as defined in Section 15(d), has been reached.
(a)	GIS Income Benefit
(1)	At the time of layoff, a guaranteed income level will be calculated for each Employee who thereafter may be eligible for a GIS Income Benefit. For eligible Employees with 10 to 15 Years of Seniority, the guaranteed income level will equal 50% of an Employee’s Weekly Before-Tax Base Earnings on the last day at Work prior to the layoff establishing eligibility hereunder, increased by one (1) additional percentage point for each whole year that the Employee’s Years of Seniority as of the last day at Work prior to such qualifying layoff exceeds 15 Years of Seniority (fractional years of such Seniority shall be disregarded), or if lesser, in the case of an Employee eligible while disabled under subsection 2(e)(4), the weekly Sickness and Accident Benefit payable under the Life and Disability Benefits Program which applied or would have applied to the Employee if disabled on the Employee’s last day at Work.
(2)	The maximum guaranteed income level hereunder is the lesser of (i) 75% of Weekly Before-Tax Base Eamings or (ii) 95% of Weekly After-Tax Base Earnings, as of the Employee's last day Worked prior to
10
E-1, Sect. 4(a)(2)
the qualifying layoff, less $30.00. or (iii) if the Employee is eligible under any Company plan or program then in effect to receive, at the Employee’s option, either (a) a monthly retirement benefit unreduced for age because of (1) a contingent event unrelated to age or (2) disability, or (b) a monthly retirement benefit containing a supplemental allowance based on attaining a specified number of years of service, the weekly equivalent of the monthly amount of the retirement benefit that would be payable.
In determining the maximum guaranteed income level, the weekly equivalent of benefits paid on a monthly basis is computed by dividing the monthly benefit amount by 4.33.
(3)	The gross amount of the GIS Income Benefit payable to an eligible Employee will equal the guaranteed income level reduced by offsets provided under Section 5 of the Program.
(4)	The GIS Income Benefit for a Week which equals at least $100 will be paid as soon as practical after receipt of a completed application for such Week. If the amount payable for any Week would be less than $100, payment will be distributed after the Week in which the Employee’s unpaid GIS Income Benefit equals at least $100. When the Employee’s eligibility for GIS Benefits is suspended or terminated, accumulated unpaid GIS Income Benefits, regardless of amount, will be paid subject to the provisions of Section 5.
(5)	For purposes of determining the maximum guaranteed income level under subsection 4(a)(2)(ii) of this Section, an Employee’s exemptions for withholding tax purposes will be equal to the Employee’s actual number of personal and dependency exemptions (excluding exemptions for blindness and for age 65 years or over) which would be allowable on the
11

E-1,Sect. 4(a)(5)
Employee’s Federal income tax return as of the Employee’s last day at Work prior to layoff.
(6)	The Corporation, upon authorization from I	an Employee, shall deduct monthly union dues from
1	GIS Income Benefits paid under the Program and pay
such sums directly to the Union on the Employee’s ; behalf.
(b) GIS Health Care and Life Insurance Coverages
An Employee who is eligible to receive GIS Benefits will receive GIS Health Care and Life Insurance [ Coverages, as determined in accordance with this paragraph, until termination of GIS Benefits or suspension of eligibility for GIS Health Care and Life ; Insurance Coverages. The GIS Health Care and Life Insurance Coverages consist of Hospital-Surgical-I Medical coverage and Life Insurance; provided, however, that Hospital-Surgical-Medical coverage will be supplementary to any other insurance or self-| insurance for which the Employee or the Employee’s I eligible dependent(s) may be eligible and for which the Employee or Employee’s dependent(s) pays no more than one-half the premium. Benefits will be reduced by the amount of benefits provided or available upon request under such other insurance or self-insured coverages available to the Employee from any other source, including coverage as a dependent.
Section 5.	GIS Income Benefit Offsets
1	(a) The GIS Income Benefit described in Section
4(a) is reduced by gross income or payments that an Employee receives or is eligible to receive from the following sources:
(1)	Statutory Benefits, except Social Security Old Age or Disability Benefit,
12
E-1, Sect. 5(a)(2)
(2)	Eighty percent of Income from Other Sources (except disability, termination and supplemental unemployment benefit pay will be offset at 100%).
In determining the amount by which GIS Income Benefits are reduced, the weekly equivalent of benefits paid on a monthly basis is computed by dividing the monthly benefit amount by 4.33.
(b)	In addition, an Employee’s outstanding debts to the Company or trustees of any Company benefit plan or program, and an Employee’s unrepaid overpayments under the SUB Plan shall be offset against GIS Income Benefits. The amount of GIS Income Benefits that are offset by SUB overpayments or outstanding debts to the Company or trustees of any Company plan or program, shall be paid by the Trustee to the Company or trustee of the SUB Plan Fund or other Company plan or program, as applicable.
(c)	For an Employee, whose GIS Income Benefit was suspended by reason of Section 8(a)(2), the Weekly earnings offset, for computing the reinstated GIS Income Benefit during any subsequent employment, will be the larger of the average Weekly Income from Other Sources received by the Employee for the last four Weeks of Employment from
(1)	the employer from whom the Employee terminated, which caused the suspension as described in Section 8(a)(2), or
(2)	any subsequent employer.
Section 6. Redemption Payment
An Employee otherwise eligible for GIS Benefits may elect at Company option to receive a Redemption Payment in lieu of future GIS Benefits, except that the Company shall pay the Redemption Payment to an Employee electing Separation Payment under the SUB
Xli.gr...*A
E-1, Sect. 6
Plan who shall be deemed irrevocably to have elected such Redemption Payment.
(a)	Eligibility
An Employee shall be eligible for a Redemption Payment if the Employee:
(1)	is otherwise eligible for GIS Benefits,
(2)	makes, within 60 months of the commencement of layoff from the Company, proper application, as determined by the Company, for such Redemption Payment, and
(3)	is at the time of application either working for a subsequent employer or meets the definition of able and available for work, utilized by the applicable Public Employment Service, for purposes of the receipt of a State System Benefit and meets the eligibility requirements, other than minimum number of qualifying weeks, for such Stale System Benefits even though the Employee may have exhausted such Benefits, or is participating in a jointly approved vocational training program. If the Employee has exhausted State System Benefits, any reporting requirements associated with Stale System Benefit eligibility will not apply under this paragraph.
(b)	Payment
(1)	A Redemption Payment shall be in a lump sum.
(2)	Subject to the Maximum Company Liability Amount defined in Section 15(d), the Redemption Payment will be payable in an amount equal to $5,000 reduced by GIS Benefits received or provided prior to the date of approval of the application for the Redemption Payment by the Company.
14

E-1, Sect. 6(b)(3)
(3)	The amount of an Employee’s Redemption Payment, as specified in (2) above, shall be reduced by any outstanding overpayment to the SUB Plan and any other debts to the Company or trustees of any Company benefit plan or program including overpayments under the GIS Program. The amount of the reduction of the Redemption Payment because of SUB Plan overpayments or outstanding debts to the Company or trustees of any Company plan or program, shall be paid by the Trustee to the Company trustee of the SUB Plan Fund, or other Company plan or program, as applicable.
(c)	Effect of Redemption Payment on GIS Benefits
An Employee who is issued and accepts or must accept a Redemption Payment will permanently cease to be eligible for GIS Benefits during the layoff that qualified the Employee for the Redemption Payment and for any GIS Benefits, that the Employee would otherwise be eligible for, which may occur because of future layoffs from the Company, unless the Employee returns to Work and thereafter Works 15 years and thereby becomes eligible for any future GIS Benefits that may be available.
(d)	Effect of Redemption Payment on Seniority
An Employee’s Seniority rights under the Collective Bargaining Agreement and any credited service under the Retirement Plan will not be affected by the application for or receipt of a Redemption Payment except that (i) the Employee shall forfeit all Years of Seniority if such Employee also receives a Separation Payment under the SUB Plan, and (ii) an Employee who accepts a Redemption Payment shall not be eligible to receive a special early retirement under any Company retirement plan, and shall not be permitted to retire under any Company retirement plan, during the Allocation Period as defined herein.

of more than 120% of the Employee’s existing average Weekly Income from Other Sources for the last four Weeks of the Employee’s present employment, but an Employee shall not be affected by any such refusal or failure hereunder where the application of the offset provisions of Section 5 results in a zero GIS Income Benefit at the Employee’s present employment;
(2)	Terminates Suitable Employment, which began at any time following the qualifying layoff, when such employment had been arranged for or identified by the Company, Agent of the Company or Public Employment Service, by reason of quit, discharge, retirement, or for any other reason over which the Employee had some degree of control;
(3)	Ceases to work or terminates employment for any reason before working thirteen consecutive Weeks as a regular Full-Time employee, for any employer, subsequent to suspension of GIS Benefits under subsections 8(a)(1) or 8(a)(2) immediately above, when such subsequent employment resulted in the reinstatement of suspended GIS Benefits under subsection (c) below. For purposes of this subsection 8(a)(3), self-employment will not be considered as meeting the 13 consecutive Week actual employment requirement.

(4)	Ceases to work by reason of strike or personal leave of absence of a Week or more.

(b) If the Employee shall fail, within 30 calendar days following receipt or attempted delivery of notice of such overpayment (such notice will be by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Employee’s last known address of record under the GIS Program), to return the overpayment to the Trustee, the Employee’s future GIS Benefits will be reduced by such GIS Benefit overpayment; provided, however, that the Company shall include in such overpayment notice a statement that eligibility for GIS Benefits will be so reduced.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
The purpose of this letter is to confirm the discussions between the parties during these negotiations as to the supplementary nature of the hospital-surgical-medical coverage (HSM Coverage) or hospital-surgical-medical-prescription drug-vision-hearing aid coverage (H-S-M-D-V-H Coverage) under Section 4(b) of the Guaranteed Income Stream Benefit Program (the GIS Program). The Company will provide the Traditional Option through United Healthcare utilizing an Administrative Services Only arrangement. If any insurer or self-insurer whose hospital-surgical-medical or H-S-M-D-V-H Coverage is intended to be supplemented denies benefits to an Employee because of the coverage available under the GIS Program, the Company will take such steps as it deems appropriate to compel the insurer or self-insurer to provide such coverage. Further, as stated in Section 5(d) of the 2003 Supplemental Agreement (Guaranteed Income Stream Benefit Program), the Program may be modified by the Company, with respect to eligible Employees in a state where other such coverage is being denied, in order to meet the intent of the parties to provide HSM or H-S-M-D-V-H Coverage on a supplementary basis.
45
Supp. HSM Coverage
In the interim, however, United Healthcare will reimburse the eligible Employee or the provider for payments otherwise covered by the HSM or H-S-M-D-V-H Coverages as if there were no other such coverage available to the Employee.

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the course of the 1982 negotiations, a question arose about the Company position regarding the possible use of any laid-off regular full-time Employees who may work as temporary part-time employees and who are eligible Employees under the Guaranteed Income Stream Benefit Program because they were Employees at work on or after March 1,1982 and had 15 or more Years of Seniority on the last day worked prior to layoff from full-time employment. This is to inform you of the following:
1.	Refusal of an offer of temporary part-time employment with the Company by an otherwise eligible Employee under the GIS Program will not cause the Employee to be terminated under Section 7 or have benefits suspended under Section 8 of the GIS Program.
2.	Any amount which a Company temporary part-time employee would have earned but for the Employees refusal of or absence from such part-time work (unless, of course, the Employee is employed elsewhere during such period) and 80% of any amount actually earned as a Company temporary part-time employee shall be offset under Section 5(a)(2).

Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties recognized the need to move ahead with the development of technological applications to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees.
1.	The parties recognized the need to provide the necessary tools to Local Union Benefit Representatives so that they may improve the service they are providing to hourly employees. Local Union Benefit Representatives require basic information that can be accessed quickly in order to confidently and accurately answer many of the questions they receive. Therefore, the parties have designed a process, the Benefits Data Access System, whereby Local Union Benefit Representatives have access to certain data elements from several benefit data systems. The Benefits Data Access System provides inquiry only access to Local Union Benefit Representatives who complete a computer training program. Access is limited to information for UAW hourly employees at their particular location.
2.	The parties jointly will develop and implement a new benefit documentation feature to the existing Benefits Data Access System that will be available to Local Union Benefit Representatives. The system will include benefit plan booklets, administrative manuals (where applicable), relevant contract provisions and appropriate process descriptions. Upon approval by the Executive Board of Joint Activities, the cost of development, hardware
55
improving Benefits Service Through Technology
and software requirements, conversion of written documentation, and installation and training, will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund. It is contemplated the benefit documentation feature will be implemented during the term of the 2003 Agreement.
3.	The parties further agreed to provide hourly employees with web teehnglogy-in addition to the continued use of a Voice Response System for inquiry and transactions in the Personal Savings Plan.
4.	The parties agree to enhance the Benefit Data Access System to provide the Pension Plan survivor coverage election/rejection and the cost of such survivor option. The cost of development and implementation will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund.
In conclusion, during the term of the new Agreement, the parties pledge to carefully consider every opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency in benefits delivery.
Very truly yours,
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION

ITEMS AGREED TO BY GM-UAW GIS BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION
COVERING
2003 Guaranteed Income Stream Benefit Program
(These “Items Agreed To” are subject to change at any time by mutual agreement of the members of the GM-UAW GIS Board of Administration)
63
Items Agr. To A.
Items Agreed to by GM-UAW GIS Board of Administration
A.	General
The Corporation shall provide a Board of Administration Secretary.
B.	Local Committees
1.	The Local Committee established at a Facility of the Company will handle appeals from determinations as provided in Section 6(b) of Exhibit E, Supplemental Agreement (GIS Benefit Program).
2.	Meetings of the Local Committee established pursuant to the Program shall be arranged by mutual agreement between the Company and Union Local Committee members.
3.	Written minutes of all meetings of the Local Committee, including pertinent discussion, statements of position, and information exchanged, will be prepared and approved promptly by the parties.
4.	The Union member of the Local Committee shall, after reporting to such member’s supervisor, be granted permission to leave work during regular working hours without loss of pay:
(a)	to attend meetings of the Local Committee including sufficient time during such meeting to write the Union’s position with respect to any appeals which are to be filed with the Board of Administration,
(b)	to meet with an active Employee (or with a laid-off Employee, retiree, survivor, beneficiary, or other person reporting to the Plant) who requests the Union representative’s presence in order to give the Union member of the Local Committee necessary information with respect to a problem concerning the payment,

Items Agr. To B.4(b)
Items Agr. To C,
denial, or appeal of a GIS Benefit or Redemption Payment,
(c)	to discuss with an Employee any change in the status of the Employee’s appeal.
S.	Consistent with the purpose of Section B.4. of these “Items Agreed To”, a rule of reason should be applied in determining whether an Employee should be excused from the job in order to confer with the Union member of the Local Committee concerning a GIS problem. A rule of reason should likewise be applied when, due to production difficulties, excessive absenteeism, or other emergencies, it will not be possible to immediately relieve the Employee from the job. On many jobs, discussion between the Employee and the Union member of the local committee is entirely practical without the necessity of the Employee being relieved. On the other hand, an Employee working on a moving conveyor, in an excessively noisy area, or climbing in and out of bodies, should be permitted a reasonable period of time off the job and a suitable place in which to discuss such problem with the Union member of the local committee. A suitable place in which to discuss such problem also should be permitted a laid-off Employee, a retiree, or other person reporting to the Plant. This shall not interfere with any local practice which is mutually satisfactory.
6.	Where the Local Committee has agreed to use the Mass Appeal Procedure (Item E hereunder), the Union member of the Local Committee will be permitted time to prepare necessary Employee notices concerning the mass appeal procedures, and to arrange with the president of the Local Union or the Chairperson of the Shop Committee for the posting or mailing of such notices.
66

If the Local Committee has failed to comply with such procedures, or if the appeal file is incomplete, the appeal file shall be returned to the Local Committee with directions to make the file complete in accordance with such procedures. The docketed appeal shall be stricken from the Board’s docket. When the appeal file is again presented to the Board, the appeal covered by such file shall be redocketed.
68
Items Agr. To C.2(h)
(h)	The Employee, the Local Committee, or the Union members of the Board may withdraw any appeal to the Board at any time before it is determined by the Board, on Form GM GIS-8B provided for that purpose.

The test case shall be processed in accordance with, and subject to, the regular appeal procedures. The Employee selected for test case purposes shall file a Form GM GIS-6 in accordance with the procedures governing a first stage appeal. The name of each Employee to be identified with the test case, together with the Week(s) or period(s) involved, shall be made a matter of record and attached to the test case appeal file in a manner mutually satisfactory to the members of the Local GIS Committee. The required appeal forms will be completed with respect to the Employee test case only, but the Local GIS Committee and/or Board determination with respect to the test case, shall be equally binding with respect to all the Employee cases identified as a matter of record with the test case.

Employees who were working at the time GIS Benefits were suspended by reason of Section 8(a)(1) of the Program will have GIS eligibility reestablished when (1) they terminate the job with the original employer and obtain full time employment with a different employer, or (2) their regular earnings with the original employer at least equals the level that would have allowed them to refuse such interview or job offer under the 120% rule stated in Section 8(a)(1) of the Program.
For purposes of determining GIS Income Benefits for Employees who have GIS eligibility reinstated, following a suspension under Section 8(a)(1), the GIS Income Benefit offset for Income from Other Sources, as provided in Section 5(a), will be based on the larger of (1) the earnings the Employee could have expected to receive had the Employee not refused the job offer or interview, or failed to appear for an interview for the job that resulted in the suspension of GIS Benefits, or (2) earnings from any subsequent employer.
3.	An otherwise eligible Employee will not be entitled to GIS Benefits when such Employee has exhausted all SUB Benefit eligibility, but continues to receive or be eligible to receive Extended Disability Benefits (EDB) under Article II, Section 7 of the Life and Disability Benefits Program (Exhibit B to the Collective Bargaining Agreement). However, when such Employee recovers and EDB benefits cease
79
Items Agr. To M.3.
without the Employee returning to active employment with the Company, GIS entitlement will be reinstated. EDB benefits and any coverages under the Life and Disability Benefits Program (Exhibit B to the Collective Bargaining Agreement) or the Health Care Program (Exhibit C to the Collective Bargaining Agreement) paid or available to an Employee who would otherwise have been eligible for GIS Benefits, will not be charged against the Maximum Company Liability Amount (Section 15(d)).
N.	Replacement of GIS Drafts
1.	In those situations where either a GIS Income Benefit, Relocation Allowance, Redemption Payment or Interview Expense Reimbursement draft, issued to an otherwise eligible employee, has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a replacement GIS draft promptly will be issued to the Employee claiming such loss, if, upon the submission by the Employee of a properly completed request for replacement of GIS draft form, as provided by the Company:
(1)	the Trustee determines that the draft identified on the request for replacement of GIS draft form has not yet been presented to the Trustee for payment and the Trustee stops payment of the draft; or
(2)	the Trustee determines that the draft identified on the request for replacement of GIS draft form has been paid by the Trustee, and the Employee has signed and submitted to the Company, a notarized forgery affidavit, as provided by the Company, certifying that the signature on the cashed draft is not the Employee’s.
2.	If a replacement draft has been issued to an Employee based on the Employee’s completed forgery affidavit, and, subsequent to the issuance of such replacement draft the Trustee determines that the
80
Items Agr. To N.2.
original draft was either (1) cashed by the Employee or (2) cashed by an individual against whom the Employee refuses to file criminal charges or a civil claim after having been requested to do so by the Trustee or the Company; then the amount issued to the Employee in such replacement draft immediately will be determined a GIS Program overpayment. The date the Trustee informs the Company of its determination that the original draft was cashed by the Employee or an individual against whom the Employee refuses to file criminal charges or a civil claim will be “the date the overpayment was established”, as provided under Section 9(a) of the GIS Program. Any GIS Program overpayment recovery shall be in accordance with Section 9 of the GIS Program.
3.	If a GIS Program overpayment has resulted from the issuance of a replacement GIS draft, and utilization of the overpayment recovery proceedings provided under Section 9 of the GIS Program has not resulted in the return of the overpayment to the Trustee, then the amount of the overpayment may be assigned to a Board of Administration approved collection agency to recover such Program overpayment. The Trustee shall be authorized to pay reasonable fees to the collection agency for services rendered, and the Fund shall be authorized to receive payments from the collection agency.

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT (PROFIT SHARING PLAN)
On this 18th day of September 2003. General Motors Corporation, hereinafter referred to as the Corporation, and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, hereinafter referred to as the Union, on behalf of the employees covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement of which this Supplemental Agreement becomes a part, agree as follows:
SECTION 1. Establishment of Plan
Subject to the approval of its Board of Directors, the Corporation will establish an amended Profit Sharing Plan for Hourly-Rate Employees in the United States, hereinafter referred to as the “Plan", a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit F-l and made a part of this Agreement to the extent applicable to the employees represented by the Union and covered by this Agreement as if fully set out herein, modified and supplemented, however, by the provisions hereinafter. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement will supersede the provisions of the Plan to the extent necessary to eliminate such conflict.
In the event that the Plan is not approved by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the Corporation, within 30 days after any such disapproval, will give written notice thereof to the Union and this Agreement shall thereupon have no force or effect. In that event, the matters covered by this Agreement shall be the subject of further negotiation between the Corporation and the Union.

SECTION 2. Administration
(a)	Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan, (1) any person who receives a back pay award applicable to" an earlier Plan Year as the result of a grievance settlement shall receive after such grievance settlement a payment for the Plan Year to which such back pay award-applies in an amount equal to the Participant’s Profit Sharing Amount that would have been payable for such earlier Plan Year, based on the Compensated Hours received by such person for such Plan Year, less any Profit Sharing Amount paid previously to such person for such Plan Year. (2) the amount of such payments shall be deducted from the Total Profit Share otherwise allocated to the Plan for the first Plan Year ending after the date of such grievance settlement in which a Total Profit Share is achieved, and (3) any Compensated Hours resulting from a back pay award shall be included as Compensated Hours only for the Plan Year for which the back pay is awarded.
(b)	The Union shall be informed of the results of a review of a request by a Participant or beneficiary of a Participant pursuant to Article VI, Section 6.06 of the Plan, provided the Participant is represented by the Union.
(c)	Notwithstanding Article II, Section 2.03 of the Plan, and solely for the purpose of determining the amount of any distribution under this Plan, Compensated Hours shall be credited to an employee who is on a leave of absence under Paragraph 109 of the National Agreement if the leave was granted for the purpose of permitting the employee to engage in the business of, or to work for, the Local Union and provided further that each such employee is involved in the in-plant administration of the provisions of such National Agreement. An employee eligible for Compensated Hours pursuant to this provision shall be credited with up to 40 hours for each calendar week while on such leave, subject to

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During the discussions between the parties held in conjunction with completing the Profit Sharing Plan language, the Union requested that all employees on leave under Paragraph 109 of the National Agreement to engage in the business of or to work for the Local Union should be included as eligible participants under such Plan. The Corporation pointed out, however, that certain employees, such as Trustees, Sergeants at Arms and Guides, and any other employees not involved in the in-plant administration of the National Agreement, would not be included in the Plan and would not receive any compensated hours under the Plan while on such leave. Moreover, it is understood that the Local Union will advise Local Management each year, in December, of the name, Social Security number, and job title of each such employee therefore not eligible for benefits under the Profit Sharing Plan.
Very truly yours,
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
This will confirm the understanding reached during our recent discussions with the Union regarding the information to be provided to the Union supporting computations made to compute the "Total Profit Share" and "Allocation of the Total Profit Share" to this Plan in the Profit Sharing Plan for Hourly-Rate Employees in » the United States {the Profit Sharing Plan).
In these discussions, we advised the Union that for each Plan Year the Corporation would provide the following information:
•	A summary report of Sales and Revenues, and Profits, adjusted in accordance with the Profit Sharing Plan, similar to the attached format;
•	A report displaying the computation of the Total Profit Share and Allocation of the Total Profit Share to this Plan;
•	Annual statement of consolidated income, including the footnotes, which will appear in the financial statements in the Annual Report to stockholders for the Plan Year; and
•	A statement of the impact of changes described in the footnotes on U.S. Operations as defined in the Profit Sharing Plan.
The data reported will be certified by the independent public accountants in accordance with the Profit Sharing Plan.
The Corporation will provide the Union with the information described above as soon as practicable after it becomes available.
This understanding has been reached on the basis that the Union will ensure that, until and to the extent the information is made available by the Corporation to the public at large, the information will be disclosed only to those reviewing for the Union the computations related to the Profit Sharing Plan, and neither the Union nor anyone reviewing such information for the Union will make any other disclosure of the information.

Attn: Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the Corporation and the Union confirmed their understanding and intent regarding certain provisions of the Profit Sharing Plan.
The Profit Sharing Plan, as initially negotiated and as presently constituted, provides for earnings of domestic । unconsolidated subsidiaries included in Plan income to । be reflected on an after-tax basis. As defined in the
Plan, these subsidiaries primarily are finance and
I insurance subsidiaries, such as General Motors 1 Acceptance Corporation. This treatment for Profit
Sharing is consistent with the way General Motors presently accounts for these subsidiaries in its published financial results.
A change in the accounting for majority-owned subsidiaries presently is being considered by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The FASB has indicated it intends to issue rules, effective in 1988, which would no longer permit companies to exclude majority-owned "non-homogenous" subsidiaries, such as General Motors Acceptance Corporation and its subsidiaries, from a line-by-line consolidation with the parent Corporation, In the event the proposed FASB rule regarding consolidation of majority-owned subsidiaries becomes final, appropriate adjustments will be made to "Profits" and "Sales and
24

" '■} - </ •*' |ew<^$^K^MH|M||nM|
FASB
Revenues" for the purpose of the Profit Sharing Plan. These adjustments will be made to achieve the same results as would be achieved under the present practice of reporting the after-tax results of unconsolidated subsidiaries (majority-owned "non-homogenous" operations) on a single line basis in the consolidated results of the parent Corporation and of excluding the revenues of these subsidiaries. These adjustments, as with all other adjustments presently required to be certified, would be certified by the independent public accountants.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties renewed their commitment to provide ongoing training programs for Company and Union Benefit Representatives so as to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees. The parties also recognized the importance of communications programs aimed at educating employees about their benefits.
It was agreed that such training and education programs will be developed jointly, and the cost of developing and implementing such programs properly will be paid from the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund as approved by the Executive Board for Joint Activities. These include, but are not limited to, the following:
•	Joint GM-UAW Benefits Training Conference may be scheduled upon approval by the parties.
•	Continuing education program for Union Benefit Representatives will be provided by the parties. Training sessions will be scheduled for newly appointed Union Benefit Representatives and Alternates as agreed to by the parties. The sessions will concentrate on areas such as eligibility to receive benefits, description and interpretation of benefit plan provisions, and calculation of benefits.
•	Conduct periodic on-site plant surveys and audits to evaluate training and education needs to improve employee service,
•	Ad hoc training meetings on legal developments or other special needs.
Included also are any travel, lodging, and living expenses incurred by Company and Union representatives in relation to the above. In addition, the Fund will pay for lost time (eight hours per day base rate plus COLA) of Union Benefit Representatives attending such programs away from their locations. The Company will pay for the time (eight hours per day base rate plus COLA) of alternate Union Benefit Representatives who replace those attending such programs.

Attn: Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties recognized the need to move ahead with the development of technological applications to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees.
1.	The parties recognized the need to provide the necessary tools to Local Union Benefit Representatives so that they may improve the service they are providing to hourly employees. Local Union Benefit Representatives require basic information that can be accessed quickly in order to confidently and accurately answer many of the questions they receive. Therefore, the parties have designed a process, the Benefits Data Access System, whereby Local Union Benefit Representatives have access to certain data elements from several benefit data systems. The Benefits Data Access System provides inquiry only access to Local Union Benefit Representatives who complete a computer training program. Access is limited to information for UAW hourly employees at their particular location.
2.	The parties jointly will develop and implement a new benefit documentation feature to the existing Benefits Data Access System that will be available to Local Union Benefit Representatives. The system will include benefit plan booklets, administrative manuals (where applicable), relevant contract provisions, and appropriate process descriptions.

Mise, (improving Benefits Service Through Technology)
Upon approval by the Executive Board of Joint Activities, the cost of development, hardware and software requirements, conversion of written documentation, and installation and training, will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund. It is contemplated the benefit documentation feature will be implemented during the term of the 2003 Agreement.
3.	The parties further agreed to provide hourly employees with web technology in addition to the continued use of a Voice Response System for inquiry and transactions in the Personal Savings Plan.
4.	The parties agree to enhance the Benefit Data Access System to provide the Pension Plan survivor coverage election/rejection and the cost of such survivor option. The cost of development and implementation will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund.
In conclusion, during the term of the new Agreement, the parties pledge to carefully consider every opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency in benefits delivery.

Dear Mr. Shoemaker
During these negotiations, the parties recognized the need to move ahead with the development of technological applications to improve the quality of service provided to hourly employees.
1.	The parties recognized the need to provide the necessary tools to Local Union Benefit Representatives so that they may improve the service they are providing to hourly employees. Local Union Benefit Representatives require basic information that can be accessed quickly in order to confidently and accurately answer many of the questions they receive. Therefore, the parties have designed a process, the Benefits Data Access System, whereby Local Union Benefit Representatives have access to certain data elements from several benefit data systems. The Benefits Data Access System provides inquiry only access to Local Union Benefit Representatives who complete a computer training program. Access is limited to information for UAW hourly employees at their particular location.
2.	The parties jointly will develop and implement a new benefit documentation feature to the existing Benefits Data Access System that will be available to Local Union Benefit Representatives. The system will include benefit plan booklets, administrative manuals (where applicable),
58

It is contemplated the benefit documentation feature will be implemented during the term of the 2003 Agreement.
3.	The parties further agreed to provide hourly employees with web technology in addition to the continued use of a Voice Response System for inquiry and transactions in the Personal Savings Plan.
4.	The parties agree to enhance the Benefit Data Access System to provide the Pension Plan survivor coverage election/rejection and the cost of such survivor option. The cost of development and implementation will be charged to the National Joint Skill Development and Training Fund.

The implementation date of the PSP deferral feature on Suggestion Award Payments will commence on or before January L 2005, This is due to the programming requirements for the Payroll System as well as the establishment of necessary financial and administrative processes, including a separate deferral election for an Employee's Suggestion Award,

Sect, 5, 5.05
5.05 Coordination of Benefits. The Plan shall not be liable to provide Benefits in any matter to the extent that the Participant has a right to substantially identical benefits under the terms of an insurance contract, or any other legally-enforceable arrangement. Where multiple coverage results under this Plan by reason of the relation of two (or more) Participants, the Plan shall only be liable for one set of Benefits. If any insurance contract or any other legally enforceable arrangement exists, the services under this Plan shall be secondary to such other coverage.
5.06 Non-alienation of Benefits. Assignment, pledge or encumbrance, of any kind, of benefits under this Plan shall not be permitted or recognized under any circumstances. Nor shall benefits be subject to attachment or other legal process for debts of Participants, or Covered Dependents. Upon notice of any such assignment or attachment of any kind, the Benefit shall automatically terminate and thereafter may be applied by the Committee, in its discretion, for the benefit of the Participant or Covered Dependent.
5.07 No Vested Rights. This Plan creates no vested rights of any kind. No Participant, nor any person claiming through him/her, shall have any right, title or interest in or to the Fund, other property of the Plan, or part thereof.
19
Sect. 6
Section 6. Financing
6.0	1 Fund. The Fund shall be held by a corporate trustee(s) or Bank(s), under a Funding Instrument(s). The Corporation shall select the Funding Agency(s), and there shall be an appropriate Funding Instrument. The Fund will consist of the monies transferred to it from the Corporation. The Funding Agency shall retain all assets of the Fund, including investment income, if any, for the exclusive benefit of Participants or to pay administrative expenses of the Plan. The assets of the Fund, including investment income, shall never revert to or inure to the benefit of either the Corporation, the Union, or any named Fiduciary.
6.0	2 Contributions. The Corporation will make available for funding the Plan, the balance of fund accruals over expenditures at the end of the 1992 GM-UAW National Agreement term, plus an amount equal to 7.2 cents per hour worked during the term of the 2003 GM-UAW National Agreement. However, should the Fund balance, including the carry-over balance, decline to three (3) million dollars according to Corporation accrual and expenditure records, the 7.20 accrual will increase to 14.00 until the Fund balance reaches ten (10) million dollars, at which time the accrual rate will revert to 7.20. This fluctuating accrual method will continue during the term of the 2003 GM-UAW National Agreement. The Corporation will transfer monies to the Fund on a monthly basis in an amount sufficient to handle the administration of the Plan. Should the Committee judge the assets of the Fund inadequate, the Director will immediately implement measures to conserve the remaining assets and the Corporation and the Union will meet expeditiously to resolve this issue in a manner that provides continuation of full services.
20
Sect. 7
Section 7.
Merger, Amendment or Termination of Plan
7.01 Modify, Amend, or Terminate the Plan. The Corporation and Union, by mutual agreement, may modify, amend, or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part.
7.02 Allocation of the Fund on Termination. Provided that the assets of the Fund are adequate, no termination shall deprive a Participant of legal representation in a matter pending in a court or administrative agency on the date of termination. Rather, the Committee shall, if possible, make appropriate arrangements for the representation of the Participant to the conclusion of the matter, or for one (1) year following the date of termination, whichever is lesser. The Plan shall have no liability for representation of the Participant beyond that period. If the assets of the Fund are not adequate to provide such post-termination representation, the Committee shall prorate the Benefits based on the available assets, after deducting necessary administrative expenses.
7.03 Residual Amounts on Termination. In the event of total termination of the Plan, after allocation of the Fund under 7.02 and payment of necessary administrative expenses, any residual assets in the Fund shall be applied by the Committee for the purpose of providing to Employees any benefits described in Section 501(c)(9), 501(c)(17), and/or 501(c)(20) of the Internal Revenue Code, or any successor provisions then in effect. In no event shall the assets of the Fund revert to or inure to the benefit of the Corporation, the Union, or the Named Fiduciary.
7.04 No Additional Liability. Upon termination of the Plan, the Benefits payable shall be only such as can be provided by the assets of the Fund when distributed pursuant to this Section.
21

Cost Containment Commitment
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18,2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During current negotiations, the parties again agreed that the UAW-GM Legal Services Plan provides valued benefits and has received overwhelming employee acceptance. They expressed satisfaction that the escalating costs of delivering Plan benefits have been restrained during the current Agreement term, but recognized that without such restraints the ability to maintain present high benefit levels and quality of services might have been jeopardized. In order to continue to avoid those consequences, the parties jointly renewed their pledge that through their participation on the Plan Administrative Committee, they will provide the Director and Chairman of the Plan with strong unified direction that cost containment efforts and policies are to be among their highest priorities in administering the Legal Services Plan and to support such measures when they are proposed and implemented.
Very truly yours,
Troy A. Clarke Group Vice President Manufacturing & Labor Relations

Canadian Legal Service
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18, 2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During our current negotiations, the Corporation and Union again discussed the fact that the UAW-GM Legal Services Plan provides benefits only in matters arising under law(s) in the United States, and that certain Participants, as defined by the Plan may have legal matters covered by the Plan, except that they arise under law(s) in Canada.
The parties discussed the concern that such Participants may have special tax and legal implications and that certain legal services in Canada may cost substantially more than the same services in the United States.
Accordingly, it was agreed that legal services will be provided under the existing Plan for matters arising under Canadian law(s), provided that the cost of providing a specified benefit in Canada is limited to the cost of providing that benefit in the United States and that the reimbursement of a Participant(s) or Cooperating Attomey(s) does not exceed the amount that would be paid a United States attorney for the same matter. Such "coverage" will be limited to the Canadian equivalent of United States legal matters covered by the Plan. The Director of the Legal Services Plan will be advised of these discussions and directed to establish a reimbursement model or case-by-case direct payment system which implements these
24
Canadian Legal Service
understandings, including, if necessary, a predetermination process.
Very truly yours,

Social Security Disability Benefits
GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION
September 18,2003
Mr. Richard Shoemaker
Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit, Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
During these negotiations, the parties discussed the formalization of the UAW-GM Legal Services Plan which will provide preparation assistance and representation before the Social Security Administration for employees who have applied for and been denied Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits. It was pointed out that since 1987, pursuant to the Statement of Intent attached to Exhibit B to the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, acting on behalf of Genera] Motors, has arranged to have such assistance provided by outside vendors on a limited case-by-case basis where the facts of the case indicate a reasonable chance of reversing the Social Security denial and the employee has:
(1)	properly applied for and been denied such benefits at the Initial and Reconsideration steps of the Social Security claim process;
(2)	agreed in writing to allow the Social Security Administration to release necessary information to General Motors and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company; and
(3)	agreed to repay the equivalent of such benefits advanced during the process.
During their discussions, the parties considered that similar assistance might be provided in such selected cases in a more cost effective manner by the Plan. Accordingly, it is agreed that the plan will provide such
26
Social Security Disability Benefits
assistance, utilizing a centralized case intake system and Plan Attorney(s) exclusively. It is also agreed that Metropolitan Life Insurance Company will:
(1)	select, in conjunction with the Director or his designee, the cases for which legal services would be provided;
(2)	notify the employees whose cases are selected; and
(3)	furnish the Plan copies of medical and other pertinent information to be utilized by the Plan in the development of each case.
The plan will also provide for maintaining records which permit the evaluation of the effectiveness of the project by the parties and Metropolitan. At a minimum, such records would include the number of cases referred to the Plan by Metropolitan, the number of cases where representation is declined and the reasons therefor, the hours of legal services expended, costs involved, and the results.
Further it is understood by the parties that any cases which the UAW-GM Legal Services Plan declines, is unable or fails to pursue in a timely fashion may be referred by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company to other firms not associated with the Plan.
Very truly yours,
Troy A. Clarke Group Vice President Manufacturing & Labor Relations

Mr. Richard Shoemaker Vice President and Director General Motors Department International Union, UAW 8000 East Jefferson Avenue Detroit. Michigan 48214
Dear Mr. Shoemaker:
Re: Legal Services Plan - Additional Funding
This confirms the understanding reached during these negotiations regarding additional funding under the UAW-GM Legal Services Plan. IL during the term of the 2003 Agreement, the Corporation and Union determine that the assets of the Fund are inadequate, the Corporation will transfer such additional monies to the Fund as are necessary to provide for continued operation of the Plan and the provision of full benefits for the term of the 2003 Agreement.
Very truly yours,
